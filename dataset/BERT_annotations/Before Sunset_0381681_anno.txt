scene_heading: EXT. PARIS -- AFTERNOON
text: Delerue's theme from "Antoine and Colette" plays over an
text: opening credit sequence consisting of a series of images of
text: Paris. Each shot is composition of the streets, landmarks
text: and the minute details of this beautiful August afternoon.
text: The last shot begins wide on the Shakespeare Bookstore and
text: closes in on a sign in the window announcing an event:
dialog: "Jesse Wallace, young author of the acclaimed best-seller
text: THIS TIME, Saturday, August 23." A brooding picture of Jesse
text: is prominent. Over the image, we hear a French Journalist
text: asking a question.
scene_heading: FRENCH JOURNALIST #1 (0.S.)
dialog: Do you consider the book to be
dialog: autobiographical?
scene_heading: INT. SHAKESPEARE BOOKSTORE -- AFTERNOON
text: Inside this funky bookstore, JESSE, early 30's, is sitting
text: casually with a few journalists and patrons.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: isn't everything autobiographical, I
dialog: mean we ail see the world from our
dialog: own tiny keyhole. I always think of
dialog: Thomas Wolfe - have you ever seen
dialog: that little one page 'note to reader’
text: in the front of Look Homeward, Angel.
dialog: Do you know what I'm talking about?
dialog: Vague affirmatives. .
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyway, He says how we are the sum
dialog: of all the moments of our lives,
dialog: that anybody who writes will use the
dialog: clay of their lives, that you can't
dialog: avoid that. I remember he says he
dialog: can't imagine anything more
dialog: autobiographical then Gulliver's
dialog: Travels.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. BEFORE SUNRISE MONTAGE
text: Over the next section of dialog, we see an approximately 90
text: second series of shots from BEFORE SUNRISE that silently
text: tell the story: boy meets girl on a train, boy and girl get
dialog: to know one another, boy and girl kiss, get more intimate,
text: part at dawn.
speaker_heading: JESSE (0.S.}
dialog: When I look at my life, I have to

speaker_heading: JESSE (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: of guns or violence, a helicopter
dialog: crash, political intrigue. But my
dialog: life, from my point of view, has
dialog: been full of drama. And one of the
dialog: most exciting things that's ever
dialog: happened to me is actually connecting
dialog: with another person and I thought if
dialog: I could write a book that could
dialog: capture that, make that connection
dialog: valuable, that possibility...anyway
dialog: that was the attempt. I don't know
dialog: if that answers your question...
dialog: He kh OF
scene_heading: FRENCH JOURNALIST #1
dialog: "ll be more specific. Was there
text: ever a young French woman on a train
dialog: you met and spent an evening with?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: See to me, that's not important.
scene_heading: FRENCH JOURNALIST #2
dialog: So, that's a yes?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Okay, since this is the last stop
dialog: of my book tour and I am in France,
dialog: Yes.
text: We're now near the end of the montage where Celine and Jesse
text: say their good-byes at the train station and are soon
text: traveling alone.
scene_heading: FRENCH JOURNALIST #1
text: The book ends on an ambiguous note -
dialog: we don't know. Do you think they
dialog: get back together in six months like
dialog: they promised each other?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I think how you answer that is a
dialog: good test as to whether you ‘are a
dialog: romantic or a cynic. *
text: He looks at the journalists and points at each of them as he
dialog: speaks.
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 3.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: You think they get back together,
dialog: you don't, you hope they do but aren't
dialog: sure.
scene_heading: FRENCH JOURNALIST #1
dialog: But do YOU think they do? Did you
dialog: in real life?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Well, in the words of my grandfather,
dialog: to answer that would take the piss
dialog: outta the whole thing.
text: Still offscreen, the Bookstore Manager chimes in.
speaker_heading: MANAGER (0.S.)
dialog: We have time for one last question.
scene_heading: INT. SHAKESPEARE BOOKSTORE -- AFTERNOON
dialog: We're now back inside.
scene_heading: FRENCH JOURNALIST #2
dialog: What is your next book?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I've always wanted to write a book
dialog: where the whole thing happens within
text: the space of one pop song.
scene_heading: FRENCH JOURNALIST #1
dialog: What song?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: T don't know, haven't written it yet -
dialog: "the Long and Winding Road" maybe...
dialog: The story's about this guy living in
text: Miami at his in-laws beach house,
text: and he's totally depressed. His
dialog: great dream was to be an adventurer,
text: a lover, riding motorcycles through
dialog: South America. But instead, he
text: sitting at this marble table eating
dialog: lobster, He's got a job, a beautiful .
dialog: wife, all that he needs, but none of
dialog: it matters - what he wants is to
dialog: fight for meaning.
text: Across the room, CELINE emerges from behind a row of books,
text: where she's been hiding and listening.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Happiness is in the doing, right?
dialog: not getting what you want.
dialog: *
dialog: 
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8403 4.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: And just that second his five year-
text: old daughter ‘jumps up on the table.
dialog: He knows she shouldn't be there ~
dialog: she could get hurt. But she is
dialog: dancing to this pop song in a summer
dialog: dress.
text: Celine is looking at him.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: All of sudden he's 16 and his high-
text: school sweetheart is dropping him
text: off at home. They just lost their
dialog: virginity and she loves him and the
text: same song is playing on the car radio,
text: and she climbs up dancing on the
text: roof of the car. And now he's worried
text: about her. She's beautiful with a
text: facial expression just like his
dialog: daughter. Maybe that's why he likes
text: her. He knows he is not REMEMBERING
text: this dance. He is there - he is
text: there in both moments simultaneously.
text: In fact he pulls away from a kiss
dialog: with the girlfriend so as to not
text: offend his daughter. Both moments
dialog: are real, happening together. For @
text: moment all his life is foiding in
text: and it's obvious to him that time is
dialog: a lie...
text: He looks up and sees Celine for the first time.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Its all happening all the time and
text: inside every moment, is another, all
text: happening simultaneously.
text: He takes a beat, still looking at Celine, not sure what to
dialog: do next.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyway, that's kinda the idea, anyway.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Our author needs to be going to the
dialog: airport soon. I'd like to thank all
dialog: ef you for coming over this afternoon,
dialog: and especially like to thank Mr.
dialog: Wallace for being with us. We hope
dialog: to see you again with your next book.
dialog: So everyone, please help yourselves
dialog: to champagne and cookies.
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 5.
text: There is polite applause and people start to disperse. Jesse
text: looks back over to Celine - she gives a little wave. He
text: gets the manager's attention.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (to Manager}
dialog: How long 'till I have to leave here
dialog: for the airport?
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: You should leave about 7:15 or so,
text: 7:30 at the latest.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Okay...
text: Jesse walks over to Celine.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Hello.
text: A slightly awkward double cheek kiss.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: How are you?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Good, and you?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Great. You wanna get some coffee or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Didn't he just say you have a plane
dialog: to catch?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I have a little time. Want to get
dialog: out of here?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yes?
text: Jesse goes back over to the manager.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll be back in thirty, forty-five
dialog: minutes or so. We're just going to
dialog: go get a cup of coffee.
dialog: Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Okay, but get your driver Phillipe's
dialog: card so you'll have his cell phone.
dialog: Call him if you're running late.
dialog: SA.
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 6.
speaker_heading: MANAGER (CONT'D)
dialog: We'll get your bags in the car so
dialog: you won't be late to the airport.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Okay. Thanks for everything.
text: As they start to exit the store, Jesse is detained briefly,
text: signing a book, getting the card from the driver, etc. Celine
text: exits in front of him.
scene_heading: EXT. WALK FROM BOOKSTORE --~ AFTERNOON
text: Outside the bookstore, Jesse puts his hands on Celine's
text: shoulders and just looks at her.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I can't believe you're here!
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I live here in Paris. Are you sure
dialog: you don't have to stay? Aren't you
dialog: supposed to talk to those people.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: It's okay, they're sick of me - I
dialog: spent the night here last night.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: You did?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: They have a loft upstairs. How are
dialog: you? This is so weird.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I'm fine. It's good to see you.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Tt's good to see you too.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: So you want to go to a cafe?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Sure.
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/87/03 7.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: There's one a little further, that I
dialog: like a lot.
speaker_heading: ®@ JESSE
dialog: Alright.
text: They start walking.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: I thought I was going to totally
dialog: lose it in there after I saw you.
dialog: How'd you even know I was going to
dialog: be here?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: It's my favorite bookstore in Paris.
dialog: You can sit down for hours, I love
dialog: it - even if there's fleas.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I think a cat slept on my head last
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I saw your picture on the calendar
dialog: about a month ago and that you were
dialog: going to be here. It's funny I read
dialog: an article on your book and it sounded
dialog: @ vaguely familiar, but I didn't put
dialog: it all together until I saw the photo.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Did you have a chance to read it?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yes. I was really surprised as you
dialog: can imagine.
dialog: {a beat)
dialog: I had to read it twice, actually.
text: Jesse just looks at her.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Comme ci comme ca?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: No, I really like it - it's romantic.
dialog: I usually don't like that but it's
dialog: well written. Congratulations.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Thanks.
text: e Celine suddenly stops and looks at Jesse.
dialog: 
dialog: Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: But. before we go anywhere I have to
dialog: ask you, did you show up in Vienna
dialog: that December?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Did you?
speaker_heading: TA.
dialog: Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I couldn't, but did you? I have to
dialog: know. It's important to me.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (playful)
dialog: Why, if you didn't?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Did you?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Oh thank God you didn't.
speaker_heading: JESSE.
dialog: Yeah, thank God you didn't either.
dialog: If one of us would have been there
dialog: alone, it would have sucked.
text: They continue walking.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I know, I was so concerned with that.
dialog: I've always felt horrible about not
dialog: being there but I couldn't, my grandma
dialog: died a few days before and she was
dialog: buried that day, December 16th.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: {almost relieved)
dialog: She died? The one in Budapest?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: How did you remember that?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I remember everything.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Oh, of course, it was in your book.
dialog: Anyway, I was just about to fly to
dialog: Vienna to meet you when we got the
dialog: news about her, then of course I
dialog: went to the funeral with my parents.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I'm so sorry to hear that.
dialog: 
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 9.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: But you weren't there anyway.
dialog: (suddenly suspicious)
dialog: Wait, why weren't you there? If
dialog: would have been there if I could
dialog: have - I had made plans. You better
dialog: have a good reason.
text: They slow to a stop and just look at each other. She realizes
dialog: he's. been lying.
speaker_heading: CELINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh no! You were there, weren't you?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: {down}
dialog: Yeah,
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Ahhhh! That's terrible! I'm so
dialog: sorry. I'm laughing but Tf don't
dialog: mean it. Did you hate me? You must
dialog: have hated me.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Have you hated me all this time?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yes you have, but you can't hate me
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No... I don't hate you. C'mon, no
dialog: big deal. I flew over there, you
dialog: blew the whole thing off, I gave up
dialog: on love, and my life's been a big
dialog: nose-dive since then, but hey, no
dialog: big deal.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I'm kidding.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I can't believe it. You must have
dialog: felt really angry with me. I'm so
dialog: sorry ~ I wanted to be there more
dialog: than anything in the world. But you
dialog: can't be angry anymore, I mean my
dialog: grand-ma~-~
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 10.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Honestly, I had a feeling something
dialog: like that might have happened. I
dialog: was bummed, but I was mostly just
dialog: mad that we hadn't exchanged phone
dialog: numbers or any information.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I know, that was so stupid - no way
dialog: to get in touch, I didn't even know
dialog: your last name.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I know! We had nothing to go on.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I was cursing... - If I could just
dialog: reach him. .
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I know, remember the reason we did
dialog: that...we were both afraid if we
dialog: started calling and writing it would
text: slowly fade away.
speaker_heading: CELINE
text: It definitely wasn't a slow fade.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Sure wasn't.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yes, we wanted to pick it up where
dialog: we left off, which would have been a
dialog: good idea if...
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (butting in)
dialog: If it'd just worked! Oh well.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: So how long were you in Vienna?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Couple of days. .
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Did you meet another girl?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, her name was Gretchen, she was
dialog: awesome. The book's actually a
dialog: composite of the two of you...
dialog: Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Really?!
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No... I even went back to the train
text: station and put up a sign that had
dialog: the number to my hotel, just in case
dialog: you had been delayed a half day or
dialog: something... total dork.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Did you get any calls?
speaker_heading: JESSE
text: Just a couple of hookers looking for
dialog: a gig.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Hey, it was awful, what do you want
dialog: me to say?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Oh, that's so sad. I'm so sorry.
text: They start walking again.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Then I just walked around for a while
dialog: then eventually flew back home. I
dialog: owed my dad two grand, who had warned
dialog: me about French chicks.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: What did he tell you about French
dialog: women?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Nothing, lots of crap. He's never
dialog: been with any French women. I don't
dialog: think he's ever been east of the
dialog: Mississippi.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Why didn't you put the six months
dialog: later part in the book?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: But I did!
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I wrote a fictional version where
dialog: you do show up.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: You did? What happens?
dialog: Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Oh, we make love for like ten days
dialog: straight...
dialog: 1l~A.
dialog: Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: That's interesting.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: And then they find out more about
text: each other and realize they don't
dialog: really get along.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I like that.., It's more real.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: My editor didn't feel that way.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yes, everybody wants to believe in
dialog: ilove. ft sells.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: But things are going well for you,
dialog: right?
dialog: {pause}
dialog: Your book's a bestseller in the U.S.?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: It's a tiny bestseller, but
dialog: officially, yes. But hey, most people
dialog: haven't read Moby Dick, so why the
dialog: hell should they read my book?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I never read Moby Dick, but I liked
dialog: your book, even though I thought
dialog: you idealized our night a bit.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Hey, it's fiction.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: i know, but I thought there wete
dialog: times when you made me, I mean her,
dialog: no, me, like sometimes she's was a
dialog: bit... psychotic.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: But you are a little like that.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: i know... Whatil!
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Just kidding. No really, where’d I
dialog: do that?
dialog: 12,
dialog: Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Maybe it’s just me...It was so strange
dialog: to be reading something knowing the
text: character in the story is based on
dialog: you. It's both flattering and
text: disturbing at the same time.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Why was it disturbing?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I don't know, just -being part of
text: someone's memory, suddenly seeing
dialog: myself through your eyes. How long
dialog: did it take you to write it?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: On and off, 3 or 4 years.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: It's a long time to be writing about
dialog: one night.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Tell mea about it. I feel like I
dialog: basically lived with you there for a
dialog: while.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I'd always assumed you've forgotten
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: T had a pretty clear picture of you
dialog: in my mind. I gotta tell you
dialog: something - I've wanted to talk to
dialog: you for so long...
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: It's surreal, now I feel everything
dialog: I say should be...
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah, and now we have what? twenty
dialog: minutes and thirty seconds?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: More than that, much more than that.
dialog: I want to know about you. What are
dialog: you up to?
dialog: 13.
scene_heading: Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 13A.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Wheew. Where to start. I'm working
dialog: for Green Cross, it’s an environmental
dialog: organization.
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 14.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Wow. What are they all about?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: We basically work on many different
dialog: environment issues, from clean water
dialog: to disarmament of chemical weapons
dialog: you know, international laws that
dialog: deal with the environment.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What do you do for them?
speaker_heading: CELINS
dialog: Different things. Last year I was
dialog: in India for quite a while working
text: on a water treatment plant.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: CELINE,
dialog: The cotton industry there is a major
dialog: source of pollution.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I gotta say I admire the fact that
dialog: it sounds like you are actually DOING
dialog: something. Most people, myself
dialog: included, just bitch about everything:
dialog: how America's consuming all the
dialog: world's resources, we're creating
dialog: sweat shops in China, SUVs suck
dialog: global warming...
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I'm relived to hear you're not one
dialog: of those Freedom Fry kind of
dialog: Americans.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Nah. But I gotta say, I think that's
dialog: S80 cool what you're doing. How'd
dialog: you get into that?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: When I.came out of political science
dialog: I thought I'd be working for the
dialog: government, and I did for a short
dialog: while and then I got tired of having
dialog: conversations with friends about how
text: the world was falling to pieces.
dialog: 
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 14K.
speaker_heading: CELINE (CONT'D)
dialog: I realized that the only thing I
dialog: wanted to do was to look at things
dialog: that really can be fixed and try to
dialog: e@ fix them.
dialog: Before Sunrise Sequel

dialog: -
dialog: hey bo
dialog: c
text: Pink Pages 24/8/03 15.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I gotta say, that's awesome. I always
dialog: figured you'd be doing something
dialog: cool like that.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Thanks. I'm lucky to have a job I
dialog: really like.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You know, I actually alternate in
dialog: thinking that everything is
dialog: irrevocably screwed up, and actually
dialog: feeling things in a general might be
dialog: getting better.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Better! How could “you possibly think
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I know it sounds weird, but I think
dialog: there are things to be optimistic
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Okay, I know your book is selling,
dialog: but what are you talking about - the
dialog: world's a mess right now.
speaker_heading: CELINE (CONT'D)
dialog: rom a western point of view things
dialog: are getting a bit better - we're
dialog: moving all our industry to developing
dialog: nations to get cheap labor free from
dialog: any environmental laws. The weapons
dialog: industry is out of control, five
dialog: million die every year due to
dialog: preventable water diseases. So how
dialog: is the world getting better? I'm
dialog: not getting angry, but really I want
dialog: to know?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I know there are a lot of serious
dialog: problems - I don't have one publisher
dialog: in the entire Asian market.

speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: But I think there's more awareness
dialog: out there.
dialog: é
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 16.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: It might be getting better because
dialog: people like you are informed and
dialog: educated and speaking out and as the
dialog: world's consciousness and education
dialog: vises - things like women's issues,
dialog: racial rights, sexual rights,
dialog: children's rights...
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I mean the very notion of conservation
dialog: and environmental issues - all that
dialog: weren't even in the vocabulary until
dialog: fairly recently - those are becoming
dialog: the norm and will eventually be what's
dialog: expected all over the world.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: IT agree with what you are saying but
dialog: it's dangerous. An imperialist
dialog: country can use that kind of thinking
dialog: to justify their economic greed.
dialog: Human rights is the only issue I...
scene_heading: INT. CAFE -- APTERNCON
dialog: They walk
text: in and eventually seat themselves.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Any particular imperialist country
dialog: you got in mind there, Frency?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: No, not really. Is it okay if we
dialog: sit here?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Perfect. But what I'm really saying
dialog: is the world might be evolving like
dialog: a person evolves. ME for example...
dialog: Am I improving? Am I getting worse?
dialog: When I was younger I was healthier
dialog: but I was racked with insecurity-
dialog: Now I'm older my problems are deeper,
dialog: but I'm more equipped to handle them.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: What are your problems?
dialog: Long Pause.
dialog: 
dialog: Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Right now, I don"t feel like I have
dialog: any - just damn happy to be here.
speaker_heading: CELINE

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Just a coffee.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Non, un cafe, et une orange pressee
dialog: avec des glacons,.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I love the coffee over here so much
dialog: more than in the U.S.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I couldn't even drink coffee when I
dialog: was living over there.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You lived in the U.S.? When?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: From '96 through '99. I was studying
text: at NYU.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Don't tell me that!
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Ch wow - that’s weird. I've been in

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: That is weird. You know, it actually
dialog: crossed my mind, if I might run into
dialog: you there, but the odds are so slim,
dialog: e you know? I had no idea even what
dialog: town you were living in. Weren't
dialog: you somewhere in Texas?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I was for a long time but, I had to
dialog: get out there. I figured it was
dialog: time for me to be in New York. What
dialog: made you come back here?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: IT had finished my master's, for one,
dialog: but I was starting to get paranoid.
dialog: The stuff in the medias all the time -
dialog: murders, gang violence, serial
dialog: killers.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: i know.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I was living in terror. The final
dialog: straw was one night I heard some
dialog: noise on my fire escape, I called
dialog: 911 and the cops came...
speaker_heading: @ JESSE
text: Like three hours later.
speaker_heading: CELINE,
dialog: After I'd been raped and killed about
text: ten times. It was a man and a woman
dialog: officer. I was describing to them
dialog: what I had heard when the woman had
dialog: to run downstairs to move the police
text: car. I was alone with the male cop,
dialog: and right away he asked me if I had
dialog: agun. I said no and he told me I'd
dialog: better think about getting one -
dialog: this was America, not France. I
dialog: told him I didn't know how to shoot .
dialog: a gun and that I wasn't interested
dialog: in firearms. That is when he pulled
dialog: out his gun and said to me...
dialog: {cop voice)
dialog: "One day you're going to have
dialog: something like this in your face,
dialog: and if you want to live a long life,
dialog: you're going to have to choose between
dialog: Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03
speaker_heading: CELINE (CONT'D)
dialog: you or them." They left and the
dialog: next morning, I actually called for
dialog: an application to get a gun. Me, a
dialog: @ gun! But then I started thinking
dialog: that something was wrong, the way
text: that cop had pulled his gun.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, sure.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: So I canceled my demand for a gun
dialog: and instead I called the police
dialog: station and tried to complain about
dialog: this cop's behavior.
speaker_heading: JESSE -
dialog: What happened with that?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: It was so much paper work and with
dialog: my shitty student visa, so I gave up
dialog: and forgot about the whole thing.
dialog: Well, actually no, I never forgot.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Obviously.
text: @ Coffee arrives.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: But still, I wouldn't mind being
dialog: back there - there's a lot of things
dialog: I miss about the U.S.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: The overall good mood people have
dialog: even if it can be bullshit. Like
dialog: “hey, how you doing? Great! How
dialog: YOU doin? Great! Have a great day."
dialog: Parisians are so grumpy. Have you
dialog: noticed?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Really? Everyone around here seems
dialog: pretty happy to me.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: They're not happy. Maybe I just
dialog: mean the French men, they drive me
dialog: @ nuts.

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I remember as a teenager I went to
dialog: Warsaw when it was still a strict
dialog: communist regime, which I don't
dialog: approve of at all.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Sure you don't.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I don't at all, really. But something
dialog: about being there after a while was
dialog: very interesting, I found. After a
dialog: couple of weeks something changed in
dialog: me. The city was quite gloomy and
dialog: gray but after a while my brain seemed
dialog: Clearer. I was writing a lot more
dialog: in my journal, ideas I had never
dialog: thought of before.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Communist ideas?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Shut up! I'm not a communist.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I know. Go ahead, sorry.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: It took me a while to figure out
dialog: why, why I felt so different. And
dialog: then, one day as I was walking throvgh
dialog: the Jewish cemetery, I don't know
dialog: why but it occurred to me there,
dialog: i realized I had just spent the past
dialog: couple of weeks away from most of my
dialog: habits. The TV was in a language I
dialog: didn't understand and there was

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: No, that's impossible.
speaker_heading: JESSE

speaker_heading: CELINE

speaker_heading: JESSE

speaker_heading: CELINE
text: Like a scar.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: A scar? Like a gunshot wound?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: No, I like it. I had a terrible
dialog: nightmare the other day. I was having
dialog: an awful dream that I was 32, then i
dialog: woke up and I was 23, relieved, and
dialog: then I woke up for real and I was
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Aw shit, it happens.
speaker_heading: CELINE
text: Time gets faster and faster.
dialog: Apparently it's because we don't
dialog: renew our synapses after 20, so it's
dialog: all pretty much downhill from then
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: On the other hand, I like getting
dialog: older. Life feels more immediate -
dialog: You can appreciate it more.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Oh I know. I actually like it too.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I was once a drummer in a band.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: You were?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: And we were pretty good too. But
dialog: the lead singer was so obsessed with

speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: But looking back at those shows we
dialog: did, even rehersing, it was so much
dialog: fun.
dialog: Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: I think now I'd be able to enjoy
dialog: every minute of it.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Well, you've got your book published
dialog: and you're travelling ali over the
text: They laugh.
dialog: world with it... are you enjoying
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: You know in my field, I see some
dialog: people that come into it like with
dialog: big idealist visions, of becoming
dialog: the new leaders that will create a
dialog: better world, they enjoy the goal
dialog: but not the process.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Right .
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: But the reality of it is that the
dialog: true work of improving things is in
dialog: the little achievements of the day,
dialog: and that's what you need to enjoy to
dialog: stay in that field. For example I
dialog: worked for an organization that helped
dialog: villages in Mexico and their concerns
dialog: was how to get the pencils sent to
dialog: the kids in those little country
dialog: schools, it was not about discussing
dialog: big revolutionary ideas about a better
dialog: world - it was about pencils. I see
dialog: the people that do the real work,
dialog: and what in a way is really sad is
dialog: that the people that are often the
dialog: most giving, hard working and capable
dialog: of making this world better don’t
dialog: really have the ambition and ego to
dialog: be a leader, they don't see any
dialog: interest in the rewards, they don’t
dialog: care if their name ever appear in
dialog: the press, they actually enjoy the

dialog: It seems like we're designed to be

dialog: everything. Always trying to better
dialog: @ our situation. You satisfy one desire

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I don't know actually. Not wanting

dialog: desire.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: That's what all those Buddhist cats
dialog: say, right, liberate yourself from
dialog: desire and you will find you already
dialog: have everything you need.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: But I feel human when I want something
dialog: more than just basic survival needs.
dialog: Wanting, whether it's intimacy with
text: another person or a new pair of shoes
dialog: is kind of beautiful. I like that
dialog: we have ever-renewing desires.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah... I guess it's just entitlement
dialog: that brings all the pain. Whenever

dialog: shoes, that your desires SHOULD be
dialog: met. It's all right to have wants

dialog: I know. I decided a long time ago

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Why did you go there?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I don't know, I'd been doing a bunch
dialog: of reading, thought it'd be cool.
dialog: Have you ever spent time with any
dialog: monks or nuns?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Not my style.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I was shocked - I expected them to
text: be ail glowering and stern but they
dialog: weren't - they were quick to laugh
dialog: and really easy to be around, very
dialog: attuned to everything. They're not
dialog: trying to hustle anybody, they're
dialog: not trying to accomplish anything,
text: they are trying to live and die in
dialog: peace and be close with God or
dialog: whatever part of them they feel is
dialog: eternal - it's so refreshing to be
dialog: around. You realize that the bulk
dialog: of people that you meet are trying
dialog: to get somewhere better, make a little
dialog: more jack, get a little more respect,

speaker_heading: CELINE

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I had a boyfriend many years ago

speaker_heading: CELINE

speaker_heading: JESSE

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Me too, I mean I thought I did.

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: It was a bad day for me, but it
dialog: must've been even worse for you.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah it was unreal, I looked at her

dialog: down this week.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: why?
speaker_heading: CELINE

speaker_heading: CELINE

speaker_heading: JESSE

speaker_heading: CELINE

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, a memory’s never finished if

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yes I know, I have memories from my

dialog: believe in ghosts, or spirits?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Do you believe in re-incarnation?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Not at all.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What about God?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: No, no.
text: Jesse laughs.
speaker_heading: CELINE (CONT'D)
dialog: But at the same time, I don't want
dialog: to be one of those people that don't
dialog: believe in any kind of magic.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: So you believe in Astrology.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Of course! I mean, your a Scorpio,
dialog: I'm a Sag, we get along. No. There's
dialog: that Einstein quote that if you don't
dialog: believe in any kind of magic or
dialog: mystery, you're as good as dead.
dialog: 33.
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 33A.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, I've always felt there was
dialog: some kind of mystical core to the
dialog: 
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 33B.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: universe. But I don't believe that
dialog: me, my personality, has any permanent
dialog: place here. And the more I believe
dialog: that, the more I can't go through
dialog: life and think "This is no big deal.”
dialog: This is it. What do you see? What
dialog: do you feel? What do you think is
dialog: funny? Every day is the last.
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 34.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: And sometimes when I feel that way I
dialog: call my mom and I tell her I love
dialog: her, she’s always...
dialog: {imitating mother}
dialog: "Oh my God, what's wrong? You've
dialog: got cancer? You're going to commit
dialog: suicide?" t's almost not worth it.
text: Jesse laughs.
speaker_heading: CELINE (CONT'D)
dialog: So what about us?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What about us?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: For example if we knew we were both
dialog: going to die tonight...
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Like the apocalypse was coming?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: No, that's too dramatic. Just the
dialog: two of us would die, would we talk
dialog: about your book, the environment or,
dialog: like tell me what you would you say.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: If today was our last day?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: That's hard, no?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I would definitely stop talking about
dialog: my book, probably drop the
dialog: environment...
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: JESSE .
dialog: I wouldn't mind still talking about
dialog: magic in the universe, I'd just like
dialog: to do it in a hotel room in between
dialog: sessions of us like, wildly fucking
dialog: till we die.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Wow. Why not just go over to that
dialog: bench right there? Why waste time
dialog: going to a hotel?
scene_heading: Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 34A.
text: He immediately grabs her and pulls over to a bench. He twirls
text: her into his lap as she is suddenly overcome with shyness.
speaker_heading: CELINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, we're most likely not gonna
dialog: die tonight.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Too bad.
scene_heading: Before Sunrise Sequel Yellow Pages 20/8/03
text: She repositions herself on the bench next to him.
dialog: 34B.
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 35.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Forget about the hotel or the park
dialog: bench.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Well let's not forget about it.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: That was an extreme example but my
dialog: point was to communicate with people
dialog: is very hard to do.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, most of our day to day
dialog: exchanges, if you think about it,
dialog: they're more like traffic control.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: iI know. For example, a friend of
dialog: mine was talking about she and her
text: boyfriend's problems in bed. After
dialog: they had dated for about @ year, she
dialog: started telling him things he could
dialog: do to please her, and it totally
dialog: freaked him out.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: He thought it meant he was a bad
dialog: lover and was all threatened, they
text: almost broke up over it.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Why'd she wait so long?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I don't know, men are so easily
dialog: offended.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: More than women, you think?
speaker_heading: CELINE -
dialog: Definitely on that subject. Plus I
dialog: think it is easier to please a man
dialog: than to please a woman.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: it's definitely easier to please a
dialog: Tan.
scene_heading: Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 35A.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Depends, but generally yes. Can you
dialog: name the female mammal that has
dialog: opposing thumbs and is been observed
dialog: in the wild te be actively encouraging
dialog: males of the same species to lick
dialog: its genitalia?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No, like a baboon or something?
dialog: What?
text: Celine gives a crazed look and points her two thumbs at
text: herself, letting out a little primate shriek. They both
dialog: laugh.
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 36.
speaker_heading: CELINE.
dialog: The good thing about getting older
dialog: is that I don't get wiser I just get
dialog: dirtier.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No shame in that.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Anyway, my friend said the next man
dialog: she dates, before they ever do
dialog: anything, she's going to make a
dialog: questionnaire about sex - what each
dialog: of them likes and dislikes.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Is it on paper, or do you answer out
dialog: loud? .
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Mostly written down, I think, but
dialog: not just yes or no. Like if the
dialog: question is, are you into S & M, you
dialog: can answer, "no, but a spanking once
dialog: in a while... doesn't hurt."
text: Jesse laughs.
dialog: She looks
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Or it could be like, do you like
dialog: dirty talk during sex?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Or it could be like, which specific
dialog: words do you want to hear or not?
text: at him.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Okay. Which words do you like to
dialog: hear? -
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: For instance, how do you feel about
dialog: the word pussy?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Love it.
dialog: Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03
text: They both laugh.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: It's amazing what perverts we've
dialog: both become in the last 9 years.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: At least now we don't have to pretend
dialog: that each sexual experience is some
dialog: life-altering event.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah - by this timé I know you've
dialog: stuck it in so many places, it's
text: probably like, about to fall off,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Exactly, and I can't realistically
dialog: expect you're anything but a total
dialog: ho at this point, so...
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: That's true, what can you do?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: {a beat}
dialog: So tell me, what kind of songs do
dialog: you write?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: What kind?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, what are they like?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I don't know. Some are about people,
dialog: relationships, one's about my cat.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Sing me one.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: No. I don't have my guitar.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: C'mon. Acapella.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: No way, not right now.
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 38.
dialog: They walk
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: If not now, when?
text: Celine starts to get up, with Jesse eventually following.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: That's right, we need to get going
dialog: back to the bookstore - you're going
dialog: to miss your flight.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I'll be fine.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: This will take us to the Seine.
dialog: Then we can just walk from there.
speaker_heading: JESSE |
dialog: Okay, okay.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: So you're flying back to New York?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah.
text: in silence for a bit.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: So I read in that article you are
dialog: married and have a kid? That's great.
dialog: A slightly weird look from Jesse: "knew this coming,
dialog: eventually."
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah. He's four - can you believe
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: What's his name?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Henry. Hank ~ he's amazing. It's
dialog: so much fun. -
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: T'm sure. And your wife? What does
dialog: she do?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Ummm...She teaches elementary school.
dialog: You don't have children, do you?
dialog:

dialog: 38A.
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 38B.
speaker_heading: CELINE (CONT'D)
dialog: I left them in the car, with the
dialog: windows up! But it was six months
dialog: @ ago - do you think they're okay?
text: They laugh.
speaker_heading: CELINE (CONT'D)
dialog: I want to some day, but I'm not ready.
dialog: i'm in a good relationship, though.
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 39.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah? That's nice. What's he like?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: He's great - he's a photo-journalist
dialog: and he does war coverage. He's away
dialog: a lot which leaves me free to do a
dialog: lot of things.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Isn't that dangerous? Seems like a
dialog: lot of those guys are getting killed
dialog: these days.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: He promises me he never takes risks,
dialog: but I often worry. He goes into
text: this trance when he starts to
dialog: photograph something.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Once we were in New Delhi and we
text: passed a bum lying in the middle of
text: the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Bomb?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Bum... homeless. it looked like he
dialog: needed help but his first reaction
dialog: was to photograph him. He took a
text: picture, very close to his face,
dialog: even fixing his collar to make it
dialog: look better. He was totally detached
dialog: from the person.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Well, to be good at that job, I'd
dialog: think you'd have to be like that.
speaker_heading: CELINE -
dialog: Maybe. I don't judge him for it -
dialog: what he does is essential and
dialog: incredible. All I'm saying is that
dialog: I could never do it.
text: They are approaching the Seine.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Hey, let's go get on that boat.
dialog: Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: You don't have time.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Come on, it'll fun, I really want
dialog: to. We still have fifteen minutes.
dialog: De you have a cell phone?
dialog: 39A.
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 40.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I'l] call him from the boat and he
dialog: can pick me up at the next stop.
dialog: That way we won't lose any time.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: OK, if you want to... I've never
dialog: peen on these boats, it's for
text: tourists. It's a bit embarassing.
dialog: Oh well.
text: They speed up to get on the boat before it leaves.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: So what, you in love with this guy?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: What guy?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: The photo journalist.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah of course. Well, probably.
scene_heading: EXT. BOAT -- AFTERNOON
text: They get on the boat and pay. Celine asks the guy about
text: where the boat stops next.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Bonjour, deux ticket stil vous plait,
dialog: ctest quoi le prochain arret?
speaker_heading: BOAT GUY
dialog: Quai Henri IV, Mademoiselle.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Tell him to pick you up at quai Henri
dialog: iv.
speaker_heading: JESSE .
dialog: Arri cat?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Quai Henri IV.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: An-Ri-cat?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Henri iv
dialog: 
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 40K.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Oh, like Henry 4.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Why didn't you say so?
text: Jesse makes his call while Celine walks to the back of the
text: Eventually they stand on the back of the boat, the
text: wind blowing, as Notre Dame looms in the background.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Notre Dame, check that out. I heard
dialog: a story once that when the Germans
dialog: were occupying Paris and they had to
dialog: retreat back, they wired Notre Dame
dialog: to blow up and they had to leave one
text: guy in charge of hitting the switch.
dialog: But the guy, the soldier, just waited,
dialog: sitting there, and he just couldn't
dialog: do it. When the allied troops
dialog: eventually came in they found all
text: the explosives and the switch just
text: lying there. They found the same
dialog: thing at Sacre-Coeur, the Eiffel
dialog: Tower and two other places, I think.
dialog: I always liked that story.
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 41.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yes, that is a great story. But you
dialog: have to think that one day Notre
dialog: Dame will be gone. There used to be
text: another Cathedral there.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Right where Notre Dame is?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah. Everything passes. People,
dialog: buildings... You know what, I've
dialog: never done this. I forget about how
dialog: beautiful Paris is... Sometimes when
dialog: you live in a city you don't even
dialog: look at it anymore.
speaker_heading: JESSE-
dialog: Yeah. I think my book was like
dialog: building something so I wouldn't
dialog: forget the details of the time we
dialog: spent together. Like a reminder
dialog: that once we really did meet, this
dialog: was real... this happened.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: You know I'm happy you are saying
dialog: that, I mean I always feel like a
dialog: freak because I'm never able to move
dialog: on like this...
dialog: (snap her fingers) )
dialog: People just have an affair or even a
text: relationship, they break up and they
dialog: forget, they move on like they would
dialog: have changed brand of cereals. Tf
dialog: feel I was never able to really forget
dialog: anyone I've been with, because each
dialog: person has their own specific
dialog: qualities, and you can never replace
dialog: anyone, what is lost is lost. Each
dialog: relationship when it ends, really
dialog: damages me, I never really recover.
dialog: That is why I'm very careful with
dialog: getting involved because it hurts me
dialog: too much...or even getting laid, .
dialog: actually I don't do that. I will
dialog: miss of the person the most mundane
dialog: things. Like I'm obsessed with little
dialog: things.
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 42.
speaker_heading: CELINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe I'm crazy, when I was a little
dialog: girl my mom told me I was always
dialog: date to school, so one day she
dialog: followed me to see why I was late.
dialog: I was looking at... chestnuts falling
text: from the trees and rolling down the
text: side walk or ants crossing the road,
text: the way a leaf cast a shadow on a
dialog: tree trunk, little things. It is
dialog: the same with people, I see in them
dialog: little details so specific to each
dialog: of them that move me, that I miss
dialog: and will always miss. You can never
dialog: replace anyone because everyone is
dialog: made of such beautiful specific
dialog: details.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: CELINE (CONT'D)
dialog: You know, like I remember the way
dialog: your beard had a bit of red in it
dialog: and the way the sun was making it
dialog: glow in the morning right before you
dialog: deft, I missed that. Shit I'm really
dialog: crazy.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Now I know for sure why I wrote that
dialog: stupid book - so you might actually
dialog: show up at a reading in Paris and
dialog: I'd walk over to you and ask, "hey,
dialog: WHERE THE FUCK WERE YOU?"
text: Celine laughs.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Honestly, did you think I'd be here
dialog: today?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: i'm not kidding - I think I wrote it
dialog: to try and find you somehow.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: i know it's not true but that is
dialog: Sweet to say.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: i think it is true. What did you
dialog: think the changes were of us seeing
dialog: each other again?
dialog: 
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 43.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: After that December, I'd say almost
dialog: zero, but we're not real anyway. We
dialog: are just characters in that old lady's
text: dream - she's on her deathbed and
text: she is fantasizing about her youth,
dialog: so of course we had to meet again.
text: Jesse then speaks in a voice that is both louder and more
dialog: frustrated and desperate than we've seen.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: God, why weren't you there in Vienna?!
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: You know why!
speaker_heading: JESSE”
dialog: T know, I mean, I wish you would
dialog: have been. Things might have been
dialog: so different in our lives.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Do you think so?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yes, I actually do.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Maybe not, maybe we would have hated
text: each other eventually.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: come on, like we are hating each
dialog: other right now?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Maybe we are only good at brief
dialog: encounters walking around in European
text: cities in a warm climate.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Ahhh, why didn't we exchange numbers
dialog: and stuff?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: We were young and stupid?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Are we still?
speaker_heading: ELINE
dialog: I guess when you are young, you
dialog: believe that you will meet many people
dialog: 
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 44.
dialog: Celine is
speaker_heading: CELINE (CONT'D)
dialog: with whom you'll connect with, but
dialog: later in life you realize it only
text: happens a few times.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: And you can screw it up and miss-
dialog: connect.
text: a bit tense.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Well the past is the past, it was
dialog: meant to be that way, no?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Do you really believe that? That
dialog: everything is fated in some way?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I think the world might be less free
dialog: than we think. That when given these
dialog: exact circumstances, this is what
dialog: will happen every time. Two parts
dialog: hydrogen and one part oxygen, you'll
dialog: get water every time.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No - what if your grandmother had
dialog: lived another week, or died a week
dialog: earlier, maybe days, things might
dialog: have been very different. I believe
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: But you can't think like that.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I know you shouldn't on most things,
dialog: but on this one, something was off.
dialog: Forgive me this, but in the months
dialog: leading up to my wedding, I was
dialog: thinking of you all the time. And
dialog: on the way there, I'm in the car
text: with a buddy of mine, staring out -
text: the window as he drove downtown. It
dialog: was raining, and I thought I saw
dialog: you, not far from the church folding
text: up an umbrella, walking into a deli
text: on the corner of Broadway and about
dialog: thirteenth. I thought I was
dialog: hallucinating, and now I know it
dialog: probably was you!
dialog: 
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 44h.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I lived on fifteenth and University.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: eS See, I'm not crazy.
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 45.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: {pause}
dialog: What is it like to be married? You
dialog: haven't talked much about that.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I haven't? How weird. I met her
dialog: our last year of college and we broke
dialog: up and got back together for a period
dialog: of years. Then we were sort-of back
dialog: together and then she was pregnant
dialog: and ah... So yeah, marriage...
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: What's she like?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: She's a great mom,- a good teacher,
dialog: smart interesting pretty. I dontt
dialog: know. I remember thinking at the
dialog: time that so many of the men I've
dialog: admired most ~ their lives have been
dialog: committed to something larger than
dialog: themselves.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: So you got married because men you
dialog: admire were married?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No, it was more like I had this idea
dialog: of my best self and I wanted to pursue
dialog: that even if it might have been
dialog: overriding my honest self. It's
dialog: funny, at that moment I thought didn't
dialog: matter so much "the who" of it, that
dialog: ultimately nobody is going to be
dialog: everything to you and that it was
dialog: the simple action of committing
dialog: yourself and meeting your
dialog: responsibilities that mattered. I
dialog: mean, what is love if not respect
dialog: and trust and admiration and I felt
dialog: all those things. So, cut to the
dialog: present tense, I've had sex probably
dialog: ten times in the last four years.
text: She laughs.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: You're laughing at me? I know it
dialog: sounds pathetic, but if somebody
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 46.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: were to touch me affectionately, I'd
dialog: dissemble into molecules. I'm sorry
dialog: that's probably more than you want
dialog: to hear.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Less then ten times in four years?
dialog: Do you masturbate a lot?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Don't ask that question if you don't
dialog: want to hear the answer. I'm like a
dialog: teenager. I have to admit, in my
dialog: youthful idea of marriage, it didn't
dialog: include a lot of beating off.
text: They laugh.
scene_heading: 16 EXT. BOAT DOCK -- AFTERNOON 10
text: They exit the boat and walk toward the street.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I'm sorry you don't seem that happy
dialog: with your marriage - This friend of
dialog: mine, she's a shrink.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: How is she doing?
speaker_heading: CELINE.
dialog: She's a mess, anyway she was telling
dialog: me that she's been dealing with a
dialog: lot of couples that are breaking up
dialog: for the same exact reason.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Hmmm. What reason's that?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: All those couples expected after a
dialog: few years of living together for the
dialog: passion, that consuming desire, to
dialog: be the same as at the beginning. -
dialog: But it is impossible.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah I know, I know.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I mean thank god otherwise we would
dialog: end up with an aneurysm if we were
dialog: 
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 47.
speaker_heading: CELINE (CONT'D)
text: in that constant state of excitement.
dialog: Plus we would end up doing nothing
dialog: at all with our lives. You think
dialog: you would have finished your book if
dialog: you were fucking someone every 5
dialog: minutes?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I would've welcome the challenge.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Your wife, it's natural after the
dialog: birth of your son, she has to give
dialog: all her love to the little one,
dialog: imagine if she was totally obsessed
dialog: with sex and forget about the baby
dialog: while she's ridding you like a wild
dialog: cat. I mean that wouldn't make sense.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I know. That all makes perfect sense,
dialog: but it's more than sex.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I know it's obvious but couples are
dialog: so confused now. Men need to feel
dialog: essential and they don't feel that
dialog: way anymore because it was imprinted
text: in their head for so long that they
dialog: had to be a provider. I'ma strong
dialog: women in my professional life, I
dialog: don't need a man to feed me but I
dialog: still need a man to love me and that
dialog: I could love.

dialog: For me, it's better I don't

dialog: I was suffering so much all the time.
dialog: I still have lots of dreams but they
dialog: are not in regard to my love life.
dialog: It doesn't make me sad, it is the
dialog: way it is.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Is that why you are in a relationship
dialog: with a man that is never around?
text: Celine is a bit stung by his observation.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yes, obviously, I can't deal with
dialog: the everyday life of a relationship,
dialog: we have this exciting time together

speaker_heading: CELINE (CONT'D)
dialog: When someone is always around me I'm
text: suffocating.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Wait a second - you just said you
dialog: need to love and be loved.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah, but when I do, it quickly makes
dialog: nauseous. It's a disaster. I feel
dialog: really happy only when I am on my
dialog: own. Even being alone is better
text: than sitting next to lover and feeling
dialog: lonely.
dialog: {getting mad}
dialog: It's not so easy for me to be all
dialog: romantic. You start off that way
dialog: and after you've been screwed over a
dialog: few times you give up on all your
dialog: delusional ideas and you just take
dialog: whatever comes into your life. That's
dialog: not even true - I haven't been screwed -
dialog: over, I've just had too many blah
dialog: relationships. They were not mean,
dialog: they cared for me but there was no
dialog: real excitement or connection, or at
dialog: least not from my side.
dialog: erying.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I'm sorry. Are you really that
dialog: unhappy?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: No, it's not even that. I was fine
dialog: until I read your fucking book - it
dialog: Stirred shit up. It reminded me how
dialog: genuinely romantic I WAS, how I had
dialog: so much hope in things and now I
dialog: don't believe in anything that relates
dialog: to love. I don't feel things for
dialog: people anymore. It's almost like in
dialog: a way I put all my romanticism into .
dialog: that one night and I was never able
dialog: to feel all this again. Somehow
dialog: that night took things away from me,
dialog: like I expressed them to you and you
dialog: took them with you.
text: Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 50.
speaker_heading: CELINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Somehow destiny not allowing me to
dialog: see you again made me cold like if
dialog: love wasn't for me.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I can't believe that.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Reality and love are almost
dialog: contradictory for me. It's funny,
dialog: every one of my exs are now married.
dialog: Men go out with me, we break up and
dialog: then they get married. Later they
dialog: call me to thank me for teaching
dialog: them what love is, that I taught
dialog: them to care and respect women.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, I may be one of those guys.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I want to kill them! Why didn't
dialog: they asked me to marry them, I would
dialog: have said no but I least they could
dialog: have asked! But it's my fault. I
dialog: never felt it was the right man,
dialog: never. But what does that mean, the
dialog: right man! The love of your life?
dialog: The concept is absurd. The idea
dialog: that we can only be complete with
text: another person is evil.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Can I talk?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I guess I've been heartbroken too
text: many times and then recovered. Now
dialog: from the start I make no effort
dialog: because I know it's not gonna work
dialog: anyway.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You can't do that- spend your life
dialog: trying to avoid pain at the expense
dialog: of engaging.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Those are words. You know what I
dialog: got to get away from you. Stop the
text: car and want to get out.
dialog: Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No wait let's keep talking about it.
speaker_heading: CELINE

dialog: Listen, I'm just so glad to be with
dialog: you, and that you didn't forget me.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: No I didn't and it pisses me off.
dialog: You come here to Paris all romantic
dialog: and MARRIED. Screw you! Please
dialog: don't get me wrong - I'm not trying
dialog: to get you or anything. All I need
dialog: is a married man. There's been so
dialog: much water under the bridge, it's
dialog: not even about you anymore.
dialog: It's about that time, that moment in
text: time that is forever gone.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You say all this stuff but you didn't
dialog: even remember having sex.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Of course I remembered.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You did?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Girls pretend things like that.
dialog: What was I suppose to say, I remember

speaker_heading: JESSE

dialog: see you, even if you've become an
dialog: angry manic-depressive activist. I
dialog: e@ still like you and enjoy being around
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: And I feel the same. I'm sorry I
dialog: had to let it all out. I'm miserable
dialog: in my love life, in my relationship.
dialog: I always act like I'm detached but
dialog: I'm dying inside. I'm dying because
text: I'm so numb. I don't feel pain or
dialog: excitement. I'm not bitter, I'm

text: The car makes it’s way through the streets of Paris, Celine
text: and Jesse continue talking in the back seat.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Oh God, you think you are the one
dialog: dying inside -My life is 24/7 bad.
dialog: The ONLY happiness I get is when I'm
dialog: out with my son. I've been to
dialog: couples' counseling, things I'd never
dialog: thought I'd have to do. Bought self
dialog: help books, lingerie, lit candles...
speaker_heading: e CELINE
dialog: Did the candles help?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Hell no. I don't love her the way
dialog: she needs to be loved. I don't even
dialog: see a future for us but then I look
text: across the table at my beautiful boy
dialog: and I think I would suffer any torture
dialog: to wake up in his house and be with
dialog: him for all the minutes of his life ~
dialog: I don't want to miss out on that.
dialog: But man, there is no joy or laughter
dialog: in my home and I don't want him
dialog: growing up in that.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: No laughter. My parents are still
dialog: together for thirty-five years - and
text: even when they have a fight they end
text: up laughing.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I don't want to be one of those people

dialog: I want her to have a great life, she
dialog: deserves that. But we're living in
dialog: the pretense of marriage,
dialog: responsibility, these ideas of how
dialog: people are supposed to live. I have
dialog: these dreams all the time...
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: What dreams?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I wasn't going to say this, but I
dialog: have these dreams where I'm standing
dialog: on a platform and you keep going by
text: on a train, again and again and again
dialog: and then I wake up with the fuckin'
dialog: sweats. And then there's this other
dialog: dream where you are pregnant beside
dialog: me in bed naked and I want to touch
dialog: you so bad but you tell me not to
dialog: and then you look away and I touch
dialog: you anyway, right on your ankle, and
dialog: your skin is so soft and I wake up
dialog: in sobs and my wife is sitting there
dialog: looking at me and I am ten million
dialog: miles from her and I know something
dialog: is wrong and I can't keep living
dialog: like this. There's got to be more
dialog: to love than commitment. I have to
dialog: tell you I put the whole idea of
dialog: romantic love to bed when you weren't
dialog: there that day I swore it off.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Why are you telling me all this?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I'm sorry - maybe I should't have. .
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Isn't it weird that people always
dialog: think that they are the only one
dialog: getting through tough times? I
dialog: thought from the article you must've
dialog: had the perfect life- wife, kid,
dialog: published author- but it sounds like
dialog: your personal life is more of a mess

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yes. You've made me feel better.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Good, I'm glad.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: You know I really wish you the best.
dialog: It's not because I'm incapable of

dialog: So it is all really true about your

dialog: to hopefully get in my pants?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: dust to get in your pants - I use

dialog: have you been here?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Four years.

speaker_heading: CELINE (CONT'D) .
dialog: Oh, there's my cat, look at him he's

dialog: What floor are you on?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Third.
text: They start up the stairs, not saying anything, but acting

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Sure.
text: As she prepares a couple of glasses, we see the details of
text: her apartment through his eyes. Some paintings, a picture

text: an article and a picture of himself pinned up on a bulletin
dialog: board,
text: He notices her guitar sitting by the sofa. She walks out of

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: No, I can't. I'm embarrassed.
speaker_heading: JESSE

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Uhhh. Okay, but you're going to

speaker_heading: JESSE

speaker_heading: CELINE

speaker_heading: JESSE

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: The ex-boyfriend, really?
text: She sits on the couch, all hippie style, and strums a
dialog: beautiful, funny song.

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Wheeeew! Encore! That was awesome!
dialog: Now the one about me.
speaker_heading: CELINE.
dialog: No, no, no. Have your tea and then
dialog: you have te get going.
text: She gets up and goes into the kitchen. While she's in there,

text: a Nina Simone song is playing and he is sitting on the couch.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Is it okay if IT put my feet up?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Sure. Did you ever see Nina Simone
dialog: in concert?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No, I wish I had. I can’t believe
text: she's gone.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I know, it's so sad. I saw her play
dialog: twice. She was great. This is one
dialog: of my favorites of hers.
text: The song begins:

dialog: Then she'd talk to somebody in the
dialog: audience. ~
dialog: {imitating Nina)
text: "Oh yeah, baby," She'd walk off a
dialog: Little, then walk really slow back
text: over to the mike. She had a big
dialog: ass, and this funny little walk.
text: Celine sort of hunches over and sticks out her butt a little
text: and proceeds to waddle slowly across the room. As the song
