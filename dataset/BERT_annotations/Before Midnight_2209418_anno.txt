scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT - AFTERNOON
text: Jesse and 14-year-old Hank are walking through an airport in
dialog: Greece.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: So you got everything?
speaker_heading: HANK
text: Mmm-hmmh.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You going to play video games the
dialog: whole flight, or do you think you
dialog: might actually crack a book?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Probably read some.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: If I write you an email, don't be
dialog: scared to write me back, okay? It
dialog: won't kill you to let your old man
dialog: know what you're thinking about and
dialog: what's going on, you know?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: If we want, we could try Skyping
dialog: once a week or something.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: All right...
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You got the drawings for your science
dialog: deal?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Yeah, think so.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Alright, well they turned out great
dialog: by the way. Like, really great.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Thanks.
text: They've arrived at the concession stand. Hank grabs a couple
dialog: of snacks.

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Is your computer charged?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What do you think's the first thing
dialog: you're gonna do when you get home?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I dunno.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I really cherish this communication
dialog: we have. You know, it's just - your
dialog: answers are so...
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: What?
text: Jesse is paying.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Just keep practicing the piano, okay?
dialog: You're really good and they spend so
dialog: much time at that school of yours...
dialog: just remember that music is actually
dialog: something you will use in your life.
dialog: Right, and don't forget to - you
dialog: want those sesame things, right?
dialog: They're really good.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Right.
dialog: (to cashier)
dialog: Yassou. Here you go. Thank you.
dialog: Okay.
text: He gets the change and they head to the gate.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll probably make it over there in
dialog: October, you know? Try to see you
dialog: in that first recital and then
dialog: hopefully catch a soccer game while
dialog: I'm there.
dialog: (to cashier)
dialog: Efharisto.

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I might not even play soccer this
dialog: year.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Oh, that'd be a big mistake. Trust
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I'm not that good.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Oh, no, you're pretty good. You
dialog: are.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I mean, I missed summer training
dialog: camp, so the chances of me starting
text: are minuscule.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, well, just tell the coach the
dialog: situation - your dad lives in Europe,
dialog: you really wanted to be there, blah
dialog: blah blah. Blame me. My parents
dialog: stink, but I'm really serious.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: But I'm not serious, Dad. I don't
dialog: care that much.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Well, you don't have to decide right
dialog: now. You know, just think about it.
dialog: All I'm saying is that team sports
dialog: are important, you know?
text: They've arrived at the security line.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Here we are. I love this airport,
dialog: don't you?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: It's awesome.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I know, it's cool, right? You excited
dialog: about seeing your mom?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Yeah, and all my friends.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, right. What about your boarding
dialog: pass, passport...? Okay. You feel
dialog: confident about making the connection?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Yeah, I've done this before.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, but not with a tricky connection
dialog: like this. Just remember, when you
dialog: land, you stay in your seat. Somebody
dialog: from the airline's going to come get
dialog: you and take you to the gate, right?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: It's not a problem.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Okay. All right. Oh, boy. Well,
dialog: looks like maybe we should just do
dialog: this thing, huh? Okay. Come here.
text: They hug.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm gonna do my best to make that
dialog: recital, okay?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You know, I wouldn't bother.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What makes you say that?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Look, I'm not being mean, but it'd
dialog: be easier if you didn't come to the
dialog: recital.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: How come?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: It'd just be better if you visited
dialog: on another weekend.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: But... I want to see you play.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Look, it's because Mom hates you so
dialog: much. She'd be really stressed if
dialog: you were there, and then it'd be
dialog: tense for me.

text: Jesse motions to the person behind him to go ahead.
speaker_heading: HANK (CONT'D)
dialog: We wouldn't have any time to hang
dialog: out, anyway.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Don't worry about her, we'll figure
dialog: that out, we can... Just don't want
dialog: you to worry about it. You know? I
dialog: mean... you know how much I miss
dialog: you, right?
text: Hank nods.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Why do you think she still hates me
dialog: so much?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I don't know. I think she hates
dialog: Daniel more than she hates you.
text: Hank playfully punches Jesse.
speaker_heading: HANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, don't worry about it. I'll
dialog: figure something out. We should
dialog: just do this though.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah. But I mean, is there anything
dialog: I can do to help?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: But you know that I love you, right?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Right, okay.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Yeah, I know. This has been the
dialog: best summer of my life.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Yeah!
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Well, me too. See, I told you, I
dialog: told you this whole Greece thing was
dialog: going to be great.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: And it was.
text: A final moment.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Okay. All right. I love you, pal.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I love you too, Dad.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Okay, shake my hand. All, right,
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Bye.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Bye. See ya.
dialog: (sighs)
text: He goes into security. Jesse watches him walk away, and

scene_heading: EXT. AIRPORT - AFTERNOON
text: We follow Jesse back through the airport as he finds his way
text: to the parking lot, revealing Celine, standing outside of
text: the car, talking on the phone.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: (speaking french)
dialog: Oui, oui.
dialog: (continues in french)
dialog: Okay.
text: As Jesse and Celine settle inside the car, the camera pans
text: over toward two 6-year-old girls who are asleep in the back
text: seat. That's right, twins NINA and ELLA. They start driving
text: away from the airport.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - AFTERNOON
text: As they hit the highway, Celine lowers her volume as she

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Okay. Bon. Trés bien. Merci.
dialog: Oui, oui, Lucia. Au'voir.
dialog: (hangs up, speaks
dialog: french)
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: They voted against it.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What, the wind turbines?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Six months dealing with those people,
dialog: they were all for it. Everyone agreed
dialog: it was great for the region...
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Oh. So what happened?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: ..-And now they've decided that they
dialog: don't like the way it looks on that
text: hill. It's ruining their view.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No, no, I thought it was a done deal.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: It was! It practically was--
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Well, can--
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: That's what's so infuriating.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Can they do that?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yes, of course. They've done it.
dialog: That's it. It's over, fini.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: No, no, it's just so frustrating. I
dialog: can't take it anymore.

dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm gonna take that job with Remy.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No. No, you don't want to work for
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: For the government?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Well, I think this government is
dialog: different. We need laws. That's
dialog: the only way anything is going to
dialog: happen.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: It's not the only way. You guys
dialog: have been getting a lot of good work
dialog: done.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Well, I've been thinking about it.
dialog: This is the way to go.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Okay. Well then, let me remind you
dialog: that you do not like that guy. The
dialog: whole time you worked for him before,
dialog: you complained about him constantly.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah, yeah, yeah. He can be an
dialog: asshole, but he gets things done.
dialog: That's how I'm gonna be from now on--
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: A real bitch, okay? That's it.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Okay. Well every time I look at
dialog: that guy, all I see is ambition. I
dialog: mean, I'm sorry, I just don't trust
dialog: him. The only reason he's going
dialog: from non-profit to government is to
dialog: have people kiss his ass.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I don't care about him, okay?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: All right, and I think you're gonna
dialog: be miserable, all right? Just with
dialog: all that politicking and compromising--
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Whatever. I've made my decision.
dialog: I'm tired of being the do-gooder
text: that rolls a boulder up a hill and
text: watches it roll down again.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Isn't he the guy that used to throw
dialog: his pens at his assistant and stuff?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Okay, I should have taken this job a
dialog: year ago. You know, and I was scared
dialog: because of the amount of work, but I
dialog: think it's the best opportunity ever
dialog: and it's more money and... I'm doing
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Okay. Are you sure?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: No, I'm not sure of anything, okay?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: All right, all right--
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I mean, you know, what's gonna happen
dialog: to everyone if I leave? Like
dialog: Francoise, and I mean, they count on
dialog: me. What do you think? Should I
dialog: take it or not, should... Should I?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Ah, no, no, no, I don't have an
dialog: opinion. I just don't want to see
dialog: you rush into a decision because of
dialog: this wind turbine crap.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: No! It's not just that, okay? It's
dialog: been stirring in me all summer...
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Well, I know it has. I know.

dialog: ..-And I should do it. And I'm doing
dialog: it!
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: All right then, just - then do it.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I'm doing it, all right? Oh, god.
dialog: I wish things were simpler. I mean,
dialog: if I leave I get fucked, if I stay I
dialog: get fucked...
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: There's always a catch.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah, the world is fucked.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, baby.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Oh, god. We finally have a vacation
text: and the girls are sick for the first
dialog: two weeks.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Or the perfect son who lives a million
text: miles away.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Or the love of your life can't clean
dialog: up after himself or learn how to
dialog: shave.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Who's that? You're not, you're not
dialog: talking about Captain Clean-up over
dialog: here, are you? You don't mean--
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Captain Clean-up! The one that's
dialog: been missing in action all these
dialog: years!
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What did you expect at this point in
dialog: your life, missy?
text: Celine turns back to look at the twins.

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: God! Oh, look at them; they're so
dialog: cute! They look like conjoined twins!
dialog: Oh my god, I gotta take a picture.
text: She takes out her cell phone and takes a picture.
text: reaches back for something he can't quite find.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Hey, did uh, did Ella finish that
dialog: apple?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: You're going to take food out of
dialog: your child's mouth?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 11.
dialog: Jesse
text: Celine reaches back and grabs a half-eaten apple off the
dialog: seat.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Okay. Well. It's all brown.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Oh, there's a spot here.
text: He takes a bite from the green part of the apple.
text: now filming him with the camera.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Ella - this is evidence of your father
dialog: stealing food from you. If you become
dialog: bulimic or anorexic, it is not my
dialog: fault. Don't blame it all on your
dialog: mother, okay?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Ella, this is a family apple. I'm
dialog: teaching you the value of sharing.
dialog: I love you honey.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Ohh, so sweet. You girls will
dialog: remember this vacation very
dialog: differently than we will.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: That's for sure. I see that with my
dialog: mom. She remembers my childhood
dialog: entirely differently than I do. Can
dialog: you please stop filming me.

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: God. I love your mom. You're always
text: so hard on her.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: It's because you missed the fucked
dialog: up years. You're just getting the
dialog: good era.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: The "fucked up years." That reminds
dialog: me, talking about fucked up... did I
dialog: ever tell you the story of my little
dialog: Cleopatra kitty? No? Okay, I think
dialog: you would remember if I did. When I
dialog: was a little girl I had this cat
dialog: named Cleopatra and every spring she
dialog: would jump the fence and get pregnant
dialog: and always end up with a litter of
text: exactly two kittens.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Two kitties?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Two kitties. Every time, every year,
dialog: two cats. I mean it was just...
dialog: amazing. Then one day, I was around
dialog: 30 and I was having lunch with my
dialog: Dad, I was remembering, mentioning
dialog: little Cleopatra and he was like -
dialog: ‘the hardest thing I ever had to do
dialog: was to kill those cute little kittens'-
dialog: and I was like WHAT? It turns out--
dialog: listen to this--there were sometimes
dialog: up to 7 kittens in that litter--
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Oh, no.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: But he would take five of them--
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Oh, no.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: --Put them into a plastic bag with a
dialog: bunch of ether.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: That's terrible.

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: He had forgotten the lie he and my
dialog: mom had told me as a kid.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: How did he decide which ones he wanted
dialog: to kill?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Well, I actually asked him that.
dialog: Did you take the fluffiest, cutest?
text: He just started to cry.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Poor Daddy.
text: They realize they're driving by some ancient ruins.
speaker_heading: CELINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, we said we were going to stop.
dialog: They wanted to see the ruins.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, but should we?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Well, Ella really wanted to.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, but should we wake them up?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You know what, let's do this. On
dialog: our way back to the airport we can
dialog: catch them.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: You know we won't.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, probably not.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: We'll be like, so long, ancient ruins!

dialog: my god, we are shitty parents. We
dialog: should have stopped.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Aw, it's okay.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: It's culture. Come on, go back.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Ah, we gotta put some character in
dialog: these kids somehow, you know what I
dialog: mean?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah, yeah.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: We're teaching them a valuable lesson,
dialog: you know. You snooze, you lose in
dialog: this world.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: And when the girls are in rehab,
dialog: recovering from ten years of addiction
dialog: to coke and speed, they'll say, "oh,
dialog: we just never felt comfortable going
dialog: to sleep because our daddy always
dialog: used to tell us, "you snooze, you
dialog: lose." And that'll be your fault
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Okay, okay. Well, we are shitty
dialog: parents.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Saying goodbye to Hank sucked.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Why, was he upset?
speaker_heading: JESSE

dialog: summer of his life.

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CELINE
text: Pimples and how girls perceive him.

dialog: What?

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah. But he was so - he was so

dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What's gonna happen now?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I don't know. They must be friends

speaker_heading: CELINE

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I'm stuck with an American teenager.
dialog: Can't believe it. Do we have to do

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What? Oh, yeah, come on. It means

dialog: prepping, the kids wanna have one
dialog: more big time together - it's gonna
dialog: be fun.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: No, no, no, but I meant the hotel,

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: It just wouldn't be so bad you know
dialog: if I - like if we were sending him

dialog: Just - I dunno. ...If his mom and I
dialog: got along a little bit better.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I know. It's like we're sending him
text: back across enemy lines.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I know. It really hit me this time,
dialog: you know? I mean, he's going to be
dialog: a freshman in high school! Four
dialog: more years and then he's gonna be on
dialog: his own.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Well, maybe that's the good news.
dialog: We only have four more years of this.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No, no, no. This is the crucial
dialog: time. I just feel like I should be
dialog: there for him. Like it's now or
dialog: never, you know?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: No. What do you mean?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I guess I just thought somehow he'd
dialog: end up living with us. Somewhere
dialog: along the way, you know. Now time's

dialog: It's high school, you know. There's

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No, it's an example, okay? It's a

speaker_heading: JESSE

speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: No, the third one I didn't read. I

scene_heading: EXT. PATIO - AFTERNOON
dialog: Back with the guys...
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: All right, well, the whole time I've
dialog: been here, I've been working on this
dialog: idea about a group of different people
dialog: with all these brain abnormalities.
dialog: So the book would be like a day in
dialog: their life from all their unique
dialog: points of view, right? Like there's
dialog: this older lady who has a condition
dialog: that makes you feel like you're ina
dialog: perpetual state of déja vu. Every
dialog: single experience she has, she feels
dialog: like she's had it before. I mean
dialog: she can be sitting here with us,
dialog: talking seemingly functional right?
text: And in her head, she's thinking:
dialog: Didn't he already say that? I mean;
dialog: weren't we here yesterday having
dialog: this exact same conversation.
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: So just like Deja Vu.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, except all the time.
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: Ah.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Right, that's the thing, right?
dialog: Everything she takes in. Breakfast,
text: a newspaper, a movie. She's convinced
dialog: she's encountered it already.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: So that's a real condition?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah. It's called persistent deja...
dialog: It's real but I can't pronounce it.
text: The men chuckle.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Then there's these two other
dialog: characters with facial recognition
dialog: extremes. Like there's this one guy
dialog: and he can't recognize his wife of
text: twenty years. He looks at himself
text: in the mirror and he feels this
dialog: disconnect with that man he's looking
text: at. Then the other character is the
text: opposite, middle-aged housewife with
text: a categorical exacting memory of
dialog: every face she's ever seen; so she
dialog: lives in a big city but to her, it's
text: a small town. Like, a taxi drives
dialog: past and she thinks 'Oh, that's the
dialog: driver who dropped me off at Place
dialog: de Vosges three Christmases ago.'
dialog: And some old lady walking on the
dialog: street, she thinks; 'Oh, she sat two
dialog: seats down from me on the Metro last
dialog: year.' So, everyone she meets,to
text: her feels intimate and connected.
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: Well, I'm just like the first guy.
dialog: Like I feel connected to nothing
dialog: most of the time, man.
text: We see Patrick's grandson, Achilles, and girlfriend, Anna,
text: come walking by, just from the beach. Anna slaps his butt
text: playfully before heading indoors while Achilles joins the
dialog: guys.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Oh, Achilles! Anna! Hey, you guys.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Hey, look at this kid. He's having
dialog: the best summer of us all.
speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: Hello, Pappou.
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: So you were saying... there's three
dialog: characters, right?
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No, it's not just three characters,
dialog: it's a whole group of people. It's
dialog: like, I'm working on a chapter right
dialog: now about a young Greek man named
dialog: Achilles.
speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Well, he's named after you. And
text: this guy is caught in a loop where
text: all he sees is the transient nature
dialog: of everything, right? Like he looks
text: out to sea and thinks of the day
dialog: it's gonna be dry and littered with
dialog: fossils.
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: Well... I dunno. It sounds a little
dialog: pretentious to me.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Ah, no-no-no. It won't be
dialog: pretentious, I promise. No, it's
dialog: gonna be funny. Really funny. He
text: picks up a book and he immediately
dialog: wonders: Who's gonna be the last
dialog: person to read this?
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: And that’s funny?
dialog: All laugh.
speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: Sometimes I kind of think like that.
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: Well, okay, so he doesn't get excited
dialog: about tits, cars, booze, nothing.
text: He just thinks about death.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Well, not so much death, right?
dialog: It's just like transformation, you
dialog: know. Like he's seeing too far into
dialog: the future.
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: Okay.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I like this idea for a novel. But
dialog: you should add a character of an old
dialog: man like me - a poor sap who can't
dialog: remember what he had for breakfast,
text: but he can still hear the song that
dialog: was playing when Sheila Campbell
text: danced topless on the bar at Jury's
dialog: when he was 14 years old.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: That'll work.
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: Okay. You have these people lost in
dialog: time, right ok? But what's the
dialog: connection? Are they going to have
dialog: sex? Don't you need something like
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: It's not time that they're lost in,
dialog: right? It's like perception. That's
dialog: the deal. No, I'm thinking of setting
dialog: the whole novel at a movie. Like,
dialog: every character in some way comes in
dialog: contact with the film 'On the
dialog: Waterfront.'
dialog: (to Achilles)
dialog: Have you seen "On the Waterfront"?
text: He's not sure until Stefanos tells him the Greek title.
speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: Oh, with Brando!
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, yeah. Okay, well, the first
text: chapter of the book is opening
dialog: weekend, Times Square, 1954. That
dialog: old lady, with perpetual deja vu
text: walks into the matinee screening,
dialog: right? Except the whole time she's
dialog: thinking: haven't I already seen
dialog: this?

dialog: Yeah.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Right. And then another chapter is
text: a 1979 Paris film studies class.
dialog: Then we have a Kazan retrospective
dialog: in Munich, 1993.
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: Well, man, that is time. How is
dialog: that not time?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, it's time but, it's more
dialog: perception. You don't like it.
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: I think it's going to be too long.
text: They laugh.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Well, I like it. Don't listen to

text: of rocky beach under Patrick's house.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Not too far, you guys!
text: We catch a nice moment where Jesse is looking out at the
text: sea, and at the kids, soaking it all up. He checks a text
text: and the moment is gone.
scene_heading: EXT. DINNER TABLE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Now in the middle of their dinner, Jesse taps his wine glass
text: and gets everyone's attention.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: All right, I don't want to let this
dialog: meal go by without saying thank you
dialog: to everyone. And especially you,
dialog: Patrick. We had no idea what we
dialog: were getting into these last six
text: weeks. A letter arrives from the
dialog: university, inviting us to the
dialog: Southern Peloponnese of Greece, to
dialog: the guest house of a great writer?
dialog: ‘Sure, why not?' And then at the
text: airport earlier today, Hank turns to
dialog: me and he says this has been the
dialog: greatest summer of his life.
speaker_heading: GROUP
dialog: (Reacting)
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: And I have to say the same. So,
dialog: thank you Patrick, and not just for
dialog: what you have done for me and my
dialog: family but for all the ways you've
dialog: given back, all right. So, to
dialog: Patrick!
speaker_heading: OTHERS
dialog: To Patrick...
text: Glasses clink.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Thank you, thank you, thank you.
dialog: You know, when I first saw you at
dialog: the airport I thought, 'No way a man
dialog: dressed like that could be a man of
dialog: letters.'

speaker_heading: GROUP
dialog: (Laughing)
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: But now, now I think I've learned
dialog: your secret. We've had many great
dialog: writers here over the past decade
dialog: but never one who had a partner more
dialog: interesting than themselves.
speaker_heading: GROUP
dialog: (Reacting)
dialog: Ohh. Oh.
dialog: (Laughing)
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I keep telling you.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: And Celine, it's been so great to
dialog: have you and your daughters' wonderful
dialog: vitality around here, and I'm so
dialog: happy you've been able to meet my
dialog: dear friend, Natalia, who's husband
dialog: Elias was like a brother to me.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: (to Patrick)
dialog: I'm so sorry about the curtains.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Don't worry. It's nothing.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I know. I shouldn't have thrown
dialog: those cherries-
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: No, I mean, really -
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: It was my fault.
speaker_heading: PATRICK/CELINE
dialog: No, no. That's sweet of you.
speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: And Grandpa, thanks for including
dialog: Anna and me this summer... because
dialog: you know he usually puts me to work
dialog: but when I bring Anna he lets me sit
text: at the table of the grown-ups.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Welcome to the grownups table! Hear
dialog: hear!
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: (to Anna)
dialog: How long have you two been together?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Since last summer.
speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: We met one year ago in my last few
dialog: days here with grandpa before I had
dialog: to go back to Athens.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yeah, we met at my closing night
dialog: cast party. I was doing Shakespeare
dialog: at Epidavros...
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: So, who did you play?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I was Perdita in "A Winter's Tale".
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: And she was fantastic! Remember,
dialog: Patrick, we went to that?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Ahhh Perdita... "When you do dance,
dialog: I wish you a wave of the sea, that
dialog: you might ever do nothing but that."
speaker_heading: GROUP
dialog: (Reacting, Applauding)
dialog: Bravo!
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: The way he just performed that was
dialog: much better than the guy at the play!
speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: Actually, people are still talking
dialog: about that production.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yeah but... the after party was even
dialog: better. It's where we met.
speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: I had an old BSA motorcycle.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Nice.
speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: Yeah. We drove around all night.
dialog: And then I had to drive her back to
dialog: the theater to get her stuff. And
dialog: it was dawn.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'll never forget it. It's outdoors
text: and seats 12,000 people, but it was
text: now completely empty.
speaker_heading: ACHILLES
text: Yeah. And she was sitting way up in
dialog: the back row. So, I went up on stage
dialog: and whispered to her...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yeah, the acoustics there are
dialog: incredible. I could see his mouth
text: move and then, three seconds later,
text: I could hear his voice in my ear.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (to Anna, quietly)
dialog: What'd he say?
text: Anna just smiles, not saying.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Woah! Okay!
speaker_heading: ARIADNI
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: That's private.
speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: And then she had to fly back to Paris
dialog: a couple of days later.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: How did you keep in touch?
speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: We Skyped. Pretty much everyday
dialog: since then.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yeah, and when we're apart we have a
dialog: thing of putting our laptops by the
text: pillow and falling asleep together.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Ah, that's the new romance!
speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: And when I wake up the screen is
text: usually frozen... and Anna's face is
dialog: in some funny position like...
dialog: (Mimes )
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: Okay. Can I ask you a question?
dialog: Please?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: When you guys Skype, do you, you
dialog: know, do you go a little crazy?
speaker_heading: ARIADNI
dialog: God, you're being so vulgar!
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: No, I'm not being vulgar. I'm just
dialog: being an amateur anthropologist who
dialog: is interested in virtual words, on a
dialog: theoretical level.
speaker_heading: ARIADNI
dialog: So now you're an anthropologist?
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: Yeah. For instance, the sex of the
dialog: near future, okay, and I'm not making
dialog: this up but, it's gonna be just like
text: plugging in, attaching something to
dialog: your genitals - I'm sorry - and then
dialog: you'll be having virtual intercourse
dialog: with anyone of your choice. You
dialog: will be able to program in all your
dialog: preferences. You'll be able to type
dialog: in exactly what you want Marilyn
dialog: Monroe to whisper in your ear.
speaker_heading: GROUP
dialog: (Reacting)
dialog: Hm..
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Oh, I might like that.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Come on.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: I mean, why not? I mean, more and
dialog: more of our experiences are going to
text: take place in the virtual world.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yeah... And you are a writer, how
dialog: are you going to feel when a computer
dialog: can write a book better than "War
dialog: and Peace"?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: It'll never happen.
speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: I think it's only a question about
dialog: WHEN it's going to happen, grandpa.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You know, I think I'm probably gonna
dialog: feel about the same way as Kasparov -
dialog: you remember how all those chess
dialog: players felt when they could no longer
dialog: compete with that big-ass computer -
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: The Big Blue.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Right, right, right! Remember at
dialog: first nobody thought a computer could
dialog: ever beat our best.
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (Accent)
dialog: A machine lacks that ineffable human
dialog: instinct.
speaker_heading: GROUP
dialog: (Laughing)
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: And now we can't even compete.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I saw this documentary where they
dialog: were doing an experiment on a lab
dialog: rat and he was wired up and he could
text: push a switch and have an orgasm.
speaker_heading: GROUP
dialog: (Laughs)
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: And so scientists were sort of
dialog: laughing at this pathetic little
dialog: creature while it ignored its food
dialog: and water and didn't do anything
dialog: else, and eventually it just died.
dialog: I mean, I think that's the future of
dialog: humanity. You know, just
dialog: (Demonstrates Rat
dialog: Dying)
dialog: .+.. And die.
speaker_heading: GROUP
dialog: (Laughing)
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Well, maybe so but every generation
dialog: believes that they're witnessing the
dialog: end of the world but... I feel that
dialog: I'm actually living it.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Okay. All right, I have a question
dialog: for you Patrick. I think a lot of
dialog: people are feeling that way. You
dialog: know, that we're this kind of pleasure
text: obsessed, porn-addled materialists,
dialog: ceding our humanity to technology...
text: At the same moment that computers
dialog: are becoming sentient, right? So
dialog: what my question is: what is this
dialog: notion of self to begin with?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
text: It's written over the portals to the
dialog: Temple of Apollo at Delphi: It says
dialog: "Gnothi seauton", which means "Know
dialog: Thyself".
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, but we're kind of 99% automated
dialog: already. Our personality - or this
dialog: thing we think of as ourself right -
dialog: it's just a tiny fraction of what
dialog: the brain is doing, right?
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Most of it's just automated body
dialog: function.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Okay.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: So then what is it we're actually
dialog: ceding?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: (Interrupting)
dialog: If this notion of self is such a
dialog: small percentage of you, sweetie...
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: How come I always hear so much about
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: GROUP
dialog: (Laughs)
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: Well, it's just like my penis. I
dialog: mean, it's not that big, it's a small
dialog: part of myself, but it needs a lot
dialog: of attention.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: His too!
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: And how did you two meet?
speaker_heading: ARIADNI
dialog: You don't know?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: Well, you have to read Jesse's books.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah, especially if you want to know
dialog: exactly what it's like to have sex
dialog: with me, read away.
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: Read away!
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Oh, excuse me, Stefanos.
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: No, no. I mean it's well written.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Thank you. We met about 18 years
dialog: ago. We kinda, sort of, fell in
dialog: love a little bit, and then we lost
dialog: track of each other and a decade
dialog: later we ran into each other.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: No, no, no, we didn't run into each
dialog: other, sweetie-pie.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: We didn't?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: No. You wrote a book "inspired" by
dialog: our meeting...
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, yeah...
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: And I read about it and went to look
dialog: for it.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: That's pretty romantic.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: It was really romantic.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Not really. Not really. He neglects
dialog: to mention he was married, had a
dialog: kid...
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Details, details...
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah, that part was a disaster.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: It wasn't a disaster. It was
dialog: inevitable.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah. Okay. And the first time we
dialog: have sex without a condom, twins!
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, one pitch, one homerun. Boom!
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: And I've been chained to the sink
dialog: ever since! I'm sorry to say that,
dialog: but -
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: It's not that bad, is it? The girls
dialog: are so beautiful.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: They're cute.
speaker_heading: GROUP
dialog: (Laughs, Reacts)
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Okay, no no, it has some upsides.
dialog: Let me tell you right now, Anna, how
dialog: to keep a man.
text: Anna nods.
speaker_heading: CELINE (CONT'D)
dialog: You've gotta let them win at all the
dialog: silly little games...
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Oh, okay.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: .+. They like. When I met Jesse,
dialog: the first night we were playing
dialog: pinball, and of course I was
dialog: winning...
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Is the foundation to our entire
dialog: relationship a lie? It is. It is.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: --. And at the last minute I let the
text: ball go down the middle. It builds
dialog: their confidence.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No, she can't beat me at one game,
dialog: not any game.
speaker_heading: CELINE

dialog: Dreams!
speaker_heading: JESSE

speaker_heading: JESSE

speaker_heading: GROUP

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah. Yeah, sure.
speaker_heading: CELINE

speaker_heading: GROUP

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Well, I - you know.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: You know, I can't even write my own
dialog: name sometimes when I'm tired.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What kind of books do you like?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Well, I like stories with a meaning
text: behind them, like a really beautiful
dialog: love story...
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Oh, sure, yeah.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: You know, I read this book once,
dialog: "Romeo and..."
speaker_heading: JESSE

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah!
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Oh, yeah.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Wow, you know it!
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: It's very good, yeah. It's a play
dialog: actually, not a book. A play.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Oh, I thought it was a book based on

speaker_heading: JESSE

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Okay, it was a play. Wow. Well,
dialog: actually I didn't read the whole
dialog: thing because you know, sometimes I
dialog: have to keep up and read those
dialog: Magazines to know exactly what is
dialog: going on in all those people's lives.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Well, that is important.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Okay. Well, you're very, very smart
dialog: and
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: I bet you have a gigantic penis.
speaker_heading: JESSE

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yes, he is - calm down!
speaker_heading: GROUP
dialog: (Reacts)
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: And that's the funny part of it!
dialog: The not-so-funny part of the closet
dialog: macho, okay -- is that today, after
dialog: we drop Henry off, he tells me that
dialog: even though I have an offer for an
dialog: amazing job, he wants me to throw it
dialog: all away and move to Chicago.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: That's not what I said.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I said I missed him. You were

speaker_heading: ARIADNI

dialog: that every woman, the very first
dialog: thing, the first reaction she would

dialog: else. "How are my kids? How's my
dialog: husband? Is anyone else hurt?"
dialog: Every man - with no exception - when

speaker_heading: ARIADNI, ANNA, WOMEN
dialog: (Chanting)
dialog: Penis, penis, penis, penis, penis,
dialog: penis--
speaker_heading: JESSE

dialog: explain it all on strictly gender
dialog: terms, why do you or why does any
dialog: woman waste time getting mad at or
dialog: bother trying to change a man?
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: Exactly. It's all biology. What is

speaker_heading: STEFANOS

speaker_heading: CELINE

speaker_heading: ANNA

speaker_heading: JESSE

speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No. And what about you?
speaker_heading: ACHILLES

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, they could.
speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: (Laughs)
dialog: I mean, I think that if they had
dialog: more money they wouldn't still be
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: ARIADNI
dialog: God, you guys are so practical! I
dialog: was born into the wrong generation.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: My grandmother's mother wrote to our

dialog: from her deathbed. And she spent
dialog: three pages on the costumes she did
dialog: for a play and only one paragraph on
dialog: her husband.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

dialog: (in French)
dialog: How do you say, seamstress?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: (in English)
text: A seamstress. Seamstress.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Seamstress...and she had all these
dialog: wonderful friends. About my great
dialog: grandfather she mentioned three
dialog: events: He went to the war, we moved
dialog: because of his job, and he died.
dialog: Her big advice was not to be too
text: consumed with romantic love.
dialog: Friendships and work, she said,
dialog: brought her the most happiness.
speaker_heading: ARIADNI
dialog: I couldn't agree more. I mean, that's
dialog: the thing that fucks us up, right?
dialog: This idea of a soul mate, of someone
dialog: who will come to complete us and
dialog: save us from having to take care of
dialog: ourselves. With Stefanos, I set the
dialog: bar extremely low - I know he is not
dialog: going to meet any of my needs.
speaker_heading: GROUP
dialog: (Laughing)
speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: Definitely not!
speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: (to Patrick)
dialog: So what about grandma? Was she a
dialog: soul mate?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Well, sounds appealing, but actually
dialog: your grandmother was more rational
dialog: than that. She took care of herself
dialog: and asked me to do the same, with
text: plenty of room to meet in the middle.

speaker_heading: STEFANOS

speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: But at the end of the day, it's not

speaker_heading: STEFANOS
dialog: That's good to know, Patrick, because
dialog: life I can handle, Ariadni, on the

speaker_heading: NATALIA
dialog: Well, when I think of Elias, what I

dialog: he used to lie down next to me at
dialog: night. Sometimes his arm would
dialog: stretch along my chest. I couldn't
dialog: move, I even held my breath, but I
dialog: felt safe... complete. I miss the
text: way he was whistling walking down
dialog: the street. Every time I do
dialog: something, I think of what he would
dialog: say: "Well its cold today, wear a

text: teeth, the texture of his skin, his
dialog: hair - that was all gone by the time
dialog: he went. And sometimes, not always,
dialog: but sometimes I can actually see
text: him. It is as if a cloud moves away
dialog: and there he is. I could almost
text: touch him, but then the real world
text: rushes in, and he vanishes again.
dialog: For a while, I did this every morning,
dialog: when the sun was not too bright
text: outside because the sun somehow makes
text: him vanish. He appears and he
text: disappears like a sunrise or sunset,

dialog: for them to get any recognition before
dialog: then. They struggle for 30 years or
dialog: they raise kids and were stranded at
dialog: home before they could finally do
dialog: what they want. Actually, you know
dialog: what? It's kind of freeing. We

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Well you know, if I'm not there it'll
dialog: be easier for you to fuck your
dialog: cousins.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (Laughs)
dialog: Yes, that's true.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah. Isn't that common where you
dialog: come from? I mean... you didn't
dialog: answer the question.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What question?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Will you be able to put up with me
dialog: for another 56 more years?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I am looking forward to it.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Shit, you're really working it.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (Spanish accent returns)
dialog: Ze nectar of your sex ages like a
dialog: fine wine.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Uh-oh, my hairy Spanish lover is
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Greek. I'm Greek now, for sure.
dialog: Greek, yeah.

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Oh! Look at this! Wow. This place
dialog: sort of reminds me of this film I
dialog: saw when I was a teenager. It was a
text: black and white film from the 50s.
dialog: I remember a couple walking through
text: the ruins of Pompeii, looking at
dialog: bodies that had been lying there for
dialog: centuries. I remember the bodies
text: caught in their sleep, still lovingly
dialog: holding each other. I don't know
dialog: why, sometimes I have this image in
dialog: my mind when, you know, we're asleep
dialog: and you hold me.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What, of being buried alive under
dialog: molten ash, that's what you're
dialog: thinking about?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah!
dialog: (Laughing)
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: That's not very fun.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: Well... I don't know, it's not
dialog: horrible. They had some bodies with
text: little kids sleeping between them...
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Oh, that's nice!
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah! I guess I was young and a bit
dialog: morbid - I mean at that age you
dialog: romanticize the idea of dying with
dialog: the person you love.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Well, you wanna die with me?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Maybe, if it were, you know, our
text: first night together, then, a long
dialog: time ago. But now, no. I'd like to
dialog: live!

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Well, I just wanted you to say
dialog: something romantic and you blew it!
dialog: Putain de merde!
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Oh, no! Putain de merde, I blew it.
dialog: Okay, if we're both 98 you can ask
dialog: me again, but anytime sooner...Ehhnt!
dialog: (Whispers)
dialog: Sorry.
text: They are walking by an old, tiny Chapel.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Hey, this is the chapel I was telling
dialog: you about. It's from the Byzantine
dialog: era, it's like a thousand years old.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Can we go in?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah. I think so. Check this out.
dialog: Hello? Hello.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Oh, wow!
text: They enter.
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - AFTERNOON
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: It's a shrine to Saint Odilia, a
dialog: patron saint to eyesight. People
dialog: come from all over, they leave little
dialog: dedications to the blind, to help
dialog: restore sight.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I'm sure it works.
text: He is looking at the old faded paintings on the walls.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Maybe. These paintings here, they
dialog: make me think of those Japanese monks,
dialog: you know, with their deal on
dialog: impermanence. They like to paint
dialog: with water on rock on a hot day so
dialog: by the time they're done it's already
dialog: evaporated.
text: Celine notices all the icons have been subtly defaced.

speaker_heading: CELINE
text: All the eyes are scratched out. Is
dialog: that about the blindness?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No, I thought that too, but the
dialog: caretaker guy, he told me that the
dialog: Turks did that during the Occupation.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: That's it! I'm never eating Turkish
dialog: food again.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Oh, okay. Well, that'll send a shiver
dialog: through the international community.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Okay fine, then I'll never suck
text: another Turkish cock.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (Laughs)
dialog: Now THAT's gonna have a global impact.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Oh, that's terrible. No, I forgot
dialog: you're a closet Christian. Is it
dialog: really bad to make blow-job jokes in
dialog: a church?
text: Jesse just shrugs.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Kind of is, okay? But we've done
dialog: worse.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: The girls asked me again what our
dialog: wedding was like.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah? What'd you say?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I said it was very low key.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, very low key. So low key I
dialog: don't even remember it.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Very Quaker.

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: We're in a church. You want to get
dialog: married?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: It's just all those fairy tales they
dialog: like so much, you know? Remember
dialog: when they were little, at the end of
dialog: every cartoon they watched, they'd
dialog: be all "Oh they're getting married!"
text: Even if it's Pinocchio and his dad,

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: So if we're going to spend another

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: «+. What about me would you like to
dialog: change?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (Smirks )
dialog: That's another one of your can't-win
dialog: questions. I'm not answering that.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: What do you mean? There's not one
dialog: thing you'd like to change about me?
dialog: I'm perfect?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Okay.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Actually...
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: One thing.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: «+. If I could change one thing about
dialog: you...
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: «+. It would be for you to stop trying
dialog: to change me.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: You're a very skilled manipulator,
dialog: you know that?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Well, I'm onto you. I know how you
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: You think?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah. I know everything about you.
dialog: Here we go. Let's go through here.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I don't think you do, actually.
dialog: (Laughs)
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (Laughs)
dialog: No? Well, I know you better than I
dialog: know anybody else on the planet.
dialog: But... maybe that's not saying much.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I mean right now?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: This is great. You know?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Right. Yeah.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I feel close to you.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: But sometimes, I don't know, I feel
dialog: like you're breathing helium and I'm
dialog: breathing oxygen.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (helium voice)
dialog: What makes you say that? Huh?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: See? I'm trying to truly connect -
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (Helium voice)
dialog: What? Come on, I'm just being
dialog: myself!
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: - And you make a joke! That's exactly
dialog: what I'm talking about!
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Oh, listen, come on, come on. If
dialog: we're ever going to truly know one
dialog: another, I think we'd probably have
dialog: to get to know ourselves better first.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah. Do you remember this friend
dialog: of mine? George, from New York.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Oh, no, that was before. That was
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What was?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: He was this friend of mine that,
dialog: when he found out he had leukemia,
dialog: and he was probably going to die, he
dialog: confessed to me that the first thing
dialog: that came to his mind was relief.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Relief? But why?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Well, before he found out he had
dialog: nine months to live he was always so
dialog: worried about money, and now his
dialog: thought was, great! I have more
dialog: than enough money to live for the
dialog: next nine months, I've made it!
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: Oh, okay.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: And then he was finally able to enjoy
dialog: everything about life, even like
dialog: being stuck in traffic. He would
dialog: just enjoy looking at people...
text: staring at their faces. Just little
dialog: things.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: And then what happened?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Well, like, is he still alive?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: No, he died. A long time ago.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Last night I had this dream where I
text: was reading a book. It was a lost
dialog: classic, "The Rovers".
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: "The Rovers"?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, like roving around, you know,
dialog: wandering? It was all these young
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Okay. Is that a real book?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No, no, no.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: But it was really great.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: It was fresh, funny, experimental,
dialog: it had all this energy...
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I love that you read books in your
dialog: dreams.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I know, and they're always really
dialog: good.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I have major action hero dreams,
dialog: like I'm flying around like a
text: superhero, breaking through walls.
text: And at the end, I have an orgasm.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (Laughs)
dialog: Well, I'm gonna try to make your
dialog: dreams come true, babe.

scene_heading: EXT. CAFE - EVENING

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Still there. Still there. ... Still

speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Mr. Wallace?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: I am such a fan of these two books.
dialog: My husband gave me your book on our
dialog: first date and then when your second
dialog: book came out, we read it out loud
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Oh, wow.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Would you please sign them to us?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, of course, of course.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I love the art work on these Greek

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: "Ekini ti Fora."
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: But I'm not sure it's a great one.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Well, that's because you never read
dialog: it in English, right?
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Exactly. ... That's great. Could
dialog: you sign them too?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Yes. You're the real Madeline, right?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Madeline? Not really. People assume
dialog: it's me but it's - it's not me at
dialog: all. He's got a big imagination.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Would you be so kind? It would mean
dialog: so much to my husband.
text: The book is passed to Celine.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I can't sign a book I didn't write.

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: They are so nice, we have to get

speaker_heading: JESSE

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: What?

dialog: (Whispering)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: (touches his chin)
dialog: It's funny. I never noticed until
dialog: today but... all the red in your
text: beard is gone. It used to be one of
dialog: the things that made me fall for
dialog: you, it's crazy.
speaker_heading: JESSE
text: Well, it's not gone, it's just white.
dialog: You're not gonna tell me that your
dialog: love is dependent on pigment, are
dialog: you? No?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: No, but you know, I see the red in
text: our girls' eyelashes. I look at
dialog: them and it makes me think of when
dialog: we met.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You know what I'm looking forward

speaker_heading: CELINE

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Is waking up next to you alone.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: You mean without Nina and Ella jumping

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Exactly. I haven't heard you think
dialog: in years now.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Think?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I used to wake up to that sound of
dialog: your eyes opening and closing, and
dialog: that brain of yours going two million
dialog: miles an hour. I miss it, hearing
dialog: you think.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: When you said you could hear me think,
dialog: I really thought you could. But it
dialog: was just my eyelids. How dumb and
dialog: romantic of me.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: It's my favorite thing.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I miss thinking, too. No more

dialog: ignored.
speaker_heading: CELINE (CONT'D)
dialog: He's fine. He says he'll call you

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Why can't I talk to him? That's
dialog: twice you've done that. C'mon, you
dialog: could have just handed me the phone.
dialog: You know I want to talk to him.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Well, he didn't have time to talk -

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You shouldn't have said that about

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: What? What did I say?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: "Good luck with your mom."
dialog: (Laughs)
dialog: I mean, come on -
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I didn't mean anything by it.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I know, but it's not good. It just
dialog: reminds him of the whole thing. I
dialog: just wish you wouldn't do that...
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Oh, like you think he forgets?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: That's so American to just sweep it
text: under the carpet and act as if it
dialog: didn't happen.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Why put it into his head? You know?
dialog: What if he doesn't want to be thinking
dialog: about that right now? He's too
dialog: stressed.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: It means nothing.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: It means something. It does.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Alright, I even made a joke the other
dialog: day that his mom and I should try to
dialog: settle it in one big mud wrestling
dialog: contest.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Mud wrestling? You said that?
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: And he laughed. He might have more
dialog: of a sense of humor than you do.
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: We just talked about that. When you
dialog: say bad things about his mom, what
text: he hears is bad things about himself.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Well, I didn't say anything bad about
dialog: his mom. I made a joke; it's as
dialog: much on me as it is on her.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Well you're right. I know, I know,
dialog: I know. Just why conjure it up at
dialog: all, you know?
text: Jesse gets up out of bed and goes across the room, goes to
text: Celine's purse and turns off her phone.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I think he's old enough now. I mean,
dialog: he knows how bad it is between his
dialog: mother and I.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: His mom and me.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: And I didn't do anything, it's all
dialog: coming from her towards me. Okay,
dialog: she hates me; yes, I fucked her
dialog: husband a long time ago. Or should
dialog: I say, he fucked me?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, right!
speaker_heading: CELINE
text: Making a joke about the fact that
dialog: his mom and I don't love each other
dialog: is not the issue. That's not going
dialog: to traumatize him. That already
dialog: happened, alright, and now you're
dialog: trying to transfer your guilt and
dialog: blame me?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No, I'm not.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: You know, on the contrary, if he can
dialog: make a joke about it, maybe he'll be
dialog: able to live with it better. That's
dialog: what I think.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Okay. You're right. As always.
dialog: Let's just not talk about it, okay?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: It's nobody's fault if his mom is a
text: drunk and abusive psychologically.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Don't say that!
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I mean, it makes me sick that he has
dialog: to be with her, but I guess judges
dialog: assume that women have the mother
dialog: instinct. She has the mother instinct
dialog: of Medea!
text: Jesse goes to the bathroom and washes off his face.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Medea, huh?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah, after all, it is a Greek myth.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: It's actually a play by Euripides,
dialog: but -
speaker_heading: CELINE
text: A woman killing her kids to punish
dialog: her ex-husband? That's basically
dialog: what she's doing, she's hurting him
dialog: to get to you.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No, she's making my life hell through
dialog: him, that's what she's doing. You
dialog: know, sometimes, you say things that

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Okay, stop blaming me for everything

dialog: multiple. If that's what you see
dialog: when you're watching the girls play,
dialog: that means you're depressed.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Okay. Maybe I am.
text: Celine is slowly getting revved up again.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: When I see them fight, I see beautiful
dialog: energy of going forward in life and
dialog: not letting anyone step on them or
dialog: take away what they want. I like it
dialog: when they fight - it gives me hope
dialog: for them.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Well that's because you see anger as
dialog: a positive emotion, you know, and
dialog: you only end up hurting yourself,
dialog: your work, your kids, me.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: And you never get angry?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: When I do, I don't see it as a
dialog: positive.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: You know something? The way you
dialog: write in your book, people come up
dialog: to me and think I make love to some
dialog: wildcat Henry Miller type... HA!
dialog: You like to have sex the EXACT same
dialog: way every time.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: When you got it, you got it.

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I'm a man of simple pleasures.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah, very simple, and I've been
dialog: meaning to tell you that lately.
dialog: You're no Henry Miller, on any level.
dialog: You know what, this room gives me
dialog: the creeps, I was expecting something
dialog: quaint, like the real Greece.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: This place is pretty real.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: What the hell are we doing here
dialog: anyway? This is all too planned,
dialog: like we're supposed to have this
dialog: great evening. There's no room for
dialog: spontaneity, it is all gone from our
dialog: lives. It's stupid and it's not
dialog: working...
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Okay. Well, obviously, right?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Right, yeah ... and I curse Ariadni
dialog: and that perv Stefanos for doing
dialog: this. A couples massage - what the
dialog: fuck is that? That sounds sleazy to
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: We don't have to do it! Okay? C'mon,
dialog: this place isn't so bad. I like
dialog: hotel rooms... I think they're sexy.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah, I know you do, Mr. Book Tour.
dialog: Mr. Radisson Hilton. And I know
dialog: that time when you were doing that
dialog: reading in Washington, when your
dialog: cell phone supposedly broke that
dialog: night - how convenient. Swear on
dialog: our kids that you didn't fuck that
text: lady from the bookstore. Emily.
dialog: Swear to me you didn't fuck that
dialog: Emily girl. And I'm not jealous
dialog: because I'm not the jealous type but
dialog: I just wanna know, be a man and admit
dialog: the truth.

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I am giving you my whole life, okay?
dialog: I've got nothing larger to give.
dialog: I'm not giving it to anybody else.
dialog: If you're looking for permission to
dialog: disqualify me, I'm not going to give
dialog: it to you. I love you and I'm NOT
dialog: in conflict about it. But if what
dialog: you want is a laundry list of all
dialog: the things about you that piss me
dialog: off, I could give it to you.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah - I want to hear.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Okay! Well, uh, let's start at number
dialog: one - okay, number one, you're fuckin'
dialog: nuts, alright? You are, good luck
dialog: finding somebody else to put with
dialog: your shit for more than like 6 months.
dialog: But I accept the whole package, the
dialog: crazy and the brilliant. I know
dialog: you're not going to change, and I
dialog: don't want you to. It's called
dialog: accepting you for being you.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah okay, I asked you a question.
dialog: If, while I was carrying the double
text: stroller down the stairs and getting
dialog: ass-raped in Pigalle, you fucked
dialog: that little Emily Bronte girl?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Ok I don't know. Emily... what Emily?
dialog: What are you even talking about?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: The one who wrote the nice emails
dialog: about Dostoevsky? "Oh Jesse, you're
dialog: so right, "The Grand Commander" is
dialog: the deepest passage of all Russian
dialog: literature."
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: If you're asking me if I'm committed
dialog: to you, the girls, and the life we've
dialog: built together, the answer is a
text: resounding YES.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: So you DID fuck her! Thank you very
dialog: much.

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Do I ever ask you about the time you
dialog: went to go visit your old boyfriend
dialog: after his mother died? No. You
dialog: want to know why? Because I KNOW
dialog: the way that your fucking French ass
dialog: works, and I guarantee that you at
dialog: least blew that guy, but I also know
dialog: that you love me, okay? I'm okay
dialog: with you being a complicated human
dialog: being! I don't wanna live a boring
dialog: life where two people own each other,
dialog: where two people are institutionalized
dialog: in a box that others created - because
dialog: that is a bunch of stifling bullshit.
text: Petrified, she exits.
text: Jesse sits alone waiting for her to return.
text: Enter Celine. She walks in, sets her room key down.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: You know what's going on here? It's
dialog: simple - I don't think I love you
dialog: anymore.
text: She exits. Jesse sits there, gazing from the cold cup of
text: tea, to the door, to the full glasses of wine, to the rumpled,
text: empty bed. Celine doesn't come back.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTDOOR CAFE/BAR - NIGHT
text: Jesse finds Celine sitting near the same table where they
dialog: saw the sunset earlier.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Miss?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I don't want to talk right now.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Are you by yourself? Are you waiting
dialog: for somebody?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah, I'm by myself and happy to be.
dialog: I'm an angry person and I hurt my
dialog: kids, my work, and everyone I love.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Oh. Well, just my type.
text: Jesse sits down right across from her.

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Okay, I'm not in the mood - I came
dialog: here to be alone.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, listen. I've just been checking
dialog: you out from across the cafe and I
dialog: don't want to make you uncomfortable,
dialog: but you're by far the best looking
dialog: woman in this place.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Thank you very much.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I'd love to buy you a drink, maybe
dialog: talk to you, get to know you a little
dialog: bit... you know. Are you here on
dialog: business?
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ok.. You have a boyfriend?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Not anymore.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Sorry to hear that. God, you want
dialog: to talk about it?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I don't talk to strangers.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: But that's the thing, I'm not a
dialog: stranger. No, we've met before...
dialog: summer '94.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: You are mistaking me for someone
dialog: else.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No, we even fell in love.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Really? I vaguely remember someone
dialog: sweet and romantic, who made me feel
dialog: I wasn't alone anymore. Someone who
dialog: had respect for who I was.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: That's me. I'm that guy.

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Well, see, I know something about
dialog: tonight that you don't know.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Really. What is that?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Something important. See, I know
dialog: because I've actually already lived
dialog: through this night.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I'm a time traveler.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: JESSE
text: I have a time machine up in my room.
dialog: I've come to save you just like I
dialog: said I would.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Save me from what?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Save you from being blinded by all
dialog: the little bullshit of life.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: It's not bullshit.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I assure you, that guy you vaguely
dialog: remember, the sweet romantic one who
dialog: you met on a train? That is me.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: That's you?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CELINE

dialog: look like shit.

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What can I say? I mean, it's tough
dialog: out there in time and space. You,
dialog: on the other hand are even more
dialog: beautiful than I remember.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Bullshit! Jesse, this is not a game.
dialog: You get all cute, you get in my
dialog: panties and the next thing I know,
dialog: I'm buying peanut butter in Chicago.
dialog: You're not going to make it better
text: by some little pick up line.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I'm not trying to pick you up - no,
dialog: no, you misunderstood me. I'm only
dialog: here as a messenger. I've just
dialog: traveled all the way from the future.
dialog: I was just with your 82 year old
dialog: self who gave me a letter to read to
dialog: you. So here I am.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I'm still alive in my 80's?
speaker_heading: JESSE
text: OOOHHHH YEAH.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: How's my French ass?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Nice. Really nice.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: I don't care about the way I look.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Let's just say, there's even more of
dialog: you to love. Okay, do you want me
dialog: to read the letter to you?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Do I have a choice?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Oh sure, I mean, if you're not
dialog: interested in what you have to say...
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: No, no, no. Read it.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Okay, here I go. Dear Celine, I'm
dialog: writing to you from the other side
dialog: of the woods. This letter is lighting
dialog: a candle...
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Okay stop it. I would never write
dialog: this - it's too flowery, "Other side
dialog: of the woods," what fucking woods?
dialog: What're you talking about?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: May I please continue?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I am sending you this young man.
dialog: Yes, young - and he will be your
dialog: escort. God knows, he has many
dialog: problems and has struggled his whole
dialog: life connecting and being present
dialog: even with those he loves the most.
dialog: And for that he is deeply sorry -
dialog: but you are his only hope. Celine,
dialog: my advice to you is this: you are
dialog: entering the best years of your life.
text: Looking back from where I sit now
dialog: these middle years are only a little
dialog: bit more difficult then when you
dialog: were 12 and Mathieu and Vanessa danced
dialog: all night to the Bee Gee's "How deep
dialog: is your love." Celine, you will be
dialog: fine. Your girls will grow up to
dialog: become examples and icons of feminism.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Nice one.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, well, you know what I just
dialog: noticed, there's a Post Script at
dialog: the bottom, looks kind of important.
dialog: Maybe I should just skip over the
dialog: rest of this boring stuff and get to
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah, skip away. Please, skip away.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Okay. You sure?

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Okay, all right, well.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: The boring stuff.
text: Jesse scoots his chair closer to her.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah. Okay.
dialog: (looks around, lowers
dialog: his voice)
dialog: Yeah, it's like financial tips,
dialog: horoscopes, boring stuff. Okay, here
dialog: it is... P.S. By the way, the best
dialog: sex of my life happened one night in
dialog: the Southern Peloponnese. Don't
dialog: miss it. My whole sexual being went
text: to a new, ground-breaking level.
speaker_heading: CELINE
text: Ground-breaking. Great.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah, I don't know what that means.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Okay, Jesse, can you stop this stupid
dialog: game? We're not in one of your
dialog: stories. Okay? Did you hear what I
dialog: said to you back in the room? Did
dialog: you hear me?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yes, I heard you - that you don't
dialog: love me anymore. I figured you didn't
dialog: mean it but if you did, then fuck
dialog: it. You know something? You're
dialog: just like the little girls and
dialog: everybody else - you want to live in
dialog: some fairy tale. I'm just trying to
dialog: make things better here. I tell you
dialog: I love you unconditionally, I tell
dialog: you that you're beautiful, I tell
dialog: you that your ass looks great when
dialog: you're 80. I'm trying to make you
dialog: laugh. I put up with plenty of your
dialog: shit, and if you think I'm just some
dialog: dog who's gonna keep coming back
dialog: then, you're wrong. But if you want
dialog: true love - this is it.

speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: So what about this time machine?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: CELINE

dialog: letter. You mention something about
dialog: the southern Peloponesse? We're in
dialog: the southern Peloponesse.
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Do you think it could be tonight
dialog: that you're still talking about in
dialog: your 80s?
speaker_heading: CELINE
dialog: Well, it must have been one hell of
