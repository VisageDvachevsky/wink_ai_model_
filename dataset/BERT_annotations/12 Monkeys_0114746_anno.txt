scene_heading: INT. CONCOURSE/AIRPORT TERMINAL - BAY
text: CLOSE ON A FACE. A nine year old boy, YOUNG COLE, his eyes wide
text: with wonder. watching something intently. We HEAR the sounds of
text: the P.A. SYSTEM droning Flight Information mingled with the
text: sounds of urgent SHOUTS, running FEET, EXCLAMATIONS.
text: YOUNG COLE'S POV: twenty yards away, a BLONDE MAN is sprawled on
text: the floor, blood oozing from his gaudy Hawaiian shirt.
text: A BRUNETTE in a tight dress, her face obscured from YOUNG COLE'S
text: view, rushes to the injured man, kneels beside him, ministering
dialog: to his wound.
text: ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, flanked by his PARENTS, their faces out of
text: view, as they steer him away.
speaker_heading: FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Come on, Son --this is no place for us.
text: YOUNG COLE resists momentarily, mesmerized by the drama.
text: YOUNG COLE'S POV: intermittently visible through a confusion of
text: FIGURES rushing through the foreground, the BLONDE MAN reaching
text: up and touching the cheek of the kneeling BRUNETTE in a gesture
text: of enormous tenderness, a gesture of farewell, while the P.A.
text: SYSTEM continues its monotonous monotone...
speaker_heading: P.A. SYSTEM
dialog: Flight 784 for San Francisco is now
dialog: ready for boarding at inmate number
dialog: 66578, Greely.
scene_heading: INT. PRISON DORMITORY/FUTURE - ETERNAL NIGHT
speaker_heading: PRISON P.A. SYSTEM
dialog: --number 5429, Garcia -- number 87645, Cole...
text: COLE, late thirties, dark hair, comes awake in a bunk cage, one
text: of many stacked four high along both sides of a long dim
text: corridor. He blinks in the near dark, shaken, disoriented.
text: Then, as he "recovers" from his very vivid dream, WE GET OUR
text: FIRST LOOK AT HIS ENVIRONMENT...A WINDOWLESS UNDERGROUND WORLD OF
scene_heading: ETERNAL NIGHT SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE...AN ALMOST COLORLESS
text: "REALITY" OF BLURRED EDGES AND ECHOEY SOUNDS, MUCH MORE
text: "DREAMLIKE" THAN HIS DREAM.
text: Flashlights glare. In the half-light, COLE sees spooky figures,
text: GUARDS, moving among the locked bunk/cages.
text: COLE turns and whispers to the occupant of the next cage, JOSE...
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Ssssst! Jose, what's going on?
text: JOSE's face is almost lost in shadow. What there is of it is
dialog: youthful. He's just a scared Puerto Rican kid!
speaker_heading: JOSE
dialog: "Volunteers" again.
text: JOSE immediately rolls over and feigns sleep as SCARFACE, a
text: menacing guard with a jagged scar running down his cheek, looms
text: close to COLE's cage and unlocks it.
speaker_heading: SCARFACE
dialog: "Volunteer duty".
text: The PRISONERS in the other cages watch silently with narrowed eyes.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I didn't volunteer.
speaker_heading: SCARFACE
dialog: You causing trouble again?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (controls his temper)
dialog: No trouble.
scene_heading: INT. EQUIPMENT ROOM - ETERNAL NIGHT
text: COLE's alone, struggling to get into what looks like a space suit
text: in a room where suits hang like ghosts with blank eyes.
text: TITLES BEGIN SUPERED OVER THE SCENE
text: COLE has the torso of the suit on now and is trying to close it.
speaker_heading: OFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: All openings must be closed.
text: COLE looks for the source of the voice, a tiny grate in the wall.
speaker_heading: OFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: If the integrity of the suit is compromised
dialog: in any way, if the fabric is torn or a zipper
dialog: not closed, readmittance will be denied.
scene_heading: INT. SEALED CHAMBER - MINUTES LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)
text: COLE, wearing the "space suit" and a helmet with a plastic visor,
text: steps into a tiny chamber, a kind of air lock. The heavy door
text: clangs shut behind him. He's alone. COLE'S breath comes quicker
text: now as he sucks oxygen from the air tanks on his back.
text: On the opposite wall is another door with a huge wheel lock.
text: COLE turns the heavy wheel, opens the door, steps through It
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - SECONDS LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)
text: COLE'S in an ascending elevator that groans and creaks. He looks
text: down at a crudely drawn map he holds in his gloved hand.
text: The map shows a series of tunnels and ladders.
scene_heading: INT. SEWER PIPE - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)
text: COLE pans a flashlight, probing the filthy sewer he's wading through
text: RATS flee the blade of light, scurry across islands of rusting junk.
text: The flashlight beam settles on a ladder mounted in the wall.
text: Reaching the rusted ladder, COLE starts to climb awkwardly.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET/FUTURE - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)
text: A SCRAPING NOISE as a heavy man-hole cover is pushed up and moved
text: aside. COLE'S helmeted head emerges from below.
scene_heading: COLE'S POV THROUGH HIS PLASTIC-VISORED HELMET: a city in
text: moonlight! A surreal image of abandoned buildings. No people
text: anywhere. The only sounds are the WIND and COLE'S BREATHING.
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER CITY STREET - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)
text: COLE'S light reveals abandoned vine-covered automobiles.
dialog: 
text: Moving to the nearest car, COLE searches in the vines for
text: something. Finds it. An insect.
text: COLE takes the bug in his gloved hand. As he clumsily inserts it
text: into a collection tube, something makes him turn.
text: There's something across the street in the dark. Something alive.
text: COLE points his flashlight and reveals...a BEAR! Startled by the
text: light, the animal blinks, then stands on its rear legs and ROARS.
text: ANGLE ON COLE, staring wide-eyed.
dialog: 
text: Then, the BEAR sinks down onto all fours and, trying to avoid the
text: flashlight, it pads quickly down the street.
scene_heading: INT. SUBTERRANEAN PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT
text: Using the flashlight to see, COLE reaches down to the cracked
text: floor and gets another specimen. DOGSHIT!
text: The only sound is COLE'S labored BREATHING.
text: Then, a different SOUND. GRRRR! A dog. More GRRRRS. More
text: dogs. Then, a YIP. Then, VICIOUS GROWLS. It's a DOGFIGHT!
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)
text: A giant OWL, perched on an overhead traffic light, raises its wings
text: and lifts off...rising higher and higher into the brightening sky.
text: Below, on the street, COLE trudges along, passing deserted
text: buildings, windows broken, rusted signs dangling.
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)
text: COLE'S light reveals a spider web just inside the store. A large
text: SPIDER tries to hide from the light.
text: COLE reaches carefully into the web and plucks the spider and
text: puts it into one of his specimen tubes.
text: Then, he shines his light all around the once elegant store. There's
text: nothing but aisle after aisle of moldering consumer goods.
scene_heading: EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAWN
text: As COLE comes out of the store, the first rays of the sun hit the
text: building. COLE stops, squints into the light through his visor.
text: COLE'S POV: spray-painted on the wall a long time ago is a stenciled
text: logo of twelve monkeys holding hands in a circle. Over it is
dialog: written, "WE DID IT!"
text: COLE looks up.
text: COLE'S POV: high up on a building across the street, a LION
text: patrols a ledge, pauses, looks out majestically over his world.
speaker_heading: TTTLES END
scene_heading: INT. FIRST UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT
text: ROARING WATER, powerful torrents gushing from nozzles in the
text: wall, pummel the still-suited COLE.
scene_heading: INT. SECOND UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT
text: Stark naked and shivering, COLE is being scrubbed with brushes on
text: long poles (like the ones used to wash cars) wielded by two HULKING
text: FIGURES in bulky decontamination suits, their personas lost in their
text: windowed masks. It's a grim scene in a grim cement room with damp,
text: dripping walls. From an unseen source comes an AMPLIFIED VOICE,
speaker_heading: AMPLIFIED VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Raise your arms above your head.
text: COLE lifts his arms and the FIGURES start scrubbing his armpits.
scene_heading: INT. TINY CHAMBER - SHORTLY (ETERNAL NIGHT)
text: Still naked, COLE is seated on a stool while a MASKED TECHNICIAN
text: in a less elaborate, less bulky decontamination outfit draws
text: blood from COLE'S arm with an old-fashioned hypodermic needle.
text: COLE glances toward a single, nearly opaque "window" of thick
text: plastic in the rusty iron wall. VAGUE FIGURES seem to lurk
text: behind the translucent aperture, studying him.
text: The TECHNICIAN slips the blood sample through a slot in the wall.
scene_heading: INT. ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - ETERNAL NIGHT
text: Ushered in by two guards, TINY and SCARFACE, COLE looks around.
text: COLE'S POV: wails hidden by old headlines, articles, maps, charts...
text: a blackboard covered with elaborate, sophisticated formulae...surfaces
text: heaped with cracked monitors, gerry-rigged computers held together with
text: string, lasers lost in tangles of cable, ancient tube amplifiers, a
text: dilapidated cardboard reconstruction of a city, stacks of moldering
text: books and tattered computer printouts...and, seated at a long conference
text: table, staring at COLE, six SCIENTISTS: an ASTROPHYSICIST, ENGINEER,
text: BOTANIST, MICROBIOLOGIST, ZOOLOGIST, and a GEOLOGIST. They represent
dialog: a "modern" science where brilliant new ideas interface with crude,
text: outdated, patched-together technologies.
speaker_heading: TINY
text: James Cole. Cleared from quarantine.
speaker_heading: MICROBIOLOGIST
dialog: Thank you. You two wait outside.
speaker_heading: SCARFACE
dialog: He's got a history, Doctor. Violence.
text: COLE'S eyes return to the walls.
text: Headlines: "CLOCK TICKING! NO CURE YET!"
speaker_heading: SCARFACE
dialog: Anti-social six -- doing 25 to life.
speaker_heading: ENGINEER
dialog: I don't think he's going to hurt us. You're
dialog: not going to hurt us, are you Mr. Cole?
text: COLE'S head turns quickly to the ENGINEER.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: No, sir.
text: The GUARDS exchange a look, shrug, exit, closing the door.
speaker_heading: MICROBIOLOGIST
dialog: Why don't you sit down, Mr. Cole.
text: COLE goes to the empty chair at the conference table, sits down.
speaker_heading: ASTROPHYSICIST
dialog: We want you to tell us about last
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I went to the surface and I collected
dialog: specimens like I was told.
text: The SCIENTISTS don't say anything. They just study him carefully.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (worried)
dialog: I mashed the spider, didn't I?
speaker_heading: MICROBIOLOGIST
dialog: We'll get to the spider later, Mr.
dialog: Cole. Right now, we want to know
dialog: everything that you saw.
scene_heading: INT. ENGINEERING OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)
text: COLE, starting to look very tired now, stands at the blackboard
text: sketching a detailed map of exactly where he was last night.
speaker_heading: ASTPOPHYSICIST
dialog: Where you collected sample #4, what
dialog: street was that?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Uh...
speaker_heading: BOTANIST
dialog: It's important to observe everything.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.
text: As the SCIENTISTS start to whisper animatedly among themselves,
text: COLE'S eyes drift across the newspaper clippings taped to the
text: wall. One headline screams, "VIRUS MUTATING!" Another features
dialog: a photo of an OLD MAN (DR. MASON, who we'll see again later on)
text: and the words, SCIENTIST SAYS, "IT'S TOO LATE FOR CURE".
speaker_heading: ASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Close your eyes, Cole.
text: Startled, COLE closes his eyes obediently.
text: BLACKNESS. Like COLE, WE SEE NOTHING. But we HEAR their VOICES.
speaker_heading: ENGINEER'S VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Tell us in detail what you've seen in
dialog: this room.
speaker_heading: COLE'S VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Uh, in this room? Uh...
speaker_heading: MICROBIOLOGIST'S VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: How many of us are there?
speaker_heading: COLE'S VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Six...seven, if you count me.
speaker_heading: ASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Tell us about the pictures on the wall...
speaker_heading: COLE'S VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Uh, you mean the newspapers?
scene_heading: A MONTAGE OF OVERLAPPING VOICES (o.s.)
dialog: Tell us about the newspapers. Can you
dialog: hear my voice? What do I look like?
dialog: What does he look like, the man who
dialog: just spoke? How old were you when you
dialog: left the surface?
text: The VOICES blur into a cacophony and FADE INTO the droning P.A.
text: SYSTEM at the airport.
scene_heading: INT. CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY
text: THE DREAM AGAIN! But at an earlier moment. YOUNG COLE, flanked
text: by his PARENTS, whose faces are out of view, is watching a PLANE
text: land through one of the big glass windows that lines the concourse
text: leading to the departure gates.
speaker_heading: P.A. SYSTEM (o.s.)
text: Flight 784 now boarding at gate...
text: Suddenly, a SHOUT, followed by raised VOICES, interrupts the
text: monotonous airport routine. As YOUNG COLE and his PARENTS turn
dialog: to see what's going on, a man we'll call MR. PONYTAIL, his face
text: averted, hurries past them, bumping YOUNG COLE with a Chicago
dialog: Hulls Sports Duffle Bag.
speaker_heading: MR. PONYTAIL
speaker_heading: WATCH IT!
text: YOUNG COLE sees little more than the gaudy pants, the duffle, and
text: the man's ponytail flopping as he rushes towards the gates.
text: Just then, a WOMAN'S VOICE cries out, "NOOOOOOOOO!"
text: YOUNG COLE turns back toward the Security Check Point just as
text: TRAVELERS scatter madly, some diving to the floor, others
text: running. A TERRIFIED TRAVELER, hitting the floor close by, looks
text: up at YOUNG COLE with panicky eyes, and asks....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERRIFIED TRAVELER
dialog: Just exactly why did you volunteer?
scene_heading: INT. ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - (ETERNAL NIGHT)
text: COLE comes abruptly awake. Seated now, he's facing the SCIENTISTS.
speaker_heading: ASTROPHYSICIST
dialog: Wake up, Cole.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Uh, I didn't hear the...
speaker_heading: MICROBIOLOGIST
dialog: (tapping a pencil on the table)
dialog: I asked you, why did you volunteer?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Well, the guard woke me up. He told me
dialog: I volunteered.
text: The SCIENTISTS react, whispering urgently among themselves.
text: COLE starts to nod off again, then comes awake with a start as
text: the ENGINEER speaks to him.
speaker_heading: ENGINEER
dialog: We appreciate you volunteering. You're
dialog: a very good observer, Cole.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Uh, thank you.
speaker_heading: ENGINEER
dialog: You'll get a reduction in sentence.
text: COLE keeps his face impassive.
speaker_heading: ASTROPHYSICIST
dialog: To be determined by the proper authorities.
speaker_heading: ENGINEER
dialog: You don't want to jeopardize that reduction,
dialog: do you, Cole? Have it taken away?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: No, sir!
speaker_heading: ASTROPHYSICIST
dialog: We have a very advanced program, something
dialog: very different, requires very skilled people.
speaker_heading: MICROBIOLOGIST
dialog: An opportunity to reduce your sentence
dialog: considerably...
speaker_heading: ZOOLOGIST
dialog: And possibly play an important role in
dialog: returning the human race to the surface
dialog: of the earth.
speaker_heading: ENGINEER
dialog: We want tough minded people. Strong
dialog: mentally. We've had some...misfortunes
dialog: with "unstable" types.
speaker_heading: ASTROPHYSICIST
dialog: For a man in your position...an opportunity.
speaker_heading: BOTANIST
dialog: Not to volunteer could be a real mistake.
speaker_heading: MICROBIOLOGIST
dialog: (tapping his pencil again)
dialog: Definitely a mistake!
text: COLE gives away nothing. He's in a box here. He has no choices.
text: He stares at the tapping pencil.
scene_heading: INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT
text: A strikingly "real" world of bright colors. Extravagant paintings
text: adorn the walls. A POET, tiny and ruddy faced, squints over his
text: glasses as he reads in a booming voice to an AUDIENCE of thirty
text: seated on folding chairs.
speaker_heading: POET
dialog: Still among the myriad microwaves, the
dialog: infra-red messages, the gigabytes of ones
dialog: and zeroes, we find words, infinitesimally
text: small, byte-sized now, tinier even than
dialog: science lurking in some vague electricity
dialog: where, if we listen we can hear the solitary
dialog: voice of that poet telling us,
dialog: "We are no other than a moving row
dialog: Of Magic shadow-shapes that come and go
text: Round with the Sun-illumined Lantern hold
dialog: In Midnight by the Master of the show."
text: As the POET reads, we STUDY the audience, mostly YUPPIE CULTURE
text: JUNKIES or BOHEMIANS. Among them, a light-haired woman of twenty-
text: eight, soberly dressed, wearing glasses. She's KATHRYN RAILLY. And
text: it's her beeper that suddenly BEEPS. BEEP! BEEP!
speaker_heading: POET'S VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: "The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,
dialog: Moves on: nor all your Piety nor Wit
dialog: Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,
dialog: Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it."
text: BEEP! BEEP! Scowling at the outrageous interruption, the POET
text: looks up from the text just as RAILLY, tumbling, shuts off the
text: beeper and rises, embarrassed. As she makes her way to an exit,
text: the glaring POET continues...
speaker_heading: POET
dialog: "Yesterday This Day's Madness did prepare;
dialog: Tomorrow's Silence, Triumph or Despair:
dialog: Drink! for you know not whence you came, nor why:
dialog: Drink! for you know not why you go, nor where."
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR/POLICE STATION - NIGHT
text: DETECTIVE FRANKI leads RAILLY past crowded holding cells.
speaker_heading: FRANKI
dialog: -- so they get there and they ask the guy
dialog: real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets
text: agitated, starts screaming about viruses.
text: Totally irrational, totally disoriented,
dialog: doesn't know where he is, what day it is,
dialog: alla that stuff. All they got was his
dialog: name. They figure he's stoned out of
dialog: his mind, it's some kinda psychotic
dialog: episode, so they're gonna bring him...
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: He's been tested for drugs?
speaker_heading: FRANKI
dialog: Negative for drugs. But he took on
text: five cops like he was dusted to the
dialog: eyeballs. No drugs. You believe that?
text: FRANKI pauses, indicating a tiny observation window of thick meshed
text: glass in an otherwise solid door, and RAILLY looks through it.
text: RAILLY'S POV THROUGH THE WINDOW: a MAN, his back to her, in
text: strait-jacket and prison denims, examining the wall of the padded
text: cell with the distorted intensity of a "mental case".
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: You have him in restraints.
speaker_heading: FRANKI
dialog: Were you listening? We got two officers in
dialog: the hospital. Yeah, he's in restraints, plus
dialog: the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill
text: a horse. Look at him! Still on his feet.
text: RAILLY'S POV THROUGH THE WINDOW: the MAN in the cell turns, looks
text: right at her. In spite of the cuts and welts, it's clearly COLE.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: That would explain the bruises, I
dialog: guess. The struggle.
speaker_heading: FRANKI
dialog: You want to go in? Examine him?
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Yes, please. You said he gave a name...
speaker_heading: FRANKI
dialog: (unlocking the door)
dialog: James Cole. That's everything we got. None
text: of the James Coles on the computer match him.
dialog: No license, no prints, no warrants. Nothing.
dialog: You want me to go in with you?
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: (entering)
dialog: No, thank you.
speaker_heading: FRANKI
dialog: I'll be right here...just in case.
scene_heading: INT. ISOLATION CELL
text: COLE stares at RAILLY. The environment is intensely real...vivid
text: colors...each sound, however slight, very distinct, almost loud...
text: and yet she appears to him almost like a vision.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Mr. Cole? My name is Doctor Railly.
dialog: I'm a psychiatrist. I work for the
dialog: County -- I don't work for the police.
dialog: My only concern is your well being --
dialog: do you understand that?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I need to go now.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: I'm going to be completely honest. I'm
dialog: not going to lie to you. I can't make
dialog: the police let you go...but I do want
dialog: to help you. And I want you to trust
dialog: me. Can you do that, James? May I
dialog: call you "James"?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: "James"! Nobody ever calls me that.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: (frowns, studies him)
dialog: Have you been a patient at County?
dialog: Have I seen you someplace?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: No, not possible. Listen, I have to
dialog: get out of here. I'm supposed to be
dialog: getting information.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: What kind of information?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: It won't help you. You can't do anything
dialog: about it. You can't change anything.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Change what?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I need to go.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Do you know why you're here, James.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Because I'm a good observer. Because I
dialog: have a tough mind.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: I see. You don't remember assaulting a
dialog: police officer...several officers?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: They wanted identification. I don't have
dialog: any identification. I wasn't trying to
dialog: hurt them.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: You don't have a driver's license,
dialog: James? Or a Social Security card?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Why not? Most people have some ID.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You wouldn't understand.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: You've been in an institution, haven't
dialog: you, James? A hospital?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I have to go.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: A jail? Prison?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Underground.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Hiding?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I love this air. This is wonderful air.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: What's wonderful about the air, James?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: It's so clean. No germs.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: You're afraid of germs?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I have to go.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Why do you think there aren't any germs
dialog: in the air, James?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: This is April, right?
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: July.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (sudden panic)
dialog: July?!
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Do you know what year it is?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: What year is it?
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: What year do you think it is?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: 1995?
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: You think it's July of 1995? That's
dialog: the future, James. Do you think you're
dialog: living in the future?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (slightly confused)
dialog: No, 1995 is the past.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: 1995 is the future, James. This is 1989.
text: COLE looks stunned.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - MORNING
text: COLE, bound tightly by the strait-jacket, heavy manacles on his
text: ankles, is being escorted down the corridor by two surly POLICEMEN.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Where are you taking me?
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN #1
dialog: South of France, buddy. Fancy hotel.
dialog: You're gonna love it.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: South of France?! I don't want to go
dialog: to the South of France. I want to make
dialog: a telephone call.
text: POLICEMAN #2 smirks as he unlocks a heavy steel door.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN #2
dialog: Zip it, scumbag -- you fooled the shrink
dialog: with your act, but you don't fool us.
text: Then, POLICEMAN #2 swings the steel door open and sunlight
text: overwhelms COLE, blinding him in a dazzling fury of white light.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET/MINI-VAN - DAY
text: A Mini-van, the kind of vehicle used to transport a half dozen
text: prisoners, crawls through a busy street. The Police Department
text: logo is prominent on the side of the van beneath barred windows.
scene_heading: INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL/SHOWERS - AN HOUR LATER (MORNING)
text: Fierce spray recalls the decontamination in the future. COLE
text: stands stark naked under the shower while two muscular attendants,
text: PALMER and BILLINGS, supervise.
text: As PALMER shuts off the water, BILLINGS hands COLE a towel and
text: starts inspecting his scalp...
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: Lemme see your head, Jimbo, see if you
dialog: got any creepy crawlies.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I need to make a telephone call.
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: (pulling Cole's head)
dialog: Gotta work that out with a doctor, Jimbo.
dialog: Can't make no calls 'til the doctor says.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: It's very important.
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: What chew gotta do, Jimbo, is take it
dialog: easy, relax into things. We all gonna
dialog: get along fine if you just relax.
text: COLE gets the hint of menace in the message and submits to the
text: lice inspection, only his eyes revealing his frustration.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL/DAYROOM - HALF AN HOUR LATER (DAY)
text: COLE stands in the doorway, stunned by his first sight of the
text: large room. His eyes go to the heavily-grilled windows where
text: light pours in from outside. Then, to the TV, where a CARTOON
text: COMMERCIAL makes raucous noises.
text: PATIENTS, in K-Mart street clothes or ratty robes, stare gloomily
text: at the TV, or play cards, pace, or just stare blankly.
text: BILLINGS is at COLE'S side, beckoning to a patient, JEFFREY MASON,
text: a twenty year old white youth dressed in khakis and a plaid shirt.
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: Jeffrey. Yo! Jeffrey. This here is James.
dialog: Whyncha show James around? Tell him the TV
dialog: rules, show him the games an' stuff, okay?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: (with a sly look)
dialog: How much you gonna pay me? Huh? I'd
dialog: be doing your job.
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: Five thousand dollars, my man. That
dialog: enough? I'll wire it to your account
dialog: as usual, okay?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Okay, Billings. Five thousand. That's
dialog: enough. Five thousand dollars. I'll
dialog: give him the Deluxe Mental Hospital Tour.
text: As BILLINGS walks away chuckling, JEFFREY turns to COLE.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Kid around, kid around. It makes them feel
dialog: good, we're all pals. We're prisoners, they're
dialog: the guards, but it's all in good fun, you see?
text: COLE nods and JEFFREY indicates card tables where PATIENTS are
text: playing cards, checkers, chess, or working on jig saw puzzles.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Here's the games. Games vegitize you.
dialog: If you play the games, you're
text: voluntarily taking a tranquilizer.
text: COLE sees a partially completed puzzle of the well-known painting,
text: THE PEACEABLE KINGDOM, depicting a serene world of animals in harmony.

dialog: What'd they give you? Thorazine? How
dialog: much? Learn your drugs -- know your doses.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I need to make a telephone call.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: A telephone call? That's communication
dialog: with the outside world! Doctor's
dialog: discretion. Hey, if alla these nuts
dialog: could just make phone calls, it could
text: spread. Insanity oozing through telephone
text: cables, oozing into the ears of all those
dialog: poor sane people, infecting them! Whackos
text: everywhere! A plague of madness.
dialog: (suddenly sly and confidential)
dialog: In fact, very few of us here are actually
dialog: mentally ill. I'm not saying you're
dialog: not mentally ill, for all I know you're
dialog: crazy as a loon. But that's not why
dialog: you're here. Why you're here is because
dialog: of the system, because of the economy.
dialog: (indicating the TV)
dialog: There's the TV. It's all right there.
dialog: Commercials. We are not productive
dialog: anymore, they don't need us to make
dialog: things anymore, it's all automated. What
dialog: are we for then? We're consumers. Okay,
dialog: buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen.
dialog: But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you
dialog: know what? You're mentally ill! That's
dialog: a fact! If you don't buy things...toilet
dialog: paper, new cars, computerized blenders,
dialog: electrically operated sexual devices...
dialog: (getting hysterical)

scene_heading: RADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITH
scene_heading: BRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE-
scene_heading: ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...
text: A woman orderly, TERRY, turns from the feeble PATIENT she's helping.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Take it easy, Jeffrey. Be calm.
text: Abruptly, JEFFREY stifles his hysteria, takes a deep breath and
text: continues, completely calm now. But COLE isn't listening. He's
text: mesmerized by the TV.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: So if you want to watch a particular
dialog: program, say "All My Children" or
dialog: something, you go to the Charge Nurse
dialog: and tell her what day and time the show
dialog: you want to see is on. But you have to
dialog: tell her before the show is scheduled
dialog: to be on. There was this one guy who
dialog: was always requesting shows that had already
dialog: played. He couldn't quite grasp the
dialog: idea that the Charge Nurse couldn't
dialog: just make it be yesterday for him, turn
dialog: back time ha ha. What a fruitcake!!
text: This last thought actually penetrates COLE'S focus on the TV and
text: he turns to JEFFREY who's picking up speed again.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Seriously, more and more people are
dialog: being defined now as mentally ill. Why?
dialog: Because they're not consuming on their
dialog: own. But as patients, they becone
dialog: consumers of mental health care. And
dialog: this gives the so-called sane people work!
dialog: (hysteria again)
text: WHOOO! SHOCK THERAPY! GROUP THERAPY!

scene_heading: IGGIDY DIGGIDY DIG! PERFECT! THE

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Okay, that's it, Jeffrey, you're gonna
dialog: get a shot. I warned you...
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: (calming himself, smiling)
dialog: Right! Right! Carried away, heh heh.
dialog: I got "carried away". Explaining the
dialog: workings of...the institution.
text: Just then, TJ WASHINGTON, a somber-looking African American in a
text: bathrobe, taps COLE on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: TJ WASHINGTON
dialog: I don't really come from outer space.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: This is TJ Washington, Jim -- he
dialog: doesn't really come from outer space.
speaker_heading: TJ WASHINGTON
dialog: Don't mock me, my friend.
dialog: (to Cole)
dialog: It's a condition of "mental divergence".
dialog: I find myself on another planet, Ogo,
dialog: part of an intellectual elite, preparing
text: to subjugate barbarian hordes on Pluto.
dialog: But even though it's a totally convincing
dialog: reality in every way...I can feel, breathe,
dialog: hear...nevertheless, Ogo is actually a
dialog: construct of my psyche. I am mentally
dialog: divergent in that I am escaping certain
dialog: unnamed realities that plague my life
dialog: here. When I stop going there, I will
dialog: be well. Are you also divergent, friend?
text: The P.A. SYSTEM interrupts, startling COLE.
speaker_heading: P.A. SYSTEM (v.o.)
dialog: James Cole. Report to Staff. James Cole!
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Staff! Whoo! Time for Staff. Now the

scene_heading: INT. PSYCH WARD CONFERENCE ROOM - MINUTES LATER (DAY)
text: COLE is agitated, speaking forcefully.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: This is a place for crazy people! I'm
dialog: not crazy!
text: RAILLY, four other PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS, including RAILLY'S best
text: friend, MARILOU MARTIN, and their chief, DR. OWEN FLETCHER, sit
text: around a beat-up conference table, watching COLE, who sits facing
text: the doctors, with BILLINGS looming behind him. (Some of the DOCTORS
text: bear a strong resemblance to the SCIENTISTS OF THE FUTURE.)
speaker_heading: RESIDENT #1
dialog: We don't use that term..."crazy", Mr. Cole.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Well, you've got some real nuts in here!
dialog: Listen to me, all of you -- I have to
dialog: tell you something that's going to be
dialog: difficult for you to understand, but...
speaker_heading: DR. RAILLY
dialog: James...please. These are all doctors
dialog: here and we want to help you.
speaker_heading: DR. FLETCHER
dialog: Mr. Cole -- last night you told Dr.
dialog: Railly you thought it was...
dialog: (checking a file)
dialog: 1995. ... How about right now? Do you
dialog: know what year it is right now?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: 1989. Look, I'm not confused. There's been
dialog: a mistake, I've been sent to the wrong place.
text: Suddenly, COLE reaches out and BILLINGS lunges forward, but COLE
text: is just grabbing a pad and pencil.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Hey, I'm not going to hurt anybody.
text: FLETCHER restrains BILLINGS with a hand signal.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (drawing)
dialog: Do any of you know anything about the
dialog: Army of the Twelve Monkeys? They paint
dialog: this, stencil it, on buildings, all
dialog: over the place.
text: COLE waves a sketch of the dancing monkey logo we saw earlier.
speaker_heading: DR. CASEY
dialog: Mr. Cole...
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Right. I guess you wouldn't, this is
dialog: 1989, they're probably not active yet.
dialog: That makes sense! Okay. Listen to me,
dialog: three billion people died in 1995.
dialog: Three billion, got that? Almost
dialog: the whole population. Of the world!
dialog: Only about one percent survived.
text: DOCTORS exchange knowing looks. This is an old story, apparently.
speaker_heading: RESIDENT #2
dialog: Are you going to save us, Mr. Cole?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Save you? How can I save you? It
dialog: already happened! I can't save you. I'm
dialog: simply trying to get some information for
dialog: people in the present so that someday...
dialog: (sees their eyes)
dialog: You don't believe me. You think I'm
dialog: crazy. But I'm not crazy. I'm a convict,
dialog: sure, I have a quick temper, but I'm as
dialog: sane as anyone in this room. I...
text: COLE stops, sees DR. FLETCHER tapping his pencil. COLE'S seen
dialog: that tapping before -- in the future! It disorients him.
speaker_heading: DR. RAILLY
dialog: Can you tell us the name of the prison
dialog: you've come from?
text: COLE doesn't answer. He's staring at the tapping pencil.
speaker_heading: DR. FLETCHER
dialog: Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (recovering, new tack)
dialog: No! Look, I don't belong here! What I
dialog: need to do is make a telephone call to
dialog: straighten everything out.
speaker_heading: DR. FLETCHER
dialog: Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would
dialog: straighten everything out?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Scientists. I'm supposed to report in
dialog: to them. They'll want to know they
dialog: sent me to the wrong time.
speaker_heading: DR. FLETCHER
dialog: So you could talk to these scientists
dialog: and they do what? Send you to the future?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: No, no. I can't talk to them. It's called,
dialog: "voice mail". I'm supposed to leave messages.
dialog: They monitor it from the present.
speaker_heading: RESIDENT #2
dialog: "From the present." We're not in the
dialog: present now, Mr. Cole?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: No, no. This is the past. This has
dialog: already happened. Listen...
speaker_heading: RESIDENT #3
dialog: Mr. Cole, you belong in 1995 -- that's
dialog: the present, is that it?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: No, 1995 is the past, too. Look...
speaker_heading: DR. FLETCHER
dialog: These scientists, Mr. Cole? Are they
dialog: doctors like ourselves?
text: Two of the residents exchange quick knowing looks.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: No! I mean yes, but... Look, I've been given
dialog: a lot of drugs but I'm still perfectly lucid.
dialog: You have to let me use the phone. One call!
text: COLE looks desperately toward RAILLY, pleading eyes meeting hers.
scene_heading: INT. LOW RENT APARTMENT - DAY
text: Four little KIDS SCREAM and SQUABBLE while the phone CHIRPS
text: insistently in the tiny, cluttered apartment and a harried MOTHER
text: lunges for the phone, answers sharply...
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Yes?
dialog: (listens, frowns, then)
dialog: Whaaaaat? "Voice mail"! I don't know
dialog: what you're talkin' about. ... Is this
dialog: a joke? I don't know any scientists.
dialog: James who? Never heard of you!
text: The MOTHER slams down the phone.
scene_heading: INT. RAILLY'S OFFICE/COUNTY HOSPITAL - DAY
text: A dismayed COLE still has the receiver in his hand. Sympathetically,
text: RAILLY takes it from him.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: It wasn't who you expected?
text: COLE is clearly agitated, starts to pace, upset. Nuts?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: It was some lady. She didn't know anything.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Perhaps it was a wrong number...
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: No. That's the reason they chose me --
dialog: I remember things.
text: RAILLY frowns, studying the distracted man with intense interest.
dialog: It's clear COLE is becoming a special patient and RAILLY'S cool,
text: detached demeanor is giving way ever so slightly.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: James, where did you grow up? Was it
dialog: around here? Around Baltimore?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (lost in thought)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: I have the...strangest feeling I've met
dialog: you before...a long time ago, perhaps.
dialog: Were you ever...?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Wait! This is only 1989! I'm supposed
dialog: to be leaving messages in 1995. It's
dialog: not the right number yet. That's the
dialog: problem. Damn! How can I contact them?
text: RAILLY recovers her distance, her poise, as she takes a bottle,
text: pours out some tablets, and holds them out to COLE.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: James, take these.
dialog: (watching him step back)
dialog: Please -- I helped you like I said I
dialog: would. Now I want you to trust me.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT CONCOURSE - DAY (THE DREAM)
text: MR. PONYTAIL races past the startled YOUNG COLE.
speaker_heading: MR. PONYTAIL
speaker_heading: WATCH IT!
dialog: Was it JEFFREY wearing gaudy pants and a ponytail? It was
text: definitely JEFFREY'S VOICE.
text: TRAVELERS dive for cover as a WOMAN'S VOICE cries out...
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
speaker_heading: NOOOOOOOOOO!
text: The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks up at YOUNG COLE, makes eye contact, but
text: doesn't speak. The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks a lot like DR. FLETCHER!
text: Just then, YOUNG COLE is distracted by a running figure. It's
text: the BLONDE MAN in the Hawaiian shirt, but he's not injured. He's
text: sprinting toward the gates, glancing back over his shoulder, his
dialog: moustache slightly askew!
text: A sharp CRACK of a GUNSHOT rings out! Then, DAZZLING LIGHT.
dialog: Everything goes white!
scene_heading: INT. DORMITORY (PSYCH WARD)/COUNTY HOSPITAL - NIGHT
text: COLE'S eyes blink awake, blinded by a flashlight.
text: He's lying in one of thirty beds in a darkened ward. Disoriented.
text: Which world is this? The room is full of BREATHING, SNORING,
text: occasional MOANS. He can barely discern the shadowy figures of
text: an ORDERLY and a NURSE, making their rounds, checking each bed.
text: His eyes adjusting to the darkness, COLE watches them exit.
text: He turns and sees a patch of moonlight coming in a barred window.
text: With a quick glance at the sleeping PATIENTS, he slips out of
text: bed, makes his way stealthily to the window, peers out.
text: COLE'S POV: the moon, glowing in the sky, illuminating a single
text: tree. Under the tree, in silhouette, a COUPLE embraces, kisses.
text: ANGLE ON COLE, looking out the window, absorbed.
speaker_heading: VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: It won't work. You can't open it.
text: Alarmed, COLE turns, sees JEFFREY in the next bed.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: You think you can remove the grill but
dialog: you can't. It's welded.
text: COLE checks the grill anyway.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: See? I toldja. And all the doors are
dialog: locked, too. They're protecting the
dialog: people on the outside from us. But the
dialog: people outside are as crazy as us.
text: COLE has become preoccupied with a small SPIDER creeping along
text: the window sill. He's staring at it when he's distracted by a
text: sudden SOUND. Grabbing the SPIDER, COLE scrambles back into bed
text: just as the door opens and an ORDERLY probes the dark room with
text: the blade of his flashlight.
text: ANGLE ON COLE, in bed, feigning sleep.
text: The flashlight clicks off and COLE hears the door close.
text: For a long moment the ward is silent except for BREATHING,
text: SNORES, occasional MOANS. Then, COLE hears JEFFREY'S hoarse
text: whisper, picking up right where he left off.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: You know what "crazy" is? "crazy" is
dialog: "majority rules". Take germs for example.
text: Although COLE is preoccupied with the SPIDER struggling to get
text: out of his fist, he can't help reacting to the word, "germs"!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Germs?!
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: In the 18th century there was no such
dialog: thing! Nobody'd ever imagined such a
dialog: thing -- no sane person anyway. Along
dialog: comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I
dialog: think. He tries to convince people...
dialog: other doctors mostly...that there are
dialog: these teeny tiny invisible "bad things"
dialog: called germs that get into your body and
dialog: make you...sick! He's trying to get
dialog: doctors to wash their hands. What is
dialog: this guy...crazy? Teeny tiny invisible
dialog: whaddayou call 'em?..."germs"!
text: As JEFFREY warms to his subject, getting excited, COLE tries to
dialog: figure out where to put the SPIDER.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY (cont.)
dialog: So cut to the 20th century! Last week
dialog: in fact, right before I got dragged
dialog: into this hellhole. I order a burger
dialog: in this fast food joint. The waiter
text: drops it on the floor. He picks it up,
dialog: wipes it off, hands it to me...like it
dialog: was all okay.
text: No alternative. COLE pops the SPIDER in his mouth and swallows
text: it as JEFFREY prattles on...
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: "What about the germs?" I say. He
dialog: goes, "I don't believe in germs. Germs
dialog: are just a plot they made up so they
dialog: can sell you disinfectants and soap!"
dialog: Now, he's crazy, right? Hey, you
dialog: believe in germs, don't you?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I'm not crazy.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Of course not, I never thought you were.
dialog: You want to escape, right? That's very
dialog: sane. I can help you. You want me to,
dialog: don't you? Get you out?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Why don't I escape, that's what you
dialog: were going to ask me, right? 'Cause
dialog: I'd be crazy to escape! I'm all taken
dialog: care of, see? I've sent out word.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: What's that mean?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: I've managed to contact certain underlings,
dialog: evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and
dialog: assorted minions, who will contact my father.
dialog: When he learns I'm in this kind of place,
dialog: he'll have them transfer me to one of those
dialog: classy joints where they treat you...properly.
dialog: LIKE A GUEST! LIKE A PERSON! SHEETS!
text: TOWELS! LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS
text: FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS...
text: PATIENTS are waking up as the NURSE and two ORDERLIES burst into the
text: dorm and head straight for JEFFREY who's struggling to calm himself.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Sorry. Really sorry. Got a little
dialog: agitated. The thought of escaping
dialog: crossed my mind and suddenly...suddenly
dialog: I felt LIKE BENDING THE FUCKING BARS
text: BACK, RIPPING OFF THE GODDAMN WINDOW
scene_heading: FRAMES AND...EATING THEM, YES, EATING
text: THEM, AND LEAPING, LEAPING...
text: COLE watches the ORDERLIES grab JEFFREY and haul him away.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: You dumb assholes! I'm a mental patient!
dialog: I'm supposed to act out. Wait til you

scene_heading: INT. WARD DAYROOM - MORNING
text: ANGLE ON TV SCREEN/A VIDEO IMAGE OF A LAB MONKEY, convulsing

text: robes, staring at the shuddering LAB MONKEY on the TV screen.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY'S VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Torture! Experiments! We're all

speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: They hurt you!
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Not as bad as what they're doing to
dialog: kitty.
text: ANGLE ON TV, showing a laboratory CAT turning in mad circles,
text: eating its own tail, while a NEWS REPORTER narrates.
speaker_heading: TV NEWS REPORTER (v.o.)
dialog: These video tapes were obtained by
dialog: animal rights activists who worked
dialog: underground as laboratory assistants
dialog: for several months. Authorities say
dialog: there is little they can do until...
text: The video footage now shows LAB WORKERS watching the results of
text: their experiments passively.
text: ANGLE ON COLE, reacting angrily.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Look at those assholes, they're asking
dialog: for it! Maybe people deserved to be
dialog: wiped out!
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: (startled, turning)
dialog: Wiping cut the human race! That's a
dialog: great idea! But it's more of a long
dialog: term thing -- right now we have to
dialog: focus on more immediate goals.
dialog: (sudden whisper)
dialog: I didn't say a word about "you know
dialog: what".
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: What are you talking about???
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: You know -- your plan.
text: As COLE stares, befuddled, JEFFREY sees COLE'S magazine.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: What're you writing? You a reporter?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (shielding the magazine)
dialog: It's private.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: A lawsuit? You going to sue them?

speaker_heading: NARRATOR (v.o.)
dialog: Take a chance. Live the moment. Sunshine.
dialog: Gorgeous beaches. The Florida Keys!
text: ANGLE ON COLE, very drugged, seated in front of the TV along with

text: ANGLE ON THE TV, showing a picture of the Marx Brothers.
speaker_heading: TV AWNOUNCER (v.o.)
dialog: We'll return to the Marx Brothers in

speaker_heading: JEFFREY'S VOICE (o.s.)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Get it? Monk - Key. Monk!
dialog: (big grin)
dialog: Key!
text: JEFFREY flashes his palm open for one quick moment. A KEY!
speaker_heading: COLE

dialog: What....???
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro.
dialog: Major load! Listen up -- try and get

dialog: Remember? I did my part.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: What...???
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Not, "what", babe! When!
dialog: "When???"
speaker_heading: JEFFREY

speaker_heading: VOICE/TV (o.s.)

speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: (leaping to his feet)
dialog: YES -- NOW! BUY NOW! STOCKS AND BONDS!
scene_heading: NO MORE MONKEY BUSINESS -- BUY NOW.

speaker_heading: VOICE/TV (v.o.)
dialog: A portfolio tailored to your specific
dialog: needs and the needs of your loved ones...
text: ANGLE ON COLE, dumbfounded, watching JEFFREY dance crazily.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: YES, YES. ENHANCE YOUR PORTFOLIO NOW!
text: ANGLE ON BILLINGS, across the ward, reacting to JEFFREY, lets go

speaker_heading: JEFFREY
text: BUY! SELL! SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY!
text: ANGLE ON A HAND, inserting the last piece into the PEACEABLE

text: puzzle off the table, scattering it into a thousand pieces.
text: ANGLE ON JEFFREY, dancing away while the PATIENT who just
text: completed the puzzle stares, very upset.
text: Other PATIENTS are getting agitated, too, as JEFFREY avoids a

speaker_heading: HEAVY WOMAN PATIENT
dialog: I'M GETTING DIZZY. MAKE HIM STOP!
speaker_heading: SKINNY MAN PATIENT

dialog: FOR ALL GOOD MEN TO SEIZE THE MOMENT! YES!
text: YES! MASTERCARD! VISA! THE KEY TO HAPPINESS!
text: ANGLE ON COLE, realizing through the haze of drugs that JEFFREY
text: is sending a message to him. COLE looks at the ward door.
text: COLE'S POV: the WARD DOOR opens and two husky ORDERLIES enter.
text: One locks the door with a key, one of many on a key ring attached
text: to his belt, as the other ORDERLY rushes to join the pursuit.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: SEIZE THE MOMENT! GET RICH! NOW'S THE
dialog: TIME! GO FOR IT!
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: (missing a tackle)
dialog: God damn you, Jeffrey, quit playing the fool.
text: ANGLE ON COLE, hesitating. He locks at the door...blurring in
text: and out of focus. He looks down at the key in his hand.
text: ANGLE ON JEFFREY, being grabbed by the ORDERLIES. JEFFREY
text: resists wildly as they struggle to overpower him.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
text: LAST CHANCE! LAST CHANCE! HEY -- OW!
text: ANGLE ON COLE, moving to the door. He reaches it and tries to
text: insert the key in the lock.
text: ANGLE ON LOCK, as the key keeps missing the hole.
text: ANGLE ON COLE, glancing nervously over his shoulder.
text: COLE'S POV: ORDERLIES swarm over JEFFREY, don't notice COLE.
text: ANGLE ON COLE, managing to insert the key. It won't turn.
text: A PATIENT, close at hand, startles COLE, speaking into his ear.
speaker_heading: PATIENT
dialog: Place to go would be...Florida. The
dialog: keys are lovely this tine of year.
text: COLE, unnerved, desperate tries the key again. It turns.
speaker_heading: PATIENT
dialog: Be careful. J. Edgar Hoover isn't really dead.
text: COLE pauses, stares, not understanding. Then, he opens the door.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR/COUNTY HOSPITAL
text: Stepping through the door, COLE finds himself in an ante-room
text: facing several elevators.
text: A uniformed SECURITY MAN sitting at a near-by desk doesn't even
text: lock up from the magazine he's reading.
text: Barely daring to breathe, COLE steps toward the elevators so his
text: back is to the SECURITY MAN. But he doesn't know how to control
dialog: this elevator. What should he do?
speaker_heading: SECURITY MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Two's not working today. Use one.
text: COLE freezes, sneaks a glance over his shoulder.
text: COLE'S POV: the SECURITY MAN continues his reading. He's a big
text: guy with reading glasses perched on his nose. He looks exactly
text: like the MENACING GUARD IN THE FUTURE...SCARFACE!
text: ANGLE ON COLE, stunned!
text: Just then, an elevator door slides open. The elevator's empty.
text: COLE steps into it.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR/COUNTY HOSPITAL
text: The door closes, isolating COLE in the elevator.
text: COLE finds the down button, is about to push it when the elevator
text: springs to life. The numbers on the indicator over the door
dialog: start to rise. 7...8...9.
text: Then, the elevator stops and the door opens.
text: Two DOCTORS and an AIDE stand in front of the door, waiting.
text: COLE hesitates.
text: They look at him. They seem to expect him to exit.
text: Avoiding eye contact, COLE exits the elevator.
text: As they enter the elevator, the DOCTORS look back at COLE and frown.
scene_heading: INT. RAILLY'S OFFICE - MORNING
text: RAILLY has just arrived for work. She's slipping on her white

speaker_heading: DR. CASEY
dialog: This was in my box, but I have a slight
dialog: suspicion it wasn't meant for me.
text: CASEY enters the room, reading the scrawled words dramatically.
speaker_heading: DR. CASEY
dialog: "You are the most beautiful woman I have

dialog: freedom, sunshine, air you can breathe."
speaker_heading: RAILLY

speaker_heading: DR. GOODINS
dialog: Hey, Kathryn, James Cole is one of

speaker_heading: DR. GOODINS

speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Just relax -- don't fight it. We have

text: The DOCTOR stops, astonished, as the door bursts open.
text: It's COLE! He stares at the PATIENT and the Cat Scanner.
text: The PATIENT lifts his head up and stares at COLE.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Eh, excuse me. Can I help you?
text: COLE turns and rushes back out the door.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR/COUNTY HOSPITAL
text: COLE steps into the corridor, turns to his right, freezes.
text: A POSSE of SECURITY GUARDS is headed in his direction.
text: COLE turns to his left.
text: Four ORDERLIES are coming that way.
text: COLE'S trapped. A beat. He attacks the nearest man. BILLINGS.
scene_heading: INT. TECH ROOM/PSYCH WARD - SHORTLY (DAY)
text: RAILLY prepares a hypo, turns to COLE who is strapped tightly on
text: a gurney with BILLINGS and an RN standing on either side, tense
text: for more trouble. One of BILLINGS' eyes is starting to swell shut.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: It's just a shot to calm you.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: No more drugs. Please...
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: I have to do this, James. You're very
dialog: confused.

scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM/PSYCH WARD - LATER (DAY)

scene_heading: CASEY, DR. GOODINS, DR. MARILOU MARTIN are also there.
speaker_heading: DR. FLETCHER
dialog: Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't
dialog: an inquisition.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: I didn't think I was being defensive.
dialog: I was just...
speaker_heading: DR. FLETCHER
dialog: He should have been in restraints. It
dialog: was bad judgment on your part, plain
dialog: and simple. why not just cop to it?
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Okay, it was bad judgment. But I have
dialog: the strangest feeling about him -- I've
dialog: seen him somewhere and...
speaker_heading: DR. FLETCHER
dialog: (impatient, not interested)
dialog: Two policemen were already in the
dialog: hospital and now we have an orderly
text: with a broken arm and a Security
text: Officer with a fractured skull.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: I said it was bad judgment! What else
dialog: do you want me to say?
speaker_heading: DR. FLETCHER
dialog: You see what I mean? You're being defensive.
dialog: (to Dr. Casey)
dialog: Isn't she being defensive, Bob?
text: But just then, BILLINGS sticks his head in the door.
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: Uh, Dr. Fletcher -- we got another...
dialog: situation.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR/PSYCH WARD - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)
text: DR. FLETCHER looks into an empty padded cell as RAILLY, MARTIN,
text: GOODIN, BILLINGS, PALMER and the NURSE crowd behind him.
speaker_heading: DR. FLETCHER
dialog: He was in full restraints? And the
dialog: door was locked?
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: Yes, sir. Did it myself.
speaker_heading: DR. FLETCHER
dialog: And he was fully sedated?
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: He was fully sedated!
speaker_heading: DR. FLETCHER
dialog: Then are you trying to tell me that a
text: fully sedated, fully restrained patient
dialog: somehow slipped out that vent, replaced
text: the grill behind him and that he's wriggling
dialog: through the ventilation system right now?
text: DR. FLETCHER indicates an impossibly tiny vent high in the wall.
scene_heading: INT. CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY (THE DREAM)
text: Seen through the glass windows, a 747 takes off, climbing into

speaker_heading: P.A. SYSTEM
dialog: Flight 784 to San Francisco now

text: YOUNG COLE, watching the 747, whirls at the SOUND of a COMMOTION.

speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
speaker_heading: NOOOOOOOOOO!
text: TRAVELERS dive for cover briefly revealing the mysterious BRUNETTE

text: just a glimpse of her face. She looks a little like RAILLY except
dialog: for the dark hair, the make-up. and the flashy earrings. She
text: calls out, her VOICE blending weirdly with the P.A. SYSTEM...
speaker_heading: BRUNETTE/P. A. SYSTEM

speaker_heading: ENGINEER'S VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Cole, you moron -- wake up!
scene_heading: INT. ENGINEERING OFFICE - ETERNAL NIGHT OF THE FUTURE
text: As COLE blinks awake, the digitized monotone of the P.A. SYSTEM
text: continues to drone in an unearthly VOICE...
scene_heading: UNEARTHLY VOICE/P.A. SYSTEM
dialog: -- they're the ones who are going to do it...
text: COLE'S eyes seek the source of the sound and find it on the table
text: in front of the panel of disapproving SCIENTISTS facing him. It's
text: a beat-up old tape recorder.
scene_heading: UNEARTHLY VOICE/TAPE RECORDER
dialog: I can't do anything more. The Police
dialog: are after me.
text: The tape ends, runs off the reel, flap...flap...flap...
speaker_heading: ASTROPHYSICIST
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Uh, what?
speaker_heading: ENGINEER
dialog: He's drugged out of his mind! He's
text: completely zoned out.
speaker_heading: ASTROPHYSICIST
dialog: Cole, did you or did you not record
dialog: that message?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Uh, that message...me?
speaker_heading: MICROBIOLOGIST
dialog: It's a digital reconstruction of a
dialog: message, Cole, from a weak signal on our
dialog: contact number. Did you make that call?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: I couldn't call! You sent me to the
dialog: wrong year! It was 1989.
speaker_heading: SCIENTISTS
dialog: 1989!
text: The SCIENTISTS react, exchanging looks, whispers. Then,
speaker_heading: ZOOLOGIST
dialog: You're certain of that?
speaker_heading: GEOLOGIST
dialog: (before Cole can answer)
dialog: What did you do with your time, Cole?
dialog: Did you waste it on drugs? Women?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: They forced me to take drugs.
speaker_heading: BOTANIST
dialog: Forced you! Why would someone force
dialog: you to take drugs?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I got into trouble. I got arrested.
dialog: But I still got you a specimen -- a
dialog: spider -- but I didn't have anyplace to
dialog: put it, so I ate it. It was the wrong
dialog: year anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter.
text: The SCIENTISTS stare incredulously, then turn, exchange knowing
text: looks, huddle, start whispering to one another.
text: Struggling to stay awake COLE sees, blurrily, the MICROBIOLOGIST
text: staring at COLE intently. For one moment, the face belongs to
speaker_heading: DR. FLETCHER!
text: COLE blinks hard...and the MICROBIOLOGIST has his own face, again.
text: COLE'S head slumps forward now...and everything goes dark.
speaker_heading: GEOLOGIST'S VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Cole!
scene_heading: INT. ENGINEERING OFFICE - ETERNAL NIGHT OF THE FUTURE
text: COLE comes awake with a start. The room is dark now, except...
text: a slide is being projected on a torn screen. It's a picture of a
text: stenciled graffiti...the logo of The Army of the 12 Monkeys.
speaker_heading: ENGINEER
dialog: What about it, Cole?
speaker_heading: ZOOLOGIST
dialog: Did you see it?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Uh, no, sir. I...
text: Another slide CLICKS into place. Youthful PROTESTERS, their
text: placards featuring slogans and images of Animal Atrocities,
text: confront POLICE in riot gear.
speaker_heading: ASTROPHYSICIST
dialog: What about these people? Did you see
dialog: any of these people?
text: Zooming in, panning, the SCIENTISTS emphasize the FACES of the
text: PROTESTERS. The FACES are unfamiliar to COLE (though WE will
dialog: recognize some of them later on).
speaker_heading: COLE (o.s.)
dialog: Uh, no, sir, I...wait!
text: The image pans back to a much enlarged blurry FACE among the
text: PROTESTERS. In spite of the poor image, the expression of rage
text: is clear, and it seems to resemble a somewhat older JEFFREY MASON.
speaker_heading: ASTROPHYSICIST
dialog: Him? You saw that man?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Uh, I think so. In the mental hospital.
speaker_heading: MICRO3IOLOGIST
dialog: (switching on the light)
dialog: You were in a mental institution?!
text: The SCIENTISTS MUTTER disapprovingly among themselves.
speaker_heading: ASTROPHYSICIST
dialog: You were sent to make very important
dialog: observations!
speaker_heading: BOTANIST
dialog: You could have made a real contribution.
speaker_heading: GEOLOGIST
dialog: Helped to reclaim the planet...
speaker_heading: ZOOLOGIST
dialog: As well as reducing your sentence.
speaker_heading: MICROBIOLOGIST
dialog: The question is, Cole -- "Do you want
dialog: another chance?"
text: COLE stares at them, trying to figure out what they mean.
scene_heading: INT. CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY (THE DREAM)
text: The BRUNETTE runs up the concourse, her back to YOUNG COLE, as
text: frightened PASSENGERS duck for cover, SHOUTING!
speaker_heading: RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Hey! Who's that?
scene_heading: INT. CELL - ETERNAL NIGHT
text: COLE opens his eyes. Where is he? Silence as he examines the
text: tiny cell. Bare cement walls. High ceiling. Same color and
text: size as the isolation room at the county hospital.
speaker_heading: RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Hey, Bob...what's your name?
text: COLE looks around frantically. Up, down. Where is the VOICE
dialog: coming from? Maybe from that tiny vent high in the wall...
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Where are you?
speaker_heading: RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: You can talk! Wah'dja do, Bobby boy?
dialog: Volunteer?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: My name's not "Bob".
speaker_heading: RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Not a prob, Bob. Where'd they send you?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Where are you?
speaker_heading: RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Another cell. ... Maybe.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: What do you mean, "maybe"? What's that
dialog: supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Maybe. Means "maybe" I'm in the next cell,
dialog: another "volunteer" like you -- or "maybe"
dialog: I'm in the Central Office spying on you
dialog: for all those science bozos. Or, hey, "maybe"
dialog: I'm not even here. "Maybe" I'm just in
dialog: your head. No way to confirm anything.
dialog: Ha Ha. Where'd they send you?
text: COLE doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Not talking, huh, Bob? That's okay
dialog: I can handle that.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: 1989.
speaker_heading: RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: 89! How was it? Good drugs? Lotsa
dialog: pussy? Hey, Bob, you do the job? D'ju
dialog: find out the "big info"?...Army of the
dialog: Twelve Monkeys...where the virus was
dialog: prior to mutation?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: It was supposed to be 1995.
speaker_heading: RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Science isn't an exact science with
dialog: these clowns. You're lucky you didn't
dialog: end up in ancient Egypt!
scene_heading: INT. LAB - ETERNAL NIGHT OF THE FUTURE
text: COLE is strapped on a gurney. SCIENTISTS hover near-by,
text: whispering. The walls of the gloomy chamber are damp, sweating.
speaker_heading: GEOLOGIST
dialog: No mistakes this time, Cole.
speaker_heading: ASTROPHYSICIST
dialog: Stay alert. Keep your eyes open.
speaker_heading: ZOOLOGIST
dialog: Good thinking about that spider, Cole.
dialog: Try and do something like that again.
speaker_heading: MICROBIOLOGIST
dialog: Just relax now -- don't fight it. We
dialog: have to know exactly what's there so we
dialog: can fix it.
text: The gurney is being wheeled into a crudely welded steel tube...
text: reminiscent of the cat scanner in County Hospital.
text: COLE'S POV: a last glimpse of anxious FACES, then the chamber
text: door is CLANGED shut.
text: EVERYTHING IS BLACK. A HUM BUILDS. THE BLACKNESS VIBRATES, THE
text: HUM REACHES A DEAFENING LEVEL, THEN DIMUENDOS. WE BEGIN TO HEAR
text: BURSTS OF MACHINE GUN FIRE, VOICES SHOUTING IN FRENCH, A SUDDEN
text: HUGE EXPLOSION! THEN...
scene_heading: EXT. TRENCH/FRANCE - DAY
text: DRIZZLING RAIN. And SCREAMS. COLE'S in a deep trench, naked,
text: eyes wide with terror. What's going on? Where is he? SOLDIERS
text: in gas masks push urgently past him rushing toward their injured
dialog: COMRADES who've been ripped apart by the shell that just hit
text: fifteen yards away. Muffled VOICES shout through gas masks...
dialog: in FRENCH. COLE doesn't know it, but this is World War I!
text: Suddenly, a SERGEANT confronts him, shouting in French.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
speaker_heading: (FRENCH, subtitled)
dialog: Where's your mask?! And your clothes...
dialog: and your weapon, you idiot?!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: What? What??
text: COLE looks around desperately. A horribly WOUNDED MAN is being
text: stretchered past them in the narrow trench. Machine guns chatter
text: close at hand. AAK AAK AAK. A grenade EXPLODES. Reacting to the
text: foreign word, the SERGEANT jams his bayonet into COLE'S ribs...
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
speaker_heading: (FRENCH, subtitled)
dialog: Captain! A Kraut! We got a Kraut!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I don't understand. Where am I?
text: The CAPTAIN hurries over, snapping at COLE in German.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
speaker_heading: (GERMAN, subtitled)
dialog: How'd you get here, soldier? What's
dialog: your rank? Where are your clothes?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I...don't understand.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: (frowning, GERMAN, subtitled)
dialog: German! Speak German! What are you
dialog: doing here?
speaker_heading: VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: (pleading in English)
dialog: I gotta find 'em. I gotta find 'em.
dialog: Please, you gotta help me!
text: COLE turns, sees...
dialog: It's his friend, JOSE, the Puerto Rican kid from the next cell in
text: the "underground" time. He's being carried past COLE now on a
text: stretcher, blood all over his torso, horribly wounded.
speaker_heading: COLE
speaker_heading: JOSE!
speaker_heading: JOSE
dialog: Cole! Oh, God, Cole, where are we?
text: JOSE reaches out to COLE just as a PHOTOGRAPHER takes a FLASH
text: PICTURE of the kid being carried off on the stretcher. SUDDENLY,
text: SHOTS RING OUT. COLE goes down. Hit in the leg!
text: SOLDIERS in gas masks rush past him like giant insects.
text: Looking to his left, COLE sees the CAPTAIN lying beside him, dead
text: from a chest wound, his gas mask half off.
text: COLE is reaching for the mask when...
text: A SHELL HITS CLOSE BY WITH AN ENORMOUS EXPLOSION.
scene_heading: EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - NIGHT
text: Stunningly quiet. We are on a placid campus looking at the
text: dignified architecture of Breitrose Hall. MOVING IN we FOCUS ON
text: a large poster advertising "The Alexander Lectures, Spring 1995".
dialog: WE SKIM the listings (Jon Else on The Nuclear Agony, Dr. Andrew
dialog: Miksztal on Biological Ethics, etc.) until we SETTLE ON...
scene_heading: DR. KATHRYN RAILLY
scene_heading: MADNESS AND APOCALYPTIC VISIONS
speaker_heading: MAY 17
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM/BREITROSE HALL - NIGHT
text: A large screen dominates the auditorium stage. On the screen is
text: a slide of an engraving from the Middle Ages showing a MADMAN in
text: apparent agony, his mouth shaped to a scream, as he is restrained
text: by PEASANTS. The projector ZOOMS slowly in on the agonized FACE
dialog: of this MADMAN as we HEAR RAILLY'S VOICE lecturing.
speaker_heading: RAILLY'S VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: According to the accounts of local
dialog: officials at that time, this gentleman,
dialog: judged to be about forty years of age,
dialog: appeared suddenly in the village of Wyle
dialog: near Stonehenge in the West of England in
text: April of 1162. Using unfamiliar words and
text: speaking in a strange accent, the man made
dialog: dire prognostications about a pestilence
dialog: which he predicted would wipe out humanity
dialog: in approximately 8OO years. Deranged and
text: hysterical, the man raped a young woman of the
dialog: village, was taken into custody, but then
dialog: mysteriously escaped and was not heard of again.
text: WE DISCOVER RAILLY, six years older now, standing at a lectern
text: in a pool of light. She's dwarfed by the giant screen where the
text: engraving is replaced by a series of slides of woodcuts showing
text: scenes of pestilence in the Middle Ages as she lectures to an
text: audience of mostly SCHOLARLY TYPES.
speaker_heading: RAILLY (cont.)
dialog: In 1841, Mackay wrote, "During seasons
dialog: of great pestilence, men have often
dialog: believed the prophecies of crazed
dialog: fanatics, that the end of the world was
dialog: come." Obviously, this plague/doomsday
dialog: scenario is considerably more compelling
dialog: when reality supports it in some form,
dialog: whether it's the Bubonic Plague, smallpox,
dialog: or AIDS. In addition to these "natural"
dialog: contagions, there are now technological
dialog: horrors as well: besides radiation,
dialog: consider our lurking fear of germ
dialog: warfare and its close approximation,
dialog: chemical warfare, which first reared
text: its ugly head in the deadly mustard
dialog: gas attacks during the First World War.
text: ON THE SCREEN, a SERIES of SLIDES show images of WORLD WAR I
text: SOLDIERS in gas masks, in death throes, etc..
speaker_heading: RAILLY'S VOICE (cont. o.s.)
dialog: During such an attack in the French
dialog: trenches in October, 1917, we have an
dialog: account of this soldier...
text: ON THE SCREEN, a slide of an old deteriorated photograph shows
text: JOSE, the Puerto Rican kid, strapped to a stretcher, being carried
text: by SOLDIERS through the trenches during an attack. JOSE appears
text: to be ranting madly as the projector ZOOMS CLOSER on his face until
text: the image approximates Munch's famous painting.
speaker_heading: RAILLY'S VOICE (cant. o.s.)
dialog: -- who, during an assault, was wounded
text: by shrapnel and hospitalized behind the
dialog: lines where Doctors discovered he had
dialog: lost all comprehension of French but
dialog: spoke English fluently, albeit in a
dialog: regional dialect they didn't recognize.
text: The man, although physically unaffected
dialog: by the gas, was hysterical. He claimed
dialog: he had come from the future, that he was
dialog: looking for a pure germ that would
dialog: ultimately wipe mankind off the face of
dialog: the earth in the year... 1995!
text: The AUDIENCE gives a nervous CHUCKLE.
text: ON THE SCREEN, a different old photograph of JOSE. This time
text: he's in a military hospital, gaunt, haunted, very ill.
speaker_heading: RAILLY'S VOICE (cont. o.s.)
dialog: Although seriously injured, the young
dialog: soldier disappeared from the hospital
dialog: before more data could be gathered. No
dialog: doubt, he was trying to carry on his
dialog: mission to warn others, substituting
dialog: for the agony of war...a self-inflicted
dialog: agony we call the "Cassandra Complex".
text: As RAILLY continues, we SCAN the AUDIENCE and DISCOVER MARILOU MARTIN,
text: RAILLY'S friend, and MARILOU'S HUSBAND, WAYNE CHANG, both listening
text: attentively. Further away, another MAN listens intently. A MAN with
text: shoulder-length carrot-colored hair. His name is DR. PETERS.
speaker_heading: RAILLY (cont.)
dialog: Cassandra, in Greek legend you will recall,
dialog: was condemned to know the future but to be
dialog: disbelieved when she foretold it. Hence,
text: the agony of foreknowledge combined with
dialog: impotence to do anything about it.
scene_heading: INT. RECEPTION ROOM - AN HOUR LATER (NIGHT)
text: A stack of new books. THE DOOMSDAY SYNDROME, Apocalyptic
dialog: Visions of the Mentally Ill by Dr. Kathryn Railly
text: Surrounded by enthusiastic members of the audience, RAILLY is
text: seated at the table signing books but DR. PETERS has her ear.
speaker_heading: DR. PETERS
dialog: I think, Dr. Railly, you have given
dialog: your alarmists a bad name. Surely
dialog: there is very real and very convincing
dialog: data that the planet cannot survive the
dialog: excesses of the human race: proliferation
dialog: of atomic devices, uncontrolled breeding
dialog: habits, the rape of the environment, the
dialog: pollution of land, sea, and air. In this
dialog: context, isn't it obvious that "Chicken
dialog: Little" represents the sane vision and
dialog: that Homo Sapiens' motto, "Let's go
dialog: shopping!" is the cry of the true lunatic?
text: DR. PETERS smiles self-importantly at RAILLY as an elderly
text: disheveled PROFESSOR elbows in front of him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DISHEVELED PROFESSOR
dialog: Doctor Railly -- please! I wonder if
dialog: you're aware of my own studies which
dialog: indicate that certain cycles of the
dialog: moon actually impact on the incidence
dialog: of apocalyptic predictions as observed
dialog: in urban emergency rooms and...
text: As the PROFESSOR babbles, MARILOU MARTIN and her husband, WAYNE
text: CHANG, appear and whisper...
speaker_heading: MARILOU
dialog: You were great.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: You're leaving?
speaker_heading: MARILOU
dialog: The reservation's at nine thirty --
dialog: it's getting late.
speaker_heading: DISHEVELED PROFESSOR
dialog: Doctor Railly -- please -- this is very
dialog: important!
speaker_heading: WAYNE CHANG
dialog: (checking the professor)
dialog: You sure you're gonna be all right?
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: (smiles, checks her watch)
dialog: I'll be there in twenty minutes.
speaker_heading: DISHEVELED PROFESSOR
dialog: Dr. Railly, I simply cannot understand
dialog: your exclusion of the moon in relation
dialog: to apocalyptic dementia...
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT/BREITROSE HALL - NIGHT
text: A full moon.
text: COLLEAGUES in a VOLVO pull out of the parking lot, calling,
dialog: "Congratulations" to RAILLY.
text: She waves back as she hurries to her black ACURA, one of the last
text: cars left in the lot.
text: The outside lights of Breitrose Hall go off.
text: RAILLY seems to be alone in the lot as she fishes keys from her
text: purse, unlocks her car door, starts to open it when...
text: Suddenly, she's grabbed from behind in a choke-hold by a large
text: shadowy MAN looming out of the darkness behind her.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Get in!
text: Unable to scream, she writhes and kicks as he forces her into the
dialog: front seat.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: I've got a gun.
text: RAILLY freezes, terrified, as he opens the rear door and
text: scrambles in behind her.
scene_heading: INT. ACURA/PARKING LOT
text: Fighting to suppress the quaver in her voice, RAILLY says...
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: You can have my purse. I have a lot of
dialog: cash and credit...
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Start the car.
text: Glancing in the rear view mirror, RAILLY sees penetrating eyes
text: peering out of the shadows, no other features.
text: Half-turning in the seat, she holds out the keys to him.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Here! You can have the keys. You can...
text: He grabs her hair and yanks her head back hard, speaking fiercely
text: into her ear, his face last in shadow.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: START THE CAR! NOW!
scene_heading: EXT. ACURA/PARKING LOT
text: The engine STARTS, the Acura backs up, then heads for the exit.
scene_heading: INT. ACURA
text: Steering fearfully, RAILLY hears him speak more calmly now.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: I don't want to hurt you. But I will.
dialog: I've hurt people before when...when I
dialog: had no choice. Turn left.
text: As she makes the turn, RAILLY glances in the rear view mirror,
text: sees him unfolding a tattered map. His face is lost in darkness
text: but she glimpses ragged, torn clothing as he tries to read the
text: map by the intermittent glow of passing street lights.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Where... where are we going'
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I need you to drive me to Philadelphia.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: (startled, horrified)
dialog: But that's... that's more than 200 miles!
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: That's why I can't walk there. Turn
dialog: here... I think...
text: RAILLY obeys. She glances in the mirror again, hesitates, then
text: boldly switches on the dome light, holding her breath fearfully
dialog: for his reaction.
text: He grunts appreciatively. Relieved, she looks in the mirror
text: again, trying to get a better look at him, but now his features
text: are concealed by the map.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: If you make me go with you, it's
dialog: kidnapping. That's a serious crime.
dialog: If you let me go, you could just take
dialog: the car and...
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I don't know how to drive! We went
dialog: underground when I was nine, I told you
dialog: that. When you come to the corner,
dialog: turn right.
text: Startled, RAILLY whirls, looks right at him.
text: He's lowered the map. It's COLE! Haggard, unshaven, dirty.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Cole! James Cole! You escaped from a
dialog: locked room six years ago.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: 1989. Six years for you. There's the
dialog: sign! Right here!
text: COLE is indicating a freeway entrance.
text: RAILLY turns the wheel sharply.
scene_heading: EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT
text: The Acura veers up the ramp and onto the freeway.
scene_heading: INT. ACURA/FREEWAY - NIGHT
text: RAILLY glances in the mirror, sees COLE settling back wearily
text: against the seat. She says carefully...
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: I can't believe this is a coincidence,
dialog: Mr. Cole. Have you been...following me?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You told me you'd help me. I know this
dialog: isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate...
dialog: no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets.
dialog: I probably smell bad. Sorry about that.
dialog: But then I saw your book in a store window
dialog: with a notice about your lecture.
dialog: (sudden pride)
dialog: I can read, remember?
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Yes, I remember.
dialog: (a beat, then)
dialog: Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: It's the next step. I checked out the
dialog: Baltimore information, it was nothing.
dialog: It's Philadelphia, that's where they
dialog: are, the ones who killed everyone.
dialog: (pointing suddenly, eagerly)
dialog: Zs that a radio? Does it play music?
text: RAILLY turns on the radio and immediately WE HEAR the SOUND of SURF
text: and the CRIES of gulls, background to an oozing baritone COMMERCIAL.
speaker_heading: COMMERCIAL/RADIO (o.s.)
dialog: This is a personal message to you.
text: COLE sits up, alert, listening intently.
speaker_heading: COMMERCIAL/RADIO (cont. o.s.)
dialog: Are you at the end of your rope? Are
dialog: you dying to get away?
text: COLE'S eyes narrow, concentrating on this personal message.
speaker_heading: COMMERCAIL/RADIO (cont. o.s.}
dialog: The Florida Keys are waiting for you.
text: COLE frowns as the SOUND of breaking SURF and crying GULLS fills
text: the car. It's confusing! He blurts out...
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I've never seen the ocean!
text: Observing his confusion in the mirror, RAILLY assumes her
dialog: professional tone.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: It's an advertisement, Mr. Cole. You
dialog: do understand that, don't you? It's
dialog: not really a special message to you.
text: COLE frowns. He did think it was for him, but she's probably right.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You used to call me "James".
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: You'd prefer that? ... James...you
dialog: don't really have a gun, do you.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (cynical laugh)
dialog: Everybody's got a gun. In this city...
text: He breaks off reacting to the RADIO MUSIC! FATS DOMINO singing
text: "BLUEBERRY HILL"! COLE grins, mouth agape, eyes wide like a kid's.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Can you...can you make it louder? I
dialog: love hearing twentieth century music!
dialog: Hearing music and breathing air!
text: As RAILLY cranks up the volume, she watches the mirror
text: incredulously, sees him stick his head out the window into the
text: wind, mouth open, "eating" the air hungrily.
scene_heading: EXT. FREEWAY/ACURA - NIGHT
text: "BLUEBERRY HILL" BLARES as the Acura, COLE'S head out the rear
text: window, zips past a sign at 65 mph.
text: The sign says, "PHILADELPHIA 233 MILES."
scene_heading: INT. ACURA/FREEWAY - NIGHT
text: RAILLY glances in the mirror at the nut in the rear seat with his
dialog: head out the window. what can she do? Just then, while she's
text: trying to figure something out, an ANNOUNCER'S VOICE breaks in...
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER/RADIO (o.s.)
dialog: This just in from Fresno, California:
text: emergency crews are converging on a
dialog: cornfield where playmates of nine year
dialog: old Ricky Neuman say they saw him
text: disappear right before their eyes.
text: COLE pulls his head back inside with a frown, troubled now.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER/RADIO (cont. o.s.)
text: Young Neuman apparently stepped into an
text: abandoned well shaft and is lodged somewhere
text: in the narrow 150 foot pipe, possibly alive,
text: possibly seriously injured. Playmates claim
dialog: they heard him cry out faintly but since then
dialog: there has been no contact with...
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: "Never cry wolf!"
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: My father told me that. "Never cry
dialog: wolf." Then people won't believe you
dialog: if...something really happens.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: "If something really happens"...like
dialog: what, James?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Something bad. Is that all the music?
dialog: I don't want to hear this stuff...
text: RAILLY glances at him as she scans stations.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Did something terrible happen to you when
dialog: you were a child? Something so bad...?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Ohhhh, that one! Can we hear that one?
text: It's IVORY JOE HUNTER singing, "SINCE I MET YOU, BABY".
speaker_heading: IVORY JOE/RADIO (o.s.)
dialog: "Since I met you, baby,
dialog: My whole life has changed...
text: Ecstatic, COLE sticks his head out the window again.
scene_heading: EXT. ACURA/FREEWAY
text: COLE'S POV: the heavens, glittering with a million stars and a
text: lover's moon as IVORY JOE croons the achingly romantic lyrics...
speaker_heading: IVORY JOE/RADIO (cont. o.s.)
dialog: "-- cause since I met you, baby.
dialog: All I need is you..."
text: ANGLE ON COLE, wind in his hair, eyes shining, gulping air blissfully.
scene_heading: INT. RAILLY'S APARTMENT - MORNING
text: Two POLICE OFFICERS and an anxious MARILOU MARTIN listen to an
text: answering machine's message while a hungry CAT cries plaintively.
speaker_heading: ANSWERING MACHINE
dialog: Dr. Railly -- this is Palmer from Psych
dialog: Admitting. There was a guy here this
dialog: afternoon looking for you. He seemed
dialog: very agitated. We tried to keep him, but
dialog: he refused 'n I kept thinking, I know
dialog: this guy. Then, just a few minutes ago,
dialog: it came to me. It's Cole! James Cole.
dialog: Remember him? The paranoid who pulled
dialog: the Houdini back in '89. Well, he's
dialog: back and he's...cuckoo...and he's looking
dialog: for you. I thought you oughta know.
text: The machine switches off. The POLICE OFFICERS exchange a look.
speaker_heading: MARILOU MARTIN
dialog: It's just as I told you -- my husband
dialog: and I had gone ahead -- she never
dialog: showed. That's totally unlike her!
speaker_heading: OFFICER TWO
dialog: (pulls out his notebook)
dialog: Do you happen to know the make of her car?
speaker_heading: MARILOU MARTIN
dialog: Um...Acura...'92 Acura. ... Also, that
dialog: cat's starving! She would never neglect
dialog: her cat!
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL - MORNING
text: The ACURA is parked outside room 46 of the HIGHWAYS &amp; BYWAYS
dialog: MOTEL, which has definitely seen better days.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM 46
text: The TV is on. A commercial is just starting. A catfood jingle.
text: The sound of HEAVY BREATHING.
text: ANGLE ON COLE, sweating, BREATHING HEAVILY, sprawled on one side
text: of the double bed, sound asleep.
scene_heading: INT. CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY (THE DREAM)
text: GUNSHOT! YOUNG COLE glimpses the BLONDE MAN staggering, wounded.
text: The mysterious BRUNETTE races past him toward the BLONDE MAN, and
text: YOUNG COLE again glimpses the resemblance to RAILLY, in spite of
text: the dark hair, the make-up, the flashy earrings.
text: Close at hand, YOUNG COLE'S FATHER, his face still out of view, says,
speaker_heading: FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Son, it's important for your cat to
dialog: have the nourishment necessary for
text: healthy bones and a rich coat.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM 46
text: COLE comes awake with a start. He stares, disoriented, at the
text: CATFOOD COMMERCIAL on the TV.
speaker_heading: RAILLY'S VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Please untie me. I'm very uncomfortable.
text: COLE turns to RAILLY, beside him on the bed, frightened and
text: helpless, her jacket arranged to restrain her like a strait-jacket.
text: COLE'S instinct is to free her at once, but he controls his
text: impulse. He looks away, gets up, and, wincing, limps to the
text: dresser, stepping around empty fast-food cartons. He pulls a
text: razor and shaving soap from a paper bag, then goes into the
text: bathroom, leaving the door open, and starts to shave.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You were in my dream just now. Your hair
dialog: was different, but I'm sure it was you.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: We dream about what's important in our lives.
dialog: And I seem to have become pretty important
dialog: in yours. What was the dream about?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: About an airport...before everything
dialog: happened. It's the same dream I always
dialog: have -- the only one. I'm a little kid
dialog: in it.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: And I was in it? What did I do?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You were very upset. You're always
dialog: very upset in the dream, but I never
dialog: knew it was you before.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: It wasn't me before, James. It's
dialog: become me now because of...what's
dialog: happening. Please untie me.
text: Finished shaving, COLE re-enters the bedroom, toweling his face.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: No, I think it was always you. It's
dialog: very strange.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: You're flushed. And you were moaning.
dialog: I think you're running a fever. What
dialog: are you doing?
text: COLE is rummaging through RAILLY'S wallet, pulling out money.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I'll be back in a minute.
text: He heads for the door.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: No! Don't leave me here like this!
text: Too late! He shuts the door behind him, leaving her alone.
text: ANGLE ON THE TV SCREEN, where an ANCHORMAN sits at a News Set.
speaker_heading: TV ANCHORMAN
dialog: And in Fresno, California...crews

text: get loose, tears welling in her eyes.
speaker_heading: TV ANCHORMAN (cont. o.s.)
dialog: The boy was playing ball with four
dialog: other children when he literally

scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL CORRIDOR - MORNING

scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM

scene_heading: ----------------------- PAGE 52 MISSING -----------------------
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: My notes. Observations. Clues.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Clues? What kind of clues?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: A secret army. The Army of The Twelve
dialog: Monkeys. I've told you about them.
dialog: They spread the virus. That's why we
dialog: have to get to Philadelphia. I have to
dialog: find them -- it's my assignment.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: What will you do...when you find
dialog: this...secret army?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I just have to locate the virus in its
dialog: original form before it mutates. So
dialog: scientists can come back and study it
dialog: and find a cure. So that those of us
dialog: who survived can go back to the surface
dialog: of the earth.
text: RAILLY maintains a professional deadpan, says nothing as they pass
text: a pickup truck with a MOTHER, FATHER, and five KIDS in the back.
text: COLE stares at the KIDS, a sad look in his eyes.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You won't think I'm crazy next month.
dialog: People are going to start dying. At
dialog: first the papers will say it's some
dialog: weird fever, some virus. Then they'll
dialog: begin to catch on. They'll get it.
speaker_heading: RADIO NEWSCASTER (o.s.)
dialog: We interrupt this program with a
dialog: special bulletin...
text: RAILLY and COLE both react to the radio, suddenly alert.
speaker_heading: RADIO NEWSCASTER (o.s.)
dialog: This report just in from Fresno,
dialog: California. Naval sonar specialists
dialog: who were flown to the site...
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I thought it was about us. I thought
dialog: maybe they'd found us and arrested me
dialog: or something.
text: RAILLY stares at COLE.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Just a joke.
speaker_heading: RADIO NEWSCASTER (o.s.)
dialog: -- an hour ago have been unable to
dialog: determine the location of the boy in the
text: 150 foot shaft...but a TV sound man who
text: lowered an ultra-sensitive microphone into
text: the narrow tube claims he heard breathing
dialog: sounds coming from approximately seventy
dialog: feet down...
text: COLE reaches over and changes stations. MUSIC again.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Does that disturb you, James? Thinking
dialog: about that little boy in the well?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: When I was a kid I identified with that
dialog: kid, down there alone in that pipe...a
dialog: hundred feet down -- doesn't know if
dialog: they're going to save him.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: What do you mean -- when you were a kid?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Nevermind. It's not real -- it's a
text: hoax. A prank. He's hiding in a barn.
dialog: Hey, turn left here. Left!
text: COLE quickly checks the map as RAILLY stares, then turns left.
scene_heading: EXT. SKID ROW STREET/PHILADELPHIA - DAY
text: An elderly EVANGELIST with long stringy hair, wearing a tattered
text: bathrobe, stands on a Skid Row corner WAVING a worn Bible as he

speaker_heading: EVANGELIST
dialog: "And the wild beasts of the islands
dialog: shall cry in their desolate houses and
dialog: dragons in their pleasant palaces: and

dialog: shall not be prolonged."
text: ANGLE ON RAILLY'S ACURA, crawling down the street, RAILLY driving,
text: COLE, beside her, staring out the window.
scene_heading: INT. ACURA/SKID ROW STREET
text: COLE is scrutinizing the crumbling walls, boarded-up store
text: fronts, tattered posters, decaying signs, miserable "RESIDENTS".
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Where I come from we think of this as Eden.
dialog: If we could just see the sun, eat sun-grown
dialog: food. Eden! Look at them! They donut
dialog: know what they have. They don't see the
dialog: sky. They don't feel the air!
text: COLE'S POV: a BMW speeds toward them, passes, its radio BLARING!
speaker_heading: COLE (o.s.)
dialog: And the ones who aren't hungry are so smug
dialog: they haven't a clue. WAIT! STOP!
scene_heading: EXT. ACURA/SKID ROW
text: On foot now, COLE pulls an astonished RAILLY to a wall covered with
text: graffiti, a hopeless tangle of symbols, words, and crude pictures.
text: Clueless, RAILLY stares at the wall, then at COLE.
text: COLE touches a bit of red-stenciled graffiti hidden under gang
text: insignias. We can just see TWELVE MONKEYS holding hands in a circle.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: The Twelve Monkeys!!! They're here.
dialog: (looks around)
dialog: Somewhere. Come on!
text: He pulls her along the sidewalk. No question, he's insane.
text: At the next alley entrance, COLE stops abruptly. Then, still
text: keeping a firm grip on RAILLY'S arm, he starts ripping down newly
text: tacked-up posters announcing a Rap concert.
text: RAILLY stares at him, then turns and is looking all around when,
text: suddenly, COLE pulls her up tight and threatens...
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Look, I'm warning you. You do anything,
dialog: I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: I'm not going to "do" anything, I
dialog: promise. But you need help, James.
dialog: None of this is what you think it is.
text: ANGLE ON COLE, not listening, staring triumphantly! He's found
text: another partially obscured stencil of THE TWELVE MONKEYS!
text: But just then, a raspy VOICE startles COLE.
speaker_heading: RASPY VOICE (o.s)
dialog: You can't hide from them, Bob.
text: COLE whirls, sees a derelict, LOUIE, leering at him, speaking in a
text: voice eerily like the RASPY VOICE from the next cell in the future.
speaker_heading: LOUIE
dialog: No, sir, Old Bob -- don't even try.
dialog: (conspiratorially)
dialog: They hear everything. They got that
dialog: tracking device on you. They can find
dialog: you anywhere. Anytime. Ha Ha!
text: RAILLY looks from LOUIS to COLE, sees COLE'S stunned reaction.
speaker_heading: LOUIE
dialog: (touches his back jaw)
dialog: In the tooth, Bob! Right?
dialog: (sudden triumphant grin)
dialog: But I fooled 'em, old buddy!
text: He opens his mouth wide. NO TEETH'
text: COLE grabs RAILLY and pulls her into the alley and down it.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: They're keeping an eye on me.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Who's keeping an eye on you?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: The man...with the voice. I recognized
dialog: him. He's from the present. He...
text: COLE breaks off, freezes as he sees...
text: there on a brick wall is a stencil of the DANCING MONKEYS
dialog: And further on, another red stencil!
scene_heading: EXT. VACANT LOT - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)
text: CRACKHEADS huddle against a building, sucking their pipes,
text: oblivious to COLE pulling RAILLY past.
text: COLE scans the walls for messages in the confusion of graffiti.
text: RAILLY is considering her surroundings dubiously when, suddenly,
text: COLE pulls her toward the mouth of a dark and forbidding alley.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: James, no -- we shouldn't be here!
text: COLE ignores her, yanking her after him into the alley.
scene_heading: INT. DARK ALLEY - DAY
text: Two TOM CATS face off, arching their backs and HISSING menacingly.
text: COLE avoids them as he pulls RAILLY into the gloom.
text: ANGLE ON RAILLY, seeing something alarming twenty yards ahead!
text: RAILLY'S POV: TWO THUGS, standing over a MAN, kicking him.
text: RAILLY tries to stop, but COLE, intent on the wall messages,
text: doesn't notice the THUGS.
text: The TWO THUGS turn and spot COLE and RAILLY moving toward them.
text: These creeps have mean eyes, predator faces.
text: RAILLY digs her heels in, forcing COLE to stop.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: James! We have to go back. Those men...
text: Too late. While COLE turns and stares at her, uncomprehending,
text: the TWO THUGS are approaching.
speaker_heading: FIRST THUG
dialog: Hey, buddy.
text: Startled, COLE turns to face them.
text: The SECOND THUG lunges for RAILLY'S purse, yanks it from her.
text: COLE reaches to grab it back, but...WHACK! The FIRST THUG smacks
text: COLE hard across the face with something metallic.
text: Bloody-faced, dazed, COLE doesn't even have a chance to clear his
text: head as the FIRST THUG shoves the hard object against COLE'S
text: cheek. It's a cheap thirty-eight pistol.
text: RAILLY turns to run, gets two steps before the SECOND THUG knocks
text: her roughly to the ground.
speaker_heading: SECOND THUG
dialog: Stick around, bitch.
text: Looming over her, the SECOND THUG starts to unzip his fly.
text: RAILLY looks over to COLE, SEES...
text: COLE dropping to his knees, groveling at the FIRST THUG'S feet.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Please! Please don't hurt me!
text: The FIRST THUG steps close, kicks COLE contemptuously, cocks his
dialog: foot for a second kick when...
text: COLE uncoils, lunging, rising, his strong arms around the bigger
text: man's calves, lifting him mightily, high off the ground.
text: The gun FIRES wildly as COLE staggers forward with the FIRST THUG
text: in his arms and smashes the man into the brick wail behind him.
text: The FIRST THUG goes down in a heap, dropping the pistol.
text: Zipping his fly hastily, the SECOND THUG turns to deal with COLE
text: but COLE attacks him....rocking him again and again with savage
text: blows that come one after another with lightning speed. The SECOND
text: THUG staggers back, bloody and dazed as RAILLY watches, amazed.
text: Turning back to the FIRST THUG, COLE sees the MAN reaching for
dialog: the dropped pistol.
text: COLE kicks him viciously in the jaw. The FIRST THUG'S head whips
text: back. SNAP! He collapses against the brick wall.
text: COLE turns back to see the SECOND THUG retreating down the alley
text: as fast as he can stagger.
text: RAILLY stares up at COLE. He looks very dangerous. He glances
text: in her direction as he pockets the pistol.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Are you hurt?
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Uh, no. Yes. I mean, just some scrapes...
text: As RAILLY gets to her feet, she sees COLE bend over the
text: motionless THUG and quickly go through his pockets.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Is he...alive?
text: COLE ignores the question as he pockets the man's wallet and a
text: handful of bullets, then turns and snaps at RAILLY.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Come an. We're running out of time.
dialog: You can't help him.
text: As COLE yanks her roughly away, she looks back, sees the FIRST
text: THUG'S sightless eyes, wide open...staring blankly.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Oh, Jesus, James! You killed him!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I did him a favor. Now come on.
text: COLE, pulling her again, sees more "12 MONKEYS" on the wall.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: You didn't have a gun before, did you?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I've got one now.
scene_heading: EXT. SECOND AVE - DAY
text: The EVANGELIST, spotting COLE and RAILLY hurrying past him,
text: points urgently at COLE.
speaker_heading: EVANGELIST
dialog: You! You! You're one of us, aren't you?
text: But COLE has stopped and is staring at...
text: A STOREFRONT OFFICE...its windows covered with posters. The sign
text: over the office says, FREEDOM FOR ANIMALS ASSOCIATION.
scene_heading: INT. FAA STORE - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)
text: Earnest young activists, FALE, deathly pale, BEN, long haired,
text: and TEDDY, muscular, are gathered around a counter collating
text: leaflets that demand an END TO SPECIEISM. Behind them, a large
text: poster proclaims, "ANIMALS HAVE SOULS, TOO". Just then, there's
text: a tremendous CLAP OF THUNDER as the ACTIVISTS look up and see
text: COLE and RAILLY enter.
text: COLE looks startled. It sounds like torrential RAIN POURING in
text: here. Maintaining a tight grip on RAILLY'S wrist, he looks
text: around frantically for an explanation for the tropical downpour.
text: Bookshelves line two walls. The front window is blanked cut with
dialog: posters of Animal Rights demonstrations, newspaper clippings,
text: photos of animal atrocities. The fourth wall features the
text: counter where the three ACTIVISTS face COLE as a JUNGLE BIRD
text: SCREAMS in the DOWNPOUR.
speaker_heading: FALE
dialog: Uh, can we help you?
text: COLE looks confused as the RAIN abates and an ELEPHANT trumpets
dialog: an urgent warning.
speaker_heading: FALE
dialog: Excuse me. You looking for something
dialog: in particular?
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: It's all right, James -- it's just a tape.
text: COLE'S eyes follow her look. It's a tape recorder underneath a
text: sign advertising, "THE TRUE MUSIC OF THE WORLD".
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I, uh, I'm looking for the, ah, the
dialog: Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
text: FALE glances at BEN and TEDDY. "We have a problem!" the look says.
text: MONKEYS start CHATTERING on the tape as TEDDY comes around the
text: counter, bigger than COLE, physically imposing, menacing.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: We don't know anything about any "Army
dialog: of the Twelve Monkeys", so why don't
dialog: you and your friend disappear, okay?
text: COLE backs away, a firm grip on RAILLY, as a LION ROARS.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I just need some information...
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: Didn't you hear me? We're not...
text: TEDDY breaks off mid-sentence...freezes.
text: COLE is pointing a pistol at them. A TIGER SNARLS.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: James, no -- don't hurt them.
dialog: (to the activists)
dialog: Please, I'm a psychiatrist -- just do
dialog: whatever he tells you to do. He's...
dialog: upset -- disturbed. Please -- he's
dialog: dangerous -- just cooperate.
text: MONKEYS CHATTER wildly as TEDDY backs up.
speaker_heading: FALE
dialog: What do you want -- money? We only
dialog: have a few bucks.
text: COLE is suddenly very much in charge and self-confident again. A
text: BABOON HOWLS with laughter.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I told you what I want.
dialog: (snaps at Railly)
dialog: Lock the door!
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: James, why don't we...?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Lock it now!
text: RAILLY hurries to the door to lock it as BEN says to FALE,
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I told you that fuckhead Mason would
dialog: get us into something like this.
speaker_heading: FALE
dialog: Shut up!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Mason???
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Jeffrey Mason?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Yeah, tucking, crazy Jeffrey Mason.
scene_heading: INT. FAA STORE BASEMENT - TWENTY MINUTES LATER (DAY)
text: The three ACTIVISTS are tied tightly together in the middle of
text: the floor in this dimly-lit, windowless basement. They're very
text: frightened, eager to cooperate.
speaker_heading: FALE
dialog: Then, Jeffrey becomes like this...big
dialog: star -- the media latch on to him
text: because he's picketing his own father,
dialog: a "famous Nobel Prize winning virologist".
dialog: You musta seen all that on TV.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: No, I don't watch TV.
text: COLE, the gun next to him, rummages through boxes of papers while
text: RAILLY watches helplessly. Suddenly, COLE finds something he
text: thinks he's seen before. He holds it up.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Is this him -- Dr. Mason?
text: It's a photograph of DR. MALCOLM MASON, being escorted by a
text: phalanx of riot cops through a mob of raging activists.
speaker_heading: FALE
dialog: That's him.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (very frightened)
dialog: What are you going to do with us?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (stares at the photo, then)
dialog: Tell me more about Jeffrey.
speaker_heading: FALE
dialog: (a helpless shrug to his cohorts)
dialog: Jeffrey started getting bored with the
dialog: shit we do...picketing, leafleting,
dialog: letter-writing stuff. He said we were,
dialog: "ineffectual liberal jerkoffs". He
dialog: wanted to do guerrilla "actions" to
dialog: "educate" the public.
text: COLE holds up a clipping showing horrified SENATORS standing on
text: their desks as RATTLESNAKES slither along the Senate Floor.
speaker_heading: FALE
dialog: Yeah, that's when he let a hundred
text: snakes loose in the Senate.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: But we weren't into that kind of stuff.
dialog: It's counter productive, we told him.
speaker_heading: FALE
text: So he and eleven others split off and
dialog: became this underground..."army"
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: They started planning a "Human Hunt".
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: They bought stun guns and nets and bear
dialog: traps. They were gonna go to Wall
dialog: Street and trap lawyers and bankers...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: But they didn't do it. They didn't do
dialog: any of it.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: Yeah, just like always, Mr. Big Shot
dialog: sold his friends out!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: What's that mean?
speaker_heading: FALE
text: He goes on TV, gives a news conference,
dialog: tells the whole world he just realized
dialog: his daddy's experiments are vital for
dialog: humanity and that the use of animals is
dialog: absolutely necessary and that he, Jeffrey
dialog: Mason, from now on, is going to personally
dialog: supervise the labs to make sure all the
dialog: little animals aren't going to suffer.
speaker_heading: COLE

scene_heading: INT. MOVING FORD/FREEWAY
text: A ROLODEX CARD with an address on "Outerbridge Road" for "Jeffrey

speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: If those young men don't get loose,

text: COLE glances out the window, indicates the PEOPLE in passing
text: cars...COMMUTERS, FAMILIES, TRUCKERS.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: All I see are dead people. Everywhere.
dialog: What's three more?
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: (a beat, carefully, a new tack)
dialog: You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey
dialog: Mason, don't you, James? You met him
dialog: in the County Hospital six years ago.
text: COLE is studying the map again.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: The guy was a total fruitcake.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: And he told you then his father was a
dialog: famous virologist.
text: COLE is absorbed in the map, his finger tracing "Outerbridge Road".
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: No -- he said his father was "God"!
scene_heading: EXT./INT. FORD/COUNTRY HIGHWAY - LATER (DAY)
text: The RADIO BLARES a country song as the Ford zips along an open
text: highway. COLE has his head out the window, sucking air, loving
text: the music, but his bliss is feverish now -- he's not well. As
text: the SONG ends, he pulls his head inside. An ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
text: intones over the RADIO...
speaker_heading: RADIO ANNOUNCER (o.s.)
dialog: This just in: police are widening
dialog: their search for Dr. Kathryn Railly,
dialog: prominent psychiatrist and author.
dialog: Authorities confirm that Dr. Railly has
dialog: been abducted by escaped mental patient,
dialog: James Cole. The two are believed to be
text: traveling in Railly's 1992 black Acura,
scene_heading: license plate H-E-A-D-D-R.
text: RAILLY glances at him, sees he's in pain. She feels so badly for
text: him. She wants to help him. She says, tenderly...
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: This can't go on, James. You're not
dialog: well. You're burning with fever.
text: COLE, refusing to succumb, instead, leans over to check the gas gauge.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: We need gas.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: I thought you didn't know how to drive.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I said I was too young to drive. I
dialog: didn't say I was stupid.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: What's the matter with your leg?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I got shot. Look -- there's a gas
text: station up ahead.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Shot! Who shot you?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: It was some kind of...war. Never mind,
dialog: you wouldn't believe me. Turn off here.
scene_heading: INT. PARKED FORD/GAS STATION - MINUTES LATER (AFTERNOON)
text: The GAS STATION ATTENDANT checks the oil while COLE and RAILLY
text: remain in the car. She's pulling a gas card from her wallet.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You were going to run out off gas on
dialog: purpose, weren't you?
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: No. I want you to turn yourself in, James --
dialog: It'll go much better for you if you do
dialog: -- but I'm not going to trick you.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (sees the credit card)
dialog: That has your name on it. Give him cash.
text: RAILLY puts the card back into her wallet and pulls out cash as
text: the GAS STATION ATTENDANT slams the hood down.
text: RAILLY starts opening the door. Alarmed, COLE tries to stop her.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Where are you going?
text: She looks him in the eye, then indicates the tiny Convenience
text: Store appended to the Gas Station.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: You can come with me. I have to get
dialog: some things. Scissors, bandages, some
dialog: alcohol or whiskey. ... I have to look
dialog: at your leg, James. I'm a doctor.
text: COLE looks helpless, hesitant. She's in charge...for the moment.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEARING/WOODS - AN HOUR LATER (AFTERNOON)
text: The sun dazzles through the canopy of leaves. We HEAR the CAR
dialog: RADIO but not the engine.
speaker_heading: RADIO ANNOUNCER (v.o.)
dialog: Meanwhile in Fresno, where mining
dialog: engineers continue their desperate
text: attempt to sink a shaft parallel to the
dialog: ant in which nine year old...
text: COLE, in his underwear, leans back on a large rock beside the
text: Ford, his pants hanging on the car's open door. He's staring up
text: at the sun and the sky. RAILLY finishes bandaging his thigh.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: You shouldn't put your weight on it.
dialog: You need stitches and antibiotics.
dialog: Lucky for you it was near the surface.
text: RAILLY wraps the bullet in some gauze and sticks it in her pocket
text: while COLE continues staring up at the sky.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I love seeing the sun.
text: A beat. COLE tries to stand up.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Wait -- let me help you.
text: RAILLY puts an arm around him and helps him to his feet. A beat.
text: They're very close. They don't move. RAILLY looks like she can
dialog: barely breathe.
speaker_heading: COLE
text: (leans closer, shuts his eyes)
dialog: You smell so good.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: (trying to concentrate)
dialog: You have to give yourself up, you know.
text: A beat. The spell is broken. He reaches for his pants, then
text: turns back to her, suddenly grim.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I have to do something now. Something
dialog: I don't want to do. I'm so sorry.
text: RAILLY reacts, sudden fear in her eyes. He looms over her. He's
text: cold now, steeled.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I have a mission. It's important.
text: RAILLY steps back...horrified, realizing she's going to die.
scene_heading: EXT. MASON MANSION - NIGHT
text: A SECRET SERVICE AGENT ambles vigilantly among the rows of luxury
text: cars parked beside the brightly-lit rural mansion. Encountering
text: another AGENT, he pauses.
speaker_heading: FIRST AGENT
dialog: They find him?
speaker_heading: SECOND AGENT
dialog: Who??
speaker_heading: FIRST AGENT
dialog: That kid. The one in the pipe.
speaker_heading: SECOND AGENT
dialog: You believe this? They're dropping a monkey
text: down there with a miniature infra-red camera
text: strapped on him and a roast beef sandwich
text: wrapped in tinfoil.
speaker_heading: FIRST AGENT
dialog: You're making that up!
text: ANGLE UNDER A PARKED MERCEDES, where COLE is hiding, listening to
text: the receding VOICES of the AGENTS.
speaker_heading: SECOND AGENT (o.s.)
dialog: I shit you not. ... Man, life is weird!
dialog: A monkey and a sandwich. Wonder who
dialog: thought that one up.
speaker_heading: FIRST AGENT (o.s.)
dialog: Probly give the sonafabitch a Nobel
dialog: Prize!
text: Quickly, COLE rolls to the next car and under it. He doesn't
text: see...the pistol fell out of his pocket, under the Mercedes.
scene_heading: INT. MASON MANSION/DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: A formal dinner for forty. Desert has been served. DR. MALCOLM
text: MASON rises to the enthusiastic applause of the GUESTS.
speaker_heading: DR. MASON
dialog: Would that I could enjoy this opulent
dialog: dinner and this excellent and
dialog: stimulating company for itself, with no
dialog: sense of purpose. But alas, I am
dialog: "burdened" with the sense that with all
dialog: this excess of public attention and
dialog: this cacophony of praise, there comes
dialog: great responsibility. Indeed, I
dialog: practically feel a soapbox growing
dialog: under my feet whenever I stand for more
dialog: than a few seconds.
text: While GUESTS laugh at DR. MASON'S last remark, SECRET SERVICE
text: AGENT #3 enters the room, scowling, looking for someone.
speaker_heading: DR. MASON (o.s.)
dialog: The dangers of science are a time worn
dialog: threat, from Prometheus stealing fire
dialog: from the Gods to the Cold War era of
dialog: the Dr. Strangelove Terror.
text: AGENT #3 spots who he's looking for. JEFFREY MASON!
speaker_heading: DR. MASON (cont.)
dialog: But never before, not even at Los Alamos
dialog: when the scientists made bets on whether
dialog: their first atomic bomb test would wipe out
dialog: New Mexico, has science given us so much
dialog: reason to fear the power we have at hand.
text: ANGLE ON JEFFREY, as AGENT #3 whispers in his ear.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: What are you talking about? What
dialog: friend? I'm not expecting anyone.
text: ANGLE ON DR. MASON, reacting with irritation to the disturbance.
speaker_heading: DR. MASON
dialog: Current genetic engineering as well as
dialog: my own work with viruses has presented
dialog: us with powers as terrifying as any...
text: ANGLE ON JEFFREY, following the AGENT out of the dining room,
text: grumbling loudly enough to disturb his father's audience.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: This is ridiculous. My father is
dialog: making a major address.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY/MASON MANSION
text: The conversation continues as JEFFREY and AGENT #3 enter the hall.
speaker_heading: AGENT #3
dialog: Normally if we caught a guy sneaking
dialog: around like this with no I.D., we'd
dialog: bust his ass, excuse the French, but
dialog: this one said he knows you...
dialog: (smirk, smirk)
dialog: -- and, since you seem to have had
dialog: some...uh...unusual...uh..."associates",
dialog: we certainly didn't want to arrest one
dialog: of your, uh, closest...pals.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY/MASON MANSION
text: COLE, smudged with dirt and car grease, sitting in the shadows in
text: a wingback chair, looks up as JEFFREY and AGENT #3 enter the
text: room. A FOURTH AGENT looms beside the wingback chair.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: (dismissing Cole casually)
dialog: Never saw him before in my life. Go
dialog: ahead and shoot him or torture him or
dialog: whatever it is you do.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (rising)
dialog: You do know me. You helped me once.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: (turning to leave)
dialog: That would be totally out of character.
dialog: Helping people is against my principles.
dialog: (to the Agents)
dialog: See, he definitely doesn't know me. Now,
dialog: I'm going to go back and listen to my
dialog: father's very eloquent discourse on the
dialog: perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS
text: INTRUDER TO DEATH.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I'm here about some monkeys.
text: Halfway out the door, JEFFREY freezes. A beat.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Excuse me -- what did you say?
speaker_heading: COLE
text: Monkeys. Twelve of them.
text: JEFFREY frowns, turns, considers COLE. Then, suddenly, JEFFREY
text: rushes to COLE and embraces him.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Arnold...Arnold.
text: COLE is astonished. The AGENTS are, too.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: (stepping back)
dialog: My God, Arnie, what's happened to you?
dialog: You look like shit
speaker_heading: AGENT #3
dialog: (dubious)
dialog: You know this man?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Of course I know him. What do you
dialog: think -- I act like this to strangers?
dialog: Listen -- you fellas are terrific. I
dialog: thought you were pulling a number on
dialog: me. What a terrible thing if you'd
dialog: thrown old Arnie out. I owe you guys
dialog: the big apologia! Mea culpa, fellas.
dialog: (turning to Cole)
dialog: Christ, Arnie, it's black tie! I mean,
dialog: I said, "drop by," but, like, this is
dialog: Dad's big "do"...vips, senators, secret
dialog: service, and...and everything.
text: JEFFREY throws an arm around COLE'S shoulder and starts leading
text: him toward the door as the two AGENTS exchange narrow-eyed looks.
speaker_heading: AGENT #4
dialog: "Arnie?"
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Arnold Pettibone. Old Arnie Pettibone.
dialog: Used to be my best friend. Still is.
dialog: What've you lost, Arnie -- forty pounds?
dialog: No wonder I didn't know you. You hungry?
text: Lots of dead cow, dead lamb, dead pig.
dialog: Real killer feast we're putting on tonight.
text: The AGENTS watch JEFFREY lead the limping, disheveled COLE out.
speaker_heading: AGENT #4
dialog: These people -- all of 'em -- are true
dialog: weirdoes!
speaker_heading: AGENT #3
dialog: (moving to the phone)
dialog: I'm gonna call in a description of this
dialog: "Pettibone" character. You go keep an
dialog: eye on him. Make sure he doesn't do
text: one of the guests with a fork.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY/MASON MANSION
text: GUESTS pouring from the dining room into the hall meet JEFFREY
text: and a very disconcerted COLE.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Hey, nice ta see ya. Lookin' good! Hi,
dialog: there. Yes, it has been a long time.
text: In the b.g., too far away to hear them, AGENT #4 trails JEFFREY and
text: COLE as they maneuver through the GUESTS toward the grand staircase.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: (whispers to Cole)
dialog: County Hospital, right? 1989. The
dialog: "Immaculate Escape" -- am I right?
dialog: (smiling to guests)
dialog: Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Listen to me -- I can't do anything
dialog: about what you're going to do. I can't
dialog: change anything. I can't stop you. I
dialog: just want some information...
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: We need to talk. Come on. Upstairs.
dialog: (to a guest)
dialog: I am a new person! I'm completely
dialog: adjusted. Witness the tux. It's Armani.
dialog: (whispers to Cole)
dialog: Who chattered? Goines? Weller?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I just need to have access to the pure
dialog: virus, that's all! For the future!
dialog: JEFFREY studies COLE. COLE doesn't just talk crazy. He looks crazy!
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Come on, follow me. You don't lock so good.
text: JEFFREY starts guiding COLE up the grand staircase as COLE, glancing
text: back, spots AGENT #3 and AGENT #4, both keeping an eye on him now.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I don't have time to go upstairs. The
dialog: police are looking for me. I need to
dialog: know where it is and exactly what it is.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: (brightening suddenly)
dialog: I get it! This is your old plan, right?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Plan? What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Remember? We were in the dayroom,
dialog: watching TV, and you were all upset
dialog: about the...desecration of the planet.
dialog: And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be
dialog: great if there was a germ or a virus
dialog: that could wipe out mankind and leave
dialog: the plants and animals just as they
dialog: are?" You do remember that, don't you?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Bulishit! You're fucking with my head!
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: And that's when I told you my father was
dialog: this famous virologist and you said, "Hey,
dialog: he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (grabbing Jeffrey)
dialog: Listen, you dumb fuck! The thing mutates
dialog: We live underground! The world belongs
dialog: to the fucking dogs and cats. We're
dialog: like moles or worms. All we want to do
dialog: is study the original...
speaker_heading: AGENT #4'S VOICE
dialog: Okay -- take it easy. We know who you
dialog: are, Mr. Cole.
text: COLE feels a firm grip on his shoulder, turns and sees AGERT #4
speaker_heading: AGENT #4
dialog: Let's go somewhere and talk this thing
dialog: over. Okay? Just come with me...
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: You're right! Absolutely right. Me's
dialog: a nut case, totally deranged. Delusional!
scene_heading: Paranoid. HIS PROCESSOR'S ALL FUCKED
text: UP, HIS INFORMATION TRAY IS JAMMED.
text: AGENT #4 is wishing JEFFREY would chill out even as the THIRD
text: AGENT is climbing up the staircase to help.
text: COLE is like a trapped animal. He's being led down the staircase
text: now with JEFFREY, right on his heels, yelling so EVERYONE can hear.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS, THE "ARMY OF THE
dialog: TWELVE MONKEYS"? IT'S A COLLECTION OF
text: NATURE KOOKS WHO RUN A STORE DOWNTOWN.
scene_heading: SPACE-CASE DO-GOODERS SAVING RAIN
dialog: FORESTS. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH
dialog: THOSE BOZOS ANYMORE. I QUIT BEING THE
dialog: RICH KID FALL GUY FOR A BUNCH OF
dialog: INEFFECTUAL BANANAS. SO MUCH FOR YOUR
speaker_heading: GRAND PLOT!
text: COLE stares back at JEFFREY as both AGENTS hustle COLE down the
dialog: stairs. It sounds true! JEFFREY'S so confident.
speaker_heading: AGENT #3
dialog: Take it easy, Mr. Mason, we've got him.
dialog: Everything's...
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
text: MY FATHER HAS BEEN WARNING PEOPLE ABOUT
text: THE DANGERS OF EXPERIMENTATION WITH
dialog: VIRUSES AND DNA FOR YEARS. YOU'VE
scene_heading: "PROCESSED" THAT INFORMATION THROUGH
scene_heading: YOUR ADDLED PARANOID INFRA-STRUCTURE AND
scene_heading: LO AND BEHOLD, I'M FRANKENSTEIN AND THE
scene_heading: "ARMY OF THE TWELVE MONKEYS" BECOMES
scene_heading: SOME SORT OF SINISTER REVOLUTIONARY
dialog: CABAL. THIS MAN IS TOTALLY BATSHIT! YOU
dialog: KNOW WHERE HE THINKS HE COMES FROM???
text: Suddenly, COLE, catching the AGENTS by surprise, wrenches free,
text: shoves them aside, and stumbles down the rest of the staircase.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER/MASON MANSION
text: COLE heads for the front door, but there's an AGENT there! COLE
text: turns and limps madly toward the dining room, pushing his way
text: through the crowd of amazed GUESTS.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM/MASON MANSION
text: SERVANTS, clearing the table, look up astonished as two AGENTS
text: burst into the room.
speaker_heading: AGENT #4
dialog: Did a man just come through here...limping?
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN/MASON MANSION
text: COOKS stare, amazed, as two OTHER AGENTS burst into the kitchen
text: and look about urgently.
scene_heading: INT. DEN/MASON MANSION
text: A large projection TV is on and a knot of GUESTS is gathered in
text: front of it...watching the spooky VIDEO IMAGES.
speaker_heading: TV REPORTER (v.o.)
dialog: These pictures we are seeing are coming
dialog: to us live from deep inside the pipe.
dialog: You can just make out the metal wall
dialog: behind those roots and I guess those
dialog: must be spider webs.
text: MRS. McCANN, a guest, watching the TV, expresses concern...
speaker_heading: MRS. McCANN
dialog: Well, if you ask me, I think that monkey
text: is going to eat the sandwich himself.
text: Just then, two AGENTS burst into the den.
text: The GUESTS turn from the TV, startled, stare open-mouthed, but
text: the AGENTS have spotted an open window and are hurrying to it.
text: AGENTS POV OUT THE WINDOW: the rows of expensive parked CARS.
text: ON THE TV SCREEN, RAILLY'S photograph appears.
speaker_heading: TV ANCHOR (v.o.)
dialog: This just in: Police say that the body of
dialog: a woman found strangled in the Knutson state
dialog: Park could be kidnap victim, Dr. Kathryn Railly.
text: As the AGENTS run out of the room, a photo of RAILLY'S abandoned
text: Acura comes up on the TV screen.
speaker_heading: TV ANCHOR (v.o.)
dialog: Earlier in the day, police located
text: Railly's abandoned car not far from a
dialog: building where three animal rights
dialog: activists were found bound and gagged...
scene_heading: EXT. MASON MANSION - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)
text: Pistols drawn, AGENTS move cautiously among the rows of parked
text: luxury cars, checking inside and under the vehicles.
speaker_heading: AN AGENT'S VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: COME ON OUT, MR COLE -- WE'RE NOT GOING
dialog: TO HURT YOU.
scene_heading: INT. PARKED GREEN JAGUAR
text: COLE, scrunched down on the floor next to the driver's seat,
text: spots the key dangling from the ignition, then lifts his head
text: slightly to study the shift mechanism, trying to figure it out.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKED CARS/MASON MANSION
text: AGENTS continue to move cautiously among the parked cars.
scene_heading: INT. PARKED GREEN JAGUAR
text: COLE eases himself into the driver's seat, tentatively slides the
text: shift into "Drive", then turns the key. Nothing happens.
text: Panic. COLE studies the shift again.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKED CARS/MANSION
text: AGENT #5 approaches the row where the Jaguar is parked.
scene_heading: INT. PARKED GREEN JAGUAR
text: COLE slides the shift from D (Drive) to N (Neutral). He twists
text: the key again. The engine ROARS...SEVEN THOUSAND RPM!
scene_heading: EXT. LAWN/MANSION
text: AGENT #5 whirls at the sound.
text: SMASH. The JAGUAR clips the Mercedes parked in front of it and
dialog: accelerates right at him!
text: AGENT #5 dives aside just as the speeding JAGUAR whizzes past
text: him, slams into a parked Cadillac, bounces off, grinds between
text: two other parked vehicles with a fierce scream of tearing metal.
scene_heading: INT. MOVING JAGUAR
text: Caught between two cars, COLE can only lean on the gas pedal.
text: The JAGUAR comes free with a great SCCCREEEEECH...
text: COLE sees the driveway ahead in the moonlight. Steering madly,
text: he plows through shrubs and gardens heading for the driveway.
scene_heading: EXT. MASON MANSION - NIGHT
text: Lights off, veering wildly, the JAGUAR reaches the driveway.
text: AGENTS are leaping into cars and a HELICOPTER is coming to life,
text: its rotors whipping around.
scene_heading: INT. SPEEDING JAGUAR/OUTERHRIDGE ?OAD - NIGHT
text: COLE turns onto the road, careening crazily from one side to the
text: other, unable to see ahead with no headlights.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: LIGHTS! LIGHTS!
text: He starts hitting switches. The wipers come on, the RADIO BLARES.
speaker_heading: RADIO REPORTER'S VOICE/RADIO (o.s.)
dialog: ---when they pulled the monkey out, it
text: was still clutching the tinfoil wrapped
dialog: sandwich.
text: Rounding a bend, an ONCOMING CAR heads straight at COLE.
text: COLE yanks the wheel as the OTHER CAR, horn BLARING, just misses him.
text: Recovering, COLE loses the road, speeds crazily along the shoulder.
scene_heading: INT. FLYING HELICOPTER - NIGHT
text: The PILOT, an agent, steers the chopper while the CO-PILOT pans a
text: spotlight over the two lane road beneath them.
text: Just then, the PILOT sees headlights below.
speaker_heading: PILOT
text: There! He's showing lights.
scene_heading: INT. SPEEDING JAGUAR - NIGHT
text: COLE can see the road now in his headlights as the windshield
text: wipers scrape frantically and the RADIO BLARES...
speaker_heading: RADIO REPORTER'S VOICE/RADIO (o.s.)
dialog: We don't know what to think. They
dialog: didn't locate him and they don't know
dialog: how much longer he can last, that's
text: assuming the boy is still alive.
text: A spotlight hits the car and COLE hears the sound of the
text: HELICOPTER as it lowers over him!
scene_heading: EXT. OUTERBRIDGE ROAD
text: The HELICOPTER maneuvers over the speeding JAGUAR.
scene_heading: INT. SPEEDING JAGUAR
text: COLE can see the underbelly of the HELICOPTER a few feet above
text: his front windshield.
text: Desperate, he yanks the wheel hard, veering off the road.
text: COLE'S POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: dense woods ahead.
scene_heading: EXT. HELICOPTER/WOODS
text: The chopper pulls up sharply, avoiding the trees, then levels out.
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER
text: The PILOT skims the top of the trees while the CO-PILOT rakes the
text: forest below with his spotlight.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Goddamnit! Where is he?
text: The CO-PILOT gets a brief glimpse of headlights through the leaves.
speaker_heading: CO-PILOT
dialog: There! Over there.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: CO-PILOT
dialog: Eight o'clock! He was right there.
text: The headlights are gone. Nothing but darkness below.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: He musta turned his lights of if.
speaker_heading: CO-PILOT
dialog: Couldn't drive down there without
dialog: lights. We just can't see 'em.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Maybe he's not driving!
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - LATER (NIGHT)
text: A weather forecast BLARES from the radio of the steaming Jaguar,
text: crumpled into a tree, the driver's door open.
text: A POLICE OFFICER, pistol drawn, approaches the car cautiously, as
text: OTHER OFFICERS and AGENTS stay behind trees, weapons ready.
text: The POLICE OFFICER lunges forward, pointing his weapon into the
text: Jaguar. He inspects the car, then turns and calls out...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: He's not in here.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS/CLEARING - NIGHT
text: Limping, bleeding from various cuts, COLE CRASHES through
text: underbrush as he follows a stream through the woods.
text: Suddenly, he sees what he's looking for.
text: The FORD...barely visible in the moonlight, parked in the trees
text: beside the stream. The car looks empty.
scene_heading: INT. TRUNK/FORD
text: Total blackness! The sound of keys in the lock.
text: Then, the trunk swings open and COLE stands in the moonlight,
dialog: looking down
text: RAILLY is in the trunk, tears of rage and frustration in her eyes.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: You bastard! You total bastard!
speaker_heading: EXT. FORD
text: COLE backs away, as RAILLY scrambles out of the trunk, swinging.
text: He slips, falls, and she starts kicking him as she rants hysterically.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: I could have died in there. If something
dialog: had happened to you I would have died.
text: COLE is lying on the ground, looking up, his lip caked with blood.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I...I...I'm really sorry.
text: Noticing his cuts and torn clothes, she stops kicking him.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: What have you done? Did you...kill someone?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (getting to his feet)
dialog: No! I...don't think so. I stole a car
dialog: and they chased me. I hit a tree.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: See -- you can drive after all!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Yeah, sort of, I guess. I...I'm sorry
dialog: I locked you up. I thought...I thought...
dialog: I think maybe I am crazy!
text: She looks at him. Breakthrough? Very calm now, the doctor.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: What made you think that?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about
dialog: the virus. And suddenly, I wasn't
dialog: sure. We talked when I was in the
dialog: institution, and it was all...fuzzy.
dialog: The drugs and stuff.
dialog: (horrified)
dialog: You think maybe I'm the one who wiped
dialog: out the human race? It was my idea?
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Nobody is going to wipe out the human
dialog: race. Not you or Jeffrey or anybody
dialog: else. You've created something in your
dialog: mind, James -- a substitute reality.
dialog: In order to avoid something you don't
dialog: want to face.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I'm..."mentally divergent". I would
dialog: love to believe that.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: It can be dealt with, but only if you
dialog: want to. I can help you.
text: COLE reacts to the sound of VOICES in the woods, dogs BARKING.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I need help all right. They're coming
dialog: after me.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: First, it's important that you
dialog: surrender to them instead of them
dialog: catching you running. Okay?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (brightening)
dialog: It would be great if I'm crazy. If I'm
dialog: wrong about everything...the world will be
dialog: okay. I'll never have to live underground.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Give me the gun.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: The gun! ... I lost it
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: You're sure?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (showing her)
dialog: No gun!
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: Stars! Air! I can live here. Breathe!
text: RAILLY starts around to the front of the car.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: I'm going to attract their attention,
dialog: let them know where we are, okay?
text: RAILLY gets in the driver's seat...and starts to HONK the horn.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: They'll tell you to put your hands on top
dialog: of your head. Do what they tell you. You're
dialog: going to get better, James -- I know it!
text: ANGLE ON COLE, spotting something on the ground. An insect! He
text: reaches down to grab it, but, instead, grins, grabs some grass,
text: stands, and starts rubbing it happily all over his face. The

text: ANGLE ON THE NIGHT SKY, the moon full, the sky rich with stars.
text: ANGLE ON COLE, tears of joy running down his face.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I love this world!
text: ANGLE ON RAILLY, in the driver's seat, hearing near-by SHOUTS
text: from the woods. The police are almost here. She gets out of the
text: car, starts around toward COLE.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Remember, I'm going to help you. I'll
dialog: stay with you. I won't let them...
text: She breaks off mid-sentence...stares, stunned!
text: COLE is gone. Disappeared.

text: RAILLY is being "debriefed" by POLICE OFFICERS and FBI AGENTS.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Then I said something to him about
dialog: cooperating and he said he would do
dialog: that, so I got in the car and started
dialog: honking the horn. When I got out, he
dialog: was gone.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT HALPERIN
dialog: You lucked out. For a while we thought
dialog: you were a body they found down state...
text: mutilated.
text: A COP enters, hands a photo to LIEUTENANT HALPERIN who studies it.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: He wouldn't do something like that -- he...
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT RALPERIN
text: (interrupts, hands her the photo)
dialog: This the man he attacked?
text: RAILLY looks at the photo, an 8 x 10 of the FIRST THUG, slumped
text: against the alley wall, obviously dead.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: I'd like to be clear about this. That
dialog: man and the other one were..."severely"
dialog: beating us. James Cole didn't start
dialog: it. In fact -- he saved me!
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT RALPERIN
dialog: Funny thing, Doctor, maybe you can
dialog: explain it to me, you being a psychiatrist
dialog: -- why do kidnap victims almost always
dialog: try to tell us about the guys who grabbed
dialog: 'em and try to make us understand how
dialog: kind these bastards really were?
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: (as if reciting)
dialog: It's a normal reaction to a life-
dialog: threatening situation.
dialog: (suddenly animated)
text: He's sick. He thinks he comes from the
dialog: future. He's been living in a carefully
dialog: constructed fantasy world and that world

speaker_heading: GEOLOGIST

speaker_heading: TV REPORTER (v.o.)

dialog: Philadelphia this morning. So far she
dialog: has refused to make a public statement.
text: RAILLY'S friends, MARILOU and WAYNE, are watching the TV.
text: A door opens and KATHRYN RAILLY, wearing a robe, comes out of her

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: No -- I'm in a state of hyper-

speaker_heading: RAILLY (o.s.)
dialog: Do they really expect him to come here?

speaker_heading: TV REPORTER on air
dialog: And in Fresno, California...
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: (glances sadly toward the TV)
dialog: He's dead, isn't he -- that little boy?
speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: SCIENTISTS
dialog: ---found my thrills on Blueberry Hill...

speaker_heading: SCIENTISTS

speaker_heading: BOTANIST
dialog: During your "interview," while you

text: COLE, confused, looks around, sees he's in a one-bed windowless
text: room adorned with cheap reproductions of 19th and 20th century
dialog: landscapes.
text: The BOTANIST responds to COLE'S obvious disbelief with a

speaker_heading: ZOOLOGIST
dialog: This isn't the prison, James.
speaker_heading: BOTANIST

speaker_heading: GEOLOGIST
dialog: Stress! Time travel!
speaker_heading: ASTROPHYSICIST

speaker_heading: ZOOLOGIST

speaker_heading: ASTROPHYSICIST
dialog: (sympathetically)

text: sitting across from her in his office, tapping his pen.
speaker_heading: DR. FLETCHER
dialog: He kidnapped you, Kathryn. You saw him
dialog: murder someone. You knew there was a real

dialog: were under tremendous emotional stress.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he
dialog: knew about the boy in Fresno and he says
dialog: three billion people are going to die!
speaker_heading: DR. FLETCHER
dialog: Kathryn, you know he can't possibly
dialog: know that. You're a rational person.
dialog: You're a trained psychiatrist. You
dialog: know the difference between what's real
dialog: and what's not.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: And what we believe is what's accepted as
dialog: "truth" now, isn't it, Owen? Psychiatry --
dialog: it's the latest religion. And we're the
dialog: priests -- we decide what's right and what's
dialog: wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ...
dialog: I'm in trouble, Owen. I'm losing my faith.

text: continues his feverish struggle.
speaker_heading: RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: But I can understand you don't want
dialog: your mistakes pointed out to you. I can
dialog: relate to that, old Bob.
text: COLE looks around in spite of himself. Nothing to see but the
text: walls and the landscape paintings.
speaker_heading: RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Hey, I know what you're thinking. You're
dialog: thinking I don't exist except in your
dialog: head. I can see that point of view. But
dialog: you could still talk to me, couldn't you?
dialog: Carry on a decent conversation?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (blurting)
dialog: I saw you! In 1995! In the real world!
dialog: You were a bum! You pulled out your teeth.
speaker_heading: RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Why would I pull out my teeth, Bob?
dialog: They don't like that. That's a no-no.
dialog: And when did you say you saw me?
dialog: In...1872?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: FUCK YOU!
speaker_heading: RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Yelling won't get you what you want. You

speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Oh, yeah? What do I want?
speaker_heading: RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: You don't know what you want? Sure you

speaker_heading: COLE

speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: You found him? Is he all right?
text: CLOSE ON HALPEPIN, noting her reaction with raised eyebrows
text: giving an "I told you so" look to the BLACK PLAINCLOTHES cop
text: across his desk, then continuing into the phone,
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT HALPERIN
dialog: Au contraire, Doctor. No sign of your
dialog: good friend, the kidnapper. However,
dialog: the plot thickens. I have a ballistic
dialog: report on my desk that says the bullet
dialog: you claim you removed from Mr. Cole's
dialog: thigh is an antique...and all indications
dialog: are it was fired...sometime prior to 1920.
text: ANGLE ON RAILLY, reacting, stunned.
text: ANGLE ON HALPERIN, continuing soberly now,
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT RALPERIN
dialog: So what I was thinking was, maybe if I
dialog: sent a detective down there to talk
dialog: with you, you could maybe revise or
dialog: amplify on the circumstances....
dialog: Hello? Hello? Dr. Railly?
text: HALPERIN considers the dead phone, glances at the COP again.
scene_heading: INT. RAILLY'S BEDROOM/STUDY
text: Her hand still on the receiver, RAILLY looks shocked. Then, she
text: hurries into her study and starts frantically pulling neatly
text: arranged piles of papers and books from a bookcase until she
text: finds a copy of her book. She leafs through it hurriedly,
text: locates the picture of the Puerto Rican KID (JOSE) in WWI.
text: Peering closely, she tries to see everything in the picture.
text: Then, she turns and reaches for a research folder of old
text: photographs and rummages through it until she finds...!!!
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: No!

dialog: You said we weren't "real," Cole...
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Well, sir, I don't think the human mind
dialog: was built to exist in two different...
dialog: whatever you call it..."dimensions."
dialog: It's stressful, you said it yourselves,
dialog: it gets you confused. You don't know
dialog: what's real and what's not.
speaker_heading: MICROBIOLOGIST
dialog: But you know what's real now?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: The SCIENTISTS start to confer openly among themselves
speaker_heading: GEOLOGIST

speaker_heading: ASTROPHYSICIST

speaker_heading: BIOLOGIST

text: Dr. Mason on the phone.
speaker_heading: DR. MASON
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: I'm afraid this doesn't seem very
dialog: professional to me, in fact it's
dialog: distressingly unprofessional for some-
dialog: one who treated my son briefly (if
dialog: indeed you actually are who you say you
dialog: are) to take a sudden unsolicited interest
dialog: in his mental health six years later,
dialog: and to telephone a parent to express
dialog: opinions that would be inappropriate...
dialog: (breaks off, listens, then)
dialog: I don't know anything about "Monkey
dialog: armies", Doctor. Nothing whatsoever.
dialog: If my son ever was involved in...
dialog: (listens, then,)
dialog: It would be doubly inappropriate to
dialog: discuss matters of security with you,
dialog: Dr. Railly, but if it will put you at
dialog: ease, neither my son nor any other
dialog: unauthorized person has access to any
dialog: potentially dangerous organisms in this

speaker_heading: DR. MASON'S ASSISTANT (o.s.)
dialog: I attended a lecture once...Apocalyptic

speaker_heading: DR. PETERS (cont.)
dialog: Has she succumbed to her own
dialog: theoretical..."disease"?
text: But DR. MASON is lost in thought, not listening.
speaker_heading: DR. MASON

dialog: information -- if the symptoms were
dialog: first detected in Philadelphia on June
dialog: 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: It was released in Philadelphia,
dialog: probably on June 14, 1995.
speaker_heading: BOTANIST
dialog: And it appeared sequentially after that
dialog: in...?
text: With a quick glance at the panel of SCIENTISTS staring at him
text: from behind the long table, COLE replies like a good pupil,
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de
dialog: Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi,
dialog: Bangkok, then Peking.
speaker_heading: BOTANIST
dialog: Meaning...???
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: That the virus was taken from Philadelphia
dialog: to San Francisco, then to New Orleans,
dialog: Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi,
dialog: Bangkok, then Peking.
speaker_heading: BOTANIST
dialog: And your only goal is...???
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: To find out where the virus is so a
dialog: qualified scientist can travel back into
dialog: the past and study the original virus.
speaker_heading: BOTANIST
dialog: So that...???
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed
dialog: that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim
dialog: the surface of the earth.
text: COLE glances nervously at the suspicious SCIENTISTS as the
text: BOTANIST switches on a slide projector and projects...
text: a magazine photo of wall graffiti: "ATTENTION!!! POLICE ARE
text: WATCHING! IS THERE A VIRUS? IS THIS THE SOURCE? 3 BILLION DIE?"
speaker_heading: BOTANIST (o.s.)
dialog: This is from a magazine printed in late
dialog: September, 1995. The writer speculated
dialog: that this graffiti might be related to
dialog: the epidemic that by that time had
dialog: already killed thirty million people
dialog: world-wide and was getting worse. He

dialog: help me. I want to get well...
text: ANGLE on RAILLY, desperately pulling COLE'S hands off his head as
text: she tries to block the COP'S view of COLE.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: James -- put your hands down and listen
dialog: to me. Things have changed!
text: ANGLE ON THE PLAINCLOTHES COP, checking the mug shot of COLE on
text: his clipboard, then reaching for his radio mike.
text: ANGLE ON RAILLY, reacting to the COP speaking into his mike: she
text: tosses the spray paint can aside, grabs COLE and tries to pull
text: him along...but COLE isn't moving. He's staring at the front of
dialog: the FAA Store with disbelief!
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: James, come on! We have to get out of here!
text: COLE looks from the wall to the can rolling on the sidewalk,
text: then back to the wall where RAILLY has sprayed the huge words:
dialog: ATTENTION!!! POLICE ARE WATCHING!
dialog: IS THERE A VIRUS? IS THIS THE
scene_heading: SOURCE? THREE BILLION DIE?
dialog: It's the graffiti COLE saw in the future, in the picture!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I've seen that...before.
text: But RAILLY'S total attention is on their dilemma.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: James, trust me. We're in terrible
dialog: trouble. We have to run.
text: Very confused, COLE lets her drag him along the sidewalk, past
text: ONLOOKERS. She looks crazier than he does.
text: ANGLE ON THE CHEVY, making a sudden, urgent u-turn, almost
text: colliding with a passing car. BRAKES SQUEAL and a HORN BLARES.
scene_heading: INT. FAA STORE - DAY
text: ANGLE ON BEN, peeking out, reacting to the drama.
speaker_heading: BEN
text: Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her
dialog: and some other guy I can't see.
speaker_heading: FALE
dialog: Hey, no problem, it's probably just
dialog: another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's
dialog: shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.
dialog: (indicating Jeffrey to the others)
dialog: This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic
dialog: who told his former psychiatrist all his
dialog: plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible
dialog: schemes, and now who knows what she's
dialog: painted out there on our wall?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON
speaker_heading: WALLS?
text: (moves to Fale, jabs him with a finger)
dialog: You think I told her about the Army of
dialog: the 12 Monkeys? Impossible! Know why,
dialog: you pathetically ineffectual and
dialog: pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to-
dialog: animals"?! I'll tell you why: because
dialog: when I had anything to do with her six
dialog: years ago, there was no such thing -- I
dialog: hadn't even thought of it yet!
speaker_heading: FALE
dialog: (triumphant)
dialog: Then how come she knows what's going on?
text: JEFFREY abruptly switches from rage to good humor, adopting a
text: supercilious smile and a patronizing tone.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Here's my theory on that. While I was
dialog: institutionalized, my brain was studied
text: exhaustively in the guise of mental health.
dialog: I was interrogated, x-rayed, studied
dialog: thoroughly. Then, everything about me
dialog: was entered into a computer where they
dialog: created a model of my mind.
text: They all stare, mesmerized, at the strutting JEFFREY. Is he
dialog: serious? Is he crazy? Doesn't matter -- he's charismatic.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY (cont.)
text: Then, using the computer model, they
dialog: generated every thought I could possibly
dialog: have in the next, say ten years, which
dialog: they then filtered through a probability
dialog: matrix to determine everything I was
dialog: going to do in that period. So you
dialog: see, she knew I was going to lead the
dialog: Army of the Twelve Monkeys into the
dialog: pages of history before it ever even
dialog: occurred to me. She knows everything
dialog: I'm ever going to do before I know it
dialog: myself. How about that?
text: JEFFREY smiles smugly into FALE'S flabbergasted face.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Now I have to get going -- do my part.
dialog: You guys check all this stuff out and
dialog: load up the van. Make sure you have
dialog: everything. I'm outta here.
text: JEFFREY exits. The others stare at the door.
speaker_heading: FALE
dialog: He's seriously crazy -- you know that.
scene_heading: EXT. SKID ROW ALLEY - DAY
text: An overflowing dumpster squats near the mouth of an alley.
text: The unmarked CHEVY crawls slowly past the alley, the PLAINCLOTHES
text: COP'S eyes searching everywhere.
text: Trash stirs in the dumpster and RAILLY'S eyes peer up out of the
text: torn cardboard boxes, rotting food, and styrofoam litter.
text: HER POV: the POLICE CAR passes from view.
text: ANGLE ON RAILLY, emerging from the refuse, hissing,
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: James! Come on.
text: A confused COLE emerges from the opposite end of the dumpster,
text: bits of lettuce in his hair.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I don't understand what we're doing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: (climbing out of the dumpster)
dialog: We're avoiding the police until I
dialog: can....talk to you.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (climbing out after her)
dialog: You mean, treat me? Cure me? Kathryn,
dialog: those words on the wall -- I've seen
dialog: them before... I...I...dreamed them.
text: But she's not listening. She's peeking out the alley entrance.
text: RAILLY'S POV: across the street is a run-down skid row hotel,
scene_heading: THE GLOBE, ROOMS WEEKLY, DAILY.
scene_heading: INT. GLOBE HOTEL/LOBBY - MINUTES LATER
text: The DESK CLERK, an old alkie who hates trouble but finds it often,
text: stares across the counter suspiciously at RAILLY and COLE.
speaker_heading: DESK CLERK
dialog: Twenty five bucks an hour.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: An hour?!
speaker_heading: DESK CLERK
dialog: You want quarter hours, go someplace else.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: (catches on, pulls out her last bills)
dialog: Here's ninety eight. For the night. Deal?
text: The DESK CLERK squints warily at this turn of events. Then, he
text: turns, gets a key, turns back and hands it to her.
speaker_heading: DESK CLERK
text: Forty four. Fourth floor, turn right.
text: Elevator's busted.
text: RAILLY turns, COLE follows, and they walk quickly to the stairs
text: passing the stares of gloomy RESIDENTS sitting on torn sofas
text: chairs in front of an old TV with hideous color.
text: ANGLE ON THE DESK CLERK, watching RAILLY and COLE climb
text: stairs. As they disappear from view, he picks up the phone,
text: punches a number, speaks into the phone.
speaker_heading: DESK CLERK
dialog: Tommy? This is Charlie at the Globe.
dialog: You know if Wallace has a new girl?
dialog: Sort of a rookie type? Blonde?
scene_heading: INT. GLOBE HOTEL ROOM 44 - MINUTES LATER (DAY)
text: COLE sits on the lumpy bed in the dingy room, watching RAILLY
text: pace back and forth like a mad woman.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Okay...you were standing there looking
dialog: at the moon...you were eating grass...
dialog: then what?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I thought I was in...prison again.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Just like that? You were in prison?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: No, not really. It's...it's in my
dialog: mind. Like you said.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: You disappeared! One minute you were
dialog: there, the next minute you were gone.
dialog: Did you run through the woods?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I don't know -- I don't remember.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: The boy in the well. How did you know
dialog: that was just a hoax?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: It was? I didn't...know.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I think I saw a TV show like that when
dialog: I was a kid. Where a boy...
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: IT WASN'T A TV SHOW! IT WAS REAL!
text: COLE looks at her. She's really upset.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Well, maybe that kid saw the same TV
dialog: show and copied it. Listen, you were
dialog: right, it's all in my head. I'm mentally
dialog: ill, I imagine all that stuff. I know
dialog: they're not real, I can trick them, make
dialog: them do what I want. I just worked on
dialog: them in my head and I got back here. I
dialog: can get better. I can stay here.
text: RAILLY pulls a photo from her purse, shows it to COLE.
text: It's the uncropped picture from her book, the photo of JOSE in
text: WWI with a fuzzy image of COLE on the edge of the frame,
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: What does this mean to you?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: ...I had a dream about...something
dialog: like that.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: You had a bullet from World War One in
dialog: your leg, James! How did it get there?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You said I had delusions -- that I
dialog: created a world -- you said you could
dialog: explain everything...
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Well, I can't. ... I mean...I'm trying
dialog: to. I can't believe that everything we
dialog: do or say has already happened, that we
dialog: can't change what's going to happen,
dialog: that I'm one of the three billion
dialog: people who are going to die...soon.
text: COLE stands, moves close to her.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I want to be here. In this time. With
dialog: you. I want to become...become a whole
dialog: person. I want this to be the present.
dialog: I want the future to be unknown.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: (sudden hopeful idea!)
dialog: James...do you remember...six years
dialog: ago...you had a phone number! You
dialog: tried to call and...
text: WHAM! The door flies open, kicked violently, the flimsy lock not
text: holding. A menacing figure stands in the doorway. WALLACE. A
text: wiry biker-type with jail house tattoos and mean eyes.
text: COLE and RAILLY are too stunned to say anything as WALLACE looks
text: them over coldly, insolently, then advances on RAILLY.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: This is my territory, bitch!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (confused, turns to Railly)
dialog: Is this real -- or is this one of my
dialog: delusions?
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: This is definitely real:
dialog: (to Wallace)
dialog: Excuse me, I think we have a little
dialog: misunderstanding here...
text: WALLACE smashes RAILLY in the face. She flies back against the
text: wall and onto the floor as WALLACE spins around to COLE who is
text: stepping toward him, but WALLACE is now holding a knife
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: What're you -- some kind of tough guy?
dialog: You wanna be a hero? You gonna try and
dialog: mess with me? Come on...
text: A beat. COLE puts his hands up placatingly as he backs around
text: WALLACE and moves to RAILLY, whose eye is already swelling.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Now that's a smart boy. But you,
dialog: honey, you think you can go 'round
dialog: me and peddle your fancy ass in this
dialog: part of town, you bet your life we got
dialog: what I would call a major goddamn
dialog: misunderstandin'.
text: RAILLY reaches a hand up to COLE for assistance, but, he grabs
text: her purse instead, swings it around, SMASHES WALLACE in the face
text: with it, then grabs the pimp's arm and SNAPS it like it was a
text: twig! The knife clatters to the floor as WALLACE yelps in pain
text: and COLE slams him to the floor, straddles his chest, retrieves
text: the near-by knife, and presses it sharply against WALLACE'S neck.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
speaker_heading: JAMES -- DON'T!
text: COLE hesitates.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: (eyes bulging)
dialog: You...heard...her. Don't do it, man.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: (gets up, looks around)
dialog: Put him in the closet, ... But get his
dialog: money first.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (amazed)
dialog: You want me to rob him?
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: I...I...We need cash, James.
text: A shadow. RAILLY turns toward the door and glimpses a FACE
text: disappearing, then hears SHOUTS from the hallway...
speaker_heading: SHOUTS (o.s.)
dialog: They're killing him! Call the cops.
text: Being very careful not to move his neck, WALLACE reaches into his
text: pocket and produces a thick roll of bills, which RAILLY grabs.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: You two are crazy. I got friends. You
dialog: put me in a closet, they're gonna be
dialog: really pissed.
text: COLE moves off Wallace and, keeping the knife close, yanks him to
text: his teeth while RAILLY hurries to the window and looks out.
text: HER POV: A fire escape leads down into an alley.
text: RAILLY turns just in time to see COLE shove WALLACE into the
text: bathroom, follow him in, slam the door behind them, and LOCK it.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: James, no!
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
scene_heading: RAILLY'S VOICE (from the other room)
dialog: (rattling the door knob)
dialog: James, what are you doing?
text: WALLACE cowers back against the shower stall.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: I have friends, man -- if you cut me...
text: WALLACE breaks off, bug-eyed, reacting to something we don't see!
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: What...the...fuck..are you doing???
scene_heading: INT. GLOBE MOTEL ROOM 44
text: RAILLY is pounding on the bathroom door now as, suddenly, it
text: opens and COLE steps out, the knife in his right hand, dripping
dialog: with blood.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Oh, my God, James. Did you kill him?
text: COLE shakes his head "no" as blood oozes from his mouth.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Just...just in case. In case I'm not
dialog: crazy...
dialog: (holds up two bloody molars)
dialog: That's how they find us. By our teeth.
dialog: (a beat, eye contact)
dialog: I don't want them to find me. Ever. I
dialog: don't want to go back.
text: RAILLY's astonishment turns to emotion as it dawns on her the
dialog: choice he's made. Given up the future (if it exists, and it's
dialog: looking like it does)! Risking his life to be with her! For
text: this brief time! She's overwhelmed, lips trembling, tears
text: welling in her eyes. But just then, the SOUNDS of SHOUTS and
text: feet THUNDERING up the stairs snap her back to reality.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL/GLOBE HOTEL
text: COPS' boots THUNDER up the stairwell.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 44/GLOBE HOTEL
text: In between nervous glances toward the door, RAILLY supervises as
text: COLE obediently blocks the bathroom door with the bureau.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Push it tight!
speaker_heading: WALLACE'S VOICE (from the bathroom)
dialog: NO PROBLEM! I'LL JUST STAY IN HERE!
dialog: DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
scene_heading: INT. 4TH FLOOR HALLWAY/GLOBE HOTEL
text: POLICE OFFICERS, led by the PLAINCLOTHES COP, make a cautious
text: entrance onto the 4th floor, guns drawn.
text: Seedy HOTEL RESIDENTS point to Room 44, then cower back into
dialog: their doorways.
scene_heading: EXT. GLOBE HOTEL FIRE ESCAPE/ALLEY - DAY
text: COLE and RAILLY clatter down the fire-escape, COLE in the lead.
text: They come to the end of the metal stairway. It's a long distance
text: to the ground. COLE jumps down, turns, reaches up to her.
text: She lets herself down to him. Their eyes meet. He holds her in
text: his arms for a moment. Then, reluctantly, he puts her down.
text: They start running down the alley.
scene_heading: INT. GLOBE HOTEL FOURTH FLOOR - DAY
text: The PLAINCLOTHES COP has his pistol out, his back to the wall
text: alongside the open doorway to Room 44. The UNIFORMED OFFICERS
text: are backing him up, weapons drawn.
speaker_heading: PLAINCLOTHES COP
dialog: POLICE! THROW YOUR WEAPONS OUT AND
dialog: COME OUTTA THERE!
dialog: No response.
scene_heading: INT. GLOBE HOTEL ROOM 44
text: The PLAINCLOTHES COP charges into the room in a crouch, pistol
text: extended in both hands. He pans the gun around the empty room.
text: HIS POV: the open window...the blood on the floor.
speaker_heading: WALLACE'S VOICE (from the bathroom)
dialog: HEY! ZAT THE POLICE! I'M AN INNOCENT
dialog: VICTIM IN HERE! I WAS ATTACKED BY A
text: COKED-UP WHORE AND A CRAZY DENTIST!
scene_heading: EXT. BUS STOP/DOWNTOWN - LATE AFTERNOON
text: A city bus disgorges a stream of PASSENGERS at a stop in the
text: toney downtown shopping district. Among them, RAILLY looks
text: furtively left and right, COLE on her heels. She's hidden her
text: bruised eye behind sun glasses; he's holding a bloody
text: handkerchief to his mouth.
text: As he steps to the sidewalk, COLE is overwhelmed by the bustling
text: city, the tall downtown buildings. His eyes go up.
text: COLE'S POV: a building, towering toward the sky. A building
dialog: with a ledge. The same ledge the lion prowled in the future!!!
text: ANGLE ON COLE, shaken, as RAILLY ushers him into the recessed
text: entrance to a store.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Wait here. I'm going to try that phone
dialog: number. Let's hope it's nothing!
text: Dazed by his experience and the flow of SHOPPERS, COLE watches
text: her hurry to a pay phone twenty yards away, his view of her made
text: intermittent by PEDESTRIANS streaming past him, their FACES
text: looming frighteningly close.
text: A BUSINESSMAN jostles COLE, forcing him back against the display
text: window. Turning, he faces the angry jaws of a BEAR only inches away
text: Recovering from a jolt of terror, COLE realizes the BEAR is a life-size
text: toy in the display window. Relieved, he looks back at RAILLY.
text: COLE'S POV: RAILLY, well out of earshot, speaking earnestly into
dialog: the phone.
text: ANGLE ON COLE, startled, as a BUSINESSMAN, mistaking him for a
text: panhandler, shoves a dollar into his hand. Confused, COLE stares
text: at the dollar, then turns to say something to the retreating
text: BUSINESSMAN, but just then he sees RAILLY rushing toward him,
text: eyes sparkling with happiness, LAUGHING, ebullient.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: James! James! It's okay. We're
dialog: insane! We're crazy!
text: COLE doesn't know how to respond, but a PASSERBY gives them a look.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: A Carpet Cleaning Company?
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: No superiors! No scientists. No
dialog: people from the future. It's just a
dialog: Carpet Cleaning Company. They have
dialog: voice mail -- you leave a message
dialog: telling them when you want your carpet
dialog: cleaned.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You... you left them a message?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: (impishly)
dialog: I couldn't resist. I was so relieved.
dialog: Wait'll they hear this nutty woman
dialog: telling them...they better watch out
dialog: for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...
text: Looking at her laughing face, COLE is struck with horror as he
text: realizes the truth! He starts to recite...
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: "The Army of the Twelve Monkeys --
dialog: they're the ones who are going to do
dialog: it. I can't do anything more. The
dialog: police are watching me."
text: Now she's stunned. She glances back and sees the phone booth
text: twenty yards away.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: You... you couldn't have heard me.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: They got your message, Kathryn. They
dialog: played it for me. It was a bad
dialog: recording...distorted. I didn't
dialog: recognize your voice.
text: RAILLY'S eyes fill with horror as she grasps the meaning.
text: ANGLE ON A UNIFORMED COP, staring out the window of a POLICE
text: CRUISER as it inches along in the bumper to bumper traffic.
text: Noticing something, he reaches for his radio.
text: ANGLE ON RAILLY, spotting the CRUISER, grabbing COLE, pulling him
dialog: into the CROWD.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Come on.
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE/MEN'S DEPARTMENT - 6:00 PM
text: RAILLY, whose sun glasses don't really hide her bruised eye, adds
text: a man's Hawaiian shirt to the pile of other men's things heaped
text: on a counter in front of a very suspicious CLERK.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: And this.
dialog: (turning)
dialog: Anything else?
text: But COLE'S not here. He's a short distance away...staring.
text: COLE'S POV: aisle after aisle of eager shoppers and a bounty of
dialog: brand new consumer goods.
text: ANGLE ON COLE, remembering another department store, dark and
text: full of moldering merchandise.
text: ANGLE ON RAILLY, turning again to the CLERK.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: I guess that's it.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Shall I put this on your account, Ma'am?
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: (producing Wallace's roll of bills)
dialog: No -- I'll pay cash.
text: The CLERK stares at the huge roll of bills!
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: What floor are the wigs on, please?
scene_heading: EXT. PEST CONTROL VAN - NIGHT
text: Surrounded by stripped and abandoned vehicles, the VAN, with a
text: PEST CONTROL logo on its side, is parked on a trash-littered
text: street beside the massive pillars of a towering freeway.
scene_heading: INT. PARKED PEST CONTROL VAN
text: The VAN is packed with SIX ACTIVISTS, SANDY and KWESKIN among
text: them, all wearing black. Some of them have climbing gear, tool
text: belts, all sorts of paraphernalia. KWESKIN is telling his story.
speaker_heading: KWESKIN
dialog: So then he goes into this incredible riff
dialog: about how his shrink, like, replicated
text: his brain while he was in the nut house.
dialog: Turned it into a computer.
speaker_heading: WELLER
dialog: And Fale believed it?
speaker_heading: KWESKIN
dialog: Oh, you know Fale! He's like, "If you
dialog: guys get nailed -- and I'm sure you will --
dialog: I never saw you before in nay life!"
text: LAUGHTER from all of them. Then, there's a sharp, rhythmic
text: series of RAPS on the side door, a signal.
text: POPE quickly slides the door open. It's JEFFREY...grinning.
text: Three other activists, GOINES, ICHIOKA, and BRUHNS, stagger out of
text: the darkness behind JEFFREY, lugging a huge, squirming GARBAGE BAG.
text: The van occupants react with murmurs of "Awwwwwright" and "Far
text: out", then they help maneuver the writhing bag into the van.
text: Then, JEFFREY and the other three scramble in, too.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Let's do it!
scene_heading: EXT. VAN/FREEWAY
text: The PEST CONTROL VAN lumbers up a ramp and onto the freeway.
scene_heading: INT. PEST CONTROL VAN/MOVING
text: The GARBAGE BAG squirms and grunts as JEFFREY holds a map under a
text: flashlight and goes over "the plan" with the other ACTIVISTS.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Okay, that's Stage One. In Stage Two,
dialog: Monkey Four is over here...
text: A loud GROAN from the bag distracts the others.
speaker_heading: GOINES
dialog: What's the harm in opening the bag?
text: His eyes are taped.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Yeah, it's cruel leaving him like that.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Ah, but cruelty is his specialty.
speaker_heading: ICHIOKA
dialog: So why should we be like him?
text: Shrugging cheerfully, JEFFREY tears open the garbage bag revealing
text: DR. MASON, trussed up, duct tape covering his eyes and mouth.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Want the full effect?
text: Grinning wickedly, JEFFREY rips the tape from his father's mouth.
speaker_heading: DR. MASON
dialog: Jeffrey? I know it's you, Jeffrey. I
dialog: recognize your voice.
text: JEFFREY puts his finger to his lips, silencing everyone.
speaker_heading: DR. MASON
dialog: JEFFREY??? ... Very well. You're out
dialog: of your mind, Jeffrey. I know all
dialog: about your insane plan. That woman --
dialog: your psychiatrist -- she told me.
text: JEFFREY raises his eyebrows. This he hadn't expected.
speaker_heading: DR. MASON
dialog: I didn't believe her -- it seemed too crazy
dialog: even for you. But, just in case, I took steps
dialog: to make sure you couldn't do it. I took myself
dialog: out of the loop! I don't have the code any
dialog: more. I don't have access to the virus. So,
dialog: go ahead -- torture me, but you can't extract
dialog: anything of use to yourself.
text: The ACTIVISTS are all exchanging puzzled looks.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: What...virus?
speaker_heading: DR. MASON
dialog: (spins his head toward Jeffrey)
dialog: She knew about it, Jeffrey. She knew
dialog: you were going to try this.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: What virus are we talking about, Dad?
speaker_heading: DR. MASON
dialog: You're insane, Jeffrey.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: You "develop" viruses and you're calling
dialog: me insane? Typical. What does this
dialog: virus attack? Don't tell me, you sick
dialog: fuck, it doesn't matter.
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: Have I ever "developed" a virus? Do I
dialog: put helpless animals in cages and measure
dialog: their reactions to electrical stimuli?
dialog: Do I inject radioactive substances into
dialog: living creatures and examine their
dialog: bowel movements? Wow! And I'm crazy!
speaker_heading: DR. MASON
dialog: Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly
dialog: are you going to do? I don't have to
dialog: tell you I'm afraid.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
text: THIS IS A FUCKING EXPERIMENT! YOU'RE
scene_heading: OUR HELPLESS LITTLE TEST ANIMAL, DADDY.
dialog: GOT THAT? NOW -- WHAT FUCKING VIRUS
dialog: HAVE YOU COME UP WITH, YOU DEMENTED
speaker_heading: FUCKING MANIAC?
scene_heading: INT. MOVIE SCREEN/THEATER - NIGHT

scene_heading: It's DAYTIME in Muir Woods. SCOTTY (JAMES STEWART) AND MADELINE
text: (KIM NOVAK) walk toward a display of a cross cut section of a
text: redwood tree. We're watching Hitchcock's VERTIGO.
text: SCOTTY (up on the screen)
dialog: Here's a cross section of one of the
text: old trees that's been cut down.
text: They look at the lines of the tree marked with cards that say,
scene_heading: "BIRTH OF CHRIST", "DISCOVERY OF AMERICA", "MAGNA CARTA SIGNED",
text: "1066 - BATTLE OF HASTINGS", and "1930 TREE CUT DOWN".
text: ANGLE ON THE THEATER AUDIENCE, empty seats dimly visible in the
text: flickering light, a few shadowy MOVIEGOERS scattered here and there.
text: ANGLE ON THE SCREEN, MADELINE pointing, saying with profound melancholy.
speaker_heading: MADELINE (up on the screen)
dialog: Somewhere in here I was born. And here
dialog: -- I die. There's only a moment for
dialog: you. You don't notice.
text: ANGLE ON THE AUDIENCE, a shadowy COUPLE near the back of the
dialog: theater. WE CAN'T REALLY SEE THEM, but we recognize their VOICES
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Here, let me help you.
text: The theater is briefly illuminated by a very bright scene on the
text: screen, revealing enough of COLE and RAILLY for us to see she's
text: doing something to his upper lip while he tries to watch the movie.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I think I've seen this movie before.
dialog: When I was a kid. It was on TV.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: (fussing with his upper lip)
dialog: Shh -- don't talk. Hold still.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (moving his head to see the film)
dialog: I have seen it, but I don't remember
dialog: this part. Funny, it's like what's
dialog: happening to us, like the past. The
dialog: movie never changes -- it can't change
dialog: -- but everytime you see it, it seems
dialog: to be different because you're different

speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: If we can't change anything...because
dialog: it's already happened, then we ought to

speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Flowers! What flowers?
text: From the darkness, a MOVIE PATRON makes a SSSSHHHHH shound.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: It's an expression. Here...
text: She's pulling something from a shopping bag at her feet, placing
text: it on COLE'S head, adjusting it...
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Why are we doing this?
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: So we can stick our heads out the
dialog: window and feel the wind and listen to
dialog: the music. So we can appreciate what
dialog: we have while we have it. Forgive me,
dialog: psychiatrists don't cry.
text: There are tears in her eyes. They discomfit COLE.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you're
dialog: wrong. Maybe we're both crazy.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: In a few weeks, it will have started or
dialog: it won't. If there are still baseball
text: games and traffic jams, armed robberies
dialog: and boring TV shows -- we'll be so
dialog: happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves
dialog: in to the police.
speaker_heading: SHADOWY MOVIEGOER
speaker_heading: SHHHHHHH
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Where can we hide for a few weeks?
text: ANGLE ON THE SCREEN, where SCOTTY and MADELINE are in the foreground,

speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: You said you'd never seen the ocean...
scene_heading: EXT. GORILLA'S PEN/ZOO - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON A GORILLA, by moonlight, angry, a true nightmare vision.
text: URGENT WHISPERS off screen, RUSTLING SOUNDS. Then, METAL ON METAL.
text: Only now are we aware that the GORILLA is in an outdoor zoo pen
text: with phony rocks. Stalking back and forth. Huge. Upset.
text: CLANK. CLANK. METAL ON METAL. GRUNTS of effort, then, DR.
text: MASON'S VOICE, plaintive, frightened.
speaker_heading: DR. MASON'S VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: What are you doing to me? Where are
dialog: we? Jeffrey, please...
speaker_heading: SANDY'S VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: For God's sake, put the tape back on
dialog: his mouth!
text: The GORILLA bellows angrily, beating his chest.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY'S VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Forget the tape. The monkey's louder than
dialog: he is. You gonna tape the monkey's mouth?
scene_heading: EXT. PANTHERS' PEN/ZOO - NIGHT
text: Under the full moon, PANTHERS pace back and forth, back and
text: forth, uttering ominous guttural SNARLS.
scene_heading: EXT. LION'S PEN/ZOO
text: The KING OF BEASTS gives a deep, fierce ROAR. From the darkness,
text: unseen ELEPHANTS TRUMPET their response.
scene_heading: EXT. AVIARIES/ZOO
text: A PANDEMONIUM of WINGS RUSTLING, the sharp metallic CLINKING of
text: metal on metal, the MUTTER of HUMAN VOICES, then a cacophonous
text: CRESCENDO of frenzied SCREECHING as PARROTS, COCKATOOS and other
text: EXOTIC BIRDS careen madly in their cages.
scene_heading: INT. MOVIE THEATER AUDITORIUM
text: CLOSE ON COLE, dozing fitfully, as the SOUNDS of SCREAMING BIRDS
text: continue. Suddenly, he comes awake with a start...sees the movie
text: filling his field of vision.
text: HIS POV: the MOVIE SCREEN. TIPPI HEDRIN, overwhelmed by
text: screeching BIRDS in an attic in Hitchcock's THE BIRDS.
text: ANGLE ON COLE, orienting himself, looking around. Empty seats on
text: both sides of him. He's alone. He panics.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Kathryn?!
scene_heading: INT. THEATER LOBBY
text: A lobby poster boasts "Classics 24 Hours A Day" and "Hitchcock
text: Festival". PANNING OFF the poster, passing a SNORING USHER, dead
text: to the world in an old velvet chair, WE DISCOVER a BRUNETTE in a
text: tight dress, just hanging up the lobby pay phone. Turning, she
text: reveals heavy make-up, gaudy costume jewelry, and sun glasses.
text: She's the BRUNETTE in COLE'S DREAM! Crossing the lobby toward
dialog: the auditorium, it's a pleasure to watch her nice body undulate
text: in the tight dress.
text: Just then, the auditorium doors burst open and a BLONDE MAN in a
text: Hawaiian shirt appears, the man from COLE'S DREAM, except this
text: man's moustache is fixed firmly on his upper lip. The BLONDE MAN
text: stops, stunned at the sight of the BRUNETTE.
speaker_heading: BRUNETTE
dialog: We're booked on a 9:30 flight to Key West.
text: The Brunette is RAILLY, no longer the frazzled professional,
text: revealed now by her disguise as a sexy babe. The Blonde Man is
text: COLE! He's confused.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You were in my dream just now. I
dialog: didn't recognize you.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Well, you look pretty different, too.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize
dialog: it was you. Then...I woke up and I...I
dialog: thought you were gone.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: (studies him seriously)
dialog: I remember you...like this. I feel
dialog: I've known you before. I feel I've
dialog: always known you.
text: Their eyes lock. Suddenly, she backs up, gently maneuvering him
text: with her, past the sleeping USHER, to and through an unlocked,
text: unmarked door, then closing it behind them.
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE ROOM/MOVIE THEATER
text: RAILLY and COLE are in a dimly lit cluttered storage room. She
text: kisses him hungrily amid the brooms, plastic trash barrels, other
text: janitorial items. COLE responds to her passion as they move
text: deeper into the room, its walls covered with old movie posters.
text: Tearing at each other's clothes, they collapse on a rolled
text: theater curtain among stacks of ancient theater seats.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBS - DAWN
text: The red rim of the rising sun is just becoming visible beyond the
text: silhouetted roofs of an upper middle-class suburban neighborhood.
text: The early light is so vague that when a huge SIBERIAN TIGER pads
text: across a neatly-trimmed lawn, he's more a shadowy vision than
dialog: reality. Did we really see him at all?
scene_heading: EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAWN
text: The rising sun flares behind the towering silhouette of an unfinished
text: building, deserted in the early morning light. High up, a MONKEY
text: his head around a girder.
text: Four stories below, other MONKEYS are climbing.
scene_heading: EXT. SHOPPING MALL - DAWN
text: Deserted in the first light of dawn, the stores face each other
text: across a broad promenade with blank staring windows.
text: Nothing happens. For a long moment. Then, an AFRICAN BULL
text: ELEPHANT appears, turning the corner, lumbering toward us along
text: the promenade, raising his trunk to TRUMPET triumphantly to the
text: other ELEPHANTS trotting into view behind him.
scene_heading: INT. TAXICAB/CITY STREETS - EARLY MORNING
text: A fiftyish WOMAN CABBIE with white hair and a Southern twang is
text: at the wheel of the cab.
speaker_heading: WOMAN CABBlE
dialog: What time's your flight, friends?
text: In the back seat, COLE, in the blonde wig and moustache, looks to
text: his companion, the sexy babe in sun glasses and heavy make-up, RAILLY.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Nine thirty
speaker_heading: WOMAN CABBIE
dialog: Might be tight.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: (startled, checks her watch)
dialog: Tight? My watch says 7:30.
speaker_heading: WOMAN CABBIE
dialog: On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a
dialog: time, but today, gotta take inta account
dialog: your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: What? What did you say?
speaker_heading: WOMAN CABBIE
dialog: Twelve Monkeys, honey. Guess you folks
dialog: didn't turn on your radio this morning.
text: COLE and RAILLY exchange a quick look.
speaker_heading: WOMAN CABBIE
dialog: Bunch a weirdoes let all the animals outta
dialog: the zoo last night. Then they locked up
text: this big shot scientist in one of the cages.
dialog: Scientist's own kid was one a the ones did it!
text: RAILLY and COLE stare at the cabbie, stunned.
speaker_heading: WOMAN CABBlE
dialog: Now they got animals all over the
dialog: place. Buncha zebras shut down the
dialog: thruway 'bout an hour ago and some
dialog: kinda thing called an "e-mu" it's got
text: traffic blocked for miles over on 22.
text: Flabbergasted, RAILLY'S eyes suddenly fill with hope.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: That's what they were up to! Freeing
dialog: animals!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: On the walls -- they meant the animals
dialog: when they said, "We did it."
speaker_heading: WOMAN CABBIE
dialog: You can hear it on the radio all the
dialog: stations...
text: As the WOMAN CAEBIE switches on the RADIO, RA:LLY points and COLE
text: follows her look.
text: COLE'S POV: two CHEETAHS, sleek and magnificent against the
text: cityscape, streaking past the cab at ninety mph!
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER/RADIO (o.s.)
dialog: In the meantime, numerous animal rights
dialog: activists have joined the chorus
dialog: condemning what they're calling the
dialog: "loose canon" activities of Jeffrey
dialog: Mason and his Army of the Twelve
dialog: Monkeys.
speaker_heading: RIGHTS ACTIVIST/RADIO (o.s.)
dialog: Can these fools seriously believe that
dialog: releasing a captive animal into an
dialog: urban environment is being compassionate
dialog: to the animal? It's mindlessly cruel,
dialog: almost as indefensible as holding the
text: animal in captivity in the first place.
text: RAILLY and COLE are watching FLAMINGOS cross the sky against a
text: backdrop of skyscrapers in silhouette.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Maybe it's going to be okay.
scene_heading: INT. TICKET COUNTER/AIRPORT TERMINAL - MORNING

text: while the airport P.A. SYSTEM DRONES in the b.g..

text: at one end of the ticket counter.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: Tell your people if they spot either

text: ANGLE ON RAILLY AND COLE, thirty yards away, entering the terminal.
speaker_heading: P.A. SYSTEM
dialog: -- Flight 531 for Chicago is now ready
dialog: for boarding at Gate Seventeen.
text: ANGLE ON COLE, reacting to the P.A., stopping, seeing the

speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I know this place! ... This is my dream.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Airports all look the same. Maybe
dialog: it's...
dialog: (turning, reacting)
dialog: James! Your moustache! It's slipping.
text: But COLE isn't listening. He's looking around, mesmerized.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: It's not just my dream. I was actually
dialog: here! I remember now. My parents
dialog: brought me to meet my uncle. About a
dialog: week or two before...before...before
dialog: everybody started dying.
text: RAILLY glances around nervously.
text: RAILLY'S POV: two UNIFORMED POLICEMEN, strolling through the
text: lobby, their eyes scanning the faces of TRAVELERS.
text: ANGLE ON RAILLY, pulling a small tube from her purse.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: They may be looking for us, James.
dialog: (placing the tube in his hand)
dialog: Use this. You can fix it in the Men's Room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (confounded)
dialog: I was here...as a kid. I think you
dialog: were here, too. But you...looked just
dialog: like you look now.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: (getting desperate)
dialog: James, if we're identified, they're
dialog: going to send us someplace...but not to
dialog: Key West!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (snaps out of it, hand to moustache)
dialog: Right! You're right. I have to fix this.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: (indicating a sign)
dialog: I'll get the tickets and meet you... in
dialog: the Gift Shop.
text: COLE follows her look, nods, then heads for the Men's Room as
text: RAILLY, in sun glasses, gaudy outfit, high heels, starts clip
text: clopping toward the ticket counter, her ass attracting admiring
dialog: glances.
scene_heading: INT. TELEPHONES/LOBBY - DAY
text: BUSINESS TRAVELERS huddle over pay phones, talking earnestly, as
text: COLE walks past on his way to the Men's Room.
text: Seeing an unoccupied phone, COLE hesitates, considers it. Coming
text: to a decision, he reaches into his pocket, pulls out some change.
scene_heading: INT. TZCKET COUNTER/TERMINAL
text: CLOSE ON the flyer of COLE and RAILLY taped under the counter,
text: hidden from the customers, but in clear view of the TICKET AGENT
text: who has just finished serving a PORTLY GENTLEMAN. The GENTLEMAN
text: walks away.
text: ANGLE ON RAILLY, stepping up to the counter, smiling, looking
text: nothing like the Railly on the flyer.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Judy Simmons. I have reservations for
dialog: Key West.
scene_heading: INT. PAY PHONES/TERMINAL
text: COLE is speaking into the phone very low, very private, very intense.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Listen, I don't know whether you're
dialog: there or not. Maybe you just clean
dialog: carpets. If you do, you're lucky --
dialog: you're gonna live a long, happy life.
dialog: But if you other guys exist and you're
dialog: picking this up -- forget about the
dialog: Army of The Twelve Monkeys -- they
dialog: didn't do it. It was a mistake'
dialog: Someone else did it. The Army of The
dialog: Twelve Monkeys are just dumb kids
dialog: playing revolutionaries. It was
dialog: someone else!
text: COLE looks around nervously, catches a BUSINESSMAN at the next
text: phone looking away quickly. COLE touches his loose moustache as
text: he averts his face and speaks into the phone in an urgent whisper.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I've done my job. I did what you wanted.
dialog: Good luck. I'm not coming back!
text: COLE hangs up the phone, looks around, catches a few stares.
text: Averting his face, he heads for the Men's Room.
scene_heading: INT. TICKET COUNTER - DAY
text: The TICKET AGENT is counting out a stack of bills.
speaker_heading: TICKET AGENT
dialog: Don't see a lot of this... cash.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: It's...a long story.
speaker_heading: TICKET AGENT
dialog: (smiles, hands over the tickets)
dialog: They'll begin boarding in about twenty
dialog: minutes. Have a nice flight, Mrs. Simmons.
text: Turning to go, RAILLY fumbles the tickets while trying to put
text: them in her purse and they flutter to the floor. As she kneels
text: to retrieve them, WE SEE the long line of waiting TRAVELERS from
text: the waist down. WE SEE a familiar Chicago Bulls Sports Bag
text: resting on the floor beside sneakers and gaudy baggy pants.
dialog: we've seen this outfit before...in COLE'S dream...on MR. PONYTAIL!
scene_heading: INT. MEN'S ROOM/AIRPORT - DAY
text: The P.A. DRONES as CCLE, head down, lingers at a sink, washing
text: and rewashing his hands while another TRAVELER finishes drying
text: his hands, gives COLE a quizzical look, then leaves.
text: Quickly, COLE glances around, checks the seemingly empty Men's
text: Room, then takes the tube of adhesive from his pocket, puts some
text: goop under the loose edge of his moustache and presses it firmly
text: against his face as he leans close to the mirror.
speaker_heading: RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Got yourself a prob, Bob?
text: COLE whirls, looks for the source of the VOICE. Nothing! Until
text: he spots shoes peeking from dropped trousers indicating an
dialog: occupied stall. It must be him!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Leave me alone! I made a report. I
dialog: didn't have to do that.
speaker_heading: RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: Point of fact -- you don't belong here.
dialog: It's not permitted to let you stay.
text: A toilet FLUSHES in the "occupied" stall. COLE'S answer is loud
text: and defiant.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: This is the present. This is not the past.
dialog: This is not the future. This is right now!
text: A PLUMP BUSINESSMAN emerges from the "occupied" stall, gives COLE
text: a wary look and a wide berth as he heads for a sink.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I'm staying here! You got that? You
dialog: can't stop me!
speaker_heading: PLUMP MAN
dialog: (high pitched voice)
dialog: Anything you say, chief. It's none of
dialog: my business.
text: COLE looks dismayed. This guy couldn't be "THE VOICE"! And there
text: are no feet showing under the other stalls. Did he imagine it?
scene_heading: INT. TICKET COUNTER - DAY
text: The Chicago Bulls bag! It's on the counter in front of the
text: TICKET AGENT who's reviewing a stack of tickets in awe...
speaker_heading: TICKET AGENT
dialog: Woooo-eeee. San Francisco, New

scene_heading: INT. TERMINAL LOBBY
text: COLE emerges from the Men's Room, shaken, paranoid. He glances
text: around nervously. Then, keeping his head down, he starts walking
text: toward the Gift Shop. Before he gets more than a few steps,
text: someone suddenly grabs his shoulder from behind.
speaker_heading: FAMILIAR VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: You gotta be crazy, man!
text: COLE whirls, finds himself facing a Puerto Rican youth in an L.A.
text: Raiders jacket, a sideways baseball cap, and mirrored sun glasses
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Jo...Jose????
speaker_heading: JOSE
dialog: Pulling out the tooth, man, that was
dialog: nuts! Here, take this.
text: JOSE tries to slip COLE a 9mm pistol. Astonished, COLE resists!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: What? What for? Are you crazy?
text: Frustrated, JOSE conceals the gun but keeps a grip on COLE'S arm.
speaker_heading: JOSE
dialog: Me? Are you kiddin? You're the one!
dialog: You were a hero, man. They gave you a
dialog: pardon! And whadda you do? You come
dialog: back and fuck with your teeth! Wow!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: How did you find me?
speaker_heading: JOSE
dialog: The phone call, man. The phone call.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: The call I just made? Five minutes ago?
speaker_heading: JOSE
dialog: Hey, five minutes ago, thirty years ago!
dialog: Yes, that phone call. I been in training
dialog: for this a couple a months now -- ever
dialog: since I got back from that... "weird"

scene_heading: INT. GIFT SHOP/TERMINAL - DAY
text: RAILLY takes a travel book on Key West from a rack, considers it,
text: includes it with several magazines she's holding. She doesn't
text: notice MR. PONYTAZL enter the Gift Shop behind her!
text: The P.A. System DRONES flight info as RAILLY checks her watch and
text: frowns. It's getting late and where's Cole? She turns, heads
dialog: for the cash register to make her purchases.
text: MR. PONYTAIL, seen from behind, is at the cash register already.
text: He sets a newspaper on the counter and searches for change.
text: The paper features a banner headline..."ANIMALS SET FREE" and a
text: sub head..."PROMINENT SCIENTIST FOUND LOCKED IN GORILLA CAGE"
text: over a photo of DR. MASON being released from the cage and
text: another photo of a GORILLA perched atop a parked car.
text: Stepping in line behind MR. PONYTAIL, RAILLY checks her watch
text: again. Then, MR. PONYTAIL, having paid, turns to go and RAILLY
text: looks up and sees his face. though it is not visible to us.
text: Startled, RAILLY frowns. Does she know this man?
text: MR. PONYTAIL pauses for a moment, considering the babe in the
text: shades, gaudy earrings, the tight skirt, and high heels.
dialog: RAILLY doesn't recognize the man, but we do! He's DR. MASON'S
dialog: ASSISTANT, DR. PETERS...the man who attended RAILLY's lecture!
text: Smiling, DR. PETERS steps around RAILLY and exits the Gift Shop.
text: Still puzzled, RAILLY puts her purchases on the counter and the
text: CLERK starts ringing them up as a DELIVERY MAN comes in and drops
text: a bundle of newspapers at her feet.
text: RAILLY'S POV: the front page shows a photo of three frightened
text: GIRAFFES in freeway gridlock under a headline proclaiming, "TERRORISTS
text: CREATE CHAOS". Further down are two more photos...DR. MASON in the
text: gorilla cage and a file photo of DR. MASON in his lab.
text: CLOSE ON THE SHOT OF DR. MASON in his lab. There's someone else

scene_heading: MEMORY FLASHBACK! INT. RECEPTION ROOM/BREITROSE HALL - NIGHT
text: RAILLY looks up from the book she's signing and sees DR. PETERS.
speaker_heading: DR. PETERS
dialog: Isn't it obvious that "Chicken Little"
dialog: represents the sane vision and that

dialog: is the cry of the true lunatic?
scene_heading: INT. GIFT SHOP - DAY
text: RAILLY, stunned, stares in the direction PETERS/PONYTAIL went.

speaker_heading: P.A SYSTEM

speaker_heading: JOSE
dialog: Coma on, Cole, don't be an asshole.
dialog: (then, blurting it out)
dialog: Look, I got orders, man! You know what
dialog: I'm sposed to do if you don't go along?
dialog: I'm sposed to shoot the lady! You got
dialog: that? They said, "If Cole don't obey
dialog: this time, Garcia, you gotta shoot his

text: COLE stops in his tracks, blown away, too stunned to speak.
speaker_heading: JOSE
dialog: I got no choice, man. These are my
dialog: orders. Just take it, okay?
text: COLE accepts the gun this time, resigned now. They've got him.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: This part isn't about the virus, is it?
speaker_heading: JOSE
dialog: Hey, man...
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: It's about obeying, about doing what
dialog: you're told.
speaker_heading: JOSE
dialog: They gave you a pardon, man. Whatdaya
dialog: want?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Who am I supposed to shoot?
text: Just then, RAILLY rushes up to COLE, not even noticing JOSE.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: James! Thank God! I thought you'd
dialog: disappeared. Listen, I think I know
dialog: who it is! I saw him! It's Dr. Mason's
dialog: assistant. An apocalypse nut! The next
text: flight to San Francisco leaves from Gate 38.
dialog: If he's there, it has to be him.
text: JOSE, having heard this, steps back into the crowd as RAILLY
text: grabs COLE and pulls him toward the Security Check Points.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I love you, Kathryn. Remember that.
text: She doesn't hear him or see the look of doom in his eyes.
speaker_heading: RAILLY

text: ANGLE ON A SECURITY OFFICER, watching the x-ray monitor.

scene_heading: INT. END OF LINE/SECURITY CHECK POINT

speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Oh, God, we don't have time for this.
text: ANGLE ON THE SECURITY CHECK POINT, where DR. PETERS unpacks his

speaker_heading: DR. PETERS
dialog: Biological samples. I have the
dialog: paperwork right here.
text: DR. PETERS produces a sheaf of official papers while the SECURITY

speaker_heading: SECURITY OFFICER
dialog: I'm going to have to ask you to open
dialog: this, sir.
speaker_heading: DR. PETERS
dialog: Open it?
dialog: (blinks stupidly, then)
dialog: Of course.

text: SECURITY OFFICER'S POV: RAILLY, trying to explain something to a
scene_heading: SECOND SECURITY OFFICER.
text: ANGLE ON THE TWO DETECTIVES, nearby, showing interest in the
dialog: commotion.
text: ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, oblivious to the fuss, pulling a closed

speaker_heading: DR. PETERS
dialog: Here! You see? Biological! Check the
dialog: papers -- it's all proper. I have a
dialog: permit.
speaker_heading: SECURITY OFFICER
dialog: It's empty!
text: Indeed, it looks like a sealed clear glass tube with nothing in it.
speaker_heading: DR. PETERS
dialog: Well, yes, to be sure, it looks empty!
dialog: But I assure you, it's not.
text: ANGLE ON RAILLY, at the end of the line, arguing with the SECOND
scene_heading: SECURITY OFFICER.
speaker_heading: RAILLY
dialog: Please listen to me -- this is very urgent!
speaker_heading: SECOND SECURITY OFFICER
dialog: You'll have to get in line, ma'am.
speaker_heading: TRAVELER
dialog: We're all in a hurry, lady. What's so
dialog: special about you?
text: ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, producing the glass tubes from the other

speaker_heading: DR. PETERS
dialog: You see! Also invisible to the naked eye.
text: A beat. OR. PETERS grins suddenly, opens one of the glass tubes,
text: and waves it under the SECURITY OFFICER'S nose!
speaker_heading: DR. PETERS
text: It doesn't even have an odor.
text: The SECURITY OFFICER glances up, sees what DR. PETERS is doing,
text: and smiles as he hands the papers back to the scientist.
speaker_heading: SECURITY OFFICER
dialog: That's not necessary, sir. Here you
dialog: go. Thanks for your cooperation. Have
dialog: a good flight.
text: Hastily, DR. PETERS snatches up all the tubes and cylinders and

text: ANGLE ON RAILLY, raging as the SECOND SECURITY OFFICER jabs her
dialog: with his finger.
speaker_heading: SECOND SECURITY OFFICER
dialog: Who are you calling a "moron"?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Get your hands off her!
text: The SECOND SECURITY OFFICER stiffens for trouble.
