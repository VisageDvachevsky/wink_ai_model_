scene_heading: SCENE 1 - INT. APARTMENT - DAY
dialog: 
text: The hallway is a mess. A window opening onto a light well is
dialog: open.
dialog: 
text: The door to the apartment is suddenly broken open. A plain-
text: clothes detective, two uniformed police officers and several
text: firemen - also in uniform - enter and look around. They all
text: wear gloves and masks that cover their mouths and noses.
text: Behind them, the superintendent and his wife also push their
text: way in. They're both holding their noses. In his free hand,
text: the superintendent holds a pile of mail and promotional
text: flyers. Behind him, comes a female neighbor.
dialog: 
scene_heading: PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE
dialog: (to the superintendent and the
speaker_heading: NEIGHBOR)
dialog: Wait Outside please.
dialog: 
text: He signals to a police officer who herds the curious
text: onlookers back out through the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: (to the superintendent, pointing to
dialog: a pile of mail)
dialog: What's the date of the last letter?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUPERINTENDENT
speaker_heading: (VERIFYING)
dialog: The 16th from what I can see...
dialog: Wait...
dialog: 
text: The plain-clothes detective has tried in vain to open the
text: door on the left. It has been sealed up with adhesive tape.
dialog: 
scene_heading: PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE
dialog: (to the fire officer)
dialog: Can you try?
dialog: 
text: While the firemen go to work on the door, the plain-clothes
text: detective goes into the adjoining dining room. He opens the
text: windows quickly and turns to go into the room to the left via
text: the double doors. They are locked and the gaps are also taped
text: up. He turns to the right and goes into the living room,
text: where he also opens up the windows...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FIREMAN (O.S.)
text: The door is open.
dialog: 
text: ...and comes back into the hallway, passing by the waiting
text: firemen. Once again, we hear snatches of dialogue between the
text: police officer and the janitor.
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANITOR
dialog: ...no as far as I know. During the
dialog: whole time, they had a nurse, but
dialog: it's been a while since I last saw
dialog: her. My wife has been...
dialog: 
text: The plain-clothes detective enters the bedroom which is now
text: accessible. Its windows are open and the draft makes the
text: curtains billow into the room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE
dialog: (to the firemen who are now curious
dialog: enough to come and stand by the
speaker_heading: DOOR)
dialog: Did you open the windows?
dialog: 
text: The firemen shake their heads.
dialog: 
text: The PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE turns toward the big double bed
text: placed against the back wall of the bedroom. On the right-
text: hand bed, there's only the bare mattress. On the left-hand
text: bed lies the partly decomposed body of an old woman. Where
text: once there were eyes, now there are only gaping holes. The
text: corpse has been neatly dressed and is adorned with flowers
text: that have already dried out a little. On her chest is a
text: crucifix.

dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 3 - INT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: All we see is the audience pouring into the hall. GEORGES and
text: ANNE, both are around eighty, are part of this crowd. They go
text: to their seats in one of the rows near the front. Once
text: everybody is seated, we hear the usual ANNOUNCEMENT asking
text: people to turn off their mobile phones. Some people, caught
text: with their phones switched on, hasten to comply. Then the
text: lights go out. APPLAUSE.
dialog: 
text: Off-screen, we hear the soloist make his entrance. THROATS
text: ARE CLEARED here and there. Finally, the MUSIC begins.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 4 - INT. ARTISTS DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The music from Scene 3 continues. The soloist is surrounded
text: by admirers who congratulate him.
dialog: 
text: Now Georges and Anne push their way into the room. (If the
dialog: soloist is female, they will be carrying flowers, like most
dialog: of the others).
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: When the soloist notices their presence, he leaves his group
text: of fans, heads towards them and greets them very warmly,
text: visibly glad to see them.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 5 - INT. BUS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Continuation of the MUSIC from Scene 3.
dialog: 
text: Georges and Anne are seated side by side in the half empty
text: bus. Anne talks enthusiastically, Georges says something from
text: time to time, and smiles now and then. They are both relaxed
dialog: and happy.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 6 - INT. APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The door to the apartment is unlocked and opened from the
text: outside. THE MUSIC ENDS.
dialog: 
text: Georges comes in, turns on the light. He and Anne observe the
text: open door. Around the lock, one can see the traces of an
dialog: attempted forced entry.
dialog: 
text: Georges bends down and runs his fingers over the deep
text: grooves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: They used a screwdriver or
dialog: something like that...it doesn't
dialog: look very professional...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: But who would do something like
dialog: that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: No idea. Why do people break in?
dialog: Because they want to steal
dialog: something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: From us?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: (laughs briefly out loud)
dialog: Hey, why not? If I thought about
dialog: it, I could come up with at least
dialog: three or four people we know who've
text: been burgled.
dialog: 
text: After having examined the outside of the second leaf of the
text: double door, he comes in, closing the door behind him.
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: What time is it? Can't we call the
dialog: superintendent?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: I'll do that tomorrow morning.
dialog: Anyway, they didn't see anything.
dialog: 
text: He unbuttons his overcoat and heads toward the large closet
text: in the hallway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't let it spoil your good mood
dialog: now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Or the police?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Come on, give me your coat.
dialog: 
text: She goes toward him, he takes her coat off and hangs it with
text: his in the closet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Imagine if we were here, in our
text: beds, and someone broke in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Why should I imagine that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: But it's terrible! I think I'd die
dialog: of fright.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: So would I.
dialog: 
text: He undoes his shoes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Shall we have a drink?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: I'm tired.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: I still fancy a drink.
dialog: 
text: He puts away his shoes with the others and slips on his
text: slippers. Anne has gone into the bathroom.
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE (O.S.)
dialog: Go ahead then. Mathilde told me
dialog: that in her building, the attic
dialog: apartment was burgled from the
text: loft. They just knocked a hole in
text: the wall, cut out all of the
dialog: valuable pictures from their frames
dialog: and disappeared without a trace.
dialog: 
text: He goes toward the kitchen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: They must have been professionals.
dialog: 
text: As he passes in front of the bathroom, he stops and appears
text: to be looking at Anne.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Did I tell you, you looked good
dialog: tonight?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SHORT PAUSE. THEN:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE (O.S.)
speaker_heading: (FLATTERED)
dialog: What's got into you?
dialog: 
text: With a gentle LAUGH, Georges disappears into the kitchen,
text: where he turns on the lights. We hear him FIDDLING AROUND,
text: apparently getting a glass and some wine. After a short
speaker_heading: PAUSE:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Weren't those semiquavers in the
dialog: presto incredible? What staccato!
dialog: Don't you agree?
dialog: 
dialog: Short PAUSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (O.S.)
dialog: You're proud of him, huh?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 7 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Georges wakes up. He looks with amazement beside him, then
text: raises his eyes. Anne is sitting upright, her back against
text: the headboard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Something wrong?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: No.
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: After a while, the RINGING of a kitchen egg-timer leads us to
text: the next scene.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 8 - INT. KITCHEN - DAY
dialog: 
text: The egg timer in the kitchen RINGS.
dialog: 
text: Georges is seated in front of the window, at a table which is
text: half set for breakfast. He has mobile phone raised to his ear
text: and a phone book opened in front of him. Anne is getting up
text: from the table. She goes toward the stove, turns off the gas,
text: takes the egg out of the pan with a spoon and runs it under
text: cold water. Like Georges, she is still in her robe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: What about next week? No but still,
dialog: it would make sense to get it done
dialog: soon. It might give people silly
dialog: ideas. And anyway, it's too ugly to
dialog: look at... Wednesday? What time?
dialog: OK... Will you bring the paint with
dialog: you too, to paint over it? But at
dialog: least some primer...Yes, OK. Thank
dialog: you.
dialog: 
text: He hangs up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO ANNE)
dialog: You can depend on that guy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
text: (who comes back to the table with
dialog: the egg) I hope so. The last time,
dialog: he kept us waiting for ages, if you
dialog: remember.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: (laughs while acquiescing)
dialog: Yes, that's true. (Reacting when
text: she places the egg in his egg cup)
dialog: Thanks. If I call a regular
dialog: professional, we'll still be
dialog: waiting two months time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: (more to herself)
dialog: Really?
dialog: 
text: She has sat down. Looks straight ahead. He cracks open his
text: egg, puts salt on it, eats.
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: The Frodons waited three days when
dialog: their toilet was blocked. Not
dialog: exactly pleasant.
dialog: 
text: He eats. Wants to put on more salt, but the saltcellar is
text: empty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
text: The saltcellar is empty.
dialog: 
text: He looks up for an instant, as if he expected her to deal
text: with it. As she doesn't react, he realizes the
text: inappropriateness of such an expectation, gets up himself,
text: heads for the kitchen cupboards and fills the salt cellar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know if he's going to bring
dialog: us the CD. Maybe he won't come at
dialog: all. In any case, he didn't mention
dialog: it. I'd like to buy it. It was
dialog: really good and I don't want to
dialog: wait long for it. We could go to
dialog: Virgin this afternoon and buy it.
dialog: What do you say?
dialog: 
text: He comes back to the table and sits down again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Hmmm? Anne? What's the matter?
dialog: 
text: She looks at him and doesn't answer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: What's going on? What's the matter?
dialog: 
text: He waves his hand in front of her eyes and laughs nervously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Helllloooo!!! Cuckoo!!! I'm here!
dialog: 
text: She continues to look at him without reacting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: (serious now) Anne! What's going
dialog: on?
dialog: 
text: He waits, looks at her. No reaction. He stands up slightly,
text: leans over the table to sit beside her. Tries to make her
text: turn toward him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Anne, what's the matter?
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He manages to get her torso to turn halfway toward him, but
text: her eyes look through him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Anne...what's...
dialog: 
text: He takes her face in both hands and turns toward him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Anne...
dialog: 
text: She stares into the void. He drops his hands. Then sits
text: beside her, for quite awhile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SILENCE
dialog: 
text: Finally he gets up, heads for the sink, turns on the tap,
text: wets a tea towel, wrings it out a little, comes back and
text: places it on Anne's face. Waits for a reaction that doesn't
text: come. Then he pulls up her hair in the nape of her neck and
text: applies the cloth there. Then sits down and looks at her
text: imploringly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: (close to tears)
dialog: Anne...Darling...please!
dialog: 
text: Once again they both remain seated. In the background, we
text: hear the GUSHING of the tap that in his panic he has
dialog: forgotten to turn it off.
dialog: 
text: Making a sudden decision, he gets up, rapidly crossing the
text: hallway, he goes into the bedroom where he starts to dress
text: agitatedly, which takes him quite a lot of time. Suddenly,
text: the GUSHING of the tap stops, which had accompanied us as far
dialog: as the bedroom.
dialog: 
text: George doesn't notice it immediately, then he stops short.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Anne?
dialog: 
text: Finally he returns, half dressed, into the kitchen.
dialog: 
text: Anne is seated in the same place and looks at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 
text: She turns toward the breakfast.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: You left the water running.
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Georges stares at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: (both aghast and furious)
dialog: Hey, what's going on? Are you
dialog: completely crazy? Is this supposed
dialog: to be a joke, or what's going on?
dialog: 
text: She looks at him with amazement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: What did you say?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
speaker_heading: (SERIOUSLY)
dialog: Is this a joke? Is this meant to be
dialog: a joke?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: What joke? I don't get it! Why are
dialog: you talking to me like that? What's
dialog: got into you?
dialog: 
text: Georges comes from the door to the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Anne! Please! Stop this game. It's
dialog: not funny.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
speaker_heading: (GETTING IRRITATED)
dialog: What game, for Christ's sake? What
dialog: on earth's the matter?!!
dialog: 
text: Georges is about to answer in a similarly irritated tone,
text: but gradually begins to suspect that he could be mistaken. He
text: tries to calm down, takes his chair that has remained beside
text: Anne, sits down and looks at his wife. She doesn't know how
dialog: to react.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: What's the matter? Why didn't you
dialog: react?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: To what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: To what? To me, to everything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: When?
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Just now. A moment ago.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Please tell me what's wrong. What
dialog: am I supposed to have done?
dialog: 
text: Georges first looks away reluctantly, then looks at Anne. He
dialog: doesn't want to believe that its serious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: I don't know what to say. Do you
dialog: really not know what just happened?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: But what DID happen?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
text: (almost reluctantly bowing his head
dialog: as he speaks) You were sitting
dialog: there, staring at me. You didn't
dialog: answer me when I asked you what the
dialog: matter was.
dialog: 
text: He picks up the wet tea towel from the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: I put this tea towel on your face,
dialog: and you didn't react.
dialog: 
text: Anne looks at the towel, then at Georges, and shakes her
text: head, perturbed that she can't understand. Georges looks at
text: her. He sees the damp marks on the collar of her robe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Look... There's still dampness on
dialog: your collar.
dialog: 
text: Anne follows his gesture, tugs on her collar and sees the
text: damp marks. She slowly grasps that something is awry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: When... When was it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Just now, a few minutes ago.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: So...??
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: There's no "So". I went into the
dialog: bedroom to get dressed. I wanted to
dialog: get help.
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Help?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Yes, and then you turned off the
dialog: tap.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Yes. Because you left it on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SILENCE
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't understand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Neither do I.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't you think it's best if I call
dialog: Dr. Bertier?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Why? What can he do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: I don't know. Examine you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: I'm fine. There's nothing wrong
dialog: with me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Anne, please!! That's absurd. We
dialog: can't pretend that nothing
dialog: happened.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: But what DID happen?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm here. I'm having my breakfast,
dialog: and you're telling me things
dialog: happened that I don't understand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Can you explain how the tea towel
dialog: got there?
dialog: 12.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
speaker_heading: (IRRITATED)
dialog: No, I can't!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Who turned on the tap?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: You did!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Can you remember that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
text: (more and more desperate, close to
dialog: tears) No I can't! Do you want to
dialog: torture me? Leave me in peace!
dialog: 
text: Georges looks at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Don't you think it would be better
dialog: to fetch Dr. Bertier?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: No!
dialog: 
text: She takes her cup of tea, as if to show how well she is, and
text: drinks it up. When she wants to re-fill her cup, she
text: completely misses her aim. She notices it, puts down her cup
text: and bursts into tears.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 9 - INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SILENCE
dialog: 
text: We see wide shots of the apartment. The hallway. The bedroom.
text: The living room. The dining room. The kitchen. Nobody in
dialog: sight.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 10 - INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: EVA, around 50, has come to pay a visit. Anne isn't there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: You know how he is. Once he's got
text: something into his head, he has to
dialog: go through with it. In the end,
dialog: everybody was delighted. And
dialog: besides, it didn't hurt our
dialog: financial situation. We're playing
dialog: until the 28th.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 13.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA (CONT'D)
dialog: Then we have 10 days to rest, then
dialog: we go to Stockholm for four days,
dialog: and then to Kumo in Finland. Heaven
dialog: knows where that is. At the North
dialog: Pole. But Geoff's already been
dialog: there few times, and he loves it.
dialog: We're playing the "Dowland
dialog: Transcriptions" there and then
dialog: we're back in London.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: What about the children?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
text: Liz is at boarding school and John
dialog: is living his own life. He's twenty-
text: six years old.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: What does he do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: He's a student. We rarely see him.
dialog: He's got his own ideas. Life Geoff.
dialog: They don't really get along. Geoff
dialog: wants to advise him on everything,
dialog: and John doesn't like that at all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Is he good?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: I think so. He's less impulsive.
dialog: Very industrious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: That sounds rather derogatory.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: No!! He's not like Geoff. Quiet,
dialog: but stubborn. I think he'll do all
dialog: right. At the last Conservatory
dialog: concert, he played the solo part in
dialog: the Haydn Concerto. It was very
dialog: good. Geoff was there and
text: congratulated him at the end.
dialog: 
dialog: Brief PAUSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: And you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog: 14.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Did you both make up?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: (with a little laugh)
dialog: My God, you know him, don't you?
dialog: Over the winter, he suddenly
dialog: discovered his passion for a viola
dialog: player who'd been in our ensemble
dialog: for years. What can I tell you? It
dialog: was a huge drama, and the poor
dialog: little darling wound up trying to
dialog: commit suicide. That scared him and
text: he came back to me in full remorse.
dialog: I've got used to it now. What's a
dialog: bit embarrassing is that the
dialog: ensemble, you can't keep any
dialog: secrets from anyone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Do you love him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Yes, I think so.
dialog: 
dialog: Brief PAUSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA (CONT'D)
dialog: What's aphasia?
dialog: 
text: Georges gestures that it's too complicated.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: What can I say? The carotid artery
dialog: was blocked. They did an ultrasound
dialog: scan, two in fact, and they said
dialog: they had to operate on her. She was
text: scared. She was confused and
dialog: scared. You know she has always
dialog: been afraid of doctors. They said
dialog: the risk was very low and that if
dialog: they didn't operate, she'd be
text: certain to have a serious stroke.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: And what do they say now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Just that it didn't go well. It's
dialog: one of the 5% that go wrong.
dialog: 
text: He yawns.
dialog: 15.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: It's pretty upsetting.
dialog: 
text: He looks at his watch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Usually at this time, I take a nap.
dialog: My blood sugar is somewhere down in
dialog: my socks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: I'm so sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: What can I do for you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Nothing. It was nice of you to come
dialog: despite all of your stress.
dialog: 
dialog: Brief PAUSE.
dialog: 
text: She doesn't know what to say.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: No, really. There's nothing you can
dialog: do. We'll see how things go when
text: she's back here in the apartment.
dialog: We'll manage. Maybe I'll get a
dialog: caretaker in, or maybe I'll manage
dialog: on my own. We'll see. We've been
dialog: through quite a lot in our time,
dialog: your mother and I.
speaker_heading: (LITTLE LAUGH)
dialog: All this is still a bit new.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: (with a little laugh)
dialog: It's funny. I don't know if I
dialog: should say it. Maybe it'll
dialog: embarrass you. But when I came here
dialog: a short while ago, I suddenly
dialog: remembered how I always used to
dialog: listen to the two of you making
dialog: love when I was little.

speaker_heading: EVA (CONT'D)
dialog: For me, at the time, it was

dialog: 
text: A carpenter and his assistant are raising the base of the

dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 12 - INT. HALLWAY - LIVING ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: The door of the apartment is opened. Georges comes in. Behind
text: him is Anne in a wheelchair, pushed by a paramedic. A second
text: paramedic (as young as the first) follows with a suitcase and
text: a large bag. Behind them, the superintendent.
dialog: 
text: Georges tries to rid of the three as quickly as possible. He
text: stuffs a twenty euro note into the hand of the first
text: paramedic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Here. Thank you very much. It's for
dialog: both of you. You can just put the
dialog: things down here. There, beside the
dialog: window, right. We'll be okay on our
dialog: own. Thanks a lot.
dialog: 
text: The two paramedics exchange a brief glance, say thanks, and
text: leave the apartment, passing the superintendent as they go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: (to the superintendent)
dialog: Thank you, Mr. Mery.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUPERINTENDENT
dialog: If you need anything, just call
dialog: downstairs. If we can help at
dialog: all...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Right now everything's fine. I'll
dialog: let your wife know as soon as we
dialog: need anything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUPERINTENDENT
speaker_heading: (TO ANNE)
dialog: It's nice to have you back, Mrs.
dialog: Laurent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Yes. Thank you, Mr. Mery. Thank
dialog: you.
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The superintendent hesitates another moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes, thanks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUPERINTENDENT
dialog: Yes... So... Goodbye then, ma'am.
dialog: Welcome home again. Goodbye, Sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Goodbye, Mr. Mery.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUPERINTENDENT
dialog: Goodbye.
dialog: 
text: He leaves the apartment.
dialog: 
text: There is a brief moment of perplexity. Then Georges says:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: (with a nervous smile)
dialog: Where do you want...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
text: In the living room.
dialog: 
text: Georges pushes her toward the living room door, walks around
text: the wheelchair, opens the door, comes back behind the
text: wheelchair and pushes Anne into the LIVING ROOM.
dialog: 
text: The doorway is narrow. The wheelchair only just passes
text: through it. Georges pushes Anne toward the sofa and the
text: armchairs and then steps in front of her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Shall I make some tea?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: (with a faint smile)
dialog: First come sit with me.
dialog: 
text: George registers her smile; he knows he's behaving in a
text: clumsy way. He sits down in one of the two arm chairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Can you help me into the chair?
dialog: 
text: Georges stands back up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
speaker_heading: (EAGERLY)
dialog: Of course.
dialog: 18.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He extends his hands. She puts on the wheelchair brake, lifts
text: the footrest with her left foot, raises her right leg from
text: the footrest with her left hand and then extends her left arm
dialog: to Georges.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: It's best if you put my arm around
dialog: your neck and your right arm around
dialog: me, that way it'll be easy.
dialog: 
text: He does as he is told, pulls her up as they hobble together
text: the short distance to the second arm chair. Cautiously, he
text: lowers her down and helps her sit herself straight. Because
text: they are not used to it, the whole process appears awkward
dialog: and clumsy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
text: He smiles because it seems silly to him to answer "Don't
text: mention it". Then he sits down opposite her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LONG PAUSE.
dialog: 
text: At first they are both ill at ease, but then they accept the
text: fact that words do not come easily. After a long while,
text: during which we hear the intermittent sound of the TRAFFIC
dialog: below.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: (softly almost to himself)
dialog: I'm glad you're back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: (in a voice just as soft)
dialog: Me too.
dialog: 
text: Another PAUSE. Then Anne says:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Promise me one thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Please never take me back to the
dialog: hospital.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She looks at him. He has understood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: You promise?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Anne...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: You promise?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Anne, I...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Don't talk right now. And don't
dialog: give me any lectures. Please.
dialog: 
dialog: Brief PAUSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: What can I say, it's...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
speaker_heading: (INTERRUPTING HIM)
dialog: Nothing. Just don't say anything.
dialog: OK?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 13 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: He helps her into bed, then throws the blanket over her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: There.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Thank you. Thank you, Darling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Everything OK?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
speaker_heading: (SMILING)
dialog: Everything's fine.
dialog: 
text: He hesitates.
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't have to hold my hand all
dialog: the time now. I can look after
dialog: myself, you know.
dialog: 
text: He nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: And don't feel guilty. That would
dialog: be pointless. And a drag. For me
dialog: too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: I don't feel guilty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: That's good.
dialog: 
text: She smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Go over there now. I'm not a
dialog: cripple. You can easily leave me
dialog: alone for two minutes. I won't
dialog: collapse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: (with a slight smile)
dialog: OK.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Did you buy the new book on
dialog: Harnoncourt?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: I've already read it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: And?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Do you want it? I'll get it for
dialog: you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 
text: He goes out of the room to fetch the book. She remains lying
text: there, waiting, and runs her healthy left hand through her
text: hair to make herself look prettier, then smooths out the
text: blanket that has slipped out of place a little. After a
text: while, we hear Georges shouting.
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (O.S.)
dialog: I don't know where I put it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Don't worry. It isn't that
dialog: important.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (O.S.)
dialog: Yes, it is. Hold on, maybe it's in
dialog: the... Just a moment! Viola! Here
dialog: you are! Nothing like an infallible
dialog: memory!
dialog: 
text: She smiles, looks in his direction. He enters with the book
text: in his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: I thought I'd left it over there in
dialog: the other room, but I'd already put
dialog: it away. Tidy people just can't
dialog: help being tidy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: (taking the book)
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
text: She puts the book on her stomach. Looks at Georges.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Right now, take care of yourself.
dialog: And don't wait to see how I hold
dialog: the book in my hand, OK?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: OK.
dialog: 
text: He looks at her for a moment longer, then leaves the bedroom.
text: She waits till he's outside. Tries to relax. Then she
text: remembers the book. She takes it in her left hand and tries
text: to open it. It's not easy for her.
dialog: 
text: Then she notices that she's forgotten her glasses. She rests
text: the book back on the bed cover and fishes for her glasses on
text: the night stand. In the end, she manages it. Then she opens
text: the book again, and tries to read.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 14 - INT. KITCHEN - DAY
dialog: 
text: The superintendent's wife puts the filled supermarket bags on
text: the counter. Takes the stack of mail that she had put on top

dialog: 
scene_heading: SUPERINTENDANT'S WIFE
dialog: Unfortunately the strawberries were
dialog: already moldy. I'll go and get you
dialog: some fresh ones tomorrow from the

dialog: I'm not supposed to carry anything
dialog: heavy: my back, you know...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Sure, no problem.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE

speaker_heading: SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE (CONT'D)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Yes. I will.

scene_heading: SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE
dialog: Is your wife well? ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
text: Yes, she's OK. She's recovering.

scene_heading: SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE
dialog: Fine. Give her my regards. My

speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Yes, we are too. Bye, Mrs. Méry,

scene_heading: SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE

speaker_heading: SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE (CONT'D)

scene_heading: SCENE 15 - INT. HALLWAY - TOILET - DAY
dialog:

text: After a while, we hear the noise of flushing. After a while
dialog: longer, we hear
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE (O.S.)
dialog: There. Can you come in, please?
dialog: 
text: He opens the toilet door, goes around Anne, pulls her up, she
text: puts her left arm around his neck, keeps herself upright that
text: way, he pulls up her pants under her skirt. Then they slowly
text: hobble out of the toilet and he sits her back down in the
dialog: wheelchair.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 16 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 17 - INT. KITCHEN - DAY
dialog: 
text: The sun shines in. Georges has cooked something simple. They
text: are both in a good mood, eating and drinking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: ... some banal romance or other
dialog: about a nobleman and a lower middle-
dialog: class girl who couldn't have each
dialog: other and who then, out of sheer
text: magnanimity, decide to renounce
dialog: their love - in fact I don't quite
dialog: remember it any more. In any case,
dialog: afterwards I was thoroughly
dialog: distraught, and it took me a bit of
text: time to calm down. In the courtyard
dialog: of the house where grandma lived,
text: there was a young guy at the window
dialog: who asked me where I'd been. He was
dialog: a couple of years older than me, a
dialog: braggart who of course really
dialog: impressed me. "To the movies", I
dialog: said, because I was proud that my
dialog: grandma had given me the money to
dialog: go all alone to the cinema.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: "What did you see?" I started to
dialog: tell him the story of the movie,
dialog: and as I did, all the emotion came
dialog: back. I didn't want to cry in front
dialog: of the boy, but it was impossible;
dialog: there I was, crying out loud in the
dialog: courtyard, and I told him the whole
text: drama to the bitter end.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: So? How did he react?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: No idea. He probably found it
dialog: amusing. I don't remember. I don't
dialog: remember the film either. But I
dialog: remember the feeling. That I was
dialog: ashamed of crying, but that telling
dialog: him the story made all my feelings
text: and tears come back, almost more
dialog: powerfully than when I was actually
dialog: watching the film, and that I just
dialog: couldn't stop.
dialog: 
text: She looks at him, smiles, then turns back to her food.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: That's cute. Why didn't you ever
dialog: tell me before?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: There are still a few stories you
dialog: don't know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Aha...? Don't tell me you're going
dialog: to ruin your image in your old age?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
speaker_heading: (GRINNING)
dialog: You bet I won't. But what is my
dialog: image?
dialog: 
text: She takes a mouthful, eats ponderously. Then she looks at
dialog: him.

speaker_heading: ANNE
speaker_heading: (TENDERLY)
dialog: Sometimes you're a rotter. But
dialog: you're nice.

speaker_heading: GEORGES

scene_heading: SCENE 19 - INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: She's lying on the sofa. He's seated in the armchair. They're

speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Listen to this! My horoscope.
dialog: Motto: You have lots of verve, but
dialog: need to be more serious!
dialog: Love: High-class conversation is
dialog: what you need.
dialog: Work: You're motivated again. But
dialog: proceed with care.
dialog: Health: Loosen up by doing
dialog: exercises. It'll give you renewed
dialog: pizzazz.
dialog: 
dialog: PAUSE. Then
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
speaker_heading: (GOOD-HUMORED)
dialog: You've only yourself to blame if
dialog: you read stuff like that.
dialog: 
dialog: Brief PAUSE. Then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Tomorrow afternoon is Pierre's
dialog: funeral.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: You have to go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: I fear I must. I don't want to go
dialog: at all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Who does like going to funerals?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Oh, I know a few people who do.
dialog: Annette can never wait to get all
text: dolled up again. And François
dialog: has...
dialog: 26.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: You're mean. What would you say if
dialog: no one came to your funeral?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: (dryly) Nothing, presumably.
dialog: 
text: She shoots him a glance, smiles at his irony. Then she says:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Have you talked to Jeanne since I
dialog: was in the hospital? I mean, does
dialog: she know I can't come?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Of course.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: What did she say?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: She was shocked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: How?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: (a bit irritated)
dialog: My God, what are people like when
dialog: they're shocked? She couldn't
dialog: believe it, she was speechless. I
dialog: don't remember any more. In any
dialog: case, not exactly. I've spoken to a
dialog: lot of people since.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be
dialog: unkind, but I just don't see the
dialog: point of talking about it all the
dialog: time.
dialog: 
dialog: Short PAUSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Do I talk about it all the time?
dialog: 27.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: No. Sorry.

scene_heading: SCENE 20 - INT. HALLWAY - LIVING ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: The front door is unlocked from the outside, and Georges
text: enters. He's back from the funeral, dressed for the occasion.
text: He turns on the light. He's wet. Clearly, it's been raining.
text: As he closes the door again, his eyes fall on Anne. With her
text: back to him, she is sitting on the floor in front of the
text: opened window of the light well, half propped against her
dialog: wheelchair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: What ... ?!
dialog: 
text: Shaken, he heads toward her, picks her up and seats her in
text: the wheelchair. Outside, in the light well, it is raining.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
text: (once she's seated in the
speaker_heading: WHEELCHAIR)
dialog: Why are you back already? What time
dialog: is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUSE.

speaker_heading: (SOFTLY)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUSE.

speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Yes.

dialog: 
dialog:

text: beside the switch. They both look exhausted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: You're always good at surprises.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Yes. Why are you home earlier?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: I didn't come home earlier. I took
text: a taxi. In August, there isn't a
dialog: lot of traffic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: That's true. How was the funeral?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Anne...!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: How was it, go on, tell me!
dialog: 
text: He thinks an instant, then goes and sits down facing her in
text: an armchair. Looks at her. She raises her head and returns
text: his look. He understands that he can't insist right now. Long
text: PAUSE. Then he begins:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: It was rather bizarre. The priest
dialog: was an idiot. Then one of Pierre's
dialog: co-workers made a speech that was
text: embarrassingly emotional. His old
dialog: secretary came with a radio-
dialog: cassette player and after the
dialog: speech she put on "Yesterday" by
dialog: the Beatles. You can't imagine.
text: Everybody turned round to look at
text: her. Apparently, it wasn't planned.
dialog: His grandchildren were there. Of
dialog: course they giggled as soon as the
text: music began. Then the urn was put
text: on a huge stretcher that was
text: obviously designed for a coffin,
dialog: and out we went into the rain. They
text: placed the urn on a small electric
dialog: cart that crawled along for what
dialog: seemed like an eternity to the tiny
dialog: hole they had dug. A lot of people
dialog: had to stifle their laughter. It
dialog: must have been terrible for Jeanne.
dialog: I have...
dialog: 29.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
speaker_heading: (INTERRUPTING HIM)
dialog: There's just no point in going on
dialog: living. I know it can only get
dialog: worse. Why should I inflict it on
dialog: us? On you and me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: You're not inflicting anything on
dialog: me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: You don't have to lie, Georges.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Imagine you were me. Didn't you
dialog: ever think something like this
dialog: could happen to one of us?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Of course I did. But imagination
dialog: and reality have little in common.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: But things are getting better every
dialog: day. We'll...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
speaker_heading: (INTERRUPTING HIM)
dialog: Georges, I don't want to carry on.
dialog: You're making such efforts to make
dialog: everything easier for me. But I
dialog: don't want to go on. For my own
dialog: sake. Not yours.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: I don't believe you. I know you.
dialog: You think you're a burden on me.
dialog: But what if things were the other
dialog: way around? What would you do then?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: I don't know. I can't be bothered
dialog: to think about being you. I'm
dialog: tired. You tire me. Everything
dialog: tires me. I can't talk. I want to
dialog: go to bed.
dialog: 
text: He looks at her. Finally he gets up and pushes her wheelchair
text: out of frame.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 21 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 30.

speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: (somewhat perplexed, but pleased)
dialog: Oh hello! Nice to see you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLOIST
dialog: Forgive me for dropping in on you
dialog: like this, Professor. I tried to
dialog: reach you by phone a couple of
dialog: times, but no luck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: I'm sorry. I only pick up the phone
dialog: when I've stored the caller's

dialog: Why didn't you leave a message?
dialog: Anyway, do come in...
dialog: 
text: He closes the door behind his guest.

text: While they pass into the living room, they continue to speak:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLOIST
dialog: ... And now, an unexpected
dialog: opportunity has arisen because
dialog: François Mitry called me - you know
dialog: him, he's my agent - to say he'd
dialog: arranged for me to meet the boss of

dialog: tonight to talk about their new

speaker_heading: (MORE)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLOIST (CONT'D)
dialog: So I flew to Paris this morning,
dialog: and while I was in my hotel, I
dialog: thought, I'll just give it a try
dialog: and drop in. After all, it's
text: virtually just around the corner.
dialog: 
dialog: Sorry, these are for your wife.
dialog: 
text: He takes the bouquet of flowers from its wrapping paper and
text: hands it to Georges.

speaker_heading: SOLOIST (CONT'D)
dialog: Isn't she at home?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Yes, she is. I'll go and get her in
dialog: a minute. Have a seat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLOIST
dialog: I hope I'm not disturbing you too
dialog: much.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: No, not at all. I'm happy that you
dialog: came. We were so thrilled by your
dialog: concert. We hoped we'd see you
dialog: again soon. Please do have a seat.
dialog: Can I can get you something? A cup
dialog: of tea?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLOIST
dialog: No, no, thank you very much.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Hold on, I'll just freshen up the
dialog: flowers; in this heat they wilt so
dialog: fast...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLOIST
dialog: I've only just bought them. They
dialog: should keep quite...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: But Georges has already left the room with the bouquet and
text: closed the door behind him. The soloist looks around him.
dialog: 
text: After a few moments we hear the VOICES of Anne and Georges in
text: the distance, without understanding what they're saying. It
dialog: lasts a while.
dialog: 
text: Finally Georges opens the door and pushes Anne, in her
text: wheelchair, into the living room.
dialog: 32.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Martin! What a delight. How lovely
dialog: to see you!
dialog: 
text: The (male or female) soloist has got up and doesn't quite
dialog: know how to handle the situation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLOIST
dialog: Mrs. Laurent! Lovely to see you
dialog: too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Don't get up. Come on, sit yourself
dialog: down and don't look so shocked.
dialog: 
text: The soloist sits down hesitantly, Georges pushes the
text: wheelchair between the two armchairs and also sits down.
text: Brief embarrassed PAUSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm so proud of you. We were both
dialog: in raptures after your concert.
dialog: Georges wanted to buy your new CD
dialog: the very next morning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLOIST
dialog: Oh God! I wanted to bring you the
dialog: CD, but I left in such a hurry that
dialog: I forgot it. I'm so sorry. I'll get
dialog: one today and drop it by.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
speaker_heading: (SMILING)
dialog: No, no, don't worry. We want to
dialog: make a contribution to your
dialog: success. Even if it's only twenty
dialog: euros.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLOIST
dialog: You've already contributed so much.
dialog: I owe you so much, Madame.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: You owe it to your hard work and
dialog: your talent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLOIST
dialog: (shaking his head a little) Do you
dialog: remember, when you first gave me
dialog: the Bagatelles to play? I was
dialog: twelve at the time, and in my
dialog: youthful arrogance I said: "But why
dialog: the Bagatelles?" And you really
dialog: gave me a piece of your mind.
dialog: 33.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: They both smile. PAUSE. Then he goes on:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLOIST (CONT'D)
dialog: So what happened?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: My right side is paralyzed, that's
dialog: all. It can happen when you get
dialog: older.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLOIST
dialog: And how...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Let's talk about something else,
dialog: shall we?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLOIST
speaker_heading: (DISCONCERTED)
dialog: Sure ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Don't be offended. But I want to
dialog: enjoy the lovely interlude you've
dialog: given us with your visit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLOIST
speaker_heading: (DISARMED)
dialog: Of course.
dialog: 
dialog: Brief PAUSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: You haven't told us yet what's been
text: going on since the Paris concert.
dialog: 
text: The soloist is a bit thrown by the couple's behavior.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLOIST
dialog: Well, actually I've spent most of
dialog: the time in London studying. Then I
dialog: went to Copenhagen for two
dialog: performances, that was Schubert
dialog: too. My whole life revolves around
text: Schubert at the moment. The
dialog: concerts with the Impromptus and
dialog: the Moments Musicaux, and for my
dialog: bread-and-butter work I'm
dialog: developing the sonatas. Not the
dialog: late ones, I think I still need a
dialog: couple more years for those.
dialog: 34.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: (The dialogue concerning music will be modified according to
dialog: the performer chosen.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Could you do me a favor?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLOIST
speaker_heading: (SURPRISED)
dialog: Really?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Would you play Für Elise?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLOIST
speaker_heading: (EMBARRASSED)
dialog: Um, I don't know if I remember it
dialog: very well. Beethoven, it's been a
dialog: long time since I've... But if you
dialog: want...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Give it a try.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLOIST
speaker_heading: (HESITANTLY)
dialog: OK.
dialog: 
text: He looks at Georges, then at Anne again, gets up, goes to the
text: grand piano and plays.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 23 - INT. HALLWAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: Georges is leaning against the chest, and watches Anne, who
text: is practicing maneuvering her new electric wheelchair.
text: Forward, backward, turning. In the end, she goes round and
text: round in circles several times. He laughs, so does she.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 24 - INT. BEDROOM - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Anne is lying in bed. A book rests on her stomach. She
text: listens to the PIANO playing coming from the living room.
text: After a while the music stops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: What's the matter?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
dialog: 
text: Georges is seated in front of the open piano. His hands in
text: his lap, he looks straight ahead.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 25 - INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The superintendent's wife runs the vacuum cleaner over a
dialog: carpet.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 26 - INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Anne is seated on a stool. Georges washes her.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 27 - INT. KITCHEN - HALLWAY - BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
dialog: 
text: Georges has cooked himself a steak and is eating. On the
text: radio, we hear the EVENING NEWS. Suddenly, coming from the
text: neighboring room, a LOUD CRASH and the SOUND of crockery
text: breaking. Stifled CRY from Anne. Georges gets up, irritated,
text: crosses the HALLWAY and enters the BEDROOM.
dialog: 
text: Anne lies on the floor, beside the overturned night stand, in
text: the midst of the crockery and remains of a meal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: (shocked, and hence furious)
dialog: Good God, what are you doing?
dialog: 
text: He hurries toward her and pulls her up rather roughly into
dialog: the bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Have you lost your senses?! I don't
dialog: believe it! How stupid!
dialog: 
text: He points to the broken objects.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at that! Did you need to do
dialog: that? Can't you call me when you
dialog: need something?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: (meekly) I'm sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
speaker_heading: (STILL FURIOUS)
dialog: Yes, so am I.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
speaker_heading: (SOFTLY)
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: 
text: Georges bends down, and begins to gather up the scattered
dialog: objects.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
text: The lamp is broken too.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 28 - INT. BATHROOM - HALLWAY - ANNEX - DAY
dialog: 36.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: Bathroom.
dialog: 
text: Georges, in pajama pants, naked torso, brushes his teeth. The
text: doorbell rings.
dialog: 
text: Georges spits out, wipes his mouth, goes into the hallway and
text: over to the front door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes? Who's there?
dialog: 
text: No answer. Georges is very irritated. O.S., Anne calls to
speaker_heading: HIM:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Georges? What's going on? Who is
dialog: it?
dialog: 
text: Georges opens the door. Outside, however, instead of the
text: usual landing, we see an empty room lit a giorno but without
text: a window, about as large as the rooms in the apartment. It
text: looks like an unpainted room in a new apartment. A couple of
text: ladders are propped against the opposite wall. At the other
text: end of the room, to the side, is a small door. Georges is
text: stunned, and doesn't understand what has happened.
text: Hesitating, he crosses the room toward the door.
dialog: 
text: O.S., in the distance, Anne's worried voice:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Georges? What's going on?
dialog: 
text: Georges opens the small door. Behind it is a narrow,
text: windowless corridor, as brightly lit as the room. At the end
text: of the corridor, a door. Georges heads toward this door and
text: opens it too. Behind it is a tiny windowless room, equally
text: bright as the others. Everything is very quiet. Georges
text: enters, turns round, then goes back along the corridor,
text: crosses the room, comes through the apartment door into the
text: hallway of the apartment. But it too is now empty and bright,
text: with bare unpainted walls, no doors; only the door to the
text: bedroom is open. Behind that too, it appears to be empty and
text: bright. Georges goes toward it.
dialog: 
text: At the same time, we hear GEORGES' VOICE. At first he groans,
text: but then begins inarticulately hollering, louder and louder.
dialog: Shortly after, we also hear:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE'S VOICE:
dialog: Georges, what's going on?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 29 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
scene_heading: Darkness. GEORGES HOLLERS
dialog: 37.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE'S VOICE
dialog: Calm down will you! There's nothing
dialog: there. It's nothing.
dialog: 
text: She manages to switch on the bedside lamp. Georges is sitting
text: up in his bed, having just awoken, wide-eyed with terror. His
text: breathing is labored.
dialog: 
text: Anne extends her good hand toward him, caresses his back to
text: calm him. He slowly calms down and flops back on his pillow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: What was it?
dialog: 
text: He doesn't answer. Continues breathing heavily. She caresses
dialog: him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: (still with labored breathing)
dialog: I didn't understand... I thought
dialog: I'd gone mad... It was something
dialog: impossible...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: What was?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 30 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Close shot on the screen of a cell phone. We read on it:
dialog: 
text: Coming to Paris on 12th. Plan to stop by in afternoon. Hope
dialog: all well. So look forward to seeing you. Love Eva.
dialog: 
dialog: We hear O.S. the voice of
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
text: Eva. They're coming on the 12th.
dialog: 
text: He crouches down in front of Anne who is seated on the bed,
text: puts his mobile phone back in his pocket and continues to put
text: on her socks and her shoes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
text: No idea. Apparently she's coming
dialog: with Geoff.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: When is it?
dialog: 38.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: I don't know exactly. What day is
dialog: it today? I'll go and look.
dialog: 
dialog: Short PAUSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: I don't want that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
text: Geoff doesn't need to come.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
dialog: 
text: Georges doesn't agree, but continues to dress Anne.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't need any comments on my
dialog: predicament. I can only take his
dialog: British humor in small doses.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 31 - INT. HALLWAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: Once more the set of physiotherapy exercises. Things are
text: going better. Georges smiles encouragingly at Anne, noticing
text: her improvement. She reacts like someone duty-bound, but
dialog: without conviction.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 32 - INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Close shot: a CD is inserted into a player. As the MUSIC
text: begins (the concert heard in Scene 3), Georges takes a card
text: out of the envelope that contained the CD and reads it to
speaker_heading: ANNE:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Dear Madame Laurent, Dear Monsieur
dialog: Laurent, it was beautiful and yet
dialog: sad to see you. My heartfelt wishes
dialog: that things will get better.
dialog: With deep gratitude, your former
dialog: pupil, Martin.
dialog: 
text: The MUSIC makes their SILENCE less awkward. Then, after a
dialog: long while, Anne says:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Stop the CD.
dialog: 
text: He hesitates, looks at her, then stops the music. They remain
scene_heading: SILENT.
dialog: 39.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 33- INT. KITCHEN - ADJOINING ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: They eat. Suddenly, Anne says:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Where are the family albums?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: The family albums? I don't know,
text: there, in the other room. Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Can you get them for me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: What, now?
dialog: 
text: Anne nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Why, Anne?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: I'd like to look at them.
dialog: 
text: Georges hesitates, and doesn't understand the suddenness of
dialog: this request.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Please!
dialog: 
text: He finally gets up and goes into the adjoining room. He comes
text: back after a few moments with a stack of albums, pushes away
text: the remains of Anne's meal and sets down the first album in
text: front of her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: (a bit irritated)
dialog: You're welcome.
dialog: 
text: With her able hand, Anne opens the album, looks at the
text: photos, turns the pages, looks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: That's nice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: (self-consciously, softly)
dialog: What?
dialog: 40.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Life...so long... What a long
dialog: life...
dialog: 
text: Georges looks at her. She continues to thumb through the
text: pages. After a while she turns toward him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop watching me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: (caught in the act)
dialog: I wasn't watching you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Of course you were. I'm not that
dialog: dumb yet.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 24 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: They are both lying in bed. Georges reads the day's news to
text: Anne from the newspaper. When he looks over to her, she has
text: fallen asleep. He then puts the newspaper on the night stand
text: and turns out the light.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 35 - INT. BEDROOM - HALLWAY - BATHROOM - DAY
dialog: 
dialog: Bedroom.
dialog: 
text: It's morning. Georges is helping Anne to get out of bed into
text: her wheelchair. As he does it, he notices that the bed and
text: her nightgown are wet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: You're soaked through.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog: 
dialog: Brief PAUSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Hold on.
dialog: 
text: He sits her back on the bed and goes out of the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll be right back.
dialog: 
text: During this time, she remains seated, feeling embarrassed,
text: and waits. He comes back with a towel and puts it on the seat
text: of the wheelchair.
dialog: 41.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: It's no big deal. Come on.
dialog: 
text: He lifts her out of the bed into the wheelchair and pushes
text: her through the hallway into the bathroom.
dialog: 
text: He lifts her out of the wheelchair, sits her on the stool and
text: takes off her wet nightgown, pulling it over her head. She
text: starts to SOB inconsolably. He caresses her face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, darling. It's nothing
dialog: serious. Things like that happen..
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
speaker_heading: (SOBBING)
dialog: I can't... take it any more.
dialog: 
text: He holds her tightly against him, strokes her hair, feeling
dialog: helpless.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: My love. My darling.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 36 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Anne is in bed. She's on a drip. Eva is seated on a chair
text: beside the bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: ... thinking about whether it
dialog: wouldn't be better to invest the
text: money in an apartment block. If
dialog: inflation gets going again,
dialog: property is the only sure thing.
dialog: Right now, savings accounts pay
dialog: 1.75% at best. Four years ago,
dialog: Geoff bought some stocks with a
dialog: small sum of money and the whole
dialog: thing collapsed. So now we're
text: obviously worried. Unfortunately,
dialog: in the meantime, other people have
dialog: had the same idea, and property
text: prices are going through the roof.
dialog: Since we came back from
dialog: Scandinavia, I spend all my spare
text: time looking through newspaper ads.
dialog: 
text: To put an end to the PAUSE that follows, she adds:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA (CONT'D)
dialog: It takes time, that's all. We'll
dialog: find something in the end.
dialog: 42.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Another oppressive PAUSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: (slowly) Yes yes I have... I
dialog: have... the grandmother... woman
dialog: with house... not... the house then
dialog: ... money
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: I don't understand you, I'm afraid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: ... yes... now... it's all... house
dialog: sel... sel... sel... was... in two
dialog: strokes of... so quickly... god
dialog: it's hard... to say... sell...
dialog: money gone... left... there too...
dialog: 
text: PAUSE. Eva has tears in her eyes.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 37 - INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Georges and Eva's husband, GEOFF, around fifty. He speaks
text: with a British accent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: ... three times a week... I'm not
dialog: experienced enough. We'll see if
dialog: that's enough.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEOFF
dialog: How much is she asking?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: It's paid by the hour. We'll see.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEOFF
dialog: And her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Anne?
dialog: 
text: Geoff nods. Georges shrugs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: It's hard to say. Sometimes I get
text: the feeling she's totally unaware
dialog: of the state she's in. And then I
dialog: feel the opposite. It's... I don't
dialog: know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEOFF
dialog: And what about the doctor? What
dialog: does he say?
dialog: 43.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: He's...
dialog: 
text: Eva comes in through the door. She's in floods of tears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
speaker_heading: (CRYING)
dialog: She only talks gibberish. I don't
dialog: know what...
dialog: 
text: Geoff gets up, hesitantly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEOFF
dialog: Hey, dear...
dialog: 
text: He goes toward her and leads her to the armchair where he was
dialog: sitting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEOFF (CONT'D)
dialog: ...come here, sit down, it's OK.
dialog: 
text: She shakes him off, irritated, and sits down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Nothing is OK.
dialog: 
text: At first he's vexed by her brusque response, but then goes to
text: sit down on the sofa. Meanwhile, Eva turns to Georges:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA (CONT'D)
dialog: What's going on, actually? You
dialog: can't just leave her lying on her
dialog: bed like that! She's
dialog: unrecognizable! It's ridiculous!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: We can't do anything for the
dialog: moment. Calm down, darling. She's
dialog: getting medical treatment, they
dialog: give her the necessary medication,
dialog: and there are no other options
dialog: right now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: What does that mean, "no other
dialog: options"? Why isn't she in a
dialog: hospital?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: She had a second stroke. Bertier
dialog: examined her and felt we could
dialog: spare her all the hospital
dialog: inpatient procedures.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 44.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyway, they wouldn't keep her,
dialog: they'd send her to a care home.
dialog: What they do in those places, we
dialog: can do here.
dialog: 
text: Eva looks at him, amazed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: And she won't be put in a care
dialog: home. I promised her that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEOFF
dialog: Don't you think you're taking on
dialog: too much?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Have you got a better idea?
dialog: 
text: Geoff doesn't know what to say. Eva has composed herself
text: somewhat and blows her nose.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: I can't believe that these days
dialog: there's no way of handling this
dialog: efficiently.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
speaker_heading: (CURTLY)
dialog: No one's stopping you from finding
dialog: out.
dialog: 
text: Eva gets up, furious, and goes to the window. Georges follows
text: her with his eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (PEACEABLY)
dialog: Believe me, I love your mother as
dialog: much as you do. So please, don't
dialog: treat me as if I was a total idiot
dialog: incapable of doing the obvious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: I didn't say that. I'm simply
dialog: questioning whether what I see
dialog: going on here is the answer to
dialog: everything!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEOFF
speaker_heading: (TO GEORGES)
dialog: Don't you want to get a second
dialog: opinion?
dialog: 45.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Now you two had better stop, OK?
dialog: Another doctor did come. He said
dialog: Bertier was right. From Monday, a
dialog: nurse will come three times a week.
dialog: Now can we talk about something
dialog: else?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Like what?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 38 - INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Georges washes the tea cups that he used for Eva and Geoff.
text: On the radio, the EVENING NEWS.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 39 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: With expert gestures, a nurse shows Georges how to lie Anne
text: down and put an incontinence pad on her. She's now almost
text: incapable of moving, and has to be turned over like an
text: object, as tears flow silently down her face.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 40 - INT. LIVING ROOM -DAY
dialog: 
text: Anne is at the piano and plays the piece from the Scene 3. We
text: watch her and listen to her for a while.
dialog: 
text: Georges is seated in his armchair and looks at the piano.
text: Finally he leans over toward the CD player and stops it. The
text: MUSIC suddenly stops. Georges remains silently seated.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 41 - INT. KITCHEN - HALLWAY - BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: He prepares a bowl of muesli, fills a sipping cup with water
text: and brings both into the bedroom. Sits down on the bed close
dialog: to Anne to feed her her food.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: There, my love, I hope you like it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: OK...
dialog: 
text: He begins to feed her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: I added a little orange juice. I
dialog: find it tastes quite good.
dialog: 
text: She can only swallow slowly, and so something keeps running
text: back out of her mouth. He wipes it with a tea towel,
text: continues to feed her. Finally, after a few mouthfuls, she
text: keeps her mouth shut.
dialog: 46.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, Anne, you have to eat some
dialog: more. You've only swallowed three
text: mouthfuls.
dialog: 
text: Anne continues to keep her lips sealed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Please, darling. A bit more.
dialog: 
text: Anne doesn't move. He puts the muesli on the night stand and
text: holds the sipping cup to her lips. She drinks slowly, one sip
text: after the other. He pulls the cup back between each sip, to
dialog: give her more time. Suddenly she says:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: ...Mom to the concert...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Yes?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: ...Mom to the concert... no
dialog: dress...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Mom has no dress for the concert?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: ...Mom to concert... no ... uuu...
dialog: no...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Yes?
dialog: 
text: Long PAUSE. Georges waits.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 42 - INT. BATHROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Georges and the nurse install Anne on a metal armchair in the
dialog: shower.
dialog: 
text: As she does so, the nurse keeps talking reassuringly to Anne.
text: Finally, she turns on the tap.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: (in a monotone)
dialog: Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
dialog: Help!...
dialog: 
text: Without being phased, the nurse continues to speak
text: reassuringly. Georges remains standing there, helpless.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 43 - INT. KITCHEN - HALLWAY - BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 47.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: Kitchen.
dialog: 
text: Georges and the nurse are seated at the table with a cup of
text: coffee. In front of the nurse, on the table, is a sum of
text: money. As they speak, we hear, coming from the room, Anne's
text: CALLS FOR HELP.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: ... we could take turns. She'd come
dialog: from 8 till 12 and I'd do 2 until
dialog: 6, or 3 to 7. That would certainly
dialog: relieve the pressure on you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: I'll think about it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: She just has to know in time so she
dialog: can arrange it in her schedule.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Yes, of course, I'll let you know
dialog: in the next few days.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Very well. I have to go now...
dialog: 
text: She takes the money on the table, pockets it and gets up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks for the coffee.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: My pleasure. I'll see you out.
dialog: 
text: They both leave the kitchen. As the nurse, in the hallway,
text: takes her jacket off the hook in the closet and puts it on,
text: she comments on Anne's continuing CALLS FOR HELP.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: You mustn't take it too seriously.
dialog: Usually they always say something.
dialog: She might just as well say "Mom,
dialog: Mom, Mom". It's just mechanical.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: (nodding, softly)
dialog: I know.
dialog: 
text: They've reached the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Goodbye, sir.
dialog: 48.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Goodbye.
dialog: 
text: He closes the door behind her. Remains motionless a moment,
text: then goes into the bedroom, where Anne's CALLS FOR HELP,
dialog: unaltered, continue.
dialog: 
text: Georges sits down beside Anne on the bed, takes her hand,
text: holds her. After a while, Anne calms down, her CALLS FOR HELP
text: become quieter and finally stop altogether.
dialog: 
text: After a long PAUSE:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: (slowly, softly)
dialog: I'd like to hire a second nurse.
dialog: The two could take turns. That
dialog: would make everything a bit
dialog: simpler. What do you think?
dialog: 
dialog: Long PAUSE. Then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: (softly) ...Help...Help...
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 44 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: They are both lying in bed. Georges SNORES noisily. Anne's
text: eyes are open.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 45 - INT. HALLWAY - KITCHEN - DAY
dialog: 
text: The front door. We hear the key in the lock. Georges enters
text: with a shopping bag, and behind him is the superintendent. He
text: carries bigger and heavier bags. Georges holds the door open
dialog: for him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Would you mind putting them in the
dialog: kitchen.
dialog: 
text: The superintendent precedes him into the kitchen with the
text: bags. Georges calls toward the bedroom:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm ba-aack!
dialog: 
text: He then follows the superintendent into the kitchen.
dialog: 
text: The superintendent has put the bags on the work surface.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks very much.
dialog: 49.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUPERINTENDENT
dialog: Can I do anything else for you,
dialog: sir?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: No, thanks, Mr. Méry. You've been a
dialog: big help.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUPERINTENDENT
dialog: Oh, it's nothing, sir.
dialog: 
text: Georges has already taken out his wallet and gives some money
dialog: to the superintendent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUPERINTENDENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks a lot, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: I'll let you know if I need you
dialog: again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUPERINTENDENT
dialog: With pleasure, sir.
dialog: 
text: He gets ready to leave. He stops again in the doorway and
text: turns around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUPERINTENDENT (CONT'D)
dialog: May I say something, sir?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUPERINTENDENT
dialog: My wife and I, we're very impressed
dialog: by the way you're managing
text: everything. I take my hat off to
dialog: you.
dialog: 
text: As he speaks, Georges' mobile phone has started to ring.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: (taking the mobile phone from the
dialog: pocket of his jacket)
dialog: That's very kind of you. Thanks.
dialog: See you soon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUPERINTENDENT
dialog: Give my regards to your wife.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: I certainly will. Thanks.
dialog: 50.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: As the superintendent leaves the apartment, Georges looks at
text: the display on his mobile phone and makes a call.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello Eva, how are you?... Things
dialog: are fine.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 46 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Georges, standing at the foot of the bed, faces Anne and
text: starts singing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: (insistently)...Sur le pont ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: ... Ssssur...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: ...Sur le pont...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: po ... pont ... sss

speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: ...Sur le pont ... Sur le pont ...

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: ... ssur... le ..
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: ... pont... Sur le pont
text: d'Avignon... (he begins to sing):
dialog: Sur le pont d'Avignon on y danse,
dialog: on y danse, sur le pont d'Avignon
dialog: tout le monde y danse en rond...
dialog: 
text: He encourages her to sing with him. Starts singing again:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Sur le pont d' Avignon, on y danse,
dialog: on y danse ...
dialog: 
text: Anne tries to sing too, she has a hint of a smile on her
text: face, but she produces only isolated SOUNDS.
dialog: 51.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: (singing to encourage Anne,
text: accompanied by the sounds that she
dialog: produces): Sur le pont d'Avignon on
dialog: y danse, on y danse ... Sur le pont
dialog: d'Avignon tout le monde y danse en
dialog: rond ...
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 47 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: A second nurse is doing Anne's hair roughly. The brush sticks
text: in her tangled hair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECOND NURSE
speaker_heading: ("CHEERY")
dialog: ... there we are...now we're all
dialog: beautiful again...so everybody will
dialog: admire us...there...you see...
dialog: wait...
dialog: 
text: She takes a mirror that she has placed within reach. Holds it
text: in front of Anne's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECOND NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Well?... What do we say to that?
dialog: Aren't we a pretty sight?
dialog: 
text: Anne, sickened, averts her eyes. Emits a muffled SOUND. The
text: nurse ignores it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECOND NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: You'll see, Monsieur will be
dialog: dazzled by you...
dialog: 
text: Furious SOUND from Anne.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 48 - INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The window opening onto the light well is open. A pigeon has
text: landed on the window ledge.
dialog: 
text: It walks to and fro, then finally dares to jump down inside,
text: onto the floor. It starts to explore the surroundings.
dialog: 
text: We hear the TOILET FLUSH. Georges comes out of the toilet.
text: The door opening frightens the pigeon. Alarmed, flapping its
text: wings, it flutters about the room.
dialog: 
text: After a moment of surprise, Georges tries to shoo it back
text: toward the window. But the bird escapes in the opposite
text: direction. George follows it.
dialog: 
text: He closes the doors of the other rooms. Coming from the
text: bedroom, we faintly hear ANNE'S VOICE.
dialog: 52.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Georges fetches a towel from the bathroom. He chases the
text: bird. He hits out at the bird for so long that it escapes
text: back out through the window. Georges, visibly exhausted, has
text: to sit down on the chest in the hallway.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 49 - INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Georges and the second nurse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: ... as you wish, sir. I don't know
dialog: what you were expecting. I gave up
dialog: another job to come and work here.
dialog: You should have thought it over
dialog: before deciding whether you wanted
dialog: a second nurse or not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: But I've only just found out how
dialog: incompetent you are.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
speaker_heading: (FURIOUS)
dialog: What's that supposed to mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: I don't want to discuss it with
dialog: you. Anyway, you wouldn't
dialog: understand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: No one has ever complained.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Good for you. (To get rid of her)
dialog: How much do I owe you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: (after a brief calculation)
dialog: Seven hundred and eighty euros.
dialog: 
text: Georges takes his wallet from his jacket hanging on the
text: armchair and takes out eight one-hundred euro bills. The
text: nurse is hopping mad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: I've never had anything like this
dialog: happen to me before. Who do you
dialog: think you are?! I've been doing
dialog: this job for ten years. I don't
dialog: need you to teach me how to do it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Do you have twenty euros?
dialog: 53.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The nurse takes out her purse angrily, looks inside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Then take the eight hundred euros.
dialog: You can go now.
dialog: 
text: The nurse pockets the money.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: You're a nasty old man. I feel
dialog: sorry for you.
dialog: 
text: Georges has put back his wallet, turns to her again and looks
text: at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: I hope from the bottom of my heart
dialog: that one day someone treats you the
dialog: way you treat your patients, and
dialog: that you too will have no way of
dialog: defending yourself. Now get out.
dialog: 
text: She looks at him, at first doesn't know what to answer, then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Go fuck yourself, you old fart!
dialog: 
text: She leaves, slamming the door behind her. A few seconds
text: later, we hear the front door of the apartment fall shut.
text: Georges sits down in his armchair, looks straight ahead. Then
text: he lights a cigarette, his hands shake, he smokes.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 50 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: He tries to pour some tea into her mouth with the sipping
text: cup. She won't loosen her lips.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: ... Please, open your mouth... go
dialog: on... open it... Anne! Please!...
dialog: come on... stop that!...
dialog: 
text: He sits upright.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: If you don't drink, you'll die.
dialog: 
text: Indecipherable SOUND from ANNE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Is that what you want?
dialog: 54.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: PAUSE. She looks at him. He bends over her again, presents
text: the cup in front of her sealed lips.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, Anne, please.
dialog: 
text: She doesn't react. He opens her lips with his fingers and
text: tries carefully, but using some force, to separate her teeth.
text: Pours a little tea in. The liquid runs out of her mouth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (ANGRILY)
dialog: Goddammit!
dialog: 
text: He puts down the cup, takes a towel and wipes the liquid,
text: some of which has run down onto the pillow. He tries to mop
text: it up. She watches him the whole time. Finally he puts the
text: towel down beside the cup and looks at her. Tries not to show
text: his helplessness and his anger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Anne! ... You can't force me to let
dialog: you die of thirst. If you persist,
dialog: I'll call Bertier and he'll put you
dialog: in hospital. They can force-feed
dialog: you there. Is that what you want?
dialog: 
scene_heading: BRIEF PAUSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: I promised to spare you that. But
dialog: you must help me. I'm out of my
dialog: depth.
dialog: 
text: He takes the cup again and puts it against her lips.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Please, Anne!
dialog: 
text: Her lips remain sealed. He presses the cup hard against them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Drink that, now!
dialog: 
text: It hurts her, so she opens her mouth and lets in a little
dialog: liquid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: There!
dialog: 
text: She closes her mouth again and he puts down the cup.
dialog: 55.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: 
dialog: Good.
dialog: 
text: Then she spits it all out like a fountain. After a moment of
text: bewilderment, he slaps her.
dialog: 
text: SILENCE. He's frightened by his own gesture. Then he puts
text: down the cup and sits on the chair beside the bed. They don't
text: look at each other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LONG PAUSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
speaker_heading: (SOFTLY)
dialog: Help... help...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
speaker_heading: (SOFTLY)
dialog: Please, forgive me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: (softly) Help... Help... Help...
dialog: Help...
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 51 - INT. APARTMENT - DAY
dialog: 
text: The various paintings hanging in the apartment. Without their
text: frames. Like views on various realities.
dialog: 
text: SILENCE. Sometimes, the REMOTE sound of TRAFFIC in the
dialog: distance.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 52 - INT. HALLWAY - LIVING ROOM - DINING ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
dialog: Living room.
dialog: 
text: Georges is drinking tea and reading the newspaper. SILENCE.
text: Suddenly, the DOORBELL RINGS.
dialog: 
text: Georges, annoyed, puts down his newspaper, gets up, goes into
text: the hallway and goes to the front door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Who's there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA'S VOICE
dialog: It's me.
dialog: 56.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Eva?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA'S VOICE
dialog: (a bit irritated) Yes.
dialog: 
text: Georges, panicked, thinks for a few seconds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Just a minute.
dialog: 
text: He goes toward the bedroom door, locks it and puts the key in
text: his pocket. He goes into the dining room, also closes the
text: door leading to the bedroom. He comes back. He is about to go
text: toward the front door, but remains motionless an instant,
text: opens the door of the toilet that is located just nearby,
text: flushes the toilet, closes the toilet door again and opens
text: the front door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello.
dialog: 
text: A brief kiss hello.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Hello. What was going on?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: I was in the toilet. Sorry.
dialog: 
text: He closes the front door behind Eva, indicates the direction
text: of the living room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Come in.
dialog: 
text: Eva points to the bedroom with a questioning look. He shakes
text: his head as if to play down the question, and indicates back
text: in the direction of the living room, as if to say: "You
text: understand, huh?". Eva is slightly irritated, but follows him
text: into the living room.
dialog: 
text: He closes the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Why this unannounced visit? Where
dialog: have you come from?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: What's going on with Mom?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Nothing. What should be going on?
dialog: 57.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Well... (gesture toward the
speaker_heading: BEDROOM)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Don't you want to sit down first?
dialog: 
text: Eva wants to answer, but finally gives in and sits down.
text: Georges does the same.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: So why are you in Paris?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: What's going on with Mom? Why don't
dialog: you answer the phone? After our
dialog: last conversation, I left four
dialog: messages on your answering machine.
dialog: Why don't you call back?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Sorry. I didn't listen to it.
dialog: Forgive me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Don't you realize we're worried?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Your worries are no use to me.
dialog: 
text: Eva glares at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: No, don't get me wrong. I'm not
dialog: criticizing you. I just don't have
dialog: the time to deal with your worries,
dialog: that's all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Dad...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: No. Let's stop this conversation
dialog: right there. I'm taking care of
dialog: your mother. It's a full-time job.
dialog: And I'm not saying that to
dialog: complain, just to explain why I
dialog: didn't answer your phone calls and
dialog: why I don't want to have any
dialog: pointless discussions on the
dialog: subject. Your mother is just as
dialog: could have been expected: bad the
dialog: whole time.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 58.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
text: She is turning more and more into a
text: helpless child, and it's sad and
dialog: humiliating, for her and for me.
dialog: And she doesn't want to be seen in
dialog: that state either. Even the last
dialog: time you visited, she didn't want
dialog: you to come. You two have your own
dialog: life. Nothing wrong with that. But
dialog: let us have our life too. Even
dialog: though it's a lousy one. OK?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Dad, what's the matter?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Nothing's the matter; your visit
dialog: caught me by surprise. And I'm
dialog: annoyed that you show up here to
dialog: check that everything's OK. Who do
dialog: you think you are?
dialog: 
text: PAUSE. Eva is speechless.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: I...
dialog: 
text: Then she gets up and makes to go to the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Stay here, will you!
dialog: 
text: She stops short, looks at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: (softly, but insistently)
dialog: Please!
dialog: 
text: She hesitates a moment, but winds up leaving the living room.
dialog: 
text: WE HEAR HER PASS IN THE HALLWAY TO GO INTO THE BEDROOM AND
text: HER VAIN ATTEMPT TO OPEN THE DOOR.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA (O.S.)
dialog: Mom? ... Mom??
dialog: 
text: Georges remains seated, motionless, until she comes back. She
text: seems upset by the situation, as one would expect.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell me, what's going on? Have you
dialog: gone crazy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Please, sit down.
dialog: 59.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: I don't want to sit down. What's
dialog: going on here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY)
dialog: Nothing's going on. I want to spare
dialog: us all a pointless drama. I presume
dialog: your mother is asleep. She mostly
dialog: sleeps the whole day. And then she
dialog: wakes up at night. If you really
dialog: want to, we'll go and see her in a
dialog: little while. Now, sit down. OK?
dialog: 
text: They look at each other.
dialog: 
text: Reluctantly, Eva heads toward her armchair and sits down.
text: PAUSE. Then Georges goes on in a quiet voice:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: We do our speech exercises every
dialog: day, or we sing together. Most of
dialog: the time, I wake up around 5. At
text: that time, she's still awake. Then
dialog: we change her incontinence pad. I
text: rub cream on her to avoid sores.
dialog: Then, around 7, I try to persuade
dialog: her to eat and drink. Sometimes it
dialog: works, sometimes not. Sometimes she
dialog: tells me things from her childhood,
text: then for hours she calls for help,
text: and then an instant later she's
text: giggling away to herself, or
dialog: crying. Nothing of any of that is
dialog: worth showing to anyone.
dialog: 
text: SILENCE. Eva looks down. Finally, she says:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
speaker_heading: (SOFTLY)
dialog: You can't stop me from seeing her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
speaker_heading: (ALSO SOFTLY)
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: They remain seated for a moment, finally Eva gets up. Georges
text: follows her into the hallway.
dialog: 
text: He unlocks the door and they enter the bedroom.
dialog: 
text: The bright light from outside filters through the blinds.
dialog: 60.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Eva goes over to the bed, looks at Anne. Finally, she
text: caresses her face, shyly and clumsily. Anne opens her eyes.
text: Looks at her. No movement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: It's me, Mom.
dialog: 
text: Anne emits a FURIOUS SOUND.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (HELPLESS)
dialog: Can I do something for you? Mom...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Mom... Mom... Mom... Mom... Mom...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SILENCE.
dialog: 
text: Georges has remained by the door. After a while, they both
text: leave the bedroom, cross the hallway to come back in the
dialog: living room.
dialog: 
text: Georges closes the door. For an instant he puts a consoling
text: hand on Eva's shoulder. Then he sits down.
dialog: 
text: Eva, trying to compose herself, goes toward the window and
text: looks outside. Suddenly she starts sobbing.
dialog: 
text: After a while, Georges gets up and goes out of the room. Eva,
text: vexed, blows her nose.
dialog: 
text: Shortly after, Georges comes back. He has another teacup in
text: his hand, puts it down beside his on the table and sits down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
text: The tea isn't very hot any more.
dialog: 
text: Eva turns toward him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: But it does make you feel better.
dialog: 
text: After a short PAUSE, Eva comes toward the table. Sits down.
text: He fills her cup.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
text: She takes the cup, drinks. Replaces it. Still can't bring
text: herself to look at him.
dialog: 61.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: It was silly of me to lock the
dialog: door. I'm sorry. You took me by
dialog: surprise, that's all. I'm sorry.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: What's going to happen now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: (with a little ironic laugh)
dialog: What's going to happen now? The
dialog: nurse comes twice a week, and every
dialog: two weeks Dr. Bertier and the
dialog: hairdresser come. That's what you
dialog: want to know, right?
dialog: Things will go on as they have done
dialog: up until now. They'll go from bad
dialog: to worse. Things will go on, and
dialog: then one day it will all be over.
dialog: 
dialog: Brief PAUSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: You can't go on like this, Dad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Can't I? What do you suggest?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Can't we have a serious talk, you
dialog: and me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: What do you call "a serious talk"?
dialog: What do you want to suggest? Do you
dialog: want to have Mom live with you? Do
dialog: you want to pack her off to a care
dialog: home? Do you? What do you want? Go
dialog: on, talk to me "seriously"!
dialog: 
text: Eva looks at him.

scene_heading: SCENE 53 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Georges is seated on the bed beside Anne, who is still
text: bedridden.
dialog: 62.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: (in a rush)... short... short
dialog: dress... only I... only I... all
dialog: long... it was... (with a small
text: gesture to imitate a bell): ding...
dialog: dong...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
speaker_heading: (SMILING)
text: Yes, it swung to and fro.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: (still rushed) ... yes... to ...
dialog: fro ... you... very serious... like
text: that... (she imitates a serious
text: countenance, continues in a low
dialog: voice): like that... serious...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: (unable to keep from laughing a
dialog: little) Yes. I think I was pretty
dialog: uptight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: (smiling) yes... up... tight...
dialog: 
text: PAUSE. Anne puts her hand on Georges'.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: ... it was n...nice...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SILENCE.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 54 - INT. BATHROOM - HALLWAY - BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BATHROOM
dialog: 
text: Georges is shaving. Suddenly we hear, coming from the
dialog: bedroom,
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE'S VOICE
dialog: (loud) Help... Help... Help...
dialog: Help... Help...
dialog: 
text: Georges wipes his face and, to the sound of Anne's cries,
text: crosses the hallway and enters the bedroom.
dialog: 
text: Anne continues to cry out in a monotone to herself.
dialog: 
text: Georges goes over to her bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES
text: (trying to calm her like a sick
dialog: child) What is it?..
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 63.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you in pain?... What's the
dialog: matter?... Is your pad full?
dialog: 
text: He raises her blanket for an instant and sniffs, then
dialog: replaces it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: No... So what's hurting you?
dialog: 
text: He sits down beside her on the bed. Takes her hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: It's all right... it's all right ...
dialog: I'm here... everything's fine...
dialog: we'll... Hold on, I'll tell you a
dialog: story... but you must be quiet, I
dialog: can't talk too loud, it wears me
dialog: out... Here we go: when I was
dialog: little... well, I wasn't as little
dialog: as all that... it was toward the
dialog: end of primary school, so I was
dialog: about ten, Dad and Mom sent me to a
dialog: holiday camp. They thought it would
dialog: do me good to spend the summer with
dialog: kids my own age... We were lodged
text: in an old castle in the midst of a
dialog: magnificent wooded landscape... I
dialog: think it was in the Auvergne... I
dialog: don't know... in any case it was
dialog: the opposite of what I'd
dialog: expected... We had to get up at 6
dialog: and go for a morning swim. Not far
dialog: from the castle, there was a pond
text: fed by an icy mountain stream. We
text: entered it running, in a double
dialog: file. You know, I was never very
dialog: sporty. They had a program to keep
dialog: us on the go all day, probably to
dialog: nip any potential pubescent
dialog: impulses in the bud ... But the
dialog: worst thing was the food. The third
dialog: day after our arrival, there was
dialog: rice pudding for lunch. I hate rice
text: pudding. We sat at long tables in a
dialog: huge hall. I didn't want to eat the
dialog: stuff and the housemaster said to
dialog: me: You won't get up until you've
dialog: cleared your plate. So after the
dialog: meal everybody left the room, and I
dialog: remained seated, in tears. I had
dialog: made a secret pact with Mom. I was
dialog: to send her a postcard every week.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 64.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGES (CONT'D)
dialog: If I was pleased with the place I
dialog: was to draw some flowers on it, or
dialog: if not, some stars. She kept the
dialog: card; it was covered all over in
dialog: stars. After three hours, I was
dialog: allowed to leave the table. I went
dialog: up to my room, got into bed and had
dialog: a fever of 42 degrees. It was
dialog: diphtheria. They took me to the
dialog: nearest hospital where I was put in
dialog: an isolation ward, which meant that
dialog: Mom, when she came to visit me,
dialog: could only wave at me through a
dialog: window. At some point I lost that
dialog: postcard. It's a pity.
dialog: 
text: Anne has become ever calmer during Georges' story. He still
text: holds her hand.
dialog: 
scene_heading: LONG SILENCE.
dialog: 
text: Then Georges reaches across Anne's body to get hold of his
text: pillow and presses it over her face. STIFLED SOUNDS from
text: Anne. Everything that can still move in her body starts to
text: move. Georges presses down heavily on the pillow, lies on it
dialog: with his whole weight, for a long time, until all Anne's
text: movements stop. Then he sits up, exhausted, and without
text: removing the pillow from her face, remains seated beside her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SILENCE.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 55 - INT. HALLWAY - KITCHEN - DAY
dialog: 
dialog: Hallway.
dialog: 
text: The front door of the apartment is unlocked. Georges, in city
text: clothes, enters with two big shopping bags full of cut
text: flowers. He puts down the bags, takes off his coat, hangs it
text: in the closet.
dialog: 
text: The TELEPHONE RINGS. Georges takes the bags and carries them
text: in the kitchen, puts them in the sink, fills it with water.
text: He starts to cut the stems and put the flowers in the water.
text: We watch him doing so for a while. Meanwhile, the TELEPHONE
text: HAS STOPPED RINGING.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 56 - INT. HALLWAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: Georges has opened one of the sections of the large wall
text: closet. He is looking for a specific dress. He takes some
text: out, puts them back inside. One of the dresses slips off its
text: hanger and falls to the floor. He picks it up, hangs it up
text: again. He ends up finding the one he was looking for. He
text: takes it out on its hanger. Closes the closet again.
dialog: 65.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Looks at the dress. Then he lowers his arm a little and is
text: about to leave the bedroom. He catches his feet in the dress.
dialog: 
text: He just saves himself from tripping up by grabbing on to the
text: wheelchair that is parked there. Exhausted, he flops down
dialog: into it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 57 - INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: With wide adhesive tape, Georges seals up the door frame of
dialog: the bedroom.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 58 - INT. KITCHEN - ADJOINING BEDROOM - HALLWAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: Georges is seated at the kitchen table where he had breakfast
text: with Anne in Scene 8, and writes a letter. PAUSES for
text: reflection. GENTLE COOING OF PIGEONS, scarcely audible.
text: Suddenly, Georges starts.
dialog: 
text: At the far end of the long kitchen, beside the door between
text: the kitchen units, a pigeon is walking. Georges stares at it.
dialog: For a long time.
dialog: 
text: Then he gets up slowly and, via the door located beside the
text: kitchen table, he goes into the adjoining room.
dialog: 
text: On the sofa there, he has set up his new bed. He takes the
text: wool blanket from the bed and comes back into the kitchen,
text: carefully approaches the pigeon that then runs off in alarm.
text: Georges carefully opens up the blanket and finally throws it
text: over the pigeon. But it manages to escape into the hallway.
dialog: 
text: Georges follows it. This action is repeated several times.
text: The pigeon is more and more panicky, starts to fly up,
text: flutters about in all directions. Georges closes the light-
text: well window to cut off its escape route. This lasts an
text: exhausting amount of time, but he ends up capturing it. He
text: cuddles it against him, rolled up in the blanket, leans
text: against a wall, then holds it as if it were a baby.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 59 - INT. ADJOINING ROOM - KITCHEN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: From the adjoining room, we see Georges seated at the kitchen
text: table, writing. Finally we see what he is writing:
dialog: 
dialog: ... you won't believe it. A pigeon came in, for the second
text: time already, through the light well. This time I caught it.
dialog: In fact it wasn't difficult at all. But I set it free again.
dialog: I'm going to ...
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 60 - INT. ADJOINING ROOM - KITCHEN - HALLWAY - DAY
dialog: 66.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Georges is lying on his bed in the adjoining room, staring at
text: the ceiling. O.S., we faintly hear the SOUND of running
text: water, and from time to time the CLATTERING OF DISHES.
dialog: 
text: After a while, Georges gets up and goes into the kitchen.
dialog: 
text: He remains in the doorway and watches Anne who, doing the
text: dishes, at first doesn't pay attention to him, then notices
text: his presence and shoots him a quick glance, saying casually:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: I'm almost done.
dialog: 
text: Georges continues to look at her unwaveringly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE'S VOICE
dialog: You can put your shoes on if you
dialog: want.
dialog: 
text: Georges looks at her an instant longer, passes beside her,
text: goes into the hallway, sits down on a stool beside the closet
text: and puts on his shoes. O.S. we hear Anne finishing her work.
text: She comes out, hangs up her apron in the closet, disappears
text: for a few moments into the bathroom. Meanwhile, Georges has
text: got up, and looks in the bathroom where, clearly, Anne is
text: tidying her hair and sprucing herself up. When she comes out
text: again, he takes her coat from the closet and helps her put it
dialog: on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
text: They head for the front door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Aren't you taking a coat?
dialog: 
text: Georges thinks a few seconds, then takes his trench-coat from
text: the hook and they leave the apartment.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENE 61 - INT. HALLWAY - BEDROOM - DINING ROOM - LIVING ROOM
speaker_heading: - DAY
dialog: 
text: Four long shots: all the windows are open. The sun is
text: shining. It is fairly bright.
dialog: 
dialog: Hallway.
dialog: 
text: SILENCE. Then the SOUND OF A LOCK BEING OPENED. Eva comes
text: into the apartment. Remains a long time beside the door.
text: Looks around her, ill at ease. Finally she hesitantly goes
text: into the bedroom.
dialog: 67.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Anne's twin bed isn't there any more. On Georges' bed lies
text: only the bare mattress. Eva remains there a moment, then goes
text: through the partition door into the dining room.
dialog: 
text: There, everything is as usual. Eva continues into the living
dialog: room.
dialog: 
text: There too, everything is as usual. Eva stops by the piano
text: stool. Looks out of the window, feeling at a loss. Then she
text: heads toward the sofa and armchairs in the corner. On the
text: table lie the remains of a snack. Eva looks at the table,
text: turns again toward the open windows, through which we hear
text: STREET NOISE. Then she sits down, exhausted, in one of the
text: armchairs. Her diminutive frame seems lost in the big room.
