dialog: 
text: Mozart's concerto filters from a jeep's stereo, fighting the

text: listens to the music.
dialog: 
text: An Indian BOY playing by the roadside steers his wooden toy
text: ship across a puddle.
dialog: 
text: The Professor turns to his driver, pointing to the boy.
dialog: 
scene_heading: PROF. WEST
dialog: Watch out!
dialog: 
text: But it's too late. The jeep drives straight through the
text: puddle at full speed, sinking the boy's toy ship.
dialog: 
text: In the background, the jeep stops in front of a building. The

scene_heading: INT. NAGA-DENG MINE/INDIA - SUNSET
dialog: 
text: An endless mine shaft. An old elevator cage comes to a

dialog: 
scene_heading: PROF. WEST
dialog: How deep are we?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SATNAM
dialog: 8200 feet. Used to be an old copper

scene_heading: PROF. WEST
dialog: Helmsley told me that the neutrino
dialog: count doubled during the last sun
text: eruptions.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SATNAM
dialog: Correct, sir. But that is not what
dialog: worries me...
dialog: 
text: They enter a large room with low hanging ceilings. A small
text: group of WHITE COATS look up from their computers, which all
dialog: show images of the solar storm we witnessed earlier.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SATNAM (CONT'D)
dialog: There was a new solar storm, so strong
dialog: that the physical reaction got even
dialog: more severe.
dialog: 
scene_heading: PROF. WEST
dialog: How can that be?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SATNAM
dialog: We don't know, Professor, sir.
dialog: 
text: Satnam walks over into another room. There he opens a hatch
text: on the floor and hot steam rises.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SATNAM (CONT'D)
dialog: The neutrinos suddenly act like...

dialog: 
speaker_heading: POLITICAL AID #1
dialog: Look at Anheuser. Anyone would think he

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADRIAN
dialog: I still can't believe that Wilson chose
dialog: him of all people to run the White
dialog: House.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POLITICAL AID #2
dialog: Why not? Anheuser owns the Senate and

speaker_heading: ADRIAN

speaker_heading: ANHEUSER (O.S.)
dialog: Somebody mention my name?

dialog: It's Helmsley, right? I'll remember

dialog: 
text: Anheuser walks away with a dangerous smile.

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Adrian follows Anheuser through a hallway of the White House,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADRIAN
dialog: Sir, the President needs to know this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANHEUSER
dialog: Helmsley, how long have you been on the
dialog: job as science advisor?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADRIAN
dialog: Four months this week.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANHEUSER
dialog: I would say that's enough time to learn
dialog: that we have rules here. You'll just
dialog: have to wait until the quarterly
dialog: science briefing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADRIAN
dialog: If this is about what I said last
dialog: night, I am truly sorry, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANHEUSER
dialog: So you didn't like my speech?
dialog: 
text: Exasperated, Adrian holds out the papers to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADRIAN
dialog: Can you please have a look at this,
dialog: sir? It's really important.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
text: Finally, Anheuser rips the papers out of his hands and starts
text: to walk away, reading.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly he slows down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANHEUSER
dialog: Who wrote this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADRIAN
dialog: An Indian astrophysicist I graduated
dialog: with from Harvard and Prof. West, the
dialog: preeminent geologist in the US.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANHEUSER
dialog: Who else knows about it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADRIAN
dialog: No one, sir.

speaker_heading: ANHEUSER
dialog: Let's keep it that way, Helmsley.

speaker_heading: JACKSON

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So, now that you got your map, where

speaker_heading: ADRIAN (O.S.)
dialog: We can't get to you. Whatever you did,

scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
dialog: 
text: Back on the bridge, Anheuser regains consciousness and gets

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ANTE-CHAMBER ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
dialog: 
text: The water level in Tamara's compartment is at its height now

dialog: 
text: Tamara drowns.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
dialog: 
text: Jackson manages to find an air pocket. He fills up his lungs

dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 120.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
dialog: 
text: Lin is being held up in the water by his brother and parents.
dialog: 
text: Kate has wrapped the belt around his lower leg and now pulls

dialog: 
text: Noah uses this as the moment to dive underwater, unnoticed,
text: to go and help his father.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
dialog: 
text: Back under water, Jackson is using the extension cord of the
text: power drill to pull himself down to the tool cabinet.
dialog: 
text: Jackson opens it, retrieving a giant crowbar. He begins to
text: use it to dislodge the tool but it's hard work.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
dialog: 
text: Anheuser and everybody on the bridge stares as the north face
text: of Mount Everest is almost upon them.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
dialog: 
text: Kate and the Pangs are desperately close to running out of

dialog: 
text: After a moment she turns and is first confused then horrified
text: to see that Noah is nowhere to be found.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Noah!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
dialog: 
text: Jackson pulls with all his might, but he can't quite shift
dialog: the drill.
dialog: 
text: To his surprise, a pair of young hands join his on the handle
text: of the crowbar. Noah is alongside him now, helping.
dialog: 
text: Working as father and son, they manage, little by little, to
text: loosen it before finally the drill comes free.
dialog: 
text: Adrian gives Noah the thumbs up and the boy heads back to the
text: surface. Jackson goes to follow but in the last moment he

dialog: 
text: He dives back down for it.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NOAH (O.S.)
dialog: We got it free. Can you hear me? We did
dialog: it!
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADRIAN

scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

scene_heading: INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
dialog: 
text: Jackson reaches his knapsack, but when sees Noah's cell phone
text: lying next to it, he makes a decision and reaches for that
dialog: instead.
dialog: 
text: He hears the muffled sound of the engines and smiles. But as
text: he turns to swim back, his face freezes--
dialog: 
text: He's looking into the lifeless eyes of Gordon, who floats
