scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT
dialog: Shooting Script - 25th August 2006
dialog: Pink Revisions - 27th September 2006
dialog: Blue Revisions - 11th October 2006
dialog: This script is the confidential and proprietary property of
dialog: Paramount Vantage, and no portion of it may be performed,
dialog: distributed, reproduced, used, quoted, or published without prior
dialog: written permission.
text: NOTES ON OUR APPROACH.
dialog: Given the emotional power of the film comes from the fact
dialog: that it is a true story, we have tried to be as accurate as
dialog: possible to the chronology of the real events.
text: Real events don’t come in the neatly shaped packages of
text: conventional drama. They are disorganised, sometimes
dialog: random, often without explanation. We feel that not only
dialog: is it more honest to remain true to these events, but it
dialog: will also add a sense of authenticity. We want the audience
dialog: to trust that they are seeing an accurate account of what
dialog: happened. If they are convinced the film is authentic the
dialog: emotional power of the film comes from the real, terrible
text: situation that Mariane and Danny found themselves in.
dialog: Our main source of information is obviously Mariane’s book.
dialog: However we have also talked to all the key characters
dialog: before making the film. We have met with Mariane, Asra,
text: Randall Bennett, Zahoor, Asif the Fixer, Jameel Yusuf,
text: Captain, Bussey, Dost and communicated with Steve LeVine.
text: Each meeting adds extra details to the story.
dialog: Given this approach to the overall story telling it is
text: obviously important that the detail within the scenes also
text: seems natural, spontaneous and honest. The dialogue script
dialog: is therefore a blueprint. A starting point for the actors,
dialog: giving a guide to the content of the scene. When we have
dialog: cast the actors we would expect them to spend time with the
dialog: real characters, getting to know them, hearing how they
text: talk, getting details of their personal stories, seeing
dialog: their point of view on the events of that time.
text: When we film the scenes in Asra’s house - the heart of the
dialog: story - we will film on location in Pakistan or India. We
dialog: will shoot in chronological order, allowing the actors to
dialog: build relationships with each other that mirror the
text: relationships the real characters had. The camera is hand
dialog: held, natural lighting is used where possible, allowing the
dialog: actors the freedom to go where they want to go, to
dialog: improvise when they want. Often in the script a scene may
text: be boiled down to three or four lines of key dialogue. This
text: may well be what ends up in the finished film. But during
dialog: the filming we usually shoot the whole scene as it would
dialog: naturally happen. And we shoot the whole scene on each take
dialog: to allow a natural rhythm to develop. It also means the
dialog: scene can change and develop with each performance.
dialog: We therefore have a huge choice of material when it comes
text: to the edit. However, the intention is that the editing
text: should be crisp and fast, creating the pace of a thriller.
dialog: So, although the script is currently 140 pages, we expect
text: the film to run somewhere between 100 and 110 minutes.
dialog: This is an approach we have used before on films such as
scene_heading: THE ROAD TO GUANTANAMO, TRISTRAM SHANDY, 24 HOUR PARTY
scene_heading: PEOPLE and WONDERLAND.
