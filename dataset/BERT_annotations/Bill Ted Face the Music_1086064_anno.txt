dialog: First Draft
speaker_heading: OVER BLACK
text: We hear the VOICE of a very, very OLD MAN:
speaker_heading: VERY, VERY OLD MAN (V.O.)
text: This is the story of two young men who
dialog: were given a very, very grave
dialog: responsibility...
speaker_heading: FADE UP ON:
scene_heading: DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE:
text: CLOSE UP: VIDEO FOOTAGE OF BILL AND TED, 17 YEARS OLD, from
dialog: the beginning of “Excellent Adventure.”
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I’m Bill S Preston Esquire!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: And I am Ted “Theodore” Logan. And
dialog: together we are..
speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: Wyld Stallyns!!
text: CUT TO: BILL AND TED AT 19 - doing their guitar solo at the
text: end of “Bogus Journey” - the super-fast, virtuosic riffing...
text: SHOT: PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD, watching. CUT TO:
text: NOT LONG AFTER THAT (circa 1992): Bill and Ted, excited,
text: wide-eyed - the picture of youthful optimism. Being
text: interviewed by KURT LODER on MTV.
speaker_heading: KURT LODER
dialog: In other music news.. Claiming they have
dialog: been told by “a civilization seven hundred
dialog: years in the future” that their music will
dialog: “do nothing less than save the world..”
text: Now on MTV we see a PHOTO OF BILL AND TED, age 20.
speaker_heading: KURT LODER (CONT'D)
dialog: Wyld Stallyns has just put down a hundred
dialog: thousand dollars to reserve the famous
dialog: “Fabulous Forum” for a date twenty years
dialog: from now..
text: CUT TO: DISTANT, HAND-HELD VIDEO FOOTAGE of the guys handing
text: a ceremonial 4 foot check to the “FABULOUS FORUM” BOOKING
text: MANAGER. The footage is shaky and distant.
scene_heading: 20 YEAR OLD TED
dialog: See you all here in twenty years - to
dialog: celebrate two decades of triumphance!
scene_heading: 20 YEAR OLD BILL
dialog: How’s it goin’, future? See you soon!
text: 20 year old Bill and Ted turn to each other, do a little air
text: guitar. FREEZE on that image - and HOLD, with ominous music.
text: CUT TO: THE BAND VAN HALEN
speaker_heading: SAMMY HAGAR
dialog: The only problem was - and it turns out to
dialog: be a pretty big problem..
speaker_heading: EDDIE VAN HALEN
dialog: They never came up with a song.
speaker_heading: ALEX VAN HALEN
dialog: The song, let’s say. Not to mention the
dialog: record. Or any record, really.
scene_heading: CUT TO: THE BAND IRON MAIDEN
speaker_heading: BRUCE DICKENSON
dialog: They got record deals - we know that cuz
dialog: they paid us a ton to just basically be
dialog: session guys.
speaker_heading: “NICKO” MCBRAIN
dialog: But no matter what we played, it was never
dialog: good enough.
speaker_heading: BRUCE DICKINSON
dialog: Yeah - cuz like, they kept saying to us:
dialog: “This has to save the world.”
speaker_heading: QUICK SHOTS:
speaker_heading: JEFF BECK
dialog: “No, Jeff - this has to save the world.”
speaker_heading: JIMMY PAGE
dialog: And I remember saying: “Guys, it’s a
dialog: song." The Beatles didn’t save the world.
dialog: Mozart didn’t save the world.
speaker_heading: ERIC CLAPTON
dialog: “Save the world, save the world...”
text: Clapton rolls his eyes and makes the “jerk off” motion. And
dialog: we CUT TO:
text: FOOTAGE FROM “BOGUS JOURNEY:” Bill and Ted, on stage, with
text: their wives to their side and their babies on their backs--
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (to crowd; re his son)
dialog: Say hello to Little Ted!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (same)
dialog: And Little Bill!
text: CUT TO: THEIR SONS NOW (INTERVIEWED ON TV)
text: 18 years old now. Title: “WILL LOGAN AND THEO PRESTON.”
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Okay, like, our dads - they were told - in
dialog: high school - that their music was gonna
dialog: save the world.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: I mean that’s a lot of pressure. Like, if
dialog: somebody came to us, and told us that our
dialog: music was gonna save the world?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Well that would be pretty okay.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Yeah, I’d be good with that.
text: CUT TO: THEIR WIVES, now. Title: “JOANNA PRESTON AND
scene_heading: ELIZABETH LOGAN.”
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Look, the point is, they took it seriously
dialog: - they take it seriously.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: They really care, and they work hard.
dialog: It’s pretty much all they do, actually.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: But they’ve found ways.. Certain,
dialog: whatever, ‘hobbies,’ you know, to cope.
scene_heading: CUT TO 1994: POLISH MTV
text: Not great video quality: the guys interviewed on a cheap
text: set. Ted is KNITTING some kind of thick, amorphous shape.
speaker_heading: POLISH INTERVIEWER (0.S.)
dialog: (Polish accent)
dialog: What are you making there, Ted?
speaker_heading: 24 YR OLD TED
dialog: I never know. I just knit till it feels
dialog: done.
speaker_heading: POLISH INTERVIEWER (0.S.)
dialog: It's very.. dense what you’re knitting.
speaker_heading: 24 YR OLD TED
dialog: Yah. I call em yarn blobs.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Ask Bill what he does to relax.
speaker_heading: POLISH INTERVIEWER (0.S.)
dialog: What do you do to relax, Bill?
text: Ted moves his mouth - but we hear BILL’S VOICE.
scene_heading: 24 YR OLD BILL’S VOICE COMING FROM TED
dialog: I do ventriloquism, dude!
text: CUT BACK TO: JOANNA AND ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER (0.S.)
dialog: How do you cope?
text: A beat. The women look at each other.. silence. Then:
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Let’s just say things didn’t go the way we
dialog: all expected them to go.
scene_heading: MORE QUICK SHOTS: A BRIEF TIMELINE:
text: 1995: 25 YR OLD BILL AND TED (with the princesses) rush from
text: the studio toward SUVs. CAMERAS PUSH IN - it’s like John and
text: Paul leaving Abbey Road with Linda and Yoko in 1968..
speaker_heading: REPORTER (0.S.)
dialog: Bill! Ted! When's the record coming out?
speaker_heading: 25 YR OLD BILL
text: (a McCartneyesque double-barrelled
dialog: finger-pointed thumbs up)
dialog: Almost there!
speaker_heading: 25 YR OLD TED
dialog: All good things come to those who wait.
text: 1996: STILL PHOTOS OF 26 YEAR OLD BILL AND TED BEHIND THE
scene_heading: SCENES AT A RADIO STATION INTERVIEW. BEARDED. A COUPLE
text: QUICK PUSH-INS - still upbeat and assured.
speaker_heading: RICK DEES (0.S.)
dialog: .».-So - the record? What gives? How about
dialog: right here - right now - you tell us the
dialog: definitive release date?
speaker_heading: 26 YEAR OLD TED (0.S.)
dialog: Oh.. Yeah.. Can’t do that..
speaker_heading: 26 YEAR OLD BILL (0.S.)
dialog: Just.. Changing directions a little bit.
dialog: But it’s all good stuff.
text: CUT TO: THE BAND ARCADE FIRE
speaker_heading: WIN BUTLER
dialog: They lost three record deals in as many
dialog: years. Cause, the thing with record
dialog: deals, when you get down to it: you kind
dialog: of have to make a record.
speaker_heading: REGINE CHASSAGNE
dialog: I personally felt sorry for them. They
dialog: were trying so hard that they were
dialog: actually driving people away..
text: QUICK PHOTOS: Bill and Ted playing increasingly obscure
text: instruments and wearing increasingly eccentric clothes
text: (capes, flight suits, kilts, knickerbockers.. play
text: didgeridoo, theramin, rainsticks, harp).
speaker_heading: WIN BUTLER (V.O.)
dialog: Or, maybe as people were drifting away, it
dialog: just made them try harder, it’s tough to
dialog: know.
text: QUICK VIDEO: A small venue. Bill & Ted wear loin cloths and
text: sandals and sport long Jesus beards and blow shofars.
text: CUT TO: KANYE WEST AND JAY Z
speaker_heading: KANYE WEST
dialog: It’s like they went from “She Loves You”
dialog: to “Revolution Number Nine” in a very
dialog: short time, without ever doing any of the
text: songs in between. Or even doing “She
dialog: Loves You,” when you think about it. Or
dialog: “Revolution Number Nine.”
speaker_heading: JAY Z
dialog: To be honest, they kind of just did nothing.
dialog: But a very lame, very pretentious version of
dialog: nothing.
scene_heading: 2000: SMALL OUTDOOR FESTIVAL - HAND HELD FAN VIDEO
text: Bill - totally nude (except for black combat boots) - does a
text: lead guitar version of TAPS while he approaches the mic.
scene_heading: 30 YEAR OLD BILL
dialog: Let us now declare the epoch of the
text: electric guitar.. officially dead.
text: We now reveal TED, behind him, also nude (and also in combat
text: boots), with a chain saw.
scene_heading: 30 YEAR OLD TED
dialog: (to his guitar)
dialog: I sacrifice thee, obsolescence embodied..
dialog: For eternity!
text: Now Ted chainsaws off the neck of Bill’s guitar - which
text: sparks and feeds back.
scene_heading: CUT TO: THE BAND METALLICA
speaker_heading: LARS ULRICH
dialog: I think that was that moment. The
dialog: Riverside Metal Fest. Okay - first of
dialog: all, right off the bat - they were using a
dialog: chain saw nude. I mean, that tells you
dialog: something about their judgement right
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: JAMES HETFIELD
dialog: I don’t think we heard another thing from
dialog: them til.. Hunh.. I don’t even know.
speaker_heading: STILL PHOTO:
scene_heading: MARQUEE OUTSIDE A DIVE BAR: “Ponderosa Lounge - 8PM The Wild
text: Stallions - and half-priced Buffalo chicken wings.” PUSH IN.
speaker_heading: LARS ULRICH (V.O.)
dialog: Are they even still making music? I mean,
dialog: what are they even doing now?
text: THROUGH THE WINDOW we see a grainy image of Bill and Ted, on
text: stage.. we FREEZE, then PULL BACK as the image becomes a:
text: HOLOGRAM and we begin to realize we are:
scene_heading: INT. FUTURISTIC DOME - CONTINUOUS
text: Where the THREE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN THE WORLD float in
text: mid-air, gravely looking at the image before them.
dialog: Super: San Dimas, California, 2713.
text: They turn to a FOURTH MAN - very severe, almost puritanical
text: looking, dressed in all black (ROLLINS).
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: Their time is running out. We must take
dialog: emergency measures. The future of
text: everything hangs in the balance.
text: On Rollins’ face, a slight flash of concern - and surprise.
text: He steps into a SLEEK, SILVER METALLIC BOOTH.. dons his
text: SUNGLASSES. And, with a nod to the Great Ones..
text: The booth shimmers, drops through the floor.
dialog: Cut to BLACK.
text: Title up: BILL AND TED FACE THE MUSIC
dialog: Then fade up on:
scene_heading: EXT. WEDDING - DAY
text: Bill and Ted, in their mid-40’s, in suits, walk up to a
dialog: microphone.
text: Behind them, a banner reads “CONGRATULATIONS DEACON AND
text: MISSY.” We are at a wedding. Garden-variety, middle class.
text: Joanna and Elizabeth are there (also in their mid 40's).
text: Elizabeth is with WILL (18); Joanna is with THEO (also 18).
text: The guys are buoyant, exuberant-- utterly unflappable.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Good afternoon. And welcome to this
dialog: joyous occasion.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Ted and I have both known Missy in
dialog: different capacities for nearly 40 years.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: She was Bill’s babysitter when we were
dialog: ten, and we both invited her to the prom
dialog: when she was a senior and we were
dialog: freshman.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Next she married my dad, and Missy became
dialog: “Mom.”
speaker_heading: TED
text: After quickly divorcing Bill’s dad, Missy
dialog: married my dad, and became my mom.
text: Ted's dad, POLICE CHIEF CHET LOGAN, now in his mid 60’s and
text: still very fit, raises his glass with a tight smile that only
text: barely masks his bitterness.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: And now she is marrying Ted’s younger
dialog: brother, Officer Deacon Logan.
text: We see DEACON now, 40, buzz cut, with MISSY, now late 40's.
text: He raises his glass.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Deacon - my congratulations. Missy - Bill
dialog: and I - along with Joanna and Elizabeth,
dialog: and Will and Theo - welcome you back with
text: open arms.
text: Elizabeth, Joanna, Will and Theo all raise glasses.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: This joyous event would seem to make
dialog: Deacon his own father-in-law, and make Ted
dialog: his own uncle.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Not to mention making my dad his own son.
text: In back, Logan just shakes his head, irked on so many levels.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: So with that beautiful thought in mind,
dialog: for your first dance, we wish to present a
dialog: sneak peek at the world premiere of our
dialog: newest sonic creation..
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: So please enjoy the first three movements
dialog: of..
speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: “That Which Binds Us Through Time: The
dialog: Chemical, Physical and Biological Nature
dialog: of Love; An Exploration of the Meaning of
dialog: Meaning.”
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Ready, Bill?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Ready, Ted. One..
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Two..
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: One two three four..
text: Ted plays bagpipes. Bill is engaged in a kind of wide-
text: mouthed Aboriginal ‘throat-singing.’ While clearly a great
dialog: deal of
dialog: of this
dialog: and, in
dialog: Wedding
dialog: thought (and even love) has gone into the preparation
dialog: piece, it is at its core quite difficult to define
dialog: fact, impossible to enjoy.
text: guests watch with jaw-dropped befuddlement as -
dialog: 9.
text: Deacon and Missy step to the dance floor - aware that this is
dialog: somehow their “first dance.” But it’s hard for them to
dialog: decipher how, exactly, they’re supposed to move to this.
text: Joanna and Elizabeth exchange a glance. As do Will and Theo.
text: Ted’s dad just openly throws his hands up..
speaker_heading: CHIEF LOGAN
dialog: This is bullshit.
text: .»-and crosses to a power bank and literally pulls the plug on
dialog: the whole thing. CUT TO:
scene_heading: THIRTY SECONDS LATER
text: Ted and his dad, off to the side of the stage.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I’m sorry you don’t get it, Dad.
speaker_heading: CHIEF LOGAN
dialog: No one gets it, Ted. No one ever has.
dialog: There’s nothing to get.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: They will, Dad, seriously.
speaker_heading: CHIEF LOGAN
dialog: I don’t think so. That song is the worst
dialog: one yet. And that’s saying a lot. I told
dialog: Deacon he should never have let you guys
dialog: play. I’m sorry, “play.” And honestly -
dialog: on a very deep level - it is time to pull
dialog: the plug. Both of you.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: We can’t. We have to pursue this until --
speaker_heading: CHIEF LOGAN
dialog: Yeah yeah yeah, I know, until your “music
dialog: saves the world.” Ted. Enough with your
dialog: delusions.
text: While this continues we CUT AWAY TO:
speaker_heading: THE VAN
text: Where Bill wheels equipment to the back door. He pulls it
text: open and sees - his FATHER, BOB PRESTON, slumped in the back,
text: having just been awakened.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Hey dad.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: MR. PRESTON
dialog: How was the wedding?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: It was good. You shoulda come in.
speaker_heading: MR. PRESTON
dialog: Weddings are hard for me, Billy. My
dialog: social worker says I’ve never really
dialog: recovered from your mom leaving all those
dialog: years ago. Your real mom, not Missy.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I know. That was hard.
text: Mr. Preston gives Bill a huge hug.
speaker_heading: MR. PRESTON
dialog: I love you, Billy.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I know, Dad. And I love you, too.
text: (as his dad continues to hug him)
dialog: Okay, Dad. It’s totally fine. Everything's
dialog: good, Dad. Everything’s gonna be okay. I
dialog: really gotta go get some more stuff.
text: He breaks off, turns. And we follow him to --
speaker_heading: TED AND LOGAN
text: Still in the thick of it.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Dad - I’m just saying: if you’d done the
dialog: things me and Bill have done, and seen the
dialog: things we've seen --
speaker_heading: CHIEF LOGAN
dialog: No - you can keep “spinning” this however
dialog: you want, Ted, but I’1l never believe it.
dialog: You didn’t time travel. You didn’t die
dialog: and go to hell and then come back.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Chief Logan - we did -
speaker_heading: CHIEF LOGAN
dialog: No. You didn’t, Bill. And here’s the
dialog: reason you didn’t: it’s impossible.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Dad - I know you’re upset because Deacon
dialog: just married --
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CHIEF LOGAN
dialog: No. Ted - you’re wrong. It has nothing
dialog: to do with that. Trust me, if I’m more
dialog: disappointed in one of my sons, it’s you.
text: Logan spins to storm away. Then turns back.
speaker_heading: CHIEF LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: By the way? That five thousand dollars I
dialog: loaned you? I want it back.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You'll get it back.
speaker_heading: CHIEF LOGAN
dialog: When, Ted? You’re upside down on your
dialog: mortgage. You’re fifty thousand dollars
dialog: in debt. Your wife is working two jobs so
dialog: you two can pursue your pathetic fantasy.
dialog: Get real, Ted. Get real - both of you.
text: And he’s off. Ted just stands there. Bill puts his hand on
text: Ted’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Dude - if it’s any consolation, I’m eighty-
dialog: thousand dollars in debt.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What are we gonna do?
speaker_heading: MAN’S VOICE (PRELAP)
dialog: No. No, no, no.
scene_heading: INT. FABULOUS FORUM - DAY
text: Keys and coat in hand, the stadium manager (FRANK) closes his
text: office door as Bill and Ted follow him out into the arena.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No, you may not have your non-refundable
dialog: deposit back.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: But --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No ‘buts.’ Twenty years ago you signed a
dialog: contract - put down a deposit - to rent
dialog: the Forum tomorrow night for your concert
dialog: celebrating “Two Decades of Greatness--”
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Triumphance.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Whatever. I tell you this every year--
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: But this year is different.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: It’s quite different - as you will see if
dialog: you'd simply listen to us.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Fine. Go ahead.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: This year, given the direness of our
dialog: financial situation, we’re willing to
dialog: reduce our offer from a one hundred
dialog: percent refund to an eighty percent
dialog: refund.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: So wait - I’m sorry - then I’d only have
dialog: to give you eighty thousand dollars that I
dialog: contractually do not owe you rather than a
dialog: hundred thousand?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Correct. But between us, our bottom line
dialog: is sixty thousand, for which we will take
dialog: forty.
speaker_heading: TED
text: But no lower than twenty-five.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Of which we would accept ten.
text: Ted leans to Bill.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Dude - I have a sneaking feeling that
dialog: we're negotiating against ourselves.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Good point, Ted.
dialog: (turns )
dialog: Forget everything we said. We’re back at
dialog: a hundred thousand. Plus interest.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay, then I guess I should make my
dialog: counter offer: nothing. The point is:
dialog: you bought the Forum tomorrow night - it’s
dialog: yours. Do whatever you want with it -
dialog: throw a party at mid-field, I don’t care.
dialog: The lights’ll be on, the gate’1ll be open.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: By the way - just out of curiosity - how
dialog: many tickets have you guys sold?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Well, it’s hard to say - it could have
dialog: changed, cause we haven’t checked the web
dialog: site in a while.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That's fine. Just give me the ballpark
dialog: number.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Okay - ballpark? I’m just estimating
dialog: here, but approximately zero.
text: Frank shakes his head.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I have to tell you guys - what you have
dialog: pulled off here is very impressive, ina
dialog: way. You’ve promoted a concert for twenty
dialog: years, and sold zero tickets.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Thanks, dude.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It’s not a compliment.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
text: Bill and Joanna ride up in silence. They get off and enter..
scene_heading: INT. WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: And Joanna stops as she sees: Elizabeth and Ted, also in the
text: waiting room. Elizabeth is equally surprised. Ted is not.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: How’s it goin’ dude? Hey, Jo!
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: I’m sorry - is this the right day?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yah. Totally. Couples therapy.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: But..
text: Now the other door opens and the THERAPIST sticks his head
text: out - a bit surprised to see TWO couples in his waiting room.
dialog: 14.
scene_heading: INT. THERAPIST’S OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER
text: Bill, with Joanna, and Ted, with Elizabeth, sit across from
text: the Therapist. It’s a little crowded on the couch.
speaker_heading: THERAPIST
dialog: So do you understand why this situation
dialog: might seem at all strange to your wives?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: No, not at all. Why?
speaker_heading: THERAPIST
dialog: Well, when your wives suggested couples
dialog: therapy, did you think this is what they
dialog: had in mind?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yah. Definitely. I mean, we’re a couple
dialog: of couples, right?
speaker_heading: THERAPIST
dialog: Well, it usually means one couple.
speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: Ohhh..
speaker_heading: THERAPIST
dialog: But since you’re here - let me ask you
dialog: this. Is there something you feel your
dialog: wives need to hear from you?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yah. Totally.
dialog: (turning to Elizabeth)
dialog: We love you guys.
speaker_heading: THERAPIST
dialog: Okay, that’s good. But.. Do you
dialog: understand how that might sound strange to
dialog: your wives? Bill?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: No. We love em.
speaker_heading: THERAPIST
dialog: “We” love them?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yah, we do.
speaker_heading: THERAPIST
dialog: “We" do?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yah, we do. Exactly.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: THERAPIST
dialog: It’s the “we” part.. Ted. Can you say
dialog: the same thing using “I” in the sentence?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Ohhh. Yah, of course.
dialog: (turns to Elizabeth)
dialog: Elizabeth. I - and Bill - love you - and
dialog: Joanna.
text: Elizabeth just stares at the floor, shakes her head.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Dude. All due respect - I don’t think
dialog: you're getting this.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Go for it, dude.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (turns )
dialog: Joanna. From the very very bottom of I -
dialog: and Ted’s - hearts. I - and Ted - totally
dialog: love and worship you - and Elizabeth.
text: Bill beams. Ted nods - as if he now sees.
speaker_heading: THERAPIST
dialog: Joanna, would you or Elizabeth like to
dialog: respond?
dialog: Elizabeth indicates “go ahead.”
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Well.. Okay. I know you love me, Bill.
dialog: However - and I can’t speak for Elizabeth,
dialog: but.. you guys are gone over two hundred
dialog: nights a year. Every time you go out on tour
dialog: to make money, you come back deeper in debt.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: But we have to --
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: I know. I know it’s a burden for you. And
dialog: I know you feel as though you have to do
dialog: it yourselves. But you don’t. We
dialog: literally left everything behind, our
dialog: families, our friends..
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: We moved 600 years in the future to be
dialog: with you. To be your partners. But it’s
dialog: like all you think about is the song..
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: The mission..
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: And it’s like we and the boys are not even
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: So.. Wait. What are you saying?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I guess what I’m saying is.. If things
dialog: don’t change.. I don’t know how much
dialog: longer I can go on like this.
text: Ted is stunned. He looks at Bill. Bill turns to Joanna.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Do you feel the same way?
text: Joanna nods.
scene_heading: INT. DODGE NEON - DRIVING
text: Ted and Elizabeth, in tense silence. Ted glances over - she
text: just stares straight ahead. They pull up to the end of --
scene_heading: EXT. CUL DE SAC - EVENING - CONTINUOUS
text: Where TWO HOUSES share a driveway at the end of a quiet
text: middle-class street. As they pull in --
text: A GEO METRO is already there, and Bill and Joanna are getting
text: out - also with palpable tension between them.
dialog: (What is clear to us now is: they all live right next door
text: to each other, and share a driveway - and garage.)
text: As the women head towards the Logan house, Bill and Ted join
dialog: each other.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Dude - things are worse than I thought. I
dialog: think they're actually thinking about
dialog: leaving us.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I know, it’s bad. But we still got our
dialog: work to do..
text: They look at their wives, who are conferring at the front
dialog: door.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Okay - let’s just try and work sorta fast.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yah. Totally.
text: As they start toward the GARAGE-- suddenly we HEAR the sound
text: of GUITARS from within. Ted exhales heavily.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I’ve told Will over and over..
text: They pull the garage door open, revealing:
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - EVENING - CONTINUOUS
text: Will and Theo are playing classic old guitars (the very ones
dialog: that Bill and Ted played at the end of “Bogus Journey."”)
text: They immediately stop, look at their fathers.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: How’s it goin, dad?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Out!
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: This is our studio - and those are our
dialog: guitars.
text: He and Bill pull the guitars from their sons’ hands.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: We have important work to do, and we can’t
dialog: have you messing around in here.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You wanna at least see what we’ve been
dialog: working on?
text: Will holds a piece of paper out. Ted takes it, shoves it in
text: his pocket.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Later. But right now, we need the studio.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Now, please, Will.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Okay, Grampa.
dialog: 18.
text: The boys shake their heads.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: I told you, dude. It’s always the same.
dialog: Let’s just go play up in my room. With
dialog: our crappy guitars.
text: Will nods and the boys head out. Bill and Ted watch them go,
text: guilty, as Ted shuts the garage door and we cut to:
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE/MUSIC STUDIO - NIGHT
text: Bill and Ted are working on a song; struggling. Bill is
text: noodling on the synthesizer - Ted is scratching out lyrics.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Okay, I added a couple things. Go again.
text: Bill starts on the synthesizer: it’s abstruse, complex (not
text: in a good way) - like D-grade Bohemian Rhapsody.
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: “We try - y - y - y to carry--yy.. on.
scene_heading: Ayiii-eee-ee-ee-ee. .a-000-00-00-00.”
text: Ted stops. Bill picks it up.
speaker_heading: BILL
scene_heading: “OQoEEEE-eeee-YIYIYIYI..”
dialog: (to Ted)
dialog: Dude - run with me. I think we’re onto
dialog: something...
dialog: (resuming)
text: “We straaa—aaaa-aaa-aaa-aain..yiyi-yi-yi--
dialog: ”
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Dude - seriously. Stop. I hate to say
dialog: this, but we’re NOT onto anything.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What are you talking about? I think it’s
dialog: our best one yet.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Dude - if that’s true - then things are
dialog: even worse than I thought. Cause this
dialog: song sucks. You do know that, right?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I don’t agree.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Dude.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Bill - come on. It’s me. You don’t have
dialog: to spin me. It sucks. All our songs
dialog: suck. What are we doing? Seriously. Our
dialog: wives are mad at us, our sons are mad at
dialog: us, we're broke-- why are we even doing
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: We're doing it cause we have to! Ted -
dialog: we're supposed to save all humanity.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Says who??
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Those people - from the future --
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What if they were wrong?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: How could they be wrong? We saw the
dialog: future - we were there.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Alls I know is, at this moment, I feel
dialog: like for the last 20 years we've been
text: beating our heads against a wall, and it
dialog: hurts, and I wanna stop.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: But we can’t! We promised!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Who’s gonna care? Seriously. I’m sick of
dialog: it. And you know you are too.
text: Bill just looks at Ted - for a long moment - and then he just
text: deflates, dropping the facade.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Okay. Yah. I’m totally sick of it. But
dialog: I thought if I ever admitted it - to you
dialog: or me - we’d completely crumble.
text: There’s a pause.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I can’t do this any more. I just can’t.
text: Another pause. Finally Bill looks at Ted.. And nods,
text: agreeing. Then, suddenly, there’s --
dialog: 20.
text: A FLASH of LIGHT outside, visible under the garage door..
text: Then: We HEAR a metallic WHOOSH.. Then FOOTSTEPS. Someone..
dialog: Or something.. is outside.
text: Bill and Ted look at each other, walk toward the garage door
text: and slowly open it, revealing--
text: The futuristic BOOTH.
speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: Whoa..
text: And next to the booth, emerging from its shadow, ROLLINS.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: ROLLINS
dialog: Come with me, please.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Are you from the future?
speaker_heading: ROLLINS
dialog: Yes.
text: A beat. The guys look at each other again.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Are you mad at us?
speaker_heading: ROLLINS
dialog: We have very little time.
text: He opens the door for them. Ted leans closer to Bill.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I think we’re in trouble.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Relax, Ted. They totally love us in the
dialog: future.
text: The guys get into the sleek, elegant booth. Rollins closes
text: the door, and in an instant.. It shimmers.. and DISAPPEARS..
scene_heading: INT. CIRCUITS OF TIME
text: Dark. Misty. Glimpses of light. We hear a WHOOOSH and the
text: silver booth soars past in blur.
dialog: 21.
scene_heading: INT. BOOTH - ON BILL AND TED
text: Bill and Ted - stunned, amazed - gape out at the circuits of
dialog: time.. for the first time in a long time. And we cut to:
scene_heading: INT. GREAT DOME - THE YEAR 2712 - DAY
text: The booth appears and touches down on the floor. Rollins
text: gets out, followed by Bill and Ted. Bill and Ted whisper:
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Dude.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I think I liked Rufus better.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Me too.
dialog: (turns to Rollins)
dialog: What is it you do here, dude?
speaker_heading: ROLLINS
dialog: I clean up messes.
text: The guys look at each other as they hear..
speaker_heading: BOOMING VOICE
dialog: Bill and Ted. Step closer please.
text: Now they turn and see:
text: THREE IMPOSING FIGURES-- who look at Bill and Ted with barely
text: restrained urgency and frustration.
text: They are fierce, unblinking. It’s dark and intense. Bill
text: and Ted look at each other, swallow.
text: Around the room is a kind of “Senate” of observers who line
text: the walls. Bill adopts an upbeat manner.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: How’s it goin’? Good to be back again.
dialog: Lookin’ great.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: What do you have to say for yourselves?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Oh..
text: They look at each other, then adopt their arm-raised posture.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Be excellent to each other..?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: And.. party on, dudes..?
text: Dead silence. No smiles. No nods. Nothing but scowls.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: Where's the song?
text: The guys eyes widen..
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Oh.. The song.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Which one? We've written so many.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: The song. The song that will fulfill your
dialog: destiny. The one that is to be played at
dialog: the Fabulous Forum tomorrow night. The
dialog: one that will save the world as we know
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Oh, yah. That song. We definitely have
dialog: that song. Yah.
text: The Leader makes a gesture. Lights come up and suddenly all
text: around them are MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS of all shapes and sizes.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: Then play it.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Like right now?
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: We need to hear it.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Um.. Before we do that --
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Which we very much look forward to doing --
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: And are most eminently prepared to do --
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Being as it’s already written --
text: A pause.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: And is very good on the level of lyrics,
dialog: and melody, and rhythmic aspects as well
dialog: as meter and, you know, thematic content..
dialog: we need to..
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Tweak..
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yah. MTweak..
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Or, even better, perhaps what would
dialog: expedite this entire process..
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Would be if you played the song for us
dialog: right now.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Or perhaps played it several times.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Or even just give us a recording. So we
dialog: may be certain we have the exact rendition
dialog: of our greatest song ever written..
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: You don’t have it.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What?! No. Just the opposite.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: In fact, our problem is we have so many
dialog: great songs that as we put together our
dialog: set list for the concert tomorrow night --
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: The one we in no way bailed on years ago --
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: And which as recently as an hour ago did
dialog: not try to get our money back from -
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Right, that did not happen..
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You're not watching us all the time, are
dialog: you?
dialog: 24.
text: Silence. Then the Leader just waves his arms and THE
text: FLOATING GREAT FIGURES DISAPPEAR INTO DARKNESS -- as do the
dialog: instruments, and instantly--
text: Rollins is standing right in front of the guys.
speaker_heading: ROLLINS
dialog: The window of destiny is closing. You
dialog: have twenty four hours to come up with the
dialog: song.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: But-- What if for some reason we don’t?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Which would be most paradoxical because
dialog: obviously we do already have it.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: But, you know, just theoretically.. cause
dialog: we are intrigued with all manner of
dialog: thought experiment involving, you know,
text: “the conundrum of time”..
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: So-- What would happen?
text: Rollins looks at them.
speaker_heading: ROLLINS
dialog: Come with me.
text: He turns. The guys look at each other, then follow him as
text: two huge doors slide open and they all enter --
scene_heading: A CATHEDRAL-LIKE CHAMBER
dialog: Built solely to house:
scene_heading: A HOLOGRAPHIC TIME-LINE
text: Ethereal, majestic, floating in mid-air. Weaving and winding
dialog: from the deepest past all the way to the present - and,
text: still, moment by moment, continuing to inch forward.
speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: Whoa...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: ROLLINS
dialog: This is time. It’s the path through which
dialog: the past connects with the present.. and
dialog: leads to the future.
dialog: 25.
text: The guys move closer. Now they can see that the “weave” is
text: actually a collection of INFINITESIMALLY SMALL BITS OF
scene_heading: INFORMATION.
text: Rollins reaches out and TOUCHES a section, in the way one
dialog: might touch, say, an iPad. As he does..
speaker_heading: ROLLINS (CONT’D)
dialog: 1945.
text: --an IMAGE FROM 1945 balloons out: Hiroshima. He removes
text: his finger - the image recedes. He touches another spot..
speaker_heading: ROLLINS (CONT’D)
dialog: 1989.
text: .--and out balloons an image of the Man standing in front of
text: the tank in Tiananmen Square.
speaker_heading: ROLLINS (CONT’D)
text: Time is more fluid, and more contingent,
dialog: than you understand. There are key
text: moments in the weave - turning points -
dialog: like stitches, if you want to think of
dialog: them that way. And when one is missing,
dialog: then everything can fray.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Has that ever happened?
speaker_heading: ROLLINS
text: It’s about to happen.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Meaning..?
speaker_heading: ROLLINS
dialog: If you don’t have the song in 24 hours,
dialog: time as we all know it will essentially
text: unravel. Forward, and backward.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Oh...
scene_heading: EXT. CUL DE SAC - HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The booth appears. The guys get out, still in shock.
text: Rollins gives Ted a TIMEPIECE of some sort.. like a really
text: cool, sleek WATCH.
speaker_heading: ROLLINS
dialog: Keep a close eye on this. You have 24
text: hours. When it runs out, it’s over.
dialog: 26.
text: Rollins crosses back to his booth and gets in.. And, with a
text: nod at them, he’s gone.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Okay - bad news: the whole unraveling of
dialog: time thing could be most heinous. Good news:
dialog: This means there is a song. Otherwise they
dialog: wouldn’t be so mad at us for not having it.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: --Yah. I think that’s probably right.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: So now, alls we gotta do is stop writing
dialog: songs that totally suck, and just write
dialog: the greatest song ever written. Okay?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: .-Yah.. I guess.
text: Bill starts into the garage. Ted remains on the curb.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Ted, what are you doing, dude? We gotta
dialog: keep going.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I just don’t get it.. I mean-- We’ve been
dialog: trying for 20 years to write the greatest
dialog: song ever written. How are we gonna do it
dialog: in 24 hours?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I don’t know.. But we gotta.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I mean.. Right? What else are we gonna
dialog: do, dude?
text: Ted nods - distant and distracted.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: But we do know the song’s gonna exist,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Well, yah.. at some point..
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I just wish there was a way that we could
dialog: go into the future and get it from
dialog: ourselves.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: How would we do that?
dialog: 27.
text: There’s a pause. They look at each other, sharing a slowly
text: dawning realization.
speaker_heading: BILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Could we actually...?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Couldn't we..?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: But-- didn’t Rufus say we could only do
dialog: that in an extreme emergency?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Bill-- if the future of all of reality as
dialog: we know it is at stake.. isn’t that an
dialog: extreme emergency?
scene_heading: EXT. BILL’S HOUSE - NIGHT - MOMENT LATER
text: The guys head towards a STORAGE SHED at the very back of the
dialog: property.
text: At the shed, they undo a series of heavy metal padlocks.
text: The door opens.. a single light bulb is switched on..
scene_heading: INT. SHED - CONTINUOUS
text: The guys walk to the darkest, most shadowy corner and start
text: to pull a series of covers, sheets, tarps, etc., off of what
text: gradually reveals itself as..
text: THE PHONE BOOTH.. The old one from the earlier movies.
text: It’s dusty, rusted, obviously hasn’t been used in 20 years.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Okay, so here’s the plan: We go into the
dialog: future to when we've actually written the
dialog: song, find ourselves, and take it.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: One question: Is that stealing?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Why would it be stealing if we’re getting
dialog: it from ourselves?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Oh, yah..
dialog: (eyeing the booth)
dialog: You think it still works?
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Only one way to find out, dude..
scene_heading: INT. PHONE BOOTH - SECONDS LATER
text: They get in. Dust off the key pad.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: How far into the future do you think we
dialog: need to go?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Depends on when we think we’re gonna write
dialog: the song.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I say definitely within the next year or
dialog: two.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Well, let’s be conservative. Say five
dialog: years?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Sounds good.
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: You wanna do the honors, or should I?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Go for it, dude.
text: Ted - with not a little bit of nostalgia and a good deal of
text: trepidation.. starts to hit the buttons.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: San Dimas, California.. Five years from
dialog: now.
text: At first, nothing happens. It’s like starting a car that’s
text: been sitting in the garage for 20 years. Then-- the lights
text: in the booth flicker on... there is a low humming/buzzing
text: sound. As the antenna comes to life, illuminating the dark
text: shed, the guys look at each other.
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: Bill..
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I have a feeling things are just about to
dialog: change in a most outstanding way.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Ted, I totally agree.
text: And with an exuberant, super-optimistic AIR GUITAR..
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Let’s go save the world, dude!
text: ..the booth shimmers and DISAPPEARS and we cut to:
scene_heading: INT. CIRCUITS OF TIME - CONTINUOUS
text: Whhhoooshhhhhh. The booth sails through the circuits of time
dialog: which are sleeker, faster than when last we sailed through.
text: The guys look through the glass - thrilled, moved: neither
dialog: thought he'd ever be doing this again.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Whoa...
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I know..
text: The booth veers off, disappears into a circuit and we cut to:
scene_heading: EXT. HOLIDAY INN - SAN DIMAS
text: On the marquee: “OPEN MIC NIGHT.” We hear a faint version
text: of Huey Lewis’ “The Heart of Rock'n Roll” coming from inside
text: a sad version - kind of pathetic; earnest and overly sincere.
dialog: Super: San Dimas, California - five years into the future
text: The booth APPEARS lands in the parking lot. The guys step
text: out, look around - hear the music from within..
scene_heading: INT. HOLIDAY INN - LOBBY - A MOMENT LATER
text: They enter the lobby.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: So where are the future us’s?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yah - you'd think we’d be waiting for
dialog: ourselves.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: We gotta remember to be more polite and
dialog: come out and greet ourselves next time.
dialog: (notices something)
dialog: Oh no..
dialog: 30.
text: Bill turns - follows Ted’s gaze into --
speaker_heading: THE LOUNGE
text: Where ON STAGE - in front of a dozen bored businessmen - are:
text: 50 YR OLD BILL AND TED
text: In black vests, white shirts, earrings - singing “Heart of
text: Rock'n Roll.” 50 Yr Old Bill is working a little harder to
text: push it across; 50 Yr Old Ted just seems depressed.
dialog: (And the years have not been kind to their voices. Ted’s has
text: gotten lower - and is now a rumbly Kris Kristofferson croak;
text: Bill’s is now a kind of high, nasally Art Garfunkel whine.)
scene_heading: 50 YR OLD BILL/TED
scene_heading: T-T-T-THEY SAY THE HEAR OF ROCK’N ROLL IS
text: STILL BEATIN’, AND FROM WHAT I’VE SEEN I
scene_heading: BELIEVE ‘EM; NOW THE OLD BOY MAY BE BARELY
text: BREATHIN’.. BUT THE HEART OF ROCK’N ROLL.
dialog: (a sort of harmony)
text: THE HEART OF ROCK’N ROLL IS STILL BEATIN’.
dialog: 
text: In the back, Bill and Ted enter, shocked.
speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: No way..
text: They say it just loud enough that on stage, 50 Yr Old Bill
text: hears them - and looks up.. Which makes 50 Yr Old Ted do the
text: same thing. Now, like deer in headlights:
dialog: 50 Yr Old Bill and Ted freeze. If the audience were paying
text: attention, they’d notice the two sets of Bills and Teds all
text: standing motionless, staring at each other, but no one cares.
text: There’s an odd moment where they all stand, staring. Then..
text: 50 Year Old Bill and Ted turn and bolt through the back exit.
text: Bill and Ted look at each other - and sprint across the room.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK OF HOLIDAY INN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: 50 Year Old Bill and Ted scramble in their dress shoes across
text: the parking lot and race toward the (now quite beaten up) van
text: with their guitars. A beat later -
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Wait! Bill!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Ted!
dialog: 31.
text: They race to the van, where 50 Yr Old Bill and Ted are
text: opening the doors.
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey - us’s. Stop.
text: Older Bill and Ted turn - busted. Instantly (and lamely)
text: they try and cover.
speaker_heading: 50 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Ohhh! Hello!
speaker_heading: 50 YR OLD TED
dialog: We totally forgot you guys were coming!
dialog: How great to see you!
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What are you talking about? You totally
dialog: ran away from us!
speaker_heading: 50 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Oh - that’s just because.. in the
dialog: darkness, we thought you were groupies,
dialog: which we have a lot of.
text: Bill and Ted look around the deserted back parking lot.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: 50 YR OLD TED
dialog: Oh, yah - absolutely.
text: 50 Year Old Ted nervously pulls a flask from his hip pocket
text: and takes a swig.
speaker_heading: 50 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Look - dudes - we know exactly what you’re
dialog: thinking: why are we playing here at open
dialog: mic night at the Holiday Inn in San Dimas,
dialog: when in fact, we are such huge rock stars
dialog: with lots of groupies?
speaker_heading: 50 YR OLD TED
dialog: And here's the answer: Us being here is
text: humorously ironic.
speaker_heading: 50 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Do you believe us?
speaker_heading: 50 YR OLD TED
dialog: I remember not necessarily believing it when
dialog: I you was standing there listening to I me.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: 50 YR OLD BILL
dialog: But this time you really can believe us.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Do you believe us?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Not at all.
text: 50 Year Old Ted takes another (this time bigger) gulp from
text: his flask. As he wipes his mouth with his sleeve:
speaker_heading: 50 YR OLD TED
dialog: (vaguely belligerent)
dialog: Well I feel sorry for you then.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Do you have the song?
speaker_heading: 50 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Do we have the song? Do we have the song?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yes. Do you?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Ted. Stop drinking for a minute and look
dialog: me in the eye. Do you have the song?
text: 50 Yr Old Ted almost looks Ted in the eye: at his eyebrows..
text: between his eyes.. But not in the eye.
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: No. In the eye. Look me in the eye, Ted,
dialog: and tell me you have the song. Otherwise
dialog: we're gonna leave right now. Do you have
dialog: the song or do you not?
dialog: (beat; shakes his head sadly)
dialog: You totally don’t have the song, do you?
speaker_heading: 50 YR OLD TED
dialog: (finishing his entire flask)
dialog: You know what? Screw you, me.
scene_heading: BILL/50 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Whoa, whoa!/Easy, Ted -
speaker_heading: 50 YR OLD TED
dialog: No - not easy.
dialog: (to Bill and Ted)
dialog: YOU didn’t write the song. YOU’RE the
dialog: ones who're responsible for all of this.
dialog: And you know something else, pretty boy?
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Don’t call me that.
speaker_heading: 50 YR OLD TED
dialog: “Don’t call me that.” “Dude.” You drove
text: the princesses away.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Whoa. Wait. What did you say? The
dialog: princesses are gone?
speaker_heading: 50 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Oh, don’t act so surprised. They basically
dialog: told you they were gonna leave. Well, guess
dialog: what? As soon as you got back from this
dialog: stupid, failed mission - they were gone.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: How??
speaker_heading: 50 YR OLD TED
dialog: No idea. Alls we know is they left a note
dialog: saying they took Will and Theo back to
dialog: 1428 and they never came back - and now
dialog: we've been alone for five years cause you
dialog: drove our wives away.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Our wives have been gone for five years
dialog: and you haven’t even tried to talk to
dialog: them?
speaker_heading: 50 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Oh - you did, alright - you just made it
dialog: worse! They had their doubts about you,
dialog: which you were totally missing, I might
dialog: add.. and then you went back to Medieval
dialog: England and confirmed every one of em!
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: There is no way we did that.
speaker_heading: 50 YR OLD TED
dialog: Yah well you’re gonna eat your words in
text: about 45 seconds.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Not true. Ted - let’s go talk to our
dialog: wives right now and set this straight.
speaker_heading: 50 YR OLD TED
dialog: Fine. I’m done with you two losers.
dialog: 34.
text: Ted lunges for himself. Grabs himself --
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Why don’t you take some responsibility,
dialog: you drunk!
speaker_heading: 50 YR OLD TED
dialog: Why don’t you go knit a blob?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: 50 YR OLD TED
dialog: Blob-knitter!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You’re rude! Get your act together, Ted!
speaker_heading: 50 YR OLD TED
dialog: You get your act together, Ted!
text: The two Bills grab the two Teds - who are inches from
text: throttling each other - and pull them apart.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Ted - back away - he’s not worth it.
scene_heading: 50 YEAR OLD BILL
dialog: He’s right. Don’t let that punk get to
dialog: you.
text: 50 Year Old Ted backs down. Bill turns Ted around.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Let’s go clean up the mess those us’s
dialog: made.
text: As Older Bill and Ted open the van doors, Bill and Ted see
text: BILL'S FATHER, in back, in a sleeping bag.
speaker_heading: MR. PRESTON
dialog: Hi boys. How was the gig?
text: Bill stops - eyes wide. Turns to his older self.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You live with Dad in the van?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (takes Bill’s shoulder)
dialog: Walk away, dude. Walk away.
text: As Bill and Ted make their way across the lot:
scene_heading: 50 YEAR OLD TED
dialog: If you don’t like it - go fix it!
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: 50 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Yah! Go write the song yourself instead
dialog: of trying to steal it from us!
speaker_heading: 50 YR OLD TED
dialog: Or do something-- cuz our lives suck and
dialog: it’s your fault.
scene_heading: EXT. HOLIDAY INN PARKING LOT - A MOMENT LATER
text: The guys approach - and get into - the booth.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Those older us’s were jerks.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I know. I can’t believe how much I hated
dialog: my me.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I know. But we did learn something quite
dialog: important from them. We gotta go back to
dialog: England.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yah. What’s the point of any of this is we
dialog: don’t got our families?
text: The phone booth starts to shimmer - the guys turn, prepare
text: for it to drop. And just as it starts to -
text: Bill and Ted’s eyes widen as they think they see - about 50
text: feet away across the parking lot:
text: ROLLINS in his silver booth, eyeing them as if studying them.
text: But before Bill and Ted have a chance to react (or even be
text: sure what they’ve seen), their booth drops.. and we cut to:
scene_heading: EXT. MEDIEVAL CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY
text: Joanna and Elizabeth - in 1428 attire - are at a table in the
text: courtyard, chatting with family and friends. Will and Theo -
text: in modern attire - are also there, chatting amiably with
dialog: their grandparents: the Duke and Duchess of North Umberland.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: --graduated in June, now we’re just
text: working on the music.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: And what kind of music is that?
dialog: There’s a
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: THEO
text: It’s a blend of classic old guitar with
dialog: techno.. Kinda neo-bluesy.. but actually,
dialog: without any place to plug in, it’s gonna
dialog: be a little hard to keep playing.
speaker_heading: DUCHESS
dialog: “Plug in” to what?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: That’s a little complicated, Grandma..
text: flash in the distance and--
scene_heading: EXT. MEDIEVAL ENGLAND —- DAY
text: The booth lands in a field and the guys get out, look over
dialog: toward the castle and see..
text: Joanna and Elizabeth - on horseback - riding toward them.
dialog: The wives
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Whatever we do, let’s not give those other
dialog: us’s the satisfaction of making things
dialog: worse.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Don’t worry. We definitely won’t.
text: arrive and dismount.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: What are you two doing here? We need some
dialog: time away.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Right. And we totally respect that. But
dialog: first: how did you get here?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: That nice man from the future showed up
dialog: and asked if we needed anything. And we
dialog: told him we would very much like to come
text: home for a while.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: So he brought us here.
text: Bill and Ted exchange a glance: “Why would he do that?” Ted
text: turns to Elizabeth.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Okay. We know you’re thinking very
dialog: seriously of leaving us.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: .-What? No, we’re not.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yes you are - you just don’t realize it
dialog: yet, you think you’re just here for a
dialog: visit, but you’re totally gonna stay.
text: Off the women’s confused looks:
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Full disclosure: we just saw ourselves
dialog: five years in the future - and you have
dialog: every reason to leave us because the truth
dialog: is: we’re going to become everything you
dialog: don’t want us to be.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: We're just sad pathetic losers living in
dialog: the van with my dad--
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Drinking too much --
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: And lying. You can’t believe what oily
dialog: liars we are.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: And - get this: we tried to tell
dialog: ourselves not to come here. Like we were
text: somehow going to make it worse.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Which is ridiculous - cause knowing what
dialog: we know we’re only making it better,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Wait - what are you talking about? In
dialog: five years you’re living in a van - with
dialog: your dad - drinking too much?
text: The guys realize they might actually be making things worse.
text: The women are starting to eye them differently: worried, now,
dialog: in a way they weren't before.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Exactly! Which is why we’re trying to
dialog: change that by finding the song.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Because if we don’t find it, it’s gonna be
dialog: a lot worse than even that.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yah, like all of reality will completely
text: unravel.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: But don’t worry about that, cuz apparently
dialog: the future is fluid.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Exactly. You can change it if you do the
dialog: right things at the right times.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Like coming here and talking to you now.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I’m not entirely sure it was the right
dialog: thing to do.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Yes, maybe those future you’s were a
dialog: little bit right.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Why were you drinking so much, Ted?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I haven’t started yet - I can’t answer
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Maybe we do need a little more time than
dialog: we thought.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What? No! Elizabeth, I‘1l go to AA!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: But you don’t even drink.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yet! But I’m about to!
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: I think we’d like you to leave now.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: And you don’t want to come with us?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Are you paying any attention?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Fine. We’re gonna go. But you need to
dialog: understand: We’re gonna keep going till
dialog: we succeed on our mission.
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yah, we’re gonna find the song. We’re
dialog: gonna save the world.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: And we’re gonna be together.
scene_heading: INT. BOOTH - A SECOND LATER
text: Bill’s at the keypad as a determined Ted closes the door.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Five years forward was clearly not enough.
dialog: Let’s go ten this time. We certainly will
dialog: have written the song by then.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Dude, I strongly believe we’re about to
dialog: see our lives get a whole lot better.
scene_heading: INT. BOOTH - CIRCUITS OF TIME
text: The booth roars past.
scene_heading: EXT. FOOTHILLS - NIGHT
text: With a flash, the booth arrives in a very nice, hilly section
text: of town. City lights lay out. The “Bel Air” of San Dimas..
dialog: Super: San Dimas, California - 10 years in the future
text: Bill and Ted step out of the booth and immediately see:
scene_heading: AN OLD FASHIONED BRITISH BUTLER
text: Standing calmly, towel over arm.
speaker_heading: BUTLER
dialog: Masters Logan and Preston.. Welcome home,
dialog: gentlemen.
text: The Butler opens a gate and leads the amazed guys into..
scene_heading: THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HOME IMAGINABLE
text: Six car garage, gardens, fountains, huge view. In the
text: driveway: a Bentley, a Range Rover, a Porsche, a 65 Mustang.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Dude.. We did it! Look at where we live.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yah - and look at what we’re driving. One
dialog: song did all this?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Ted - what if it wasn’t just one song?
dialog: What if after we wrote it, the dam broke
dialog: and they just kept coming and coming?
text: Subtle air guitar as the Butler ceremoniously opens the door.
speaker_heading: BUTLER
text: The masters of the house are on the way
dialog: down. Might I offer you a spot of
dialog: champagne?
text: He extends a tray with four flutes of champagne. The guys
text: take two, then hear casual laughter and see..
scene_heading: COMING DOWN THE GRAND OPULENT STAIRCASE
text: 55 YR OLD BILL AND TED, wearing expensive clothes and
text: jewelry. Whereas 55 Yr Old Bill’s clothes are loose,
text: flowing; 55 Yr Old Ted’s are tighter, more form-fitting.
text: Bill’s hair is long and flowing; Ted's is “casually unkempt.”
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
dialog: Why hello younger us’s.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Quel plaiser a vous voir.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Dude - I speak French?
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Oui, monsieur.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Excellent!
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL
dialog: I think you mean.. Excellente.
text: 55 Yr Old Bill and Ted raise their champagne flutes.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
dialog: To your futures.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: So, then.. I guess you have the song?
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
dialog: Why would we be living like this if we
dialog: didn't?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: And the princesses..?
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Brace yourselves.. Are you ready?
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
dialog: They're back.
text: (as Bill and Ted audibly exhale)
dialog: They've been back for a while. And things
dialog: are better than ever.
text: Huge loads are lifted from Bill and Ted’s shoulders.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Oh, that’s such a relief.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
text: (a hand on Ted’s shoulder)
dialog: I know you feel that way, Ted. And it’s
dialog: all gonna be good.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL
dialog: And - do you know why that happened?
dialog: Because a certain chanson changed the
dialog: lives of two gentlemen named Bill and
dialog: Ted..
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
dialog: But enough prologue. We know the time is
dialog: slipping by on that crazy clock of yours.
dialog: This way.
text: 55 Year Old Bill and Ted lead the guys past a SUNKEN LIVING
dialog: ROOM, where they hear:
scene_heading: MR. PRESTON’S VOICE
dialog: Salutations, boys!
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Dad!?
text: BILL'S FATHER sits on the sofa, dressed in a pashmina caftan.
text: He raises his own champagne flute - and a small silver tray.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: MR. PRESTON
dialog: Caviar?
scene_heading: 55 YEAR OLD BILL
dialog: In a moment dad - we’re gonna play em the
dialog: song first.
speaker_heading: MR. PRESTON
dialog: You're in for a treat, boys! Enjoy!
text: MOVING DOWN A LONG HALLWAY
text: Bill and Ted follow 55 Yr Old Bill and Ted down a hallway
text: lined with POSTERS, GOLD RECORDS, MAGAZINE COVERS -- all with
text: Bill and Ted on the cover. We see: “BILLBOARD NUMBER ONE
text: SONG 131 WEEKS IN A ROW!”
speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: Whoa..
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
dialog: (to 55 Yr Old Bill)
dialog: Remember that?
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Like it was yesterday. And I remember me
dialog: saying --
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL (CONT’D) BILL
dialog: Whoa! Ted! Check out the Whoa! Ted! Check out the
dialog: cover of Rolling Stone, dude! cover of Rolling Stone, dude!
text: Bill points to a cover that says “Q: CAN A SONG CHANGE THE
text: WORLD? A: TOTALLY!”
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
dialog: And I remember the feeling I had when we
dialog: us’s showed you us’s into our somewhat
dialog: nice recording studio.
text: They open a double-door and Bill and Ted follow them into --
scene_heading: A SPECTACULAR MUSIC STUDIO
text: Beyond state of the art. Instruments everywhere. Clearly a
dialog: lot of great music has been - and is being - made here.
speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: No way..
scene_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL/55 YR OLD TED
dialog: Yes way, Bill and Ted.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: So it worked! Our plan worked!
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Of course it worked. You guys totally took
dialog: the song - the one we’re about to play for
dialog: you - played it at the Forum - the girls
dialog: were there - and it changed everything.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Wait - we’re gonna play that concert?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: We haven’t even sold one ticket.
scene_heading: 55 YEAR OLD TED
dialog: Remember: reality is fluid.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: But what about the guys we just saw?
dialog: Those loser us’s from 5 years ago?
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Dudes - you’ve been told this before:
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
dialog: That reality will only happen if you don’t
dialog: take this song back with you. Those guys
dialog: don't need to exist. Trust me, Ted - it’s
dialog: amazing how fast life can change when you
dialog: do the right things.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL
dialog: But you guys gotta make it happen.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: We will, we will.
text: 55 Yr Old Bill and Ted point to two very plush seats - where
text: the guys sit.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I must say, Ted, as much as I disliked
dialog: those previous us’s, I like these us’s.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
dialog: Okay! Enough talking. Are you ready to
dialog: face the music?
text: Bill and Ted nod as 55 Yr Old Bill and Ted put the most
text: spectacular pair of over-the-ear EARPHONES on them..
text: And, with a nod and a wink at the guys, and at each other...
text: they move to the soundboard and hit PLAY.
dialog: 44,
text: CLOSE ON BILL AND TED
text: The moment they’ve been waiting for for twenty years is here.
text: And - though we only hear the barest, most muffled SENSE of
text: music from beneath the headphones - from the very first
dialog: moment we can tell that it’s not disappointing.
text: A tear is forming in Bill’s eye. Ted looks stunned - deeply
dialog: impressed, but it’s more complex than that.
text: And while this is happening, we CUT AWAY TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MANSION - NIGHT - SAME
text: The security gate starts to slowly open as a HUGE WHITE LIMO
text: pulls up in the street outside the mansion. Meanwhile --
scene_heading: INT. MANSION - SAME
dialog: For reasons that are unclear to us, the BUTLER sees the
text: headlights and suddenly snuffs his cigarette out on the
text: floor, spins and bolts through the kitchen, and out a door.
scene_heading: INT. MUSIC STUDIO - SAME
text: Close on the guys as the song ends. Bill’s in tears. Ted’s
text: in disbelief. They slowly pull the headphones off.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: That is truly the most amazing song I’ve
dialog: ever heard.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yah.. It’s great. Honestly? I
dialog: wouldn’t’ve thought we had it in us.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
dialog: Well you do, and now it’s time to get it
dialog: out to the world.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I don’t even know how to thank you.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL
dialog: (re Ted’s watch)
dialog: You guys should probably get going.
text: Bill nods, shakes his older self’s hand.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I‘’1l never forget you, Bill.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Right back atcha, Billy boy.
text: The handshake turns into an affectionate bearhug. Ted looks
text: at his older self.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Well... so long, I guess.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
dialog: Yah, so long.
text: They nod to each other - somehow slightly wary of each other.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - MOMENT LATER
text: As the guys head out, Bill looks over at Ted, confused.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Dude. Why were you acting so weird with
dialog: yourself?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I just got a weird feeling.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You always have a weird feeling when
dialog: you're with other you's.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I know, I gotta stop being so suspicious
dialog: of myself.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yah, you do, cuz it’s all gonna be fine.
text: They reach the front door and throw it open, extremely
dialog: surprised to see --
speaker_heading: EDDIE VAN HALEN
text: Standing there, a suitcase at his side, a guitar case slung
text: over his shoulder - his house keys out, about to open the
text: front door.
speaker_heading: EDDIE VAN HALEN
dialog: Wyld Stallyns?? What the hell are you
dialog: doing in my house?
speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: Eddie Van Halen?!
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: This is our house, dude.
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: EDDIE VAN HALEN
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: This is our house - or at least the house
dialog: of future us’s.
speaker_heading: EDDIE VAN HALEN
dialog: You two need to leave right now or I’m
text: calling the cops.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: No, you need to leave right now, Eddie Van
dialog: Halen - or we’ll call the cops.
text: Suddenly - Ted slams the door and slides the deadbolt. He
text: turns and starts purposefully down the hallway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Oh no, oh no oh no oh no..
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO - SAME
text: 55 Yr Old Bill and Ted are undressing - as actors would after
text: a performance. It’s now obvious why their clothes didn’t fit
text: well: because they’re both wearing Eddie Van Halen’s clothes,
text: and he’s bigger than Bill and smaller than Ted.
text: Bill removes his WIG - revealing that he is almost totally
text: bald (except a thin strip of Friar Tuck hair at the back).
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL
dialog: I think we totally fooled those other
dialog: us's.
text: Ted pulls his shirt off, revealing he is wearing a MALE
text: GIRDLE. He loosens it - he’s easily 80 pounds overweight.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
dialog: I hope so. I didn’t like the way I was
dialog: looking at myself..
text: Ted downs a long, long swig of Eddie Van Halen’s VODKA.
scene_heading: IN THE HALLWAY - SAME
text: Ted has stopped, is staring at one of the magazine covers.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I don’t believe it..
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 47.
text: Ted nods to the cover which, when you look at it more
text: carefully, is very obviously “photo-shopped.”
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO - SAME
text: 55 Yr Old Bill and Ted raise their glasses in a toast.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
dialog: Now.. We wait for those other us’s to go
dialog: back and change everything.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL
dialog: To our lives gettin’ a whole lot better.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Ted - seriously - slow down on the vodka,
dialog: dude.
text: Now the door flies open and Bill and Ted, enraged, storm in.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You guys totally lied to us!
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL
dialog: What are you doing here, why haven’t you
dialog: taken the song back to the Fabulous Forum?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Maybe cuz it’s not our song!?
scene_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL/50 YEAR OLD TED
dialog: Ch (feigning shock)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: It’s Eddie Van Halen’s song, he wrote it.
dialog: And this is his house.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
dialog: On what basis would you say something so
dialog: utterly ridiculous?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Cuz we just ran into him. He’s outside,
text: calling the cops.
text: Older Bill turns to Older Ted, frustrated and annoyed.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Ted, I told you Eddie Van Halen came back
dialog: this week.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
dialog: I totally thought he came back next week.
text: The two younger guys look at their older selves, shocked.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You're totally bald, Bill.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: And you're a fat drunk, Ted.
scene_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL/55 YR OLD TED
dialog: Heyyyyyy--
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What on earth were you guys even
dialog: thinking??
text: Older Bill and Ted get up, cross to their younger selves.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL
dialog: What were we thinking? That we had the
dialog: perfect plan, and we still do.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Just cuz you two couldn’t come up with a
dialog: great song and Eddie Van Halen did doesn’t
dialog: mean we should be punished for that.
speaker_heading: TED
text: What? That doesn’t even make sense.
text: There is the sound of sirens outside.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL
dialog: You gotta go right now.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: No way, it’s not our song.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
dialog: Take it now and it will be yours. When
text: Eddie Van Halen comes up with it in 10
dialog: years, he'll be stealing it from you.
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE
dialog: I think it’s a great idea, Ted. We should
dialog: leave right now and do exactly what the wise
dialog: older us’s say - regardless of what I might
dialog: say immediately following this sentence.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Dude! No! He’s ventriloquizing me!
text: 55 Yr Old Bill shrugs - “innocent.”
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: We're not gonna do it, forget it.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Fine. I guess saving the world is just
dialog: irrelevant to you now.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You're not interested in saving the world -
dialog: all you care about is saving your own
dialog: pathetic lives.
scene_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL/TED
dialog: Wrong.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Your blatant cynicism is both transparent
text: and appalling, Ted.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
dialog: Fine. Maybe you'll care about this:
dialog: taking the song is your only chance to get
text: the princesses back.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (as if punched in the gut)
dialog: You were lying about that.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
dialog: Of course we were lying. They don’t want
dialog: to have anything to do with you. Cause
dialog: they think you’re losers. Which you are.
dialog: Cause you make bad choices. Like this.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I’m so disappointed in you, me.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
dialog: I don’t care what you think of me, Ted.
dialog: Our life is hell and if you don’t go back
dialog: and change it --
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Oh - it’s all about you --
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Ted and Ted - take it easy - this plan
dialog: will work - everyone’s life will be better
dialog: if you guys just would --
text: There’s loud pounding on the front door.
speaker_heading: OS VOICE
dialog: It's the police, open up!
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL
dialog: So what do you say - are you gonna do it
dialog: or not?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: No way, dude. You had ten years to write
dialog: the song --
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: And we're not gonna build a fake future on
dialog: one that’s not even ours.
text: 55 Yr Old Bill and Ted look at each other.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Fine.
text: He and 55 Yr Old Ted pull out GUNS.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
dialog: Then we’ll do it. We’ll take the song,
dialog: and the booth, and we’ll go back.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL
dialog: This is our third strike, and we’re not
dialog: going back to jail, I can tell you that.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Dudes - seriously - you don’t have to pull
dialog: guns on us.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Oh yah we do. Cause watch what happens if
dialog: we don’t.
text: They lower their guns. Instantly Bill and Ted try to run
text: away - scrambling desperately for the door - then stopping
text: when they hear the loud clicks of the guns.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL (CONT’D)
dialog: See?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I have to admit, you were right.
text: Quickly Ted grabs a guitar and swings it into older Ted -
text: shoving him back into older Bill.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You dicks.
scene_heading: INT. MANSION - CONTINUOUS
text: Our guys race out the studio door and, unsure which way to
text: turn, scramble down the hall and through --
dialog: 51.
scene_heading: THE LIVING ROOM
text: Where they race past Bill’s Father - who is now sitting on
text: his caftan on the floor (wearing his shabby, filthy clothes).
speaker_heading: MR. PRESTON
dialog: (teary)
dialog: Bill - where are you going?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I can’t believe you participated in this
text: charade.
speaker_heading: MR. PRESTON
dialog: I’m sorry, Bill. I miss your mother and I
dialog: just wanted it all to be good again.
text: Bill looks at his wan, pathetic father.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Hang in there, Dad - things will get
dialog: better at some point.
dialog: (trying to convince himself)
dialog: I mean.. They have to.
text: And he and Ted rush down--
scene_heading: ANOTHER HALLWAY
text: But then come to a skidding halt when -- at the staircase at
text: the end -- they see OLDER BILL AND TED, blocking their way.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
dialog: You guys can’t get away from us, you know.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Yah, cuz we totally remember everything
dialog: you’re gonna do.
text: Bill and Ted hesitate, then suddenly dive out a window.
scene_heading: EXT. EDDIE VAN HALEN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Bill and Ted roll, leap up, then stop when they see: on the
text: roof, the 55 Yr Old thems are aiming guns at them.
scene_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL/55 YR OLD TED
dialog: Told ya!
dialog: 52.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT OF THE HOUSE - SAME
text: Police cars in the driveway, lights flashing. A cop is
text: interviewing Eddie Van Halen. A third car squeals into the
text: driveway and Deacon - ten years older now - jumps out.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Tell me this isn’t my brother and Bill.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Sorry, Deac.
text: Deacon sighs, grabs a bullhorn and yells:
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Ted!! Come out right now, or I’1l have to
dialog: call Dad!!
scene_heading: EXT. BACK OF EDDIE VAN HALEN’S HOUSE - SAME
text: The guys hear Deacon’s voice on the megaphone.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (yells)
dialog: Deacon! It’s not me!
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
dialog: Yes, Deacon! It totally IS me!
speaker_heading: FRONT OF HOUSE
text: Deacon and the other cops - along with Eddie Van Halen -
text: listen to the voices from the back yard:
speaker_heading: TED (0.S.)
dialog: This me talking is from ten years ago, and
dialog: I don’t have anything to do with this!
speaker_heading: BILL (0.S.)
dialog: It’s totally true, dude! It’s the future
dialog: us’s that you want!
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL (0.S.)
dialog: Shut up, Bill!
speaker_heading: BILL (0.S.)
dialog: You shut up, Bill!
text: Deacon grabs his radio.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Dad, you gotta get down here.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: BACK OF HOUSE
text: Bill looks to Ted.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: We gotta make a break for it.

dialog: Yah, but how? They’re us - they remember
dialog: everything we’re gonna do.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: That means we gotta do something we can’t
dialog: possibly remember.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: How do we do that?
text: Ted thinks a moment, then..
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: Dude - check it out.
text: Ted pulls his shirt up so his head is hidden. His arms
text: flail.
speaker_heading: TED (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I totally can’t see where I am!
text: Bill nods - does the exact same thing. And now..
text: UP ON THE ROOF
text: 55 Yr Old Bill and Ted look at each other, alarmed.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL
text: Oh no.. The head in shirt move.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
dialog: I was hoping those younger us’s wouldn't
dialog: think of it this time.
speaker_heading: DOWN BELOW
text: We HEAR Bill and Ted's voices as we see what basically looks
text: like two headless bodies running in circles.
speaker_heading: BILL (0.S.)
dialog: Dude! What do we do?
speaker_heading: TED (0.S.)
dialog: No idea! That’s the point!
dialog: 54.
text: They spin, sprinting in odd, random, chaotic, arbitrary
text: directions - like pinballs - as they rush out the gate and
text: start spinning down the alley..
text: Falling at times, bumping into each other, into walls..
text: Tripping, getting up.. For a moment Bill’s shirt drops.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Oh no! I can see!
dialog: (then; pulling his shirt up)
dialog: Spin me dude! I can’t know where I am!
text: Ted spins him and pushes him over and now the two of them
text: start ROLLING DOWN THE HILL - gaining speed..
speaker_heading: FRONT OF HOUSE
text: Into the swarm of police cars out front, CHIEF LOGAN
text: screeches to a halt, jumps out, enraged.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: TED!
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Dad, I think Ted needs help. He was
text: talking to himself like he’s two people--
speaker_heading: LOGAN
text: This ends now. The lies, the delusions.
dialog: I’m done with him. I’m done with both of
dialog: them.
dialog: (turns; gives the signal)
dialog: Take them! Now!
text: And the cops burst the door down and race into the house.
text: AT THE BACK OF PROPERTY - SAME
text: 55 Yr Old Bill and Ted yell from the top of the hillside:
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL
dialog: You guys are idiots! This woulda worked!
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
dialog: You haven’t heard the last of us! We’re
dialog: gonna get you, Bill and Ted!
text: Suddenly cops come out, guns drawn.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Drop your weapons and get on the ground!
dialog: Now!
text: 55 Yr Old Bill and Ted turn to each other.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD TED
dialog: Dude, there is no way I’m going back to
dialog: jail.
speaker_heading: 55 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Blaze of glory, Ted.
text: And - like Butch and Sundance - they just start rushing down
text: the hill, turning back and firing madly as --
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Get them! NOW!
text: Police fan out, start moving, keeping cover.. Deacon and
text: Logan turn and race back into Deacon’s police car, as --
scene_heading: EXT. BOTTOM OF THE HILL - NIGHT
text: Bill and Ted tumble to a stop against a wall and Bill and Ted
text: dizzily pull their shirts down.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Dude - that totally worked!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yah - maybe we should always not know what
dialog: we're doing.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: We gotta try and get back to the booth..
text: Wobbly, they start up the hill, hearing GUNSHOTS, as--
dialog: JUST UP THE HILL
text: 55 Yr Old Bill and Ted scramble from the cops, firing, as a
text: police chopper sweeps the area with a searchlight and --
scene_heading: INT. DEACON’S POLICE CAR - DRIVING - SAME
text: Deacon screeches around a turn, heading downhill.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Down there! Hurry! Go!
text: Suddenly, in the wash of headlights, they SEE --
text: Bill and Ted, moving swiftly past them, uphill.
text: Deacon slams on the brakes.
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Turn it around!
dialog: 56.
text: But it’s a narrow alley - it takes some maneuvering, as..
speaker_heading: BILL AND TED
text: Race up through some bushes and weave toward --
scene_heading: THE PHONE BOOTH
text: Into which they leap and start frantically dialing.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Dude - where are we going?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: We just gotta keep going further into the
dialog: future! At some point, we’ll find the
dialog: song.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Ten more years?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yes! Go!
dialog: (seeing something)
dialog: DUDE - what’s that?
dialog: 
text: For a BRIEF INSTANT they think they see ROLLINS again -
text: leaning against his silver phone booth across the street.
text: But suddenly they’re AWASH IN BRIGHT LIGHT - from the
text: HELICOPTER above them - as well as from --
scene_heading: DEACON’S POLICE CAR
text: Which roars up - spotlight fixed on them.
speaker_heading: LOGAN’S VOICE (ON SPEAKER)
dialog: TED! Step out of that phone booth, Ted!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Sorry dad! I’m not the me you want
dialog: anyway!
speaker_heading: LOGAN’S VOICE
dialog: I don’t want to hear it Ted! Come out
dialog: right now!!
text: Bill finishes dialing and the booth starts to shimmer..
scene_heading: FROM WITHIN DEACON’S POLICE CAR
text: Logan squints into the bright light:
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: What the hell?
text: He grabs the spotlight from the side of the car - and turns
dialog: it on. Now --
text: Its beam shoots forward - and connects with the shimmer of
text: the phone booth. And in so doing, the sparks from the
text: booth’s antenna travel along the beam of the light, until..
text: .-the police car itself begins to shimmer...
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Deacon - what the hell is going on??
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: I have no idea!
text: Then, suddenly -- as the antenna on top of the police car now
text: sparks like the antenna on top of the booth..
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: The other cop cars all screech to a halt as --
text: Deacon’s car VANISHES RIGHT BEFORE THEIR EYES.
text: COPS, confused, scratch their heads and we cut to..
scene_heading: THE CIRCUITS OF TIME - SAME
text: The phone booth careens past.. followed a second later by -
scene_heading: DEACON’S POLICE CAR
text: Where Logan is apoplectic. He yells into the microphone.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
text: PULL OVER TED! PULL OVER NOW!
scene_heading: INT. PHONE BOOTH - SAME
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Dad! You gotta go back! Put it in
dialog: reverse! Deacon - go back!
text: But the police car is catching up. The guys’ eyes widen as
text: the police car is ABOUT TO collide with them when --
scene_heading: SOME KIND OF BRIGHT SILVER CROSS TRAFFIC
dialog: 58.
text: Flares past in a blur - missing the booth but nearly
dialog: colliding with --
speaker_heading: THE POLICE CAR
text: Where Deacon cranks the wheel hard -- screaming -- as --
scene_heading: INT. CIRCUITS OF TIME - CONTINUOUS
text: The police car spins rapidly and..
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Godddddamnit Teeeeddddddddddd!!!!
text: ..it whirls into a 360 and shoots off to the side and--
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - SOMEWHERE - DAY
text: HOLD A BEAT on the vast, arid desert until..
speaker_heading: DEACON/LOGAN (0.S.)
dialog: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
text: ..the POLICE CAR APPEARS and.. WHAM. It hits the ground with
text: a thud. Beat.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: Logan and Deacon - speechless and dazed - groggily look up.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Where the hell are we?
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE - THEIR POV
text: THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD they see, a half mile in the distance,
text: the GREAT PYRAMID - about 2/3rds complete.
dialog: Super: Egypt - 3000 BC
text: Deacon and Logan just sit there, in the police car, taking it
dialog: in. For a while. Until we cut to:
scene_heading: EXT. - DENSE FOG - NIGHT
text: The booth lands - somewhere - some flat, grey space. The
text: guys look at each other, open the door.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Where are we, dude?
dialog: 59.
text: They look around in the fog, hearing something guttural and
text: awful in the distance: low, grinding guitar - pounding, trash
text: can-like percussion. Death metal - at its darkest.
text: They start toward the music. As they do, they become aware
text: of FACES - HARDENED, HOLLOW-EYED MEN - in shadowy corners
text: staring at them, as if waiting for something, anticipating..
text: As they walk, MORE FACES become visible - denser now -
text: shoulder to shoulder... Then two rows deep... four.. and..
text: They start to hear snippets of a song.
speaker_heading: SONG
scene_heading: PAIN..... DEATH..... HOPELESS,
text: HELPLESS....... DYING BREATH.....
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I got a bad feeling about this.
text: Behind the rows of men all watching them as they pass, they
text: see barbed wire.. And guard towers.. and guards, with guns.
text: They’re in a PRISON. With everyone focussed on one thing:
text: Bill and Ted, walking through the foggy, dimly lit yard,
dialog: toward..
speaker_heading: TWO FIGURES
text: who become more and more distinct as Bill and Ted approach.
dialog: Super: San Quentin, 20 years in the future
scene_heading: CLOSER - THE FIGURES
dialog: Bill and Ted, in their mid-60's. Hardened beyond what we
dialog: would ever have imagined: shaved heads, tattoos, heavily
text: muscled. Bill grinds a guitar, Ted ‘sings’ - ferociously
text: growling out the final words, which sound something like:
speaker_heading: 65 YR OLD TED
dialog: «+WELCOME..... WELCOME TO THE END.
text: Then it ends. 65 Yr Old Bill and Ted look up with dead eyes.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: How’s it goin’, older incarcerated Bill
dialog: and Ted?
speaker_heading: 65 YR OLD BILL
dialog: How'd you like our song? And yah - it
dialog: actually is our song.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: It’s very, you know, intense. Passionate.
dialog: But is it the song?
speaker_heading: 65 YR OLD TED
dialog: Does that matter?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Well, yah - if we’re gonna save the world.
speaker_heading: 65 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Does that matter?
text: 65 Yr Old Bill and Ted stare-- hard. The guys look at each
text: other, concerned.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: So-- I think we'll be leaving now.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: It was really excellent seeing you guys,
dialog: good luck with everyth-
speaker_heading: 65 YR OLD BILL
dialog: You're not going anywhere, blondie.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: “Blondie?” Dude-- I’m you.
speaker_heading: 65 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Like I care.
text: The wall of prisoners has circled them and the men are
text: staring - waiting for what seems to have been promised them.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What’s going on?
speaker_heading: 65 YR OLD TED
dialog: Our friends here have been waiting for ten
dialog: years for the chance to kick your asses.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: 65 YR OLD TED
dialog: Way, guy.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: “Guy?” You don’t even know my name?
speaker_heading: 65 YR OLD TED
dialog: I don’t care what your name is.
dialog: 61.
text: Prisoners pull out pipes, blades-- start to close in.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Seriously dudes, you can’t just let us get
dialog: killed.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yah - cuz if you do, then you totally
dialog: won't exist.
speaker_heading: 65 YR OLD BILL
dialog: It doesn’t matter.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: That is most nihilistic.
speaker_heading: 65 YR OLD BILL
dialog: It doesn’t matter.
speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: Stop saying that.
text: Knives go up to Bill and Ted’s throats.
speaker_heading: 65 YR OLD TED
dialog: See you in hell, guy.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Okay. Um. I don’t want to be
dialog: argumentative here. But I don’t think
dialog: there could be two souls of the same
dialog: person in one hell.
speaker_heading: 65 YR OLD TED
dialog: Well, there’s two of us here.
speaker_heading: 65 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Ted - don’t --
speaker_heading: 65 YR OLD TED
dialog: “Oh, I’m Ted and I’m a philosophical
dialog: monist!”
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Well, I am! And I knew you knew my name!
speaker_heading: 65 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Ted - do not get drawn into this argument -
dialog: we talked about this -
text: Suddenly we hear a crackling and see a flash of light in the
text: sky. 65 Yr Old Bill looks at 65 Yr Old Ted with urgency.
speaker_heading: 65 YR OLD BILL (CONT’D)
dialog: We gotta do this before that future guy
dialog: shows up and --
text: Suddenly he freezes. As does 65 Yr Old Ted.
text: And everyone else around them as..
text: Only Bill and Ted are able to move. Their eyes widen as
text: ROLLINS steps out of the SILVER BOOTH and walks toward the
text: now completely motionless scene..
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: How’s it goin’, dude?
speaker_heading: ROLLINS
dialog: You tell me.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Bad.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: We're looking. We’re trying to find the
dialog: song.
speaker_heading: ROLLINS
dialog: Well whatever you’re doing is not working.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Sorry, dude..
speaker_heading: ROLLINS
dialog: I don’t care if you're sorry. There are a
dialog: lot of people depending on you. You need
dialog: to figure this out, and you need to figure
text: it out fast.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: How? We keep going further and further
dialog: into the future and things keep getting
dialog: worse and worse.
dialog: (looking at his older self)
dialog: I don’t even recognize myself anymore.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I’m starting to think maybe there is no
dialog: song.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Is there no song?
speaker_heading: ROLLINS
dialog: I don’t know. You have to figure this out
dialog: yourselves.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: We've like travelled through our whole
dialog: lives almost..
speaker_heading: ROLLINS
dialog: Have you?
dialog: 63.
text: A pause. The guys look at each other..
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Well, I guess not our whole lives..
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Are you saying we should go.. to the very
dialog: end?
text: He just looks at them, shrugs.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Like.. our end?
scene_heading: A MOMENT LATER
text: --FLASH -- Bill and Ted, in the phone booth - are seen
text: briefly - worried - as it drops from view, revealing:
text: Rollins, standing over the frozen scene, a look of grave
text: concern on his face as he steps into his silver booth and it
text: whooshes away. As it goes..
text: .-the prisoners return to their natural movement.
speaker_heading: 65 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Dude - I told you not to have that
dialog: argument with yourself!
speaker_heading: 65 YR OLD TED
dialog: I went out of my way to make sure it was
dialog: shorter.
speaker_heading: 65 YR OLD BILL
dialog: It wasn’t! Ted - it was the exact same
dialog: argument you had back then!
speaker_heading: 65 YR OLD TED
dialog: Maybe so - but he was so wrong! And I
dialog: told you to stop me!
speaker_heading: 65 YR OLD BILL
dialog: I was trying! I was yelling!
scene_heading: EXT. ANCIENT EGYPT - 3000 BC
text: 2 DOZEN SLAVES HAUL STONES on a GIANT WAGON up a hill along a
text: NARROW PATH in the desert. Slavedrivers crack whips. After
dialog: a moment of this we HEAR A SIREN BLIP and..
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: (amplified)
dialog: This is the San Dimas Police. Please stop
dialog: what you’re doing and drop your weapon.
dialog: 64.
text: The Rear Slavedriver looks back, sees:
text: The SAN DIMAS POLICE CAR behind it, its lights on.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE CAR - SAME
text: Deacon and Logan just sit there, looking at the line of
text: slaves blocking the road in front of them. Until..
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: So.. You gonna say it, dad, or am I?
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Say what?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: That Ted was right?
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Just drop it. I want us out of here.
dialog: NOW.
dialog: (holds mic to his lips)
dialog: I said - this is the San Dimas--
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: (rolling his eyes)
dialog: Dad --
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Fine.
text: Frustrated - Logan sets the mic down, opens his car door.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: The Slavedriver - and the slaves - all turn and gape as..
text: Logan emerges from the police car, putting in his billy club.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Have any of you men seen a phone booth
dialog: circa USA approximately 1989? Phone
dialog: booth.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: (rolls down window)
dialog: Dad - it’s 5000 years ago - there’s no
dialog: version of that that they understand.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: (to slavedriver, who is raising
dialog: his scimitar)
dialog: If you draw that weapon I will arrest you,
dialog: sir.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Dad - you can’t arrest this guy. This is
dialog: like three thousand BC.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: (ignoring Deacon)
dialog: Sir - this is your last chance.
text: The guy - uncomprehending - raises his scimitar. Logan
text: shakes his head - grabs his taser - and -
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Dad - this is a terrible idea
text: As the slavedriver comes at Logan with his huge blade, Logan
text: instantly shoots him in the bare chest with his taser.
text: The guy shakes violently and crumples to the ground, where he
text: lays there, twitching and writhing.
text: The slaves are terrified. Another GUARD comes at Logan.
text: Logan tases him too. But more and more guards are coming.
speaker_heading: DEACON (CONT'D)
dialog: Great. Now what are you gonna do?
text: Logan grabs his GUN and FIRES IT INTO THE AIR.
text: Which causes immediate and widespread panic.
speaker_heading: ON THE WAGON
text: The slaves scatter - the ones who were pulling the giant
text: boulder. The ones who were securing it. It starts to move..
scene_heading: JUST BELOW IT
text: Deacon’s eyes widen.
speaker_heading: DEACON (CONT'D)
dialog: Dad!
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: I’m not quite done here -
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: DAD! WE HAVE TO GO!
text: Logan turns -- sees the boulder dislodging and starting to
text: roll. He turns quickly. And he dives back into --
speaker_heading: THE POLICE CAR
text: Where Deacon steps on the gas.
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: GO! Put it in reverse!
text: But the tires spin in the sand and --
speaker_heading: THE BOULDER
text: Gains speed and rolls off the huge wagon - all 25,000 pounds
dialog: of it toward --
speaker_heading: THE POLICE CAR
text: Which can’t get any traction.. As just as it starts to move
dialog: backwards --
text: -- CRUUUUUUUUNCH -- the boulder utterly crushes the car.
dialog: Pause. Silence.
text: The slaves and slavedrivers all stop and look as we hold on
text: the huge motionless boulder in the dust.. and then we cut to:
scene_heading: DARKNESS - SOMEWHERE
text: WE HOLD for a while. As our eyes adjust we begin to sense
text: that we are in some kind of a deep, deep cave.
text: Gradually we begin to SEE some reflected blue and red light
text: from above... and we HEAR an approaching SIREN.. as..
text: THE POLICE CAR plummets into frame - dropping and dropping
text: down this seemingly bottomless hole.
text: CAMERA DROPS WITH IT- for a while.. We see Deacon and Logan
text: sitting in the front seat -- too gobsmacked to scream.
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: What just happened?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: I think we were crushed by that giant
text: boulder and killed.
text: A pause. Logan looks around, nodding.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: So where are we then?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: My guess is we are falling to --
text: Suddenly there’s a loud WHOOOMPH as the car hits the ground
text: and bounces a moment before stopping entirely.
dialog: 67.
text: As the dust clears around them we see red, fiery light
text: playing off their faces as they look around and gape. And we
dialog: cut to:
scene_heading: EXT. SAN DIMAS, CALIFORNIA
text: We’re outside a REST HOME as - FLASH - the shimmering phone
text: booth appears and lands. Bill and Ted get out, approach the
text: front door.
dialog: Super: San Dimas, California, 50 Years In the Future
scene_heading: INT. REST HOME - A MOMENT LATER
text: Bill and Ted enter, turn and go down a hallway toward an open
text: door backlit with light. They cross and enter --
scene_heading: INT. ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: -- Where they step in and see.. in two beds, TWO VERY, VERY
text: OLD MEN-- 95 YEAR OLD BILL AND TED.
text: Ancient, frail, in the final moments of their lives. They
text: look up with grateful recognition as Bill and Ted enter.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (gently)
dialog: How’s it goin’?
speaker_heading: 95 YR OLD TED
dialog: All I can say is we’re so glad you’re
dialog: finally here.
speaker_heading: 95 YR OLD BILL
dialog: And so happy to be able to share the song
dialog: with you.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: So then-- there is a song?
speaker_heading: 95 YR OLD TED
text: As it turns out, there is.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: When was it written?
speaker_heading: 95 YR OLD BILL
dialog: A long, long time ago. You just didn’t
dialog: recognize it.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Is it.. good?
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: 95 YR OLD BILL
dialog: It’s amazing. You can’t imagine how proud
dialog: you'll feel when you play it.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: When do we play it?
speaker_heading: 95 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Tonight.
text: The guys look at each other, amazed, excited. Then..
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Is there.. a title?
text: The ancient thems look at each other.. Then back at the guys.
speaker_heading: 95 YR OLD BILL
dialog: It’s called..
speaker_heading: 95 YR OLD TED
dialog: ..-Face the Music.
text: The guys take this in. It’s clear it’s the truth.
text: Exchanging a look, Bill and Ted separate.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (taking his older self’s hand)
dialog: Bill.. I just want to say thank you for
dialog: all the times you’ve been there for me..
speaker_heading: 95 YR OLD BILL
dialog: I’m so sorry for the times I let you down,
dialog: Bill.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (voice catching)
dialog: You never did, Bill, you never did.
text: At the same time, on the other side of the room:
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I feel like I never really knew you, Ted.
speaker_heading: 95 YR OLD TED
dialog: I know, that’s my fault. I never truly
dialog: opened myself up to you. The truth is-- I
dialog: looked at you and saw myself.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I know, me too.
speaker_heading: 95 YR OLD TED
text: But now, as I reach the end, there’s so
dialog: much that I want to say to you.
dialog: 69.
text: We hear crying and MOVE BACK TO THE BILLS. Bill is hugging
text: his ancient, dying self, whose eyes are dimming.
speaker_heading: 95 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Te adoro, Guillermo...
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I‘ll never forget you, Bill. Ever.
text: Bill looks over to Ted, who leans close to 95 Yr Old Ted.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: There is one more thing we need to ask
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: 95 YR OLD TED
dialog: I know. Elizabeth and Joanna.
dialog: (a pause; voice catching)
dialog: We haven't seen them since the day they
dialog: left.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Oh no, please don’t say that.
speaker_heading: 95 YR OLD TED
dialog: But I’m afraid it’s true.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Does it have to be that way?
text: 95 Yr Old Ted takes Ted’s hand.
speaker_heading: 95 YR OLD TED
dialog: Unless you two change it.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Can we?
speaker_heading: 95 YR OLD TED
dialog: Of course you can. None of this has to
dialog: happen.
speaker_heading: 95 YR OLD BILL
dialog: Believe us: When the song is played,
dialog: everything will change.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: But how are we gonna play it? We don’t
dialog: even know what it is.
speaker_heading: 95 YR OLD TED
dialog: Its with you. It’s with you right now.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Where?
dialog: 70.
text: 95 Yr Old Ted starts to point - but his hand drops. He looks
text: at ancient Bill. They both nod ever-so-slightly, then look
dialog: back at their younger selves and say:
text: 95 YR OLD BILL AND TED
dialog: Catch you later, Bill and Ted.
dialog: And with that, they die.
text: Bill and Ted stare for a long moment.. Then..
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Dude-- In honor of our late selves, I
dialog: propose that we get back to the Fabulous
dialog: Forum and immediately play our song..
text: Ted nods. Meanwhile:
scene_heading: IN HELL —- SAME
text: The cop car cruises along, slowly, demons and anguished souls
text: peering in, crowding them, making it difficult to navigate.
text: Logan flicks the lights on top and BLIPS the siren a couple
text: times. Then gets on the mic and says, amplified:
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Please move away from the vehicle. I
dialog: repeat: please move away from the vehicle
dialog: immediately.
text: No change. If anything, it’s getting more difficult to move.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Dad - that is lame. I mean, we’re in
dialog: hell.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Now you’re telling me how to be a police
dialog: officer. You gonna replace me there too?
speaker_heading: DEACON
text: Finally it comes out.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Finally what comes out, Deacon?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: That this is about Missy.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: I’m sorry - when you say “Missy” are you
dialog: referring to your wife - or are you
dialog: referring to my ex-wife? Oh - oh - I’m
dialog: sorry - they’re the same person.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (re tortured souls)
dialog: You know what? Stop the car. I’m gonna
dialog: deal with this.
text: Logan pushes the door open and steps outside.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: Logan stands about a head or two ABOVE the hunched-over
text: TORMENTED SOULS as TWO FEARSOME DEMONS approach and growl.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: I need you to move these people out of the
dialog: way, please.
text: The Demons come toward him, eyes glowing.
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm telling you to freeze right there,
dialog: sir. Both of you.
dialog: (as they keep coming)
dialog: Consider yourselves warned.
text: Now Logan removes his BEAN BAG GUN from his belt and FIRES
text: THREE BEAN BAGS INTO THE FIRST DEMON’S CHEST, who falls over
text: backward with a wail. The other demon keeps coming. Logan
text: CLUBS HIM WITH HIS BILLY CLUB - then MACES HIM. As the Demon
text: grabs his eyes, moaning, Logan reflexively cuffs him.
text: Deacon exits, is now standing on the other side of the car..
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Good work, dad. What are you gonna do
dialog: about the rest of them?
text: Logan turns, sees what Deacon's referring to:
text: Two HUGE DEMONS are lumbering menacingly toward them..
text: Logan looks out, then looks down at his weapons..
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Let’s get back in the car.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Good idea.
text: They re-enter the car. Suddenly STARTLED as they see:
text: Sitting in the back seat is DEATH, black-clad, white-faced.
text: Very, very somber.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Who the hell are you?
speaker_heading: DEATH
dialog: I am “Death.” I knew your son and his
dialog: friend Bill. We were band mates.
dialog: 72.
dialog: We sense in Death a kind of longing - he misses those ever-so-
text: brief good moments; the last (and only) ones of his life.
speaker_heading: DEATH (CONT'D)
dialog: (very straight-faced)
dialog: Man did I party hard. Too hard, it turned
dialog: out. And the women. Whoo-boy. Yes, I
dialog: was a player...
text: He looks off, nostalgic.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Excuse me.
dialog: (as Death turns back)
dialog: Why are you here? Are you just here to
dialog: reminisce? Because we actually need to
dialog: find a way out of here.
speaker_heading: DEATH
dialog: Yes, I can help you. I’ve still got some
dialog: ‘juice’ around here. This way.
text: Death makes a gesture out the window and a slight path opens.
text: As Deacon starts to drive:
speaker_heading: DEATH (CONT'D)
dialog: So.. how is the band? Have the guys come
dialog: up with the song yet?
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: No - and they never will. They're
dialog: delusional.
speaker_heading: DEATH
dialog: Oh - you still think that?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: I know. That’s what I’ve been saying.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Hey, you know what-?
speaker_heading: DEATH
dialog: (raising a hand)
dialog: Excuse me. Gentlemen. Please. I get
dialog: enough conflict down here. Can we just
dialog: have some chill tunes?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: You know, I think that’s a good idea.
dialog: 73.
text: Deacon turns on the CD player. JACK JOHNSON’S “BETTER
text: TOGETHER” comes on.
speaker_heading: DEATH
dialog: Mnnn. Love me my Jack Johnson.
text: He sits back, slightly moving to the beat as --
text: FROM A HIGH, WIDE SHOT: The police car cruises through hell
text: Jack Johnson music wafting up. HOLD a moment, then cut to:
scene_heading: EXT. FABULOUS FORUM - NIGHT
text: The MARQUEE reads “TONIGHT - WYLD STALLYNS presents ‘Two
text: Decades of Triumphance!’"” There’s a FLASH in the sky, and a
text: moment later the booth lands and the guys jump out and rush
text: towards the artists’ entrance. As they run..
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I still don’t understand.. How are we
dialog: gonna play the greatest song ever written
dialog: when we don’t even know it?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Ted, you heard us: we have it with us.
dialog: We've obviously been over-thinking this.
dialog: We just have to let it happen.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: So we’re just gonna make it up as we go
dialog: along?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Exactly.
text: Ted nods, not totally convinced, as the guys hurry towards -
scene_heading: EXT. ARTISTS’ ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS
text: The guys move quickly to Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Gotta admit-- didn’t think you two’d
text: actually show up.
dialog: (into radio)
dialog: They're here. Cut the house lights.
text: Frank throws open a door marked “STAGE” and they push in as,
text: in front of them, the arena dims. They look nervously at
dialog: each other.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Our world is about to change, dude.
dialog: 74.
text: They mount the steps toward the side curtains which block--
speaker_heading: THE STAGE
text: Which is lit. But the guys don’t see much of it - yet.
speaker_heading: BILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Ready, Ted?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Ready, Bill.
text: And they stride past a curtain and onto..
speaker_heading: THE STAGE
text: Which is totally empty. No mics. No instruments. Nothing.
text: They stand in the glare of the bright lights on the totally
text: bare stage. It’s too dark in the audience to see out.
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: Dude.. What’s going on?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I don’t know.. Maybe we gotta keep going.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Going... where?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: To the mics.
speaker_heading: TED
text: There are no mics.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I think we just gotta start.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Okay. I guess.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Ready? One.. Two..
speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: One - two - three - four!
dialog: Silence.
text: They stand there - look at each other. Nothing coming into
dialog: their heads.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Let's try again.
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Okay. One - two - three - four.
dialog: Still nothing. Beat.
text: They walk closer to the center of the stage. It’s like a
dialog: very, very bad dream.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Hello?
text: It’s utterly silent in the audience.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Hello, Fabulous Forum?
text: More silence. A beat. Ted turns to the side:
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: Um.. Could we have the house lights up?
text: A beat later - a loud KA-CHUNK, and the guys stare out at:
scene_heading: THE ENTIRE FORUM
text: Which is completely empty. Not one ticket has been sold.
text: Bored USHERS motionlessly man utterly empty tunnels.
text: CONCESSION WORKERS stand idly behind their counters.
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
text: Bill and Ted just look around, confused, disoriented...
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t understand...
text: DING DING DING, a warning light goes off on the timepiece:
text: TWO MINUTES LEFT. Suddenly the guys feel something strange:
text: Their feet are starting to move. They gape at each other -
dialog: terrified - as..
text: They begin sliding backwards - WHAM - into the phone booth.
text: Which lights up automatically and quickly SHOOTS DOWN through
text: the pavement and is gone. Revealing:
text: ROLLINS, by his booth, watching. He steps back inside.. and
text: WHOOSH.. It’s gone, too.
dialog: 76.
scene_heading: EXT. FORUM - NIGHT
text: Above, the sky starts to DARKEN ominously. LIGHTNING
text: flashes.. Some cracks start to appear in the ground. We PAN
dialog: TO:
text: THE 76 STATION ACROSS FROM THE FORUM
text: Where a guy gets out of his car to pump gas and stops short -
text: totally baffled as he sees:
text: An EQUALLY CONFUSED ROMAN SOLDIER - in toga, with lst century
text: weaponry - just standing there, under the fluorescent light
dialog: of the gas station.
text: Both men stare at each other, utterly confounded. And we cut
dialog: to:
scene_heading: EXT. HEAVEN - DAY
text: Stark, white, quiet. As if we are up in the clouds. The
text: POLICE CAR is parked. Deacon and Logan are standing,
text: waiting. In silence. For a long while. Until, finally:
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Fine. Ted wasn’t wrong.
dialog: (off Deacon’s look)
dialog: He was right. Ted was right. Ted was..
dialog: totally, one hundred percent right. About
dialog: everything. You happy?
text: Deacon nods. Footsteps. Death approaches, exiting a heavy,
text: gold door.
speaker_heading: LOGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: How'd it go?
speaker_heading: DEATH
dialog: My bad. I thought I could get the gate
dialog: key. But the truth is, the old man just
dialog: got pissed. That’s the bad news. The good
dialog: news? I just got scored a new Play
dialog: Station which is pretty rad, and since
dialog: we'll be spending a lot of time - like
dialog: “eternity” - together--
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: No. Absolutely not. I’m not staying
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: DEATH
dialog: Well I’m afraid you don’t get to make the--
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: No. No no no. My son is in serious
dialog: jeopardy - and I have a job to do.
text: He pushes past Death and through the gold door, which closes
text: with a solid whoomph.
text: Deacon and Death look at each other as, OFFSCREEN, we hear
text: Logan's insistent, muffled voice - and a lower, booming, also
text: muffled voice - talking over each other.
text: Death looks at Deacon, raises an eyebrow.
speaker_heading: DEATH
dialog: Wow. Your old man has a very big ball
dialog: sack, bro.
text: There's a brief beat of silence. Followed by a low PHHUP-
text: PHHHHHUP, and then..
scene_heading: MUFFLED AUTHORITARIAN VOICE
scene_heading: OW-OWWWW. .
text: Which is then followed by a very heavy THUD. And groaning.
text: And then Logan storms out, eyes straight ahead - jaw fixed -
text: holding a GILDED SKELETON KEY.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Did you just bean-bag God, Dad?
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Yes I did. Get in.
text: Deacon turns - follows his father to the car.
speaker_heading: DEATH
dialog: I'll try to smooth this out. Say hi to the
dialog: fellas for me. And - oh - one thing. Can
dialog: I keep that chill Jack Johnson CD?
text: Deacon hands Death the CD, the police car screams away.. then
text: shimmers and disappears and we cut to:
scene_heading: INT. GREAT DOME - DAY (2713)
text: --BANG - the phone booth lands, roughly, followed a half beat
text: later by the silver booth.
text: The guys get out - shaken - and find themselves face to face
text: with the THREE GREAT LEADERS, who are scowling, furious.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: You have failed utterly.
dialog: 78.
text: Though inside the dome, we HEAR UTTER CHAOS coming from
text: outside: thunder - the ground is quaking - screaming..
text: people in the dome are running.
speaker_heading: LEADER (CONT'D)
dialog: Why we ever put our hopes in you two
dialog: idiots is beyond me.
text: And he and the others turn, stride off. There is a final
text: BEEEEEEP on the timepiece as it runs out. The guys just
text: stand, looking down at it-- horrified, speechless.
text: Then Rollins steps between them. They look at him.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What’s going to happen?
text: Rollins indicates for them to follow.
scene_heading: WITH THE GUYS - A MOMENT LATER
text: As Rollins leads them, shell-shocked, into the room which
text: houses the TIMELINE.
speaker_heading: ROLLINS
dialog: This is the new reality.
text: He points all the way down towards antiquity.
speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: Whoa..
text: The time line appears to be fraying: bending upward,
text: twisting back in on itself, contorting - like a hose out of
text: control or a downed electrical line.
text: The guys move closer. Ted touches it. Suddenly an image
text: pops up: The BUDDHA is running in panic from --
text: A CAVEMAN - who catches him and CLUBS HIM on the head..
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Whoooaaaa.. Dude-- the Buddha just got
text: clubbed by a caveman.
text: Bill moves forward, touches the timeline. We see the Last
text: Supper -- 12 people sitting in a torch-lit tent. Suddenly
text: two OMINOUS SHADOWS appear on the tent wall and we HEAR a
text: pair of loud SCREECHES as a_FEARSOME CLAW suddenly tears the
text: tent. The 12 disciples leap and run as --
text: Bill turns to Ted:
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Ted, if I’m not mistaken, I believe the
text: Last Supper was just disrupted by a pair
text: of velocirapters.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Oh, no..
text: They cross together.. Look at the line.
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: Dude. It’s like everything is just
dialog: blending together.
speaker_heading: ROLLINS
text: It’s collapsing in on itself. Starting at
text: the ends - and moving toward the middle.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: It’s in 1400 now.. Does that mean it’s
dialog: about to hit..?
text: The guys look at each other, then look toward medieval times -
text: the 1400's - suddenly grasping something -
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: You brought our families there.
speaker_heading: ROLLINS
dialog: That I did.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Ted --
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Why would you do that?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Ted - it doesn’t matter now. We just
dialog: gotta get there and get em back.
text: Ted looks at Rollins - then follows Bill as..
scene_heading: THE GUYS RUN
text: Through the chaos and into the phone booth and we cut to:
scene_heading: EXT. ENGLAND, 1428 - DAY
text: The booth appears on TOP OF A CASTLE WALL and Bill and Ted
text: leap out, suddenly stopping and reacting in horror.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Dude - look.
text: WITHIN THE CASTLE, guarded by dozens and dozens of fearsome-
text: looking KNIGHTS in armor who are brandishing swords--
text: Joanna, Elizabeth, Will, Theo - as well as the Duke and
text: Duchess - are bound and are being led along SCAFFOLDING
text: toward 6 NOOSES.
text: The King stands nearby and shouts out over the chaos:
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: For bringing darkness into our world, this
dialog: entire family must die!
text: Bill and Ted look in the other direction: below them -
text: OUTSIDE THE CASTLE - pounding on the gates and trying to ram
dialog: down the castle walls - are:
text: SOLDIERS FROM EVERY ERA - Trojan warriors, Incas, Nazis, Red
text: Coats - you name it - all ramming the gates.. Scaling the
text: walls.. pulling pins in grenades, etc. And more are coming
dialog: from other directions.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Dude, what are we gonna do? There’s not
text: just guards and executioners in the castle
dialog: - but there’s like armies from all through
text: history outside the castle.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I know. And we got like 30 seconds to
dialog: figure it out and we’d need like 30 years!
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: But dude-- we don’t got 30 years to figure
dialog: it out.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: We don’t.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What? What do you mean?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: We don’t - cause we’re just starting to
dialog: think about it now. But what if we start
dialog: thinking about it thirty years ago?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: How? We'd have to start when we’re like
dialog: ten.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Exactly!
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (eyes widening)
dialog: Whoa! Dude! That means, alls we gotta do
dialog: is--
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: --go back and find ourselves when we're
dialog: ten --
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: -- when we actually have 30 years to think
dialog: about it.. and get ourselves thinking
dialog: about it!
dialog: (turns )
dialog: Ted - you have had many ingenious ideas
text: which on the surface seem
dialog: counterintuitive. But this is the
dialog: counterintuitivest of them all. Let’s go,
dialog: dude.
text: They jump back into the phone booth, quickly dial. With a
text: flash, the booth disappears and we cut to:
scene_heading: INT. BILL’S CHILDHOOD HOUSE - NIGHT
text: VAN HALEN’S “RUNNIN’ WITH THE DEVIL” plays on the tape deck
text: as 10 year old Bill and Ted jump on the beds, playing air
text: guitar and singing along.
dialog: Super: San Dimas, California, 1980
text: The door opens and 14 YEAR OLD MISSY sticks her head in.
scene_heading: 14 YEAR OLD MISSY
dialog: You guys need to brush your teeth and get
dialog: ready for bed. Your folks will be home
dialog: soon, Bill.
scene_heading: 10 YEAR OLD BILL
dialog: Okay, Missy.
text: She puts her Walkman headphones back on, exits.
speaker_heading: 10 YEAR OLD TED
dialog: Dude, your babysitter is cute.
scene_heading: 10 YEAR OLD BILL
dialog: I know, remember when we were in
dialog: kindergarten and she was in third and we
dialog: asked her to the pumpkin dance?
dialog: 82.
text: They hear LOUD RAPPING on the window. There, outside, in
text: shadows, desperate and frenetic, are adult Bill and Ted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Dudes! Let us in! Hurry!
speaker_heading: 10 YEAR OLD TED
dialog: Wh-who are you?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Don’t worry! We’re you, it’s fine!
text: The boys - terrified - turn and try to run out - but Bill and
text: Ted open the window and rush in and catch them at the door.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Dudes, listen to us. We're you. We're
dialog: what you will become.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yah - and we’re here to prevent you from
dialog: destroying time and space as we know it.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Not to mention destroying your marriages.
dialog: And alienating your kids.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Elizabeth is gonna be the love of your
dialog: life, Ted, and you’re gonna blow it. And
dialog: Will and Theo will think you two are
dialog: completely blind idiots, which you are.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You will be lonely beyond description
dialog: without Joanna, Bill. Especially when mom
dialog: walks out on you and never comes back.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: But! Here’s the good news: It doesn’t
dialog: have to happen.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yah, alls you gotta do is take the next 30
dialog: years to figure out how to save your wives
dialog: and sons and in-laws from being hanged in
dialog: 1428! Simple, right?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: But you gotta start now - like right now.
text: The two boys are too stunned and scared to speak. Bill and
text: Ted kneel down, get right in their own faces.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: So-- ARE you gonna spend the next 30 years
dialog: figuring this out? Are you? Are you??
text: The two kids, looking like they’re about to cry, are so
text: scared that they cannot even manage tiny little nods. Bill
text: and Ted look at each other.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Dude, they’re not getting it. What do we
dialog: do?
scene_heading: INT. PHONE BOOTH - MOMENT LATER
text: Bill and Ted shove their beyond-terrified, whimpering,
text: trembling younger selves into the booth. As Ted dials..
text: A CAR screeches into Bill’s driveway and a woman (35, pretty,
text: curly blonde hair) rushes towards them, yelling at the top of
dialog: her lungs--
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: STOP!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING??
text: Bill’s jaw drops in amazement as the booth sparks..
text: Bill and Little Bill both press their faces to the glass..
scene_heading: BILL/LITTLE BILL
speaker_heading: MOM!
scene_heading: MRS. PRESTON
dialog: BILL??!
text: But the shimmering booth is now dropping--
text: And just before it disappears, Bill notices that --
scene_heading: IN THE SWIRLING VORTEX
text: Mrs. Preston has slipped and tumbled in and now --
scene_heading: IN THE CIRCUITS OF TIME - CONTINUOUS
text: Bill is horrified.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Oh, no! I always knew I was responsible
dialog: for my mom’s leaving.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Dude, you weren't.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Ted, I literally just was. Mom!
speaker_heading: MRS. PRESTON (0.S.)
dialog: (voice disappearing)
scene_heading: BILLLLLL1111111111......
text: Bill and Little Bill stare in horror and we cut to..
scene_heading: EXT. ENGLAND - ON TOP OF THE CASTLE WALL (1428)
text: The booth lands back on the parapet and.. Bill and Ted drag
text: their 10 year old selves out of it.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Bill: stop crying. Even though Mom's
dialog: gone, I love you and I will always be
dialog: there for you.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Dude - you can’t promise that.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Okay - I won’t be there for you. But you
dialog: are gonna have to be there for us.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yah. You guys have to see this.
text: Gradually the terrified 10 year olds open their eyes.
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: Now. Is this burned on your brain?
text: The kids stare down at the confusion: royal guards on the
text: inside - soldiers from all of time on the outside, climbing
text: the walls, clambering to get in.
text: Their younger selves give horrified nods.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Good. Now. Here’s what you need to do:
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: See those people down there? Those are
dialog: your beloved wives and sons - and that’s
text: their grandparents. They’re about to be
text: hung by their necks till they’re dead.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You don’t want that to happen? Spend the
dialog: next thirty years coming up with a plan to
dialog: get us out of this.
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: And do it fast. Cause we only got about
dialog: thirty seconds and we don’t have any idea
dialog: what to do.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Now get going.
text: (swatting his young self on the
dialog: ass)
dialog: Get.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (shoving himself roughly)
speaker_heading: IW
dialog: n.
text: As they shove the kids back into the booth and speed-dial the
dialog: numbers --
text: And BOOM.
speaker_heading: BILL
text: Even though space-time is unravelling -
dialog: because of you - it doesn’t matter. You
dialog: have to save them.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: So don’t blow it.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Don’t blow anything.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Do everything right, always. You two -
dialog: alone - are responsible for saving
dialog: everything. Okay?
text: The booth is gone. Alerting the attention of TWO
text: GUARDS WITH BOWS AND ARROWS, who turn, on the parapet, and
dialog: start toward..
text: Bill and Ted - who quickly spot--
speaker_heading: A STAIRWELL
text: and hurry into it, mulling what just happened as they rush
dialog: down it.
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t think that went particularly well.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yah. I think in our desperation we came
dialog: on a bit too strong.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I know, midway through, I started to
dialog: totally remember this whole thing from
dialog: when it happened to us.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I know. I’d always thought that was just
dialog: some weird nightmare.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yah - the worst nightmare of all time.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Totally. So bad that I musta completely
dialog: blocked it out.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: But now that we’re talking about it - it’s
dialog: like in the back of my mind, I’ve always
dialog: been thinking about it.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I know.. Me, too.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Dude. Is it even possible that it worked?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Well.. What if we now have been thinking
dialog: about this - subconsciously - for thirty
dialog: years?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I don’t know. Then I guess we’d know more
dialog: about what to do.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yah. Like.. I don’t know..
text: Ted reaches into his jacket packet and pulls out the LARGE
scene_heading: BLOB OF YARN.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Dude, you're gonna knit?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I don’t think so. I think I’m gonna just
dialog: do.. This.
text: Ted holds the yarn blob right in front of Bill - AND
text: INSTANTLY - there’s a “THWOOK” - and A SPEEDING ARROW lodges
text: right in the blob - and not into Bill.
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: Whoa!
text: Suddenly Ted turns, shifts his arm, and - THWOOK-THWOOK - two
text: more arrows lodge into the blob. From the CASTLE GUARDS
text: who'd just seen them on the parapet.
text: They look at each other and now burst out a door and into --
scene_heading: A COURTYARD ON THE CASTLE GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS
text: Where it’s chaos: soldiers and denizens from all of time
text: drop down over the walls and swarm, doing battle with the
text: royal guards. Bill and Ted make their way out.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Dude - you have been thinking about this!
dialog: That must be why you’ve been making yarn
dialog: blobs all these years!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Whoa! Yah! I wonder what you’ve been
dialog: thinking about?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I don’t know. I look forward to finding
dialog: out.
text: Suddenly they both freeze as they HEAR LOUD VOICES IN ANCIENT
text: CHINESE and they turns slowly to see:
text: 2 DOZEN HUNS stand before them, spears raised, with a LEADER
text: yelling in Mongolian.
text: SUBTITLE: KILL THEM BOTH!
text: Bill and Ted's eyes widen -
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Whoa...
text: Ted yanks a knitting needle, holds it “threateningly.” It
text: does nothing. The Huns come closer. Suddenly --
text: AN OFFSCREEN VOICE YELLS LOUDLY IN ANCIENT MONGOLIAN.
scene_heading: SUBTITLE: LEAVE THEM - KEEP MOVING! NOW!!
text: The Huns look at the guys for a second.. And then move on,
text: pushing past.
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: Whoa.. I didn’t even see who said that.
dialog: 88.
text: Bill looks at TED with a little smile. And then, with his
text: mouth completely closed, he says:
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE
dialog: Me neither, dude!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Whoa! I’m not sure what’s more
dialog: impressive: your ventriloquism, or your
dialog: use of ancient Mongolian.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Thanks! And I spent that whole summer and
dialog: only learned two phrases! I guess I won’t
dialog: get to use the other one.
dialog: (then, turning)
dialog: Hing tak ga.
scene_heading: SUBTITLE: EXCUSE ME, DUDE
text: He steps aside as a Mongolian warrior moves past, almost
text: hitting him. Gaining confidence now, they start moving
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Our families are just on the other side of
dialog: that wall.
text: Indeed - there’s a LARGE CASTLE WALL just on the other side
dialog: of this courtyard.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: How we gonna get through all this and over
dialog: there?
text: They see a HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE moving through the chaos.

dialog: Camp Weekhoko - summer of 83!
text: They two of them race to the wagon and slide under -
text: immediately get into “crab-walking” position (legs forward,
text: hands behind, body facing up) and - using the carriage as
text: “cover” -— they crab-walk exceedingly fast - scuttling forward
dialog: under the carriage. They are very good at it. (And they
dialog: know it.)
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Dude - that whole summer - all the
dialog: counselors were like “don’t you wanna do
dialog: anything besides crab-walk?”
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: And we were like --
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: Nope!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Now we know why.
text: And they roll out - rise. Look at the wall - and then look
text: at TWO FELLED FLAG POLES which have just been knocked from
text: the walls.
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: Pole vault!
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Good idea, dude!
text: They each grab an end of one of the long flagpoles and try to
text: plant the pole, but they both just end up running along the
text: pole with it sliding through their hands until they both face
text: plant at the other end of the wood.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Dude.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I know. I just remembered: we never
dialog: learned how to pole vault!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Then why did we think these poles were a
dialog: good idea?
text: The guys look at the long wooden sticks they are holding in
dialog: their hands.
scene_heading: A MOMENT LATER
text: Bill and Ted are STILT-WALKING - 25 feet in the air.
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m not sure this was such a good idea
dialog: either. We’re still not high enough to
text: get over the wall.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I know. And I feel somewhat vulnerable
dialog: and exposed.
text: Below them HORDES OF SOLDIERS are approaching their long,
text: spindly wooden “legs.”
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Maybe we should wave to them like Uncle
dialog: Sam.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Dude - what does Uncle Sam say?
speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: (alternating, while waving)
dialog: Good day citizens! Happy Fourth of July!
dialog: We are Uncle Sam! We want you.. To stop
dialog: trying to knock us over!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Dude - we have to remember to not have
text: this misguided stilt-walking plan.
text: Below them SOLDIERS whack the stilts. The guys teeter.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Well there must be some reason we did it.
text: They hear an o.s. SCREECH and suddenly see TWO HUGE, SCALY
text: REPTILIAN CLAWED FEET rise up over the wall..
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: That’s why!
text: They reach up and grab the legs. Now look up and see the
text: UNDERBELLY of a huge scaly flying beast.
text: Below - the shadow of a PTERODACTYL moves toward the wall as
text: the guys rise up..
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Dude - I hate to even ask this question..
dialog: But how - and when - could we have learned
dialog: how to ride pterodactyls?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I’m not sure we did, dude.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Oh, yah.
text: They look at each other -- and then just fall to the ground
text: with a double WHUMPF as we hear heavy wings flump away.
scene_heading: EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD —- CONTINUOUS
text: They look up. They are at the feet of the executioners --
text: just yards away from where their wives and children have
text: their heads on blocks.
speaker_heading: BILL TED
dialog: Joanna! Theo! Elizabeth! Will!
text: Their families look up as Bill and Ted rise, full of
dialog: confidence.
dialog: gl.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Stop, executioners.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Unhand our families. Now.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Bill?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Ted?
text: Suddenly swords appear at their necks.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Apparently 30 years was not quite enough
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: SCAFFOLDING
text: Bill and Ted’s heads are placed in nooses next to the others.
text: The guys look at their wives and sons.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Liz.. Will.. I’m sorry. We tried to save
dialog: the world - but we failed.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (to Joanna and Theo)
dialog: We tried to save you - and we failed that,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: I love you both.
text: The King nods - the hangmen start away from the scaffolding.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I must say - it’s darkly ironic that the
dialog: name of the song we supposedly wrote is
dialog: “Face the Music”..
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (nods )
dialog: Cuz I think that’s what we’re about to do.
text: There’s a beat. Will and Theo look at each other.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Wait - dad - what did you say the song was
dialog: called?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Face the Music.
dialog: 92.
text: Now the women look at each other.. then at Bill and Ted...
text: grasping something.
text: Below, the King gets in position for the execution.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Ted.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Bill.
speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: What?
text: The women nod to the boys, who are looking at their dads.
text: And suddenly... it hits Bill and Ted like a tidal wave. Their
text: eyes widen. They look at their sons.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: That's your song, isn’t it?
text: Ted wriggles a hand free, manages to reach into his pocket
text: and pull out the now-crumpled sheet of paper that he took
dialog: from Will the night before.
text: He unfolds it.. And opens it. It’s sheet music. Written on
text: the top are the words “FACE THE MUSIC.”
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I’ve had it in my pocket the whole time.
text: Now, below, the King gives a signal. The executioners move
text: toward the lever - and begin to pull it..
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: That future guy was right, there is a
dialog: song.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I just kinda wish we’d figured this out a
dialog: bit sooner.
text: They are all about to hang... when suddenly, from outside the
dialog: castle, we hear:
speaker_heading: AN AMPLIFIED VOICE
dialog: Citizens of Medieval England, this is the
text: San Dimas Police. Come out of the castle
dialog: immediately. I repeat: Come out of the
dialog: castle immediately. This is your last
dialog: warning.
text: Suddenly CANISTERS fly over the wall and pink TEAR GAS fills
text: the air. People wheeze, cough, cry, as--
dialog: 93.
text: DEACON’S POLICE CAR crashes through a gate and drives into
text: the castle courtyard, smashing into the base of the wooden
text: scaffolding.. bringing it all toppling to the ground.
text: Logan jumps out, in a gas mask. As he frees the Logans and
dialog: Prestons, the Duke and Duchess...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Dad? What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: I was wrong about you, Ted - and I’m sorry
dialog: - and we're all leaving. Come on.
dialog: (then - to the Duke and Duchess)
text: Chet Logan. Ted’s dad.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: John, and this is my wife Mary. Duke and
dialog: Duchess of North Umberland.
text: This while they rush through the melee - pile into the car -
text: 5 in front, 5 in back. Deacon slams it into gear - and it
text: accelerates, shimmers and disappears.
scene_heading: INT. CIRCUITS OF TIME - A MOMENT LATER
text: Windblown, chaotic, lights swirling. Deacon tries to
text: navigate as the car careens through - barely. The Duke is in
text: Logan's lap. Between them, the Duchess is on Theo’s lap.
text: Bill and Ted are in the back with Joanna, Elizabeth and Will.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Where are we going, Ted?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: The Fabulous Forum!
text: Deacon cranks the wheel - the car shakes violently - as if
text: crossing a bridge that’s an the brink of giving out.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: This is impossible!
text: Suddenly a SILVER STREAK OF LIGHT FLASHES PAST THEM.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: What is that?
text: The guys look forward -- it’s THE SILVER BOOTH. With Rollins
text: inside. He nods - beckons them to follow.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: It’s help.
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Follow him.
text: Deacon does. And now, through the shuddering circuits of
text: time, they swoop and swerve - until finally--
scene_heading: EXT. FABULOUS FORUM - NIGHT - PRESENT DAY
text: The police car drops to the ground in front of the Forum -
text: where the ground is shaking and cracking. They race out of
dialog: the car --
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Duck!
text: And have to squat to avoid a pack of PIRATES who are firing
text: muskets at come COWBOYS..
text: They all start moving with their families. As they pass the
dialog: silver booth--
text: Rollins emerges - joining them. He carries two large cases.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Dude - thank you.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Do you think it’s too late?
speaker_heading: ROLLINS
dialog: We'll see.
dialog: (then)
dialog: My dad always said you'd figure it out,
dialog: sooner or later.
dialog: The guys slow..
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Wait..
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Is your dad.. Rufus?
text: Rollins nods. And they all start through--
speaker_heading: THE TUNNEL
text: Which is over-run with anachronistic madness.
text: Logan billy clubs a Samurai. Deacon tases a Sabertooth tiger.
text: Joanna beanbags a Nazi. Elizabeth pepper sprays George
dialog: Washington.
dialog: 95.
scene_heading: GEORGE WASHINGTON
dialog: My eyes! My eyes!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Sorry! Sorry!
text: They make their way through, fending off whatever “obstacles”
text: are in their way. Bill and Ted turn to Rollins..
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Okay - dude - you have to tell us now..
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Why did you take our families back to
dialog: 1428?
speaker_heading: ROLLINS
dialog: It was obvious that there was no version
dialog: of you guys seeing what was right in front
dialog: of you until it was no longer right in
dialog: front of you.
text: Bill and Ted look at him - and he points - indicating..
speaker_heading: THE STAGE
dialog: Where in all directions it’s utter mayhem. Every century -
text: every epoch - crashing up against each other.
text: The Forum is shaking - a crack is forming in its ceiling.
text: Bill and Ted rise and walk on - joining Will and Theo.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What do we do?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You just play.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What do we play with?
text: Rollins opens the two cases. The boys look inside: it’s
text: Bill and Ted’s amazing guitars. The boys look at their dads.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Those are your guitars.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: They’re yours now.
text: The boys look at their moms.
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: It’s a great song, Theo. Just go ahead
dialog: and play it.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Wait. You’ve heard it?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Dozens of times.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: The thing is.. It’s kind of a.. Well, it’s
text: a bigger sound.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Yeah - it’s not really something we can
dialog: play on our own. We kind of need
dialog: everybody.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I’m not sure I know it.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It’s okay, Dad. Alls you gotta do is
dialog: follow along.
text: Bill and Ted look at each other. Nod. Pick up two other
text: guitars that Rollins is handing them..
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I think we can do that.
text: Joanna and Elizabeth sit at the drums and keyboard. Bill and
text: Ted remain just outside the limelight - but there, behind the
text: boys.. Who look at each other. Cross to center stage.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Ready, Will?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Ready, Theo.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: One..
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Two..
speaker_heading: WILL/THEO
dialog: One two three four..
text: And from the VERY FIRST NOTE of the VERY FIRST CHORD..
dialog: 97.
text: ALL AROUND THE FORUM
text: What began as the most violent, chaotic, out of control
text: Altamont-like riot becomes the greatest Woodstock-type peace
dialog: and love festival of all time.
text: Fights stop. Soldiers put down their weapons, take seats..
text: The crack in the ceiling recedes..
text: Fans start to fill in: from aisles, they take seats. Others
text: come in through the tunnels.
text: Other people are suddenly there as well:
text: Logan takes a seat up front next to the Duke and Duchess, and
text: MR. PRESTON, who nods - still bummed and lonely-looking.
text: Missy is sitting with them. Deacon joins them.
text: Bill and Ted look at each other - smile - beginning to get a
text: feel for the music. They glance at their wives.. who smile
dialog: back.
text: As the song continues.. And Will and Theo begin to pick up
dialog: their rhythm and confidence..
text: The arena continues to fill in more and more. Now there are
dialog: 2,000.. Now 4,000..
text: Rollins watches from the wings as..
text: The Forum is now full -- except for a few empty seats by
dialog: Bill’s father..
text: --until there’s a FLASH OF LIGHT and --
text: Dropping into one of the seats is..
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: MOM!?
text: MRS. PRESTON (at 75), who shimmers and drops plops down,
text: right next to Mr. Preston.
speaker_heading: MR. PRESTON
dialog: Louise! ?
text: They embrace joyfully. Then, suddenly, there are SIX QUICK
text: FLASHES and, with them - like a crazy slot machine suddenly
dialog: paying off..
text: Six more Mrs. Prestons - in ages varying from 35 to 70 - into
dialog: the same row.
speaker_heading: MR. PRESTON (CONT’D)
dialog: Louise?? Louise! ??
dialog: 98.
text: They all converge - hugging him.
text: Ted looks at Bill - who is thrilled.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You got seven moms, dude!
text: And now the music really kicks in.
dialog: And the guys’ 95 year old selves couldn’t have possibly been
dialog: more correct when they said Bill and Ted would never feel
dialog: prouder in their lives.
text: The family plays the song. The crowd is cheering, arms in
text: the air, exultant, thrilled, singing along-- present at the
text: pivotal moment of history and feeling it.
scene_heading: WIDE SHOT - THE FORUM
text: As the song rolls on, rocking the giant stadium, we cut to:
text: THE YEARS ROLLING BY
text: -- Five years into their new future, 25 year old Will and 25
text: year old Theo are joined in the garage by 50 year old Bill
text: and Ted. Joanna and Elizabeth enter with food. JUMP CUT TO:
text: Ten minutes later - the entire family is playing. All six of
text: them - with Joanna and Elizabeth on piano and drums. Jump to:
dialog: -- Ten years into the future. Same gang playing. But there
text: are TWO NEW PEOPLE: Will and Theo’s lovely young wives. Who
dialog: now join them. Cut to:
text: THANKSGIVING DINNER.. With all of them.. And Deacon, Missy,
dialog: Logan, and Bill’s 7 moms. The Duke and Duchess. And Death
text: and Rollins. And something else: TWO LITTLE GIRLS..
text: -- Fifteen years into the future. 60 year old Bill and Ted
text: with their now 5 year old GRANDDAUGHTERS on their laps.
text: Teaching them simple chords on the guitar.
dialog: Quick shots: kids growing; holidays; more music.. And
dialog: finally:
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH - 50 YEARS INTO THE FUTURE
text: 95 year old Bill and Ted, on rocking chairs, smiling, happy,
text: strumming guitars together as we PULL AWAY and see..
text: More GRANDCHILDREN sitting at their feet. And Joanna and
text: Elizabeth - 95 now, too - at their sides. Will and Theo -—
text: now 75 - with them. There are GREAT GRANDCHILDREN..
dialog: 99.
text: even GREAT GREAT GRANDCHILDREN. The lawn is full, teeming
dialog: with life.
dialog: And that voice we heard at the very beginning of the movie
text: belongs to 95 YEAR OLD BILL - who looks out, with 95 YEAR OLD
dialog: TED - at the generation upon generation of family before
dialog: them..
text: They are completing the telling of a long, long story:
scene_heading: 95 YEAR OLD BILL
dialog: And as they looked back on everything
dialog: they’d done.. Everywhere they'd been..
dialog: Everyone they’d known...
scene_heading: 95 YEAR OLD TED
dialog: There was only one word to describe it.
text: There’s a pause. The old men look at each other - then out
text: at their children and their children’s children..
text: And smile. And say - quietly - and with deep conviction:
speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: Excellent.
text: CLOSE ON BILL AND TED
text: Smiling, watching out over all of it.. with Joanna and
text: Elizabeth now sitting at their sides, holding their hands.
dialog: And then cut to:
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH - DAY
text: Empty. The rocking chairs are motionless. The house is now
dialog: silent. And we..
dialog: Fade out.
dialog: Roll credits.
text: And then, after the very last credit.. We CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SAN DIMAS - 1980 - NIGHT
text: --FLASH. The PHONE BOOTH lands in the lawn of Bill’s
dialog: childhood home. And out of it step..
text: 10 year old Bill and Ted. Who turn - sort of shell-shocked -
text: but now able to grasp the enormity of what just happened.
text: They turn. Gradually. And take in the thing that just
dialog: brought them here.. the PHONE BOOTH.
dialog: 100.
text: Wide-eyed, they look at each other.
scene_heading: 10 YR OLD BILL/TED
dialog: Whoooaaaaaa..
text: And as they’re just about to start an exuberant AIR GUITAR,
text: we CUT TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: THE END **
