dialog: with finding perishable intel,
dialog: computer disks, shit like that. But
dialog: in the master bathroom -- about the

dialog: golden dolphins for faucets -- there
dialog: was this lock-box bolted to the

dialog: cash, maybe a set of pearl-handled
dialog: pistolas, or hey, maybe some damn
dialog: fine Presidential-grade hashish. We
dialog: finally burn it open with 50-grain

dialog: “Det cord.” Nice detail.

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: CLIFF

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: But here’s the kicker: When I took
