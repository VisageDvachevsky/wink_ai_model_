scene_heading: INT. MOVING CAR - NIGHT
text: The driver is PAUL BIEGLER, His fingers tap time against the
text: steering wheel to MUSIC from the radio, In the glow from the
text: dashboard we see a pleasant looking man in his early forties -- wry,
text: humorous mouth, lean jaws, friendly eyes. He wears an old hunting
text: jacket, shirt open at the throat. Several angling lures are hooked
text: into the felt of his battered hat,

scene_heading: NN HIGHWAY - NIGHT

text: WE'RE A LIVELY TOWN
scene_heading: EXT, MAIN STREET OF IRON CITY - FULL. SHOT - NIGHT
text: The sidewalks are rolled up. A single auto is parked in front of a
text: bar identified by a blue neon sign -- TRIPOLI BAR, A traffic light
text: at an intersection futilely changes color -- kept company only by a
text: lonesome night marshal standing on the corner, From down the
text: street comes Paul's car,
scene_heading: DOOROF TRIPOLI: BAR -*:.NIGHT .
text: The white-aproned BARTENDER leans against the door jamb, watching
text: the approaching car. Inside the bar, a man and woman are hunched
text: over a table -- and at the bar stands.a solitary drinker -- an elderly
text: man,. hat cocked on the back of his head, interest absorbed by a bottle
text: on the bar. This is PARNELL, Paul's car rolls past the bar.. Paul
text: waves, calls out, ''Hi, Toivo.'"' The bartender answers Paul with a

text: himself another drink from the bottle on the bar.
speaker_heading: PARNELL
dialog: Just one more, Toivo,
text: Parnell is an erect, not quite drunk gentleman in his sixties, His hat
text: was once an expensive velvet Homburg. His jacket is good tweed but
text: worn and baggy. He wears a Tattersall vest of brilliant colors which
text: seems wonderfully right on Parnell -- a reflection of a young heart
text: and love of life. As Parnell tosses the drink off, Toive watches him
text: with a gentle compassion, Parnell now fumbles in his various pockets
dialog: for some money.
speaker_heading: PARNELL
dialog: (continues)
dialog: Toivo, I'm afraid I'm going to have to
dialog: pay my bar bill tomorrow.
dialog: Too... 2
dialog: You're good with me, Mr. McCarthy,-- —-—... -—-_.

dialog: Good night, Mr. McCarthy.
scene_heading: EXT, PAUL'S HOME AND OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Qn the main street -- the lights of the business district in the distance,
text: Paul's car approaches the old, two-storied house -= swings into the
text: driveway. In CLOSE SHOT the headlights catch his shingle fastened
text: to.a support post on the front porch, It reads: PAUL BIEGLER -
text: ‘ATTY, AT LAW, The headlights go out. Paul climbs from the car,
text: bringing with him a collapsed fly rod, a knapsack and a trout basket,
text: In the darkness he comes up the steps, fumbles into the mail box for
text: the door key, opens the door, flips the light switch inside.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - PAUL'S HOME AND OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Lighted by a shaded bulb hanging from the ceiling, the sparsely
text: furnished foyer ~~ an umbrella stand by the door and a limp,
text: artificial potted plant. A flight of stairs rises to the second floor.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The hallway runs past the stairs to the rear of the house. In the
text: f.g. a piece of white note paper is speared on one of the points of a
text: deer's antlers, which, attached to the wall, serve as a hat rack.
text: In the b. g. Paul has entered, closed the door behind him with a
text: practiced kick. He comes to the antlers, cocks his head sideways
text: to read the note. His lips move a little as he reads.
scene_heading: INT. PAUL'S PRIVATE OFFICE - NIGHT
text: A darkened interior, At an angle we look through an open door which
text: leads into the dark outer office. In the outer office another open door
text: leads into the lighted hallway. Paul is seen in the hallway reading
text: the note on the antlers. Not disturbing the note, he enters the outer
text: office, passes through into the private office. He turns on a standing
text: lamp. Illuminated, this office is quite a large room -- was once.a
text: dining room. The walls are lined with law books. There isa
text: cluttered, roll-top desk and swivel desk chair, Grouped about the
text: desk are several other assorted chairs. Against one wall is an
text: ancient black leather couch and on a small safe in a corner a portable
text: record player with a well-stocked album rack. Near the safe is an old
text: upright piano against the wall, the panel missing, revealing its
text: musical works. The round dining table, left over from times past,
text: is stacked with law books and legal journals. Paul deposits his
text: fishing gear on the table, lifts a brown paper sack from his coat ,
text: pocket, stands it on the table. The sack contains the shape of a
text: bottle. He opens a closet door, and on the inside of the door is fixed
text: a canvas panel on which are fastened myriad trout lures. Paul
text: removes the lures from his hat, hooks them into the canvas, The
text: last is a brightly colored Royal Coachman. He affectionately blows
text: on its pretty feathers before fastening it to the panel. Now he tosses
text: his hat into the closet, closes the door, gets his trout basket,
text: brushes through a swinging door into the kitchen,
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: _As.he enters, he lights the room. There are no built-in modern.
dialog: ‘cabinets here. This kitchen,..like the rest of the house, belongs to
text: another period. There is an antique kitchen cabinet, a sink with
text: wooden drainboar d and brass fixtures, a sanded kitchen table anda
text: kerosene stove of early vintage. “Alone in'modern splendor is a big,
text: upright freezer. Paul takes a half-dozen trout from his basket,
text: plops them on the table. He removes his hunting jacket, takes a
text: knife from a drawer, sets about cleaning the fish. Now he remembers
text: the note on the antlers. Wiping his hands on a towel, he goes through
text: another door in the kitchen which leads into the hallway.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Paul comes from the back of the hallway to the antlers, picks off
text: the note and goes again into the outer office.

scene_heading: EXT, THUNDER BAY TOURIST PARK - NIGHT
text: On the outside of a small, darkened hut a dimly illuminated sign
text: reads: THUNDER BAY PARK - OFFICE. Beyond and scattered
text: along a narrow road are the shapes of darkened house trailers --
text: autos parked beside therm. At the end of the road a wide lake
text: shimmers in the moonlight. In the hut.a telephone TINKLES faintly.
text: -& light goes on in the hut and through the window we see an elderly
text: man come from a back room wearing his bathrobe. This is Mr.
text: LEMON, the park caretaker and deputy sheriff. He answers the phone
text: on the wall -- listens -- replies -- leaves the phone dangling, comes
text: outside the hut -- flashlight in hand -- hurries away to disappear
text: among the trailers.
scene_heading: ANOTHER PART OF TOURIST PARK - NIGHT
text: Lemon comes through trees, flashlight beam leading the way,
text: approaching a trailer in the f.g. The trailer has a striped awning
text: over the front door, a couple of canvas chairs outside the stoop.
text: Light shines through the broad picture window on the front end of
text: the trailer, The CAMERA LOOKS through the picture window into
text: the living room of the trailer. A folding table is littered with cheap
text: magazines, a half empty bottle of whiskey, and several glasses. A
text: bra. hangs on the back.of the chair and.an army officer's cap and
text: acket are hooked ‘to’a nail in the wall. ‘A woman's negligee hangs
text: from a corner of an open closet door, and on the floor, below the
text: negligee, are a pair of blue-puffed bed slippers. Beyond the living
text: room is the passage way which also serves as a kitchen. At the end
text: of the passage way we glimpse an unmade bed. The effectis not of
text: squalor -- but rather of sensual carelessness. Mr. Lemon has
text: reached the trailer and we hear him rap on the door several times.
text: Now the door opens and Lemon thrusts his head into the trailer.
text: He calls, "Mrs. Manion?" Satisfied she is not there he closes the

text: In Lieutenant Manion's case, a soldier,
