scene_heading: INT. PAUL’S APARTMENT. BEDROOM - DAY
scene_heading: BLINDING WHITENESS
text: We hear a MAN GASPING softly. Rhythmically.
text: A LUMINOUS PALE SHAPE slowly forms out of the searing
text: whiteness. Gradually we realize we’re moving across the
text: ALABASTER BODY of a WOMAN. Her skin translucent.
scene_heading: ON THE WOMAN'S FACE
text: Ethereal. Her eyes closed. Her face lifeless. Then...
text: ..-her eyes open. She looks straight at us with unseeing
text: pale blue eyes. This is ANNA (late 20s).
text: We pull back. PAUL (30s) makes love to Anna. Their
text: movements perfunctory. Passionless. He turns to look at
text: her. Realizes she’s not there. He suddenly stops.
text: Rolls off her. Sits on the edge of the bed.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Nothing.
text: Anna leans down and picks up her RED SLIP from the floor.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (sighs wearily)
dialog: You used to enjoy it. Now it’s...
text: He shakes his head. Frustrated. Lights a cigarette.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: ...it's like fucking a corpse.
text: Paul immediately realizes he’s gone too far. Turns to Anna.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Shit. I’m sorry. That was--
text: Anna gets out of bed. Walks towards the bathroom. Paul
text: puts his head in his hands.
scene_heading: INT. PAUL’S APARTMENT. BATHROOM —- MOMENTS LATER
text: Through the fogged shower partition we see the blurred
text: ghostly figure of Anna. Paul walks in.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Anna. I’m sorry. That was a stupid
dialog: thing to say. But you know sometimes...
dialog: sometimes it’s like you’re not here
dialog: anymore. Like you're somewhere else.
text: Anna doesn’t reply.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Is this about us?
speaker_heading: ON ANNA
text: her head bowed as she lets the water wash over her.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: It’s not about us.
speaker_heading: PAUL (0.C.)
dialog: Then what is it?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: PAUL (0.C.)
dialog: I just want us to be happy.
text: Anna doesn't move. We sense the emptiness inside her.
speaker_heading: PAUL (0.C.)
dialog: Are you happy?
text: She closes her eyes. Forces herself to reply.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’m happy.
scene_heading: A DROP OF BLOOD
text: falls into the water. Then another drop.
speaker_heading: ON ANNA
text: her nose is bleeding. She touches her lips. Looks
text: impassively at the blood on her fingertips. The SOUND OF
text: WATER carries into the next scene...
text: FADE TO WHITE.
text: A STREAM OF CRYSTAL BLUE WATER
text: A MAN’S HANDS penetrate the water. Thin and elegant.
text: Perfectly manicured. Turning slowly as he washes them
text: meticulously. He picks up a crisply folded white towel.
text: Dries his hands carefully. Snaps on white latex gloves.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - MORNING
text: A beautiful morning. We move through a tranquil cemetery.
text: Pastoral and idyllic. Dappled light falls through old
text: trees onto statues of grieving angels.
scene_heading: EXT. FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS
text: A path leads to an old well-kept house. Amongst a blaze of
text: violet tulips we see a sign: Eliot Deane. Funeral Home.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. CASKET DISPLAY ROOM - MORNING
text: Sun streams into an elegant wood-panelled room. The
scene_heading: Funeral Director, ELIOT DEANE (40s) guides MRS. AYRES
text: (70s) past caskets tastefully arranged on faux-marble
text: pedestals. He’s a serene man. Quiet and professional.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
text: The Antique Carlisle. Solid cherry.
dialog: (strokes the wood lovingly)
text: Hand rubbed satin finish. Tufted
dialog: sovereign interior. Eternal-Rest
text: adjustable mattress with matching pillow.
text: He gestures to a metal casket.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Or perhaps the Aegean? Solid bronze
text: exterior. Hand brushed finish with
text: Grecian bronze highlights.
scene_heading: MRS. AYRES
dialog: The Antique Carlisle. Definitely the
dialog: Antique Carlisle.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: (writes in his notebook)
dialog: Excellent choice.
text: Mrs. Ayres caresses the soft velvet trimming.
scene_heading: MRS. AYRES
text: An antique coffin for an antique lady.
dialog: We suit each other.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: You'll look beautiful.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now about the service. Would you like a
dialog: private visitation?
text: Mrs. Ayres is miles away.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Mrs. Ayres?
scene_heading: MRS. AYRES
dialog: I’m sorry. Yes. A private visitation.
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: Mr. Deane? What happens when we die?
text: Eliot chooses his words carefully.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: It’s different every time. Each person
text: dies in their own way.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. ANNA’S CAR - MORNING
text: Anna drives past the strip malls of a small suburban town
text: in a GREEN TOYOTA. On the dashboard a KITSCHY BOBBLEHEAD
text: DOLL nods its head from side to side. Anna pulls up to a
text: red light. Glances across at the other cars. We see the
text: vacant faces of COMMUTERS staring blankly into space.
text: The light changes. Anna hasn’t noticed. The car behind
text: her HONKS in frustration. She quickly pulls out...
text: ++. just as a SUV turns in front of her. She slams on
text: her brakes. Hard. Missing the SUV by inches. The
text: DRIVER screams at her. His face contorted in ugly rage.
scene_heading: EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. PARKING LOT - MORNING
text: Anna locks her car. Heads towards the main building.
scene_heading: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - MORNING
text: Classes have started. JACK (11), a serious looking boy,
text: walks through a silent corridor. Up ahead two OLDER
text: BOYS, a TALL KID and a KID with ACNE, push a GEEKY BOY
text: against a locker. Jack tries to pass by unnoticed.
speaker_heading: TALL KID
dialog: Hey. Jack-off!
text: Jack walks faster. The two Older Boys set off after him.
text: He darts into a corridor. Ducks into an empty classroom.
scene_heading: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. BIOLOGY CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Jack waits anxiously by the door. It looks like he’s
text: lost the bullies. Then a sudden rustling noise makes him
text: jump. He turns. TINY CHICKS huddle in a plastic
text: incubator on a table. Jack moves over to them.
speaker_heading: TALL KID (0.C.)
dialog: Didn’t you hear me Jack-off?
text: Jack swivels round. The Tall Kid walks towards him as
text: the Acne Kid guards the door. Jack doesn’t reply.
speaker_heading: ACNE KID
dialog: He must be deaf.
speaker_heading: TALL KID
dialog: You deaf Jack-off?
text: Jack ignores them. Irritating the Tall Kid even more.
speaker_heading: TALL KID
dialog: Can’t fucking speak either.
text: He pushes Jack against the table, toppling the incubator.
text: Panicked, the CHICKS scatter across the surface. Just
text: then the door opens. Anna walks in.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What's going on?
text: She glances at the Older Boys then at Jack.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Jack?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Nothing Miss Bryant.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Nothing? The incubator didn’t just
dialog: fall by itself.
text: The Older Boys stare at Jack. Waiting for his reaction.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I tripped. It was an accident.
text: Anna looks at Jack carefully. She knows he’s lying.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (to the Older Boys)
dialog: Show’s over. Get to your classes.
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: Jack. Help me clear up.
text: Jack doesn’t hear her. He’s mesmerized by a SOLITARY
text: CHICK standing motionless in the corner of the incubator.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I think it’s dead.
text: Anna reaches in. Tenderly picks up the chick.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No. The poor thing’s just scared.
scene_heading: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. TEACHERS’ COMMON ROOM —- DAY
text: School’s over. Anna listlessly corrects a stack of
text: exercise books. She can’t focus. Pulls out a BOTTLE OF
text: PILLS. Shakes a pill into her hand. Swallows it dry.
scene_heading: INT. LAW OFFICE. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: Paul works with half a dozen COLLEAGUES around a large
text: conference table covered with documents and thick files.
text: He reaches across to a pizza box. It’s empty.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: OK. Who took the last pepperoni?
text: A PREPPY GUY slides across another pizza box.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Great. Broccoli.
dialog: (lifts out a slice)
dialog: Who the fuck ordered broccoli?
text: NEAL, a thin pallid guy, looks up.
speaker_heading: NEAL
dialog: Oh that’s just disgusting.
speaker_heading: PREPPY GUY
dialog: What's wrong with vegetarian pizza? It’s
dialog: healthy.
speaker_heading: NEAL
dialog: Pizza isn’t supposed to be healthy.
text: Paul glances at his watch. Suddenly realizes the time.
text: He quickly picks up his cell phone. Heads for the door.
speaker_heading: NEAL
dialog: You ordering in another pizza?
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: Yeah. With wheatgrass and alfalfa sprouts.
text: Everyone laughs.
speaker_heading: PREPPY GUY
dialog: (mutters )
dialog: Yeah. Yeah. Smart asses.
scene_heading: INT. LAW OFFICE. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Paul walks into the corridor dialling his cell phone.
scene_heading: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. TEACHERS’ COMMON ROOM - SAME TIME
text: Anna’s cell phone rings as she closes her locker. She
text: fishes it out from her bag as she heads to the door.
text: Checks the ID. Hesitates. Then takes the call.
scene_heading: INT. LAW OFFICE. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME
text: Paul cups his cell. Worried he'll be overheard.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hi baby. I’m really sorry about this
dialog: morning. I fucked up. I know.
scene_heading: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME
text: Anna steps into an empty corridor.
speaker_heading: PAUL (0.S.)
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: We still on for tonight?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Anna?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I don’t know Paul.
scene_heading: INT. LAW OFFICE. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME
text: Paul’s anxious. We sense he’s hiding something.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Please Anna. It took me weeks to get the
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: ANNA (0.S.)
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: Maybe we can change it to Thursday--
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No. It has to be tonight.
speaker_heading: ANNA (0.S.)
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: Paul? What’s the matter?
text: Paul tries hard to cover his nervousness. Forces a smile.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Nothing. Don’t worry. I just need... I
dialog: just want us to have dinner tonight.
scene_heading: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME
text: Despite Paul’s reassurances Anna is clearly worried now.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: PAUL (0.S.)
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: Great.
scene_heading: INT. LAW OFFICE. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME
text: Paul hesitates. Lowers his voice.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: And Anna. Everything’s going to be fine.
speaker_heading: ANNA (0.S.)
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: Promise?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I promise.
scene_heading: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Anna slips her phone back into her bag as she walks
text: through the deserted corridor. Her high heels echo
text: loudly in the eerie quietness.
text: Suddenly one of the fluorescent ceiling lights behind her
text: blows out with a loud WHUMPH. Anna starts. Turns.
text: WHUMPH. The next light dies. Anna quickens her step.
text: The lights go off one by one. The darkness quickly
text: creeping up behind her. There’s only one light still on
text: as she reaches the exit. She looks up. The light
text: flickers. But then strangely stays on. Bathing her ina
text: cold pool of light.
text: Anna’s unsettled. She turns and frantically pushes the
text: door. It doesn’t open. She pushes hard with both hands.
text: Nothing. It’s locked. She turns back slowly. The
text: darkness around her impenetrable. Almost viscous. She
text: reaches out...
text: ... her hand DISAPPEARS into the thick blackness. Anna
text: snatches her hand back. Stares at it.
text: Then we hear the sound of SLOW FOOTSTEPS. Moving
text: deliberately towards her.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: Hello?
text: Her voice echoes down the silent corridor. She glimpses
text: something move in the blackness.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Is someone there?
text: A BLACK SHAPE materializes inside the darkness. Silent.
text: Brooding. Anna can’t move. Terrified. Suddenly the
text: corridor’s flooded with a BLINDING WHITE LIGHT.
text: Anna's dazzled. Shades her eyes with her hand. As she
text: tentatively pulls her hand away...
text: ...it’s only Jack. His hand on the light switch.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Jack!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Did I scare you Miss Bryant?
text: Jack moves over to the door.
speaker_heading: ANNA
text: It’s locked.
text: He gently pushes against the door. The door slowly opens.
scene_heading: EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER
text: Anna, still shaken, walks with Jack towards the parking lot.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Shouldn’t you be home?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: My mom’s picking me up.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It’s my birthday. We're going to
dialog: MacDonald’s. Then on Saturday my mom’s
dialog: taking me to Busch Gardens. We’re
text: going to ride the Alpengeist.
dialog: (earnestly)
dialog: Continually voted one of the top ten roller
dialog: coaster rides in America, the Alpengeist is
text: a breathtaking avalanche of adventure.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (tries to keep a straight-face)
dialog: I didn’t know the park was open yet.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: My mom’s friends with the manager.
dialog: They’re opening it specially for me.
text: She knows he’s lying again. Smiles sadly.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Sounds like fun.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yes. It will be fun.
dialog: 10.
text: They reach Anna’s car. Stand in silence for a moment.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Jack. Those boys. Do they bother you
dialog: a lot?
text: Jack hesitates. Then slowly nods his head.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You know you can always talk to me about
dialog: it if you want to.
text: He nods. Anna‘’s clearly worried about him.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You sure you don’t need a ride?
text: Jack shakes his head. Anna glances at her watch.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Well. I better run.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: I have to go to a funeral. My old piano
dialog: teacher.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (with sudden interest)
dialog: Can I come?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No Jack. Funerals are very private
dialog: affairs.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I’ve never been to a funeral.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: It wouldn’t be appropriate Jack. Anyway
dialog: wouldn’t your mom worry about you?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (shrugs )
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’m sure she would. I’11 see you
dialog: tomorrow in class. Have a wonderful
dialog: birthday.
text: Jack nods disappointed. Anna watches him walk away then
text: gets in her car.
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: INT. ANNA’S CAR —- MOMENTS LATER
text: Anna slips her key into the ignition. Loud music suddenly
text: blares from the car radio. She switches it off. Squeezes
text: the bridge of her nose. She pulls out a bottle of pills
text: from her bag. It’s empty. She rummages in the glove
text: compartment. Finds another bottle. Empty. She sighs.
scene_heading: EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER
text: Jack sits on the bench. Watches Anna drive away. Then
text: unzips his backpack. Something moves inside. A strange
text: jerky movement. Jack closes the backpack. Glances up
text: and down the empty street. Then walks away on his own.
scene_heading: EXT. STRIP MALL. PHARMACY - DAY
text: Anna steps out of the Pharmacy. As she washes down a pill
text: with a bottle of water she notices a small Hair Salon.
text: Looks critically at herself in the Pharmacy window.
text: Anna moves over to the Salon. Reaches for the door
text: handle... then hesitates. She’s about to walk away when
text: the Salon door suddenly opens. Anna smiles shyly as a
text: freshly COIFFURED WOMAN politely holds the door for her.
scene_heading: INT. HAIR SALON - DAY
text: Anna leans back against a washbasin. Her neck tightly
text: cradled against the white porcelain. The light's harsh
text: and not particularly flattering. She closes her eyes.
text: Behind her the HANDS of a HAIRDRESSER in latex gloves
text: begin to rinse dye from Anna’s hair.
speaker_heading: ON SINK
text: Startling white. A stream of water flows into the sink.
text: Then after a moment the spiralling clear water gradually
text: turns a deep crimson red.
scene_heading: INT. MOTHER’S HOUSE. HALLWAY - DAY
text: Anna closes the front door behind her. She smiles as
text: she catches her reflection in the hallway mirror. Her
text: hair a dark vibrant red. Just then, from another room,
text: we hear an OLD WOMAN'S hacking cough.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN (0.S.)
dialog: Anna? Is that you?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes Mother.
dialog: 12.
scene_heading: INT. MOTHER’S HOUSE. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Anna's mother, BEATRICE (50s), sits in bed, knitting with
text: swift, violent precision. The bedside table’s stacked
text: with medication. She’s clearly been bed-ridden for some
text: time. An electric wheelchair in the corner of the room.
text: Anna appears at the door. Beatrice scrutinizes her for a
text: second. Then returns to her knitting.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
text: Terrible color.
text: Anna moves to the beside table. Picks up a dirty plate.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Can I get you something to eat?
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: I’m not hungry.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You have to eat.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: I don’t have to do anything.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: The doctor said--
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: The doctor’s an idiot. He doesn’t know
dialog: what he’s talking about.
text: Anna sighs. Trying hard not to let her Mother provoke
text: her. Beatrice glances up. Anna avoids her look.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: Why did you do it? Today of all days.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What have I done wrong this time?
text: Anna goes to the window. Draws back the curtains.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: You've forgotten haven’t you?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No I haven’t forgotten. The service
dialog: isn’t till six.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: Then you’ve got plenty of time to wash it
dialog: out.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: It’s permanent. You can’t wash it out.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: Then dye it back. You can’t show up at
dialog: the funeral looking like that. Like some
dialog: prostitute.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I don’t look--
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: Don’t argue with me. Why are you
dialog: constantly arguing with me?
text: Anna bites her tongue. Heads to the door.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: To do the washing up.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: The sheets need changing. They haven’t
dialog: been changed in months.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I changed them Monday.
text: Anna goes to the cupboard. Takes out clean sheets.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: You weren’t here Monday. You never sleep
dialog: at home anymore. What if something
dialog: happened to me in the middle of the night?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Nothing is going to happen to you.
dialog: Anyway Diane--
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: (snorts)
dialog: Fat lot of good she is. I wouldn’t have
dialog: to pay for a Nurse if my only daughter
dialog: wasn’t living in sin with that lawyer of
dialog: hers. Doing God knows what. They always
dialog: leave you in the end. You'll see. Just
dialog: like your father--
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: That’s enough Mother!
text: Anna dumps the sheets on the bed. As she turns to leave
text: Beatrice’s hand darts out and grabs Anna’s wrist.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: That’s it. Go and cry to Paul.
dialog: 14.
text: Anna pulls herself free. Moves to the door.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: Go and bitch to Paul about your mean old
dialog: mother.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - DAY
text: A warm intimate room. Peaceful. Rows of chairs filled
text: with ELDERLY MOURNERS. Eliot stands respectfully beside
text: a casket. FATHER GRAHAM (50s) reads at a lectern.
speaker_heading: FATHER GRAHAM
dialog: We have entrusted our brother James
dialog: Hutton to God's mercy in sure and...
scene_heading: EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Anna, in a black dress, walks quickly along the gravel
text: driveway. She stops. Stares out over the cemetery.
speaker_heading: FATHER GRAHAM (0.S.)
dialog: ...certain hope of the resurrection to
dialog: eternal life through our Lord Jesus
dialog: Christ, who died and rose again for us.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Anna slips into the back of the room. Eliot leads MRS.
text: HUTTON (60s) to the body of her husband, JAMES HUTTON
text: (70S), lying in the casket. Mrs. Hutton touches a
text: bouquet of white roses by the casket.
speaker_heading: MRS. HUTTON
dialog: White roses. They were his favorite.
dialog: How did you know?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: They just seemed appropriate somehow.
speaker_heading: MRS. HUTTON
text: He looks so peaceful. As if he's only
dialog: sleeping.
text: Anna approaches Mrs. Hutton. She doesn’t notice Eliot
text: watching her carefully.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Mrs. Hutton. I'm so sorry.
speaker_heading: MRS. HUTTON
dialog: Thank you Anna. You were always his
dialog: favorite student.
dialog: 15.
text: Anna smiles awkwardly. Uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: MRS. HUTTON
dialog: How’s your mother?
speaker_heading: ANNA
text: Fine. She sends her condolences.
speaker_heading: MRS. HUTTON
dialog: You look tired dear.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No. I’m fine. Everything’s fine.
text: But we can see in her eyes that everything’s not fine.
text: Mrs. Hutton nods, then turns to greet another MOURNER.
text: Anna steps nervously up to the coffin.
speaker_heading: ANNA'S POV
text: James Hutton lies peacefully amongst the velvet trimming.
text: Suddenly his LIPS PART... as he GASPS SOFTLY.
speaker_heading: VIEWING ROOM
text: Anna steps back terrified. Stares at Hutton. His face
text: serene again. It must have been her imagination. She
text: glances up quickly. Embarrassed.
text: Eliot’s still observing her. He nods to her cordially.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT’S ROOM - DAY
text: A spartan room at the top of the house. Eliot carefully
text: pins a POLAROID of Hutton lying in a coffin to the wall.
text: Next to Hutton’s photograph, we briefly glimpse the edge
text: of ANOTHER POLAROID.
text: Eliot stares intently at Hutton’s image for a moment,
text: then takes off his jacket and moves to the window.
speaker_heading: ELIOT’S POV
text: Anna’s by her car rummaging in a bag for her keys.
text: Getting increasingly frustrated.
scene_heading: EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - DAY
text: Anna suddenly looses it. Angrily dumps the contents of
text: her bag onto the driveway. She kneels down. Grabs the
text: keys. Throws the rest of her things back into the bag.
text: She stands. Leans against the car. She looks weary.
text: She glances up at the sky desperately trying to hold back
text: her tears. Black storm clouds gather on the horizon.
dialog: 16.
text: Anna brusquely wipes away her eyes with the back of her
text: hand. Pulls herself together. Angry with herself.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT’S ROOM - DAY
text: Eliot watches intently as Anna drives away.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - EVENING
text: Paul sits at a window table. It's raining hard outside.
text: He glances at his watch then nervously checks his
text: pockets. Pulls out a RING BOX. He looks at it for a
text: moment then slips it back into his pocket.
text: As he refills his glass, Anna appears outside holding her
text: raincoat above her head. She stares at Paul for a moment
text: through the window marbled with rain.
text: Paul suddenly notices Anna at the window. He starts.
text: Spills some of his red wine on his shirt.
text: CLOSE on the red stain. It unfurls like a flower.
text: Spreading out over the white material.
speaker_heading: ANNA (0.C.)
dialog: Sorry about that.
text: Paul dabs the stain with a napkin.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You scared the life out of me.
text: Anna laughs as she sits down. Paul looks up at her.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Your hair.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You don't like it.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I didn't say that. It's just very...
dialog: red. I mean it's not really you is it?
text: A WAITER appears at the table before Anna can reply.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Are you ready to order?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes. We'll have the duck.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Paul.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What? You always have the duck here.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (picks up the menu)
dialog: I don't always have the duck.
text: Paul shrugs. Pours Anna some wine as she looks through
text: the menu. The Waiter taps his pen on his pad
text: impatiently. Anna sighs. Puts the menu aside.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'll have the duck.
text: Paul smiles as the Waiter leaves. Anna tries to ignore
text: him. But after a second she can't help smiling back.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: The duck is very good.
text: Anna's smile broadens. The tension between them broken
text: for the moment. Paul reaches across. Touches her hand.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Let’s not argue tonight. OK?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: OK.
text: Anna takes a sip of wine.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: This is good.
text: She picks up the bottle. Checks the label.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: And looks very expensive...
dialog: (smiles questioningly)
dialog: What’s the special occasion?
text: Paul’s momentarily thrown. He tries to cover it by
text: rearranging his napkin. Anna notices.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (suddenly very serious)
dialog: Actually there is something I need to
dialog: talk to you about.
text: Now Anna’s nervous.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I’ve been offered a transfer to head
dialog: office in Chicago.
text: Anna looks down. Stares at her hands on the table.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It’‘ll mean more work of course. More
dialog: responsibility. A lot of changes. But
dialog: it’s an incredible opportunity. I’d be
dialog: crazy to turn it down. And...
dialog: (nervous )
dialog: ---well I’ve been thinking. Maybe it’s
dialog: time for us to...
text: Paul pauses as he reaches inside his jacket.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (without looking up)
dialog: You’re going to leave me.
text: Paul’s stunned. Speechless. Before he can say anything--
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You could've just told me this morning.
dialog: You didn’t need to buy me off with an
dialog: expensive meal.
text: Paul reaches for her hand. Anna gets up to leave.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Anna wait.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Why did you lie to me? You promised
dialog: everything was going to be OK.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (increasingly frustrated)
dialog: Don’t be ridiculous. Anna. You’ve got
dialog: it all wrong.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’m not being ridiculous. Why do you
dialog: always talk to me like I'm a small child?
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: (as if talking to a small child)
dialog: Anna.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: See? There you go again. Do you know
dialog: how irritating that is?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (loses it)
dialog: Jesus. Can't we just have one fucking
dialog: meal without arguing--
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Fuck you!
text: The other DINERS turn and stare at them. Paul glances at
text: them embarrassed. Anna doesn’t notice. Upset.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Keep your voice down, everyone’s watching.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: FUCK YOU!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You’re crazy. You know that? Just like
dialog: your mother.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’m nothing like my mother!
text: Anna grabs her coat. Pushes her way through the restaurant.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (stands)
dialog: I’m not running after you this time Anna.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Good.
text: Paul’s suddenly aware that everyone’s looking at him. He
text: quickly sits down. Drains his glass of wine. Furious.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. ANNA’S CAR - NIGHT
text: Anna closes the car door. It’s still raining hard outside.
text: Her hair, perfect minutes ago, is now bedraggled. Her make-
text: up’s running. She places her hands on the steering wheel.
text: Trying desperately to pull herself together.
text: Suddenly. THUMP. Anna jumps. Turns. Paul’s at the car
text: window. He thumps the glass again. Anna hits the locks.
scene_heading: EXT. RESTAURANT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
text: Paul grabs the door handle.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Anna. Open the door. Please. I want
dialog: you to come with me. I want to...
scene_heading: INT/EXT. ANNA’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: Anna can’t hear him above the sound of the RAIN HAMMERING
text: onto the car. She shakes her head. Puts the car in drive.
scene_heading: EXT. RESTAURANT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
text: Paul stumbles aside as Anna’s car pulls away. She stops
text: at the parking lot exit a short distance away.
dialog: 20.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. ANNA’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: Anna looks up into the rearview mirror.
scene_heading: ON REARVIEW MIRROR
text: Paul stands forlornly in the rain. Their eyes meet.
speaker_heading: ANNA'S CAR
text: She hesitates. For a moment we think she might go back
dialog: to him...
scene_heading: EXT. RESTAURANT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
text: +--+. but then Anna pulls out and drives away. Leaving Paul
text: alone in the parking lot. The rain pounding the asphalt.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. ANNA’S CAR. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: Anna peers through the blurred windshield as the wipers
text: battle with the TORRENTIAL DOWNPOUR. A LARGE TRUCK plows
text: past menacingly on the rain-slicked highway.
text: Anna’s still upset. She wipes away her tears. On the
text: dashboard the kitschy doll bobs its head from side to
text: side. Anna picks up her cell phone. Glances down as she
text: dials a number. She looks up...
text: a WHITE VAN with black tinted windows cuts in front of her.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Shit!
text: Anna swerves into the next lane. We hear the blaring
text: horn from the car behind her.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (into rear-view mirror)
dialog: OK. OK. I saw you.
dialog: (muttering)
dialog: Jerk.
text: The cell phone connects. We hear Paul’s answering machine.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Paul? You home yet? Can you pick up? I
dialog: just don’t want it to end like this.
text: Anna drops the phone into her bag on the passenger seat.
text: Wipes away the mist on the inside of the glass.
text: A TRACTOR TRAILER shudders past loaded with metal pipes.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: ON METAL PIPES
text: The badly loaded pipes BANG OMINOUSLY against each other.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT’S ROOM - EARLY MORNING
text: Darkness. A bright light comes on.
text: CLOSE ON a MAN'S HANDS. Turning slowly under a stream of
text: crystal blue water. We pull back. Eliot dries his hands.
text: Opens a cabinet. Takes out a pair of latex gloves.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - EARLY MORNING
text: A large room. Tall vaulted ceilings. White tiles. Soft
text: morning light seeps in from a small round window set high
text: on one wall. The room is silent. Still. Like a chapel.
text: In the semi-darkness we see a BODY on a porcelain slab
text: covered with a white sheet.
text: We hear a key turn in a lock. Then another lock. The
text: room’s suddenly flooded with a harsh white light.
text: Eliot steps inside the room. He takes off his jacket.
text: Carefully places it on a coat-hanger. Puts on a pale
text: blue smock then snaps on the latex gloves. His every
text: move meticulous. Measured. Like a ritual.
text: Eliot walks over to the slab, his surgery clogs softly
text: clacking against the tiled floor. He looks at the slab
text: for a moment then slowly pulls the sheet away
dialog: revealing...
text: ANNA'S BODY. Pale and lifeless. An ugly gash above her
text: eyebrow. Cracked violet lips. A rip in her black dress
text: soaked with a dark stain. She’s only wearing one shoe.
text: Eliot gently takes off the watch from her stiff wrist.
text: Places it inside a brown paper bag. Eases off the shoe.
text: Picks up a scalpel from a tray of instruments on a steel
text: trolley. Delicately slices open her dress. Peels it off.
text: He's about to cut the straps of her RED SLIP when...
text: Anna OPENS HER EYES.
text: She looks straight at us with unseeing pale blue eyes.
text: Strangely Eliot's not surprised. He calmly steps back.
text: Watches her carefully.
text: Anna’s eyes slowly focus on Eliot. She’s groggy. Confused.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Where am I?
text: She talks with difficulty. Her breathe labored.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You're in a funeral home.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You’re dead.
text: Anna’s vacant eyes widen in shock. She struggles to sit
text: up but she can’t even raise her head. Her body stiff.
text: Rigid. Eliot speaks to her calmly. Soothingly.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You had a car accident. It was raining.
dialog: You hit a truck loaded with metal pipes.
text: She looks fearfully at the bloodied dress in Eliot’s hand.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’m not dead.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You were pronounced dead eight hours ago.
dialog: Your blood no longer circulates through
dialog: your body. Your brain cells are slowly
dialog: dying. Your body’s already decomposing.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’m not dead.
text: Eliot looks at her sadly for a moment. He places the
text: bloodied dress on the trolley. Then picks up a document.
text: Holds it up for her.
speaker_heading: ON DOCUMENT
dialog: It’s Anna’s death certificate.
speaker_heading: ELIOT (0.C.)
dialog: This is your death certificate. Cause of
text: death. Massive internal trauma. Time of
dialog: death. 8.23PM.
speaker_heading: PREP ROOM
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You were dead on arrival. The attending
dialog: physician signed here...
dialog: (points to document)
dialog: -.-at 9.45 last night. I picked up your
text: body from the hospital morgue at 12.10
dialog: this morning.
text: Anna stares with horror at her death certificate, then at
text: Eliot. He looks away. It pains him to see her so
text: distressed.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I’m sorry.
text: Eliot picks up a sponge from the trolley. Wets it.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Who are you?
text: Eliot delicately washes Anna’s face. She doesn’t flinch
text: as he dabs the wound above her eye brow.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Don’t touch me! Why are you touching me?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I’m preparing your body. You have to
dialog: look beautiful for your funeral.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’m not dead.
text: Eliot sighs wearily. As if he’d had this conversation
dialog: many times before.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You all say the same thing.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I’m sorry. Maybe you should rest now.
text: Eliot peels off his latex gloves and heads for the door.
text: As he hangs his pale blue smock on the peg he turns and
text: looks at Anna for a moment.
speaker_heading: ON ANNA
text: The lights go off. 0O.S. the door clicks shut as it locks
text: automatically behind Eliot.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (softly)
dialog: I can’t be dead. It’s just a nightmare.
dialog: I’ll wake up soon. Wake up.
scene_heading: INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Paul wakes up. Badly hung-over. Still in his clothes.
text: Sunlight streams into the room. Blinding him. He
text: reaches across. The bed's empty. He’s surprised for a
text: moment then remembers the argument the night before.
text: He gets up. Sits on the edge of the bed. Lights a
text: cigarette. He notices his jacket on the floor. lLeans
text: down. As he pulls out the BlackBerry from his jacket, the
text: RING BOX falls onto the floor. Paul doesn’t notice.
dialog: 24.
scene_heading: INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - LATER
text: Paul steps into the kitchen. Nervously checking his
text: BlackBerry. Nothing. Just then he sees the red light
text: blinking on his answer machine. He presses play.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Paul? You home yet? Can you pick up? I
dialog: just don’t want it to end like this.
text: Paul’s relieved. He picks up the phone. Dials. We hear
text: the ringing on the other end.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL MORGUE - SAME TIME
text: Two technicians, an OLD GUY and his YOUNG PALE ASSISTANT,
text: push a NAKED BODY wrapped in plastic through the morgue.
text: They jump as they hear the MUFFLED sound of a cell phone.
text: The ringing comes from a bag speckled with blood lying on
text: a table (we recognize it as Anna’s bag). The Assistant
text: walks over. Takes out the cell phone.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
text: It’s the schoolteacher’s. From the car
dialog: crash. Should I answer it?
text: The ringing stops abruptly. It’s suddenly very silent.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: Someone's in for a surprise.
speaker_heading: OLD GUY
dialog: How many times do I have to tell you? You
dialog: can’t leave their stuff laying around. It
dialog: should've been returned to the family.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: I’ve been busy, OK.
dialog: (muttering)
dialog: Like she’s really going to need her
text: rollover minutes now.
text: As the Assistant reaches for the bag, he notices a
text: solitary shoe on the table. He picks it up.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: What shall I do with this?
speaker_heading: OLD GUY
dialog: Where’s the other one?
text: The Assistant looks round. He can’t see the other shoe
text: anywhere. He turns to the Old Guy and shrugs.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: OLD GUY
dialog: Just burn it. You can’t send them back
dialog: one shoe. It’s not respectful.
scene_heading: INT. PAUL’S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME
text: We hear a BEEP.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: You got it all wrong baby. I want you to
dialog: come to Chicago with me. Look. I'll
dialog: swing by your place on my way to the
dialog: office. You know I love you.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTHER’S HOUSE - DAY
text: Paul pulls up to a suburban house. Walks quickly to the
text: door, a supermarket bouquet of flowers wrapped in
text: cellophane in his hand. He rings the bell. No-one
text: answers. He rings again. Knocks hard on the door.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Anna!
text: Still no answer. Paul looks around. Notices the
text: driveway’s empty. He heads back to his car.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. PAUL’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Paul’s on his cell phone as he drives. He gets Anna’s
text: voice mail again.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: It’s me again. I must have just missed you
dialog: at home. Call me when you get this. OK?
scene_heading: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Paul strides down an empty corridor. The flowers in his
text: hand. Searching for Anna’s classroom.
scene_heading: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. BIOLOGY CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: A TEACHER stands in front of the class holding a shell.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: ... the shell grows slowly...
text: The door opens. Paul steps into the classroom. His
text: smile fades as he realizes it’s not Anna.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh hi. I’m looking for Anna Bryant.
text: The Teacher quickly moves over. Hustles Paul to the door.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: (indignant)
dialog: I’m sorry but you just can’t--
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I’m Anna‘s... fiancée. Paul Conran. I
dialog: thought this was her class.
text: The Teacher glances suspiciously at the flowers in his hand.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: We had a little misunderstanding last
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: She didn’t come in today.
text: Jack’s in the front row. Following the conversation.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Did she call in sick?
speaker_heading: TEACHER
text: She hasn’t called in at all. It’s not
text: like her. She always calls in.
text: Paul’s worried now. Something’s wrong.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY
text: Anna lies rigidly on the slab. Her head turned to one
text: side. Staring blankly at the wall. Her eyes glazed.
text: Suddenly classical music fills the room. Anna frowns.
text: Disoriented. She moves her head with difficulty.
text: Nervously looks around.
text: For a moment she doesn’t know where she is. Then she
text: sees Eliot by a CD player. She watches with trepidation
text: as he approaches her.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Please don’t hurt me.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: How can I hurt you? You’re already dead.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: But I’m not dead.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Then why are you here?
text: Anna doesn’t know what to say. She turns her head away.
text: A tear falls down her cheek.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Please. Just let me go. I won’t go to
dialog: the police. I won’t tell anyone.
text: Eliot moves her head back. Gently wipes away her tear.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You’re still in denial. You have to
dialog: trust me. I’m only here to help you.
text: Eliot slides a wooden head-rest under her neck and studies
text: her wounds, touching them delicately. Thinking about how
text: to conceal them. He turns to a tray of instruments.
text: Picks up a needle. Leans over Anna.
text: The needle pierces her brow. Sliding cleanly through her
text: skin. She doesn’t feel any pain as Eliot carefully sews
text: the wound. He’s meticulous. Clearly very good at his job.
text: Eliot glances at his watch. Picks up a SYRINGE and an
text: AMPOULE OF AMBER LIQUID. Draws up the amber liquid.
text: Anna’s alarmed. She tries to pull back.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Don’t be scared.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: This will relax your muscles. Stop the
dialog: rigor mortis setting in so I can work on
dialog: your body.
text: He INJECTS Anna in the neck. Just then we hear a car
text: pull up on the gravel driveway outside.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Your mother's early.
text: Anna‘s eyelids feel very heavy. Slowly her eyes close.
text: Eliot pulls the white sheet over her body.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: A Nurse, DIANE (30s) follows Beatrice in her wheelchair
text: as Eliot leads them through the hallway.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I'm so very sorry Mrs. Bryant. It’s
dialog: always so tragic when you lose a child.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: I lost her years ago.
text: He glances at her curiously. Then gestures to his office.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: If you'd care to come to my office we can
dialog: discuss the arrangements.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: I want to see her.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: But she hasn’t been--
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: I don’t care. I want to see her.
text: It takes him a second to respond.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Of course.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY
text: Beatrice leans against the slab staring at Anna’s covered
text: body. Eliot stands respectfully to one side. In the b.g.
text: Diane shivers. The room’s cold. Beatrice touches Anna’s
text: hand through the white sheet. Then uncovers Anna’s face.
text: The needle’s still embedded in her eyebrow.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Ah. Forgive me.
text: Eliot quickly steps forward. Pulls out the needle. Cuts
text: the thread with a pair of large scissors.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: As I said. I’ve only just started
text: preparing her.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: What's the point of preserving the body
dialog: if the soul's already left?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: (quietly to himself)
dialog: No. The soul never leaves.
text: Beatrice stares at Anna.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: It’s us who are left behind. It's us who
dialog: suffer.
dialog: (to Anna)
dialog: Who’s going to look after me now? Did
dialog: you think about that?
text: She nods to Diane. Diane helps her into the wheelchair.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I’1l confirm the date with Father Graham
dialog: this afternoon. Friday as you requested.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: Just do what you think's best. It’s just
dialog: details.
text: Beatrice whirs towards the door. She suddenly stops.
text: Turns to Eliot.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: Oh there is one thing.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: Her hair. She was a brunette. I'd like
dialog: it back to that color.
scene_heading: EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - DAY
text: Eliot watches Beatrice’s car drive away.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. PAUL’S CAR - DAY
text: Paul waits in his car outside the Mother’s house. The
text: wilting flowers on the passenger seat beside him.
speaker_heading: PAUL'S POV
text: Beatrice’s car pulls up. Diane gets out. Pulls the
text: wheelchair out of the car.
speaker_heading: PAUL'S CAR
text: Paul grabs the flowers.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Paul strides over as Diane helps Beatrice into her
dialog: wheelchair.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Mrs. Bryant.
text: Beatrice doesn’t acknowledge him. Paul turns to Diane.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hi Diane. I need to talk to Anna.
text: Diane can’t look him in the eye.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: I think you better come in.
scene_heading: INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Beatrice sits in her wheelchair with her back to the
text: door. Paul stops a short distance away.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What happened? Where’s Anna?
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: (without turning)
dialog: Anna was in a car accident last night.
dialog: My daughter’s dead. That's what
dialog: happened.
text: Paul stares at Beatrice’s back in disbelief.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: A car crash? When?
text: Beatrice turns her wheelchair round to face Paul.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: (irritably)
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: They said it happened just before 8.30.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: But... we were at the restaurant...
text: Beatrice glares at him. She clearly blames him for
text: Anna’s death.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: You shouldn’t have let her drive in that
dialog: weather.
text: Paul looks down guiltily at the flowers in his hand.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No. She can’t be dead. There must be
dialog: some mistake.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: There’s no mistake. We just got back
text: from the funeral home.
text: Beatrice pushes a joystick on her wheelchair. As she
text: whirs past Paul she notices the flowers.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: (dryly) .
dialog: Flowers? How appropriate.
text: Paul’s not listening anymore. Stunned.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Why didn’t you call me?
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: You took her away from me. I don’t want
dialog: you anywhere near her.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Eliot turns on the taps. Fills a copper kettle.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME
text: Silence. 0.S. a shuddering pipe bangs ominously. Anna
text: opens her eyes abruptly as if waking from a deep sleep.
text: She stares at us. Numb.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
text: CLOSE ON an exploding BLUE FLAME from a gas ring.
text: We pull back. Eliot places a kettle on the ring. Then
text: measures out exactly two spoons of tea from an ornate tin
text: into a teapot. Meticulous in everything he does.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME
text: CLOSE ON Anna’s hand. Her fingers FLEX slightly. She
text: pushes herself up awkwardly. Suddenly realizes
text: something. She touches her wrist. Desperately searching
text: for her pulse. Then frantically checks her neck.
text: Panicking. She can’t find her heartbeat.
text: She stares at her hand. Then abruptly SLAMS it against
text: the slab. Hard. She feels no pain. She does it again.
text: Harder. Still nothing.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I must be in shock. That’s all. It’s
dialog: just shock.
text: She struggles to her feet. Stumbles groggily to the door.
text: Tries the door handle. It’s locked. She bangs on the
text: door feebly. Then she hears something. She cocks her
text: head. Follows the sound of Eliot’s footsteps upstairs.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (hoarse)
dialog: Let me out!
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT’S OFFICE - DAY
text: Eliot’s by his desk. Checking his appointment book.
text: Whistling softly to himself. We can’t hear Anna’s cries.
text: He pours a cup of tea. Adds a drop of milk. As he stirs
text: his tea, he hears the sound of feet CRUNCHING on the
text: gravel outside. He glances out the window.
speaker_heading: ELIOT’S POV
text: Paul stands in the middle of the driveway staring blankly
text: at the Funeral Home.
scene_heading: EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Eliot steps out of the Funeral Home. Heads towards Paul.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Can I help you?
text: Paul turns to him. Pulled away from his thoughts.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Mr. Deane?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: My name’s Conran. Paul Conran.
text: Eliot smiles. Holds out his hand.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Of course. The lawyer.
dialog: (off Paul’s surprised look)
dialog: It’s a small town. In my line of work
dialog: you get to know everyone eventually.
text: As they shake, Eliot looks at Paul’s hand strangely. As
text: if he senses something.
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I’m Anna Bryant’s fiancée.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: That’s strange. She wasn’t wearing an
dialog: engagement ring.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well not quite fiancée...
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I’m very sorry for your loss Mr. Conran.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I’d like to see her.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I’m afraid the viewing isn’t until--
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I’d need to see her now. If that’s
dialog: possible.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I’m sorry. It’s not possible. You're
dialog: not family and--
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Please. It’d only take a minute.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I understand. But--
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: NO. YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND!
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME
text: Anna suddenly hears Paul’s loud voice outside.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: Paul! I’m here! Paul!
text: She frantically beats her fists against the door.
scene_heading: EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - SAME TIME
text: Paul quickly controls his anger. His eyes smart with tears.
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: I tried to stop her. She didn’t hear me.
text: Paul’s voice breaks with emotion. He can’t go on. Eliot
text: gently takes him by the elbow. Leads him back to his car.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Mr. Conran. There really is nothing I
dialog: can do. I’m so sorry.
text: Paul looks defeated. He simply nods his head. Eliot
text: watches him get into his car and drive away.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - LATER
text: Anna sits by the door in the darkness. Suddenly the
text: room’s flooded with light. Eliot walks in. Looks at
text: Anna for a moment. She just stares back at him coldly.
text: He heads over to the sink.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Who was that?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: No one.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No one?
text: A long beat.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: It was Paul.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: I know. I heard you talking to him.
dialog: Why didn’t you let him see me?
text: Eliot smiles. Amused she caught him out. He continues
text: washing his hands.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Did you love him?
text: Anna looks up sharply. Eliot’s clearly hit a nerve.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: That’s none of your business.
text: Eliot shrugs. Dries his hands on a white towel.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You weren’t going to tell me Paul was
dialog: here, were you?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Because it would only hurt you. You have
dialog: to let go of the living. Just like they
dialog: have to let go of you.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I don’t believe you. Why are you doing
dialog: this to me?
text: He shakes his head as he drops the towel into a small bin.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You’re all the same. You all blame me
dialog: for your death. As if it were my fault.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No. You drugged me. So my mother
dialog: wouldn’t--
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: The others. They just see you as a dead
dialog: body on a slab. Only I can see you as
dialog: you really are.

dialog: You’re crazy!
text: Eliot’s taken aback. Hurt.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I’m a busy man. I don’t have time for this.
text: He heads to the door. Pulls out his keys and unlocks it.
text: Just then he remembers something. Turns to her.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Oh I nearly forgot. How tall are you?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What!?
text: He looks her up and down. Gauging her height.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Five seven.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Why. .?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I need to know how tall you are. For
dialog: your coffin.
text: Anna’s stunned. Eliot looks at her for a moment. Then
text: switches off the main lights.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Wait!
text: He ignores her. The door CLICKS shut behind him.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Eliot steps into the hallway. Stops by a vase of
text: flowers. He plucks a dead petal. Crushes it. Curiously
text: sniffs his fingers. Then heads to the casket room.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY
text: CLOSE ON Anna’s face. She looks empty. Dispirited.
text: Just then something catches her attention...
text: The light from the window glints off a pair of LARGE
text: SCISSORS on the steel trolley. Anna stumbles to the
text: trolley. Feeling her way through the semi-darkness.
text: Grabs the scissors.
text: Just then she notices a BODY, covered with a white sheet,
text: lying on a gurney in the corner. She turns away.
text: Scared. But then, almost against her will, she
text: approaches the gurney. As if drawn to the body. She
text: slowly pulls the sheet away...
text: The dead body of an OLD WOMAN. Staring blindly at Anna
text: with cloudy opaque eyes. Long greasy gray hair. Shaken,
text: Anna pushes herself against the wall.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Oh God. Please. I don’t want to die.
scene_heading: INT. JACK’S HOUSE. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Jack carefully cuts something out of a local newspaper.
text: The loud sounds of a TV blare from another room.
speaker_heading: ON NEWSPAPER
text: Schoolteacher Dies in Tragic Car Crash.
scene_heading: INT. JACK’S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: The curtains are drawn. JACK’S MOTHER sits in an
text: armchair with her back to us watching TV. Jack walks in.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You were supposed to pick me up from
dialog: school yesterday.
text: His mother doesn’t reply. Jack moves in front of the TV.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I waited.
text: His mother doesn’t respond.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS - DAY
text: Jack furiously cycles through empty streets. Past
text: identical suburban houses with identical prim lawns. He
text: stops suddenly. Considering something. Then turns and
text: cycles away purposely.
scene_heading: EXT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY
text: Eliot walks out of the funeral home. We pull back. Jack
text: stands by his bicycle in the bushes watching him. Eliot
text: looks up. As if sensing someone was spying on him. Jack
text: steps back quickly behind a tree.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
text: A POLICE OFFICER talks on the phone as Paul walks in.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hang on a sec.
dialog: (to Paul)
dialog: Mr. Conran. Heard about your girlfriend.
dialog: I’m sorry.
text: Paul nods. Clearly doesn’t want to talk about it.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Is Tom in?
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: The captain just stepped out. He won't
dialog: be long. You can wait in his office if
dialog: you want.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Thanks. I’11 just go and grab a coffee.
text: As Paul walks away, the Officer returns to the phone.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: A buddy of the captain’s. Poor guy...
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Paul slides a dollar bill into a coffee machine. Presses
dialog: his selection. Nothing.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Come on.
text: He pushes the button repeatedly. Then angrily slams the
text: side of the machine. Nothing.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You piece of shit.
text: As Paul turns away, he notices a door with a sign on it:
text: AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY. Paul glances around. Then
text: quickly walks over to the door.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
text: A dozen wrecked cars. Twisted metal. Paul’s footsteps
text: echo through the empty garage. It’s dark. Out the
text: corner of his eye Paul glimpses a SHAPE move quickly
text: around a pillar. He stops. Unsettled.
text: Just then we hear a WOMAN’S FOOTSTEPS. Her high-heels
text: clicking on the concrete floor. There’s something
text: strange about the sound. UNNATURAL. Paul listens
text: nervously. The footsteps grow fainter. Then fade away.
text: The garage is silent again. Too quiet.
text: Paul moves apprehensively over to Anna’s GREEN TOYOTA.
text: The car’s a mess. One side’s completely caved in. He
text: touches the car. Pulls open the door. Squeezes into
text: the driver’s seat.
speaker_heading: ANNA'S CAR
text: Glass everywhere. Paul glances at the KITSCHY BOBBLEHEAD
text: DOLL on the dashboard flecked with blood. He places his
text: hands on the steering wheel. Suddenly he hears a strange
text: noise. He looks up...
text: The KITSCHY DOLL. Its head NODDING SLOWLY. Its smiling
text: face now unnaturally sinister. Turning towards us until
text: it abruptly stops. Staring straight at us.
text: Paul looks at the doll transfixed. Just then a PALE
text: WOMAN’S HAND slowly reaches through the window... and
text: touches Paul’s shoulder. He jumps. Turns.
text: ANNA stands by the car. Staring blankly at him. The
text: color drains from Paul’s face.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (0.C.)
dialog: Paul?
text: The Police Captain, Tom Peterson, stands by the car where
text: Anna was a second ago. He pulls his hand away from
text: Paul’s shoulder. Looks at him with concern.
dialog: 39.
text: Paul gathers his composure. He must have just imagined
text: Anna was there. He shoves the door open. He’s about to
text: step out when he turns back and grabs the Kitschy Doll.
speaker_heading: GARAGE
text: Paul gets out awkwardly. He can’t look Tom in the eye.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You OK?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (unconvincing)
dialog: I’m fine.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I just found out. I’m so sorry Paul. If
dialog: you need anything--
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I need to see Anna.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: The funeral director won’t let me see her
dialog: Tom. He says I’m not family. Can you
dialog: talk to him? Put some pressure on him.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I can’t do that.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Tom. You're my friend.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Paul. I can’t do it.
text: Paul nods slowly. Tom notices the Kitschy Doll.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You sure you’re OK?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I fucked up.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Paul. It was an accident. You should
dialog: get some rest. Let me drive you home.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I always fuck everything up.
dialog: 40.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Eliot stops by a thermostat. Studies it for a moment.
text: Turns it lower. He glances at his watch. Takes out his
text: keys from his jacket and moves over to the Prep Room door.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Anna sits on the slab. Her hands behind her back. She
text: carefully watches Eliot as he pulls on his pale blue
text: smock then walks over to a cabinet.
scene_heading: BEHIND ANNA’S BACK
text: her hands clutch the large scissors.
speaker_heading: PREP ROOM
text: Eliot opens a cabinet full of boxes of hair dye with
text: photographs of smiling women. As he prepares the dye he
text: looks across at Anna. She’s staring at something behind
text: him. Eliot turns. Sees the uncovered body of the Old
text: Woman on the gurney. He quickly walks over. Carefully
text: pulls the white sheet over the Old Woman.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Who is she?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Mrs. Whitehall.
text: He mixes the dye in a bowl as he moves over to Anna.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You shouldn't be afraid of her. The dead
dialog: can’t harm the dead.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (forcefully)
dialog: But I’m not dead!
text: Anna’s hand suddenly FLIES UP... she slashes at Eliot’s
text: face with the SCISSORS.
text: The sharp edge misses his cheek by inches. Eliot drops
text: the bowl. Stumbles back against the steel trolley.
text: Instruments crash to the floor.
text: Anna staggers to the door. Her legs weak. Her long lank
text: hair falling over her eyes. She frantically wrenches at
text: the door handle but it’s locked. Eliot gets up. Slowly
text: moves towards Anna. She turns. Raises the scissors.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Stay where you are.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: (holds out his hand)
dialog: Give me the scissors. I only want to
dialog: help you.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Don’t come any closer. I swear to God
dialog: I’1l kill you.
text: Eliot walks right up to her. His face now inches from hers.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: Go ahead.
text: Anna doesn’t move. Eliot looks her steadily in the eye.
text: He reaches for her hand. Slowly. Deliberately. He brings
text: the scissors to his cheek. Then lets go of Anna’s hand.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON ELIOT'S FACE
text: The sharp tip pushes into his skin.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Go on.
speaker_heading: PREP ROOM
text: For a moment we think she might do it. But then she wavers.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: What are you waiting for?
text: Anna’‘s confidence falters. She slowly lowers her hand.
text: The scissors fall onto the floor. Anna looks down
text: defeated. Her breath labored. Suddenly she realizes...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'm breathing!
dialog: (raises her head)
dialog: Look. I’m still alive!
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You think you’re still alive because
dialog: you’re still attached to life. It’s
dialog: normal. You're just imagining you still
dialog: have symptoms of life.
text: She's not listening. Eliot takes a roll of paper towels.
text: Kneels down, picks up the bowl of dye and mops up the mess.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Maybe I was in some kind of coma. The
dialog: doctors made a mistake. They’re always
dialog: making mistakes.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You died. Everyone dies.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: How can I be dead if we’re talking?
text: He stands up. Sighs wearily.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: We're talking not because you’re alive.
dialog: But because I have a gift.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I can talk to those between life and death.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: To help them make the transition.
text: Anna’s stunned. For the first time we sense a seed of
text: doubt in her mind.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Is this what happens when you die?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: It depends on how you lived your life.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Not everyone needs my help. Some let
dialog: go as soon as their body dies. Others
dialog: don’t let go until long after they’re
text: in the grave.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Am I a ghost? Is that why I’m here?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You're here so I can bury you.
text: Anna’‘s silent. Trying to make sense of what she’s just
text: heard. Eliot takes her arm. Leads her to the slab.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Come. We've wasted enough time already.
text: She lies down submissively. Suddenly very tired. Eliot
text: leans over her to apply what’s left of the dye.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: No. Please. I don’t want--
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You're a corpse. Your opinion doesn’t
dialog: count anymore.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: But I can breathe. I must be alive.
text: She weakly pushes him away. Anger flashes across Eliot's
text: face, but just as quickly he controls it.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You people. You all think that if you
dialog: breathe, shit, piss you’re alive.
text: Anna doesn’t know what to say.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You clutch onto life as if your life was
dialog: worth clutching onto. Was your life
dialog: worth clutching onto Anna?
text: Anna turns her head away. Clearly he’s struck a chord.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Was it? Maybe you died a long time ago.
text: Eliot rips off his latex gloves. Tosses them into a bin.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I have to tell you I’m surprised you’re
dialog: still arguing with me. You don’t have
dialog: much time left.
dialog: (gestures to the Old Women)
dialog: Look. She’s accepted her death. Her
dialog: life has been examined. She has no more
text: regrets. And now she’s at peace. She
dialog: used her time well. You still have so
dialog: much to learn.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I have nothing to learn!
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Are you sure?
text: Eliot stands in the doorway. He switches off the light.
text: His body silhouetted by the light from the hallway.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Your funeral’s in three days. Soon
dialog: you'll be enclosed in a coffin. Then
text: buried in the ground. No-one will hear
dialog: you then. No-one will talk to you there.
text: The door clicks shut behind him. Anna doesn’t move.
text: Clearly unsettled by Eliot’s words. After a moment she
text: looks at the Old Woman. She moves over. Hesitantly
text: pulls away the white sheet. Stares at the Old Woman
text: curiously. Then tentatively touches her cheek.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Are you cold?
dialog: 44,
text: She takes the Old Woman’s hand. Strokes her paper-thin skin.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’m so cold.
text: Anna notices the Old Woman’s plastic ankle tag.
scene_heading: ON PLASTIC ANKLE TAG
text: Name: Carol Whitehall. Sex: F. DOB: 11.02.30.
speaker_heading: PREP ROOM
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You had a long life.
text: Anna turns back. Studies the Old Woman’s serene face.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You look so peaceful.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Aren't you scared?
text: Anna’s eyes fill with tears.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’m scared. I’m so scared.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Jack lies in bed staring at the ceiling. On his bedside
text: table an alarm clock reads 2.38AM. He looks across at an
text: Anglepoise lamp in the corner of the room bent over an open
text: shoebox. He gets up. Walks towards the muted light.
text: The SMALL CHICK huddles in the shoebox. It looks dead even
text: though it’s eyes are open. Jack’s about to reach into the
text: box. Then changes his mind. He looks at the lamp. Switches
text: it off. After a moment he switches it back on again.
scene_heading: INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Paul stands motionless in the middle of the room. Staring
text: blankly into space. The room feels empty and depressing.
text: He suddenly looks around. Not quite sure why he came into
text: the room in the first place. He moves over to a CD player.
text: Mechanically switches it on. Music fills the room. He
text: turns the volume higher. Then all the way up. The music’s
text: unbearably loud but Paul just stands there. Numb.
speaker_heading: ON PAUL
text: The music’s strangely distorted now. Almost silent. As
dialog: if we were inside Paul’s head.
dialog: 45.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - NIGHT
text: Anna lies on the slab. Curled in a fetal position. 0.S.
text: we hear the UNNATURALLY LOUD metallic drip of a faulty
text: faucet. Slow. Rhythmical. Anna opens her eyes. Stares
text: at us. Terrified. Then she turns her head.
text: The Old Woman sits on the other slab. Slowly brushing
text: her tangled gray hair with a silver backed brush.
text: Anna looks around anxiously. The room is strangely
text: larger. The perspective not quite right. Certain
text: objects look absurdly small or abnormally large. She
text: notices a TINY DOOR. Half hidden by a steel trolley.
text: The door’s slightly ajar. Anna’s surprised.
text: The Old Woman shakes her head. Staring blindly at Anna
text: with opaque eyes. Anna ignores her. Moves quickly to
text: the tiny door. As she approaches, the door seems to grow
dialog: to normal size.
text: Then we realize it’s Anna who has shrunk. The steel
text: trolley now towers high above her. The massive
text: instruments on the trolley look like menacing insects
text: cast in surgical steel. She opens the door. Revealing a
text: solid wall of DARKNESS.
text: FROM INSIDE THE DARKNESS
text: the small shape of Anna in the doorway. The huge dark
text: space engulfs her. The only light comes from the Prep
text: Room behind her.
speaker_heading: PREP ROOM
text: Anna reaches forward. Her hand disappears into the thick
text: blackness. She snatches her hand back. Scared. Then...
text: ...a CHILD'S HAND darts out of the darkness. Grabs Anna’s
text: wrist. Pulling her in with surprising strength. Anna
text: struggles to free herself. But the hand drags her deeper
text: into the darkness. The door slams shut behind her.
scene_heading: INT. DARKNESS
text: Anna stands in the black empty space.
speaker_heading: GIRL’S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: I’m disappointed with you.
text: An innocent looking YOUNG GIRL (6) materializes out of
text: the blackness. She looks like a young Anna.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Who are you?
dialog: 46.
text: The Young Girl walks slowly towards Anna.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: You promised me so many things.
dialog: (amused)
dialog: You don’t recognize me?
text: Anna shakes her head.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: I am you. I’ve been waiting for you.
dialog: You shouldn’t have disappointed me.
text: The Girl now looks strangely malevolent. Anna steps back
text: terrified. Turns. But there’s no door anymore.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME
text: The Old Woman stands alone in the middle of the room.
text: Braiding her long hair.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: You're not ready.
text: CUT TO A SEARING WHITENESS.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - DAY
text: A small congregation of MOURNERS sit in the white chairs.
text: “AVE MARIA” plays quietly in the b.g. A MAN leans over
text: the casket paying his respects.
speaker_heading: ON CASKET
text: The Old Woman. Her long hair braided. She looks serene.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME
text: “AVE MARIA” filters into the room. Anna opens her eyes.
text: She’s confused. She gets up awkwardly. Looks around the
text: room. The other slab’s empty. The Old Woman’s gone.
text: Anna stumbles over to the trolley. Pushes it aside.
text: Desperately searching for the tiny door. She touches the
text: wall. There’s nothing there. Frustrated she turns to a
text: counter crowded with instruments. She sweeps her arm
text: across the counter top in rage. Sending everything
text: crashing to the floor.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - DAY
text: The funeral’s over. Eliot takes out a wilted bouquet of
text: flowers from a vase.
dialog: 47.
text: In the b.g. Jack stands half-hidden in the doorway.
text: Glancing around in fascination. A flower in his hand.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: (to Jack without looking up)
dialog: Can I help you?
text: Jack steps back timidly. Eliot looks up. Smiles.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Then perhaps you can help me.
dialog: (holds up the withered flowers)
dialog: Could you throw these away for me?
text: Jack nods hesitantly. Moves over and takes the flowers.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Thank-you.
text: Eliot turns and arranges fresh flowers in the vase.
speaker_heading: ON JACK
text: as he looks at the wilted flowers. He crushes a petal
text: then sniffs his fingers.
speaker_heading: ELIOT (0.C.)
dialog: There’s no life left in them.
speaker_heading: VIEWING ROOM
text: Jack looks up. Eliot’s watching him carefully.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: They belong in the garbage.
text: Jack turns to leave.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I’ve seen you round here before.
text: Jack’s suddenly nervous.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Did you know Mrs. Whitehall?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I thought it was Miss Bryant’s funeral.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Ah. Miss Bryant. No. Her funeral’s not
dialog: until Friday.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Where is she now?
text: Eliot considers the question for a moment.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
text: She’s downstairs.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Why? Because she’s not ready.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Is the flower for her?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (nods )
dialog: She was my teacher.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: And you are?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Jack.
text: Jack holds out his hand. A serious look on his face.
text: Eliot’s amused. He shakes Jack’s hand.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Well Jack. What did you think?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Mrs. Whitehall’s funeral. Did you find
dialog: it interesting?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (shrugs )
dialog: It was OK I guess.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Oh. I see.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Are all funerals the same?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: No Jack. They’re never the same. Each
dialog: one is special. The dead always speak to
dialog: us in different ways.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (curious now)
dialog: What do you mean?
text: Eliot finished arranging the flowers. He glances at his
text: watch. Smiles at Jack.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: It was a pleasure talking to you Jack.
dialog: 49.
text: Jack’s intrigued. He watches Eliot walk out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
text: As Eliot heads to the Prep Room, we hear a MUFFLED CRASH
text: from inside. Eliot quickly pulls out his keys. Moves to
text: the door. Just then Eliot hears a creaking sound behind
text: him. He turns. Jack’s at the top of the stairs.
text: Staring down curiously at the Prep Room door.
text: Eliot observes him cautiously. Did Jack hear the sound
text: as well? Jack looks back at Eliot. Smiles. Then
text: without a word, turns and heads back up the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Anna sits on the floor in the middle of the room.
text: Hugging her legs to her chest. Rocking to and fro.
text: Surrounded by broken glass, torn papers and instruments.
text: Eliot enters the room. Coldly surveys the destruction.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: (angry)
dialog: Why did you do this?
text: Anna ignores him. Eliot strides over to her.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
text: Anna stares at him blankly.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Is this the afterlife? Am I in heaven?
dialog: Or am I in hell?
text: Strangely Eliot’s not surprised. He nods his head. His
text: anger gone now.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: The door...
dialog: (points distractedly)
text: There was a door. Just there.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: gently)
dialog: It won’t be long now.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I used to believe in God. I thought I’d
dialog: see him when I died. Instead I saw you.
text: Eliot softly strokes her hair. Comforting her.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Maybe you are God.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You'll be at peace soon. I promise.
text: For a moment we see a deep sadness in Eliot’s eyes. He's
text: conflicted. But then abruptly he pulls himself together.
text: Moves away and starts clearing up. Anna closes her eyes.
text: Hugs her legs closer to her chest.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Paul.
text: She lets out a DESPONDENT SIGH. The SIGH carries into
text: the next scene...
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
text: The tall trees stand motionless amongst the graves. A
text: sudden GUST OF WIND bends the dense foliage. Their
text: leaves ripple. lLanguid and fluid like a wave. RUSTLING
text: EERILY. The sound almost malevolent.
scene_heading: INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM - DAY
text: Paul’s red-rimmed eyes snap open. He lies on his bed
text: fully clothed. An empty bottle of bourbon on the bedside
text: table. Behind him the curtains stir.
text: The KITSCHY DOLL’S head begins to slowly nod. Turning
text: towards us. We hear the eerie rustling sound again.
text: Like a MURMURING WHISPER...
speaker_heading: ANNA (0.S.)
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Paul.
text: Paul turns quickly. Sees the open window. It’s only the
text: wind. He shivers. It suddenly got very cold. He gets
text: up and closes the window. The WHISPERING starts again.
text: This time from the bathroom.
text: Paul walks over to the bathroom door. As he touches the
text: door handle... the whispering STOPS. Paul hesitates.
text: The room’s strangely silent. He slowly opens the door...
scene_heading: INT. PAUL’S APARTMENT. BATHROOM —- CONTINUOUS
text: Nothing. The bathroom’s empty. Paul looks around
text: nervously. He catches the reflection of his pallid face
text: in the mirror. lLeans wearily against the washbasin.
dialog: 51.
text: Water DRIPS from a leaky pipe. The fluorescent bulb over
text: the mirror CRACKLES softly. Paul turns on the taps.
text: Splashes cold water on his face. He’s about to reach for
text: a towel when he senses something. He cocks his head
text: slightly. A feeling.
text: He turns and checks out the bathroom. Nothing. Paul
text: dries his face. As he replaces the towel... the sound of
text: dripping water ABRUPTLY STOPS. Silence.
text: Suddenly the SHOWER STARTS RUNNING.
text: Paul’s paralyzed with fear. Steam wreathes the room in a
text: cloud of vapor. He turns slowly towards the shower.
speaker_heading: PAUL'S POV
text: Anna stands in front of the shower with her back to him.
text: She slips off her bathrobe and hangs it on a hook. Then
text: her hand moves to her chest. There’s a STRANGE WET
text: SUCKING sound...
text: .-..-as Anna rips out her heart and hangs it casually on
text: the hook next to her bathrobe.
text: ON THE STILL BEATING HEART
text: dripping crimson blood onto the bone white tiles.
speaker_heading: BATHROOM
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Anna.
text: Anna turns slowly. Her skin’s like alabaster. Unnaturally
text: translucent. A bloody gash where her heart used to be.
text: The steam from the shower curls around her like a mist.
text: She looks hauntingly beautiful. Mesmerizing. A line of
text: thick black fluid trickles from her nose. Paul turns
text: away. Horrified. When he turns back a second later
text: Anna’s not there. The bathroom’s empty. The shower’s
text: not even running.
scene_heading: INT. JACK’S HOUSE. KITCHEN - EVENING
text: Jack opens the fridge. It’s almost empty. He takes out
text: a carton of milk. Sniffs it. Recoils from the smell.
text: From the living room we hear the LOUD sound of a TV.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (shouts )
dialog: Mom! We’re out of milk.
text: There’s no reply. Jack grabs his jacket.
dialog: 52.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - EVENING
text: Anna‘s still sitting on the floor. The place is clean
text: and ordered again. She watches Eliot unzip a garment
text: bag. He lifts out a plain black dress.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: It’s your dress. For your funeral. Your
dialog: mother brought it round this morning.
text: As Eliot takes out a pair of shiny black shoes from a
text: plastic bag, Anna moves haltingly over to the dress. She
text: touches the material puzzled.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: This isn’t my dress.
dialog: (realizes with shock)
dialog: This is my mother’s dress! It was
dialog: supposed to be for her funeral. Why has
dialog: she given it to me?
text: Eliot starts folding the plastic bag. He notices
text: something else inside. He opens the bag. Hesitates then
dialog: takes something out.
scene_heading: ON ELIOT’S HAND
text: An old-fashioned wooden rosary.
speaker_heading: PREP ROOM
text: Eliot looks at it for a moment. Then glances over at
text: Anna. She’s still staring at the dress. He opens a
text: drawer beneath the counter. It’s full of rosaries and
text: printed Holy cards. He quickly drops the rosary into the
text: drawer. Closes it. Then turns back to Anna.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: It should have been her not me.
dialog: (turns to Eliot)
dialog: She was the one dying. Not me.
text: Eliot unlocks the door. Jams it open with a door stop.
text: Slips his keys back into his jacket pocket. Takes off
text: his jacket and hangs it up. He moves over to a
text: collapsible gurney folded on the floor. Bends down and
text: snaps open the side-rails. Anna looks at the open door.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’m not ready to die.
text: Eliot looks up at Anna sadly.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Why are you still struggling?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (plaintively)
dialog: I’m not ready to die. Not yet.
text: She glances at the open door again. Eliot follows her look.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: There’s nothing out there for you
dialog: anymore.
text: As Eliot turns back to the gurney, Anna notices Eliot’s
text: jacket hanging beside her. Realizes the KEYS are in the
text: pocket. She quickly glances back at Eliot. He’s still
text: busy adjusting the gurney. She leans over to his jacket.
speaker_heading: ON ELIOT
text: as he gets up and turns to Anna.
speaker_heading: PREP ROOM
text: Anna looks at him calmly. We can’t tell if she managed to
text: get his keys or not. Eliot pulls on his jacket and wheels
text: the gurney through the door. He steps back into the room.
text: Nudges the door stop away with his foot.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I’ll be back soon.
text: The door locks behind him with a CLICK.
scene_heading: EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Eliot pushes the gurney to a WHITE VAN with black tinted
text: windows (Note: The same kind of van that cut in front of
dialog: Anna just before the accident).
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME
text: Anna listens anxiously to the CRUNCH of Eliot’s feet on
text: the gravel outside. After a moment she hears the van
text: drive away. She unfurls her fist revealing Eliot’s keys.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. ELIOT’S VAN. STREETS - MOMENTS LATER
text: As Eliot slides in a CD he notices the fuel gauge. He’s
text: low on gas. He glances into his rear-view mirror and
text: makes a left turn.
dialog: 54.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME
text: Anna staggers to the door. There’s at least a dozen keys.
text: She frantically chooses one and shoves it into the lock.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (begging the door to open)
dialog: Please.
text: It doesn’t fit. She’s panicking. She fumbles for
text: another key. It almost fits. She forces it. The key
text: SNAPS OFF LOUDLY in the lock.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No!
text: Anna looks around desperately. Sees a tray of instruments
text: on the steel trolley. She scrambles over. Finds a pair of
text: surgical pliers. She moves back to the door.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - LATER
text: Eliot replaces the pump nozzle. Walks over to the cashier.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: Thirty-four fifty.
text: In the b.g. Jack, a carton of milk in his hand, steps out
text: of the gas station. Eliot doesn’t notice him as he pulls
text: out a roll of notes. Hands over two twenties. Then he
text: frowns. Something’s wrong. He checks his pockets again.
text: He can’t find his keys. He walks quickly away.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: Sir. Your change.
text: Eliot ignores him. Scrambles into his van. Intrigued,
text: Jack watches Eliot drive away. Then unlocks his bicycle.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME
text: Anna’s still trying to pry out the broken key.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (desperately)
dialog: Come on. Come on.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. ELIOT’S VAN. STREETS - SAME TIME
text: Eliot’s at a red light. Drumming his fingers in
text: frustration as he waits for the light to change.
dialog: 55.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Finally Anna pulls out the broken key. Quickly chooses
text: another. Turns it gently. Again it doesn’t fit. Anna's
text: hysterical now. She tries the next key. It fits! She’s
text: stunned for a second. Then pulls open the door.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. ELIOT’S VAN. STREETS - SAME TIME
text: Eliot turns sharply into a small road by the cemetery.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT
text: Anna staggers to the front door. She pulls at the door.
text: It won’t open. Frantically she finds the key. Unlocks the
text: door, leaving the keys in the lock. As she opens the door,
text: HEADLIGHTS sweep across the hallway.
speaker_heading: ANNA'S POV
text: Eliot’s van pulls up in front of the house.
speaker_heading: ENTRANCE HALL
text: Anna’s trapped. We hear the CRUNCH of Eliot’s footsteps
text: on the gravel outside. Anna looks round desperately.
scene_heading: EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
text: Eliot reaches the front door. It’s slightly ajar. He
text: pushes it open. Steps warily inside.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS
text: Eliot looks around. The entrance hall’s empty. Then he
text: notices the keys in the lock.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
text: It’s dark. Anna pulls at the back door. It won’t budge.
text: She panics. Sees a kitchen knife on the counter.
text: Quickly grabs it. As she steps back, she knocks over a
text: metal bucket. The sound’s DEAFENING in the silent house.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS
text: Eliot hears the NOISE. Smiles. He calmly locks the door
text: and puts the keys into his pocket. Moves down the
text: hallway towards the kitchen.
dialog: 56.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
text: Eliot switches on the light. The kitchen’s empty. He
text: steps back into the hallway.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: He stands very still. Watching. Waiting. We pull back.
text: JUST AROUND THE CORNER
text: Anna pushes herself against the wall clutching the knife.
speaker_heading: HALLWAY
text: Eliot turns towards her... then at the last moment
text: changes his mind. Heads in the opposite direction
text: towards the viewing room.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Eliot steps carefully into the viewing room. Looks
text: around. Just then we hear the sound of bare feet
text: STAMPING along the hallway behind him.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. ENTRANCE HALL - SAME TIME
text: Anna runs to the front door. It’s locked. She glances
text: around anxiously. Sees a staircase leading upstairs.
text: She weakly stumbles up the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Anna walks along the corridor. She peers into a room.
text: Notices a TELEPHONE on a table. She moves over to the
text: telephone. The door CREAKS closed behind her.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. ENTRANCE HALL - SAME TIME
text: Eliot hears the CREAKING DOOR upstairs. He cocks his
text: head upwards. Straining to listen.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Anna frantically punches the buttons on the phone.
scene_heading: INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME
text: A telephone RINGS in the empty kitchen.
dialog: 57.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME TIME
text: Anna rocks back and forth as she anxiously listens to the
text: RINGING on the other end.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (desperately)
dialog: Please pick up. Please pick up.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. STAIRS - SAME TIME
text: Eliot slowly climbs the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. PAUL’S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME
text: The phone continues to RING. We pull back. Paul stares
text: at the phone blankly. A drink in his hand. He looks
text: worse than before. Dark circles under his eyes.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME TIME
text: Anna glances back to the door in panic.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Paul. Please pick up.
scene_heading: INT. PAUL’S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME
text: Finally Paul reaches across and picks up the phone.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME TIME
text: Anna cups her hand around the mouthpiece.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (frenzied whisper)
dialog: Paul. I’m here.
scene_heading: INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME
speaker_heading: ANNA (0.S.)
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: Help me Paul.
text: Anna’s HOARSE DISTORTED VOICE sounds almost malevolent.
text: Paul’s stunned. He stares at the phone as if it was
text: possessed. Then slowly puts it down.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Leave me alone.
dialog: 58.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME TIME
text: Anna looks at the phone in disbelief. The MONOTONOUS
text: TONE DRONES in the ear piece. She doesn’t notice Eliot
text: appear in the doorway.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Paul.
text: Suddenly the light comes on.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I’m the only one who can hear you now.
text: Anna drops the phone. Backs away towards a window. Eliot
text: walks over and calmly replaces the phone.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I’d be very careful if I were you. The
dialog: dead have such a hold over the living.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: (nods to the phone)
dialog: He still feels your presence. You're
dialog: only causing him more pain. If you
dialog: really loved him, you'd accept your death
dialog: and let him go.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Then prove to me I'm really dead.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You people. You always need proof.
text: Eliot places his hands on her shoulders. Turns her
text: towards a tall mirror.
speaker_heading: ON MIRROR
text: A PALE CADAVEROUS WOMAN. Sunken eyes. A blood-stained
text: tear in the side of her RED SLIP.
speaker_heading: UPSTAIRS ROOM
text: Anna’s stunned. She moves closer to the mirror. Touches
text: her reflection through a thin layer of dust.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Why do I look like a corpse?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Because you are a corpse.
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: ON MIRROR
text: Anna stares blankly at her image in the mirror.
speaker_heading: ELIOT (0.C.)
dialog: It's time you finally accepted the truth.
dialog: You are dead. You will never live again.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I am dead.
speaker_heading: UPSTAIRS ROOM
text: Eliot smiles. Like a father proud of his child’s first
text: step. Just then he notices something outside. We see a
text: brief flicker of unease in Eliot’s eyes.
speaker_heading: ELIOT’S POV
text: Jack stands in the driveway holding his bicycle. Looking
text: up at the Funeral Home. Transfixed.
scene_heading: EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY
speaker_heading: JACK’S POV
text: Anna in her RED SLIP by the mirror. She looks frightening
text: in the harsh light. Deathly pale. Like a ghost.
speaker_heading: DRIVEWAY
text: Strangely Jack isn’t scared. He continues staring up at
text: the window. Calmly. Curiously.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME TIME
text: Eliot coolly turns back to Anna. She hasn’t noticed
text: Jack. Still staring at her reflection in the mirror.
scene_heading: INT. PAUL’S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
text: Paul stares at the telephone. After a moment he slowly
text: pulls the telephone plug out of the wall. Mechanically
text: grabs a plastic bin liner from underneath the sink.
scene_heading: INT. PAUL’S APARTMENT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Paul opens the wardrobe. Pulls out Anna’s clothes. Stuffs
text: them into the bin liner. He notices the Kitschy Doll.
text: Shoves it in with Anna’s clothes.
dialog: 60.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY
text: Anna lies on the slab. She stares at us blankly. Her
text: face emotionless. Resigned. Eliot rinses her hair now
text: dyed back to brown. She slowly closes her eyes.
text: CLOSE ON RED DYE draining into the sink.
text: Eliot picks up the scissors. Carefully slices open
text: Anna's red slip. Delicately peels the slip off her body.
text: Anna doesn’t react.
text: CLOSE ON Anna. She opens her eyes. Confused. She turns
text: her head... she’s in PAUL’S BEDROOM.
scene_heading: INT. PAUL’S APARTMENT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Paul lies in bed next to her watching her intently. He
text: looks different. Clean shaven. Sober.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: Oh God.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Bad dream?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I was dead. I had a car accident. Did
dialog: you ever dream you were dead?
text: Paul doesn’t reply. She turns... the bed's empty.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Paul?
speaker_heading: PAUL (0.C.)
dialog: Yes?
text: Anna looks up. Paul’s in the doorway. She gets up.
text: Suddenly the light goes off.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Paul.
text: The light comes back on. Paul stands by the light switch.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (puts his finger to his lips)
dialog: Ssh. Don't talk so loud. You'll wake
dialog: the neighbors.
dialog: 61.
text: Anna’s getting nervous. Something’s not right.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What neighbors? You don't have any
dialog: neighbors.
text: Suddenly he looks at her reproachfully.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Did you ever love me Anna?
text: CLOSE ON Anna’s face. She looks away guiltily.
speaker_heading: PAUL (0.C.)
dialog: Did you?
text: Anna closes her eyes. Unable to answer.
speaker_heading: PAUL (0.C.)
dialog: Say it. Say you love me.
text: Suddenly we hear the strident ringing of a phone.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Aren’t you going to pick it up?
speaker_heading: PAUL (0.C.)
dialog: Me? No. It’s probably for Eliot.
text: Anna’s eyes snap open in shock...
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM —- CONTINUOUS
text: Eliot stands over her. We’re back in the PREP ROOM. We
text: hear the faint ringing of a phone from upstairs.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Is it always like this?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I thought when you died you wouldn’t
dialog: feel anything. You wouldn’t feel any
dialog: more pain. You wouldn’t have to
dialog: struggle anymore.
dialog: (beat )
dialog: But it just doesn’t stop does it?
text: Upstairs the phone keeps on ringing.
dialog: 62.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Eliot takes notes as he talks on the phone. He looks at
text: a day calendar on his desk. Idly flips over the page
dialog: from Tuesday to Wednesday.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: No. It’s no problem at all.
text: He glances at his watch.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I’‘ll pick up the deceased from the
dialog: hospital. Yes. This afternoon? That‘1l
dialog: be fine. It’s my pleasure Mr. Merano.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL MORGUE - DAY
text: GRAY BODIES lie on steel tables. Eliot moves over to one
text: of the CORPSES. Examines it with professional interest.
text: Just then the Old Guy walks in with the Pale Assistant
text: pushing a gurney with a BODY wrapped in plastic sheeting.
speaker_heading: OLD GUY
dialog: Well here he is. Frank Merano.
text: The Old Guy hands Eliot a clipboard. The Assistant
text: unties the rope. Pulls the plastic sheeting away.
speaker_heading: ON BODY
text: FRANK (40s), the top half of his head has been flattened.
text: His head split open. Grotesquely distorting his face.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT (0.C.)
dialog: Ouch. That had to hurt.
speaker_heading: MORGUE
text: Eliot glances at the Assistant with disdain. Signs the
text: release form and hands the clipboard back to the Old Guy.
scene_heading: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. TEACHERS’ COMMON ROOM —- DAY
text: Paul stands by a PRINCIPAL as they watch a JANITOR snap
text: off the padlock on Anna’s locker.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL
dialog: (to Paul)
dialog: I’‘1ll leave you to sort out her things.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 63.
text: The Principal and Janitor walk away. Paul reaches inside
text: the locker. Pulls out a stack of exercise books. An
text: empty pills bottle. Then he notices something in the
text: back of the locker. He pulls it out.
text: It’s a PHOTOGRAPH of Paul and Anna together on vacation.
text: Smiling. Happy. Paul looks at it for a moment. Trying
text: hard to hold back his emotions.
scene_heading: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - LATER
text: The DEAFENING NOISE of schoolchildren. Paul weaves his
text: way through the crowded corridor.
speaker_heading: JACK (0.C.)
dialog: Mr. Conran?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (turns)
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: My name's Jack. Miss Bryant was my
dialog: teacher.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I saw her last night.
text: Paul looks at Jack coldly for a second. Then walks away.
text: Jack follows him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I was going past the funeral home. Miss
text: Bryant stood there. In the window. Ina
text: red dress.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (irritated)
text: Anna doesn’t have a red dress.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You think I’m lying. I’m not lying.
text: Paul stops. Turns to Jack angrily.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Look...
dialog: (trying to remember his name)
dialog: Jack. I’m in no mood--
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She needs your help.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (shouts )
text: Jack. Anna’s dead.
text: Paul’s words ECHO loudly. The bustling corridor goes silent.
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (almost to himself)
dialog: I can’t help her anymore.
text: Paul turns and walks away. Jack grabs his arm.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Maybe you just don’t love her anymore?
text: Paul turns and hits Jack with the back of his hand. Jack
text: falls to the ground. Paul stands over him enraged.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You little fuck. You think this is funny?
text: He’s about to hit Jack again when a STOCKY TEACHER grabs
text: him. Paul tries to struggle loose.
scene_heading: STOCKY TEACHER
dialog: Hey!
text: The CHILDREN stare at Paul. A SECURITY GUARD runs across
text: talking into a walkie-talkie. Another TEACHER bends down.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Are you alright sweetie?
text: Jack nods numbly. Looking up all the time at Paul. The
text: Security Guard grabs Paul’s arm.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
text: The police are on their way.
text: Paul watches Jack stand shakily. Realizes what he’s
text: done. He reaches out to Jack.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Jack... I’m sorry...
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Step back sir.
scene_heading: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. SECURITY ROOM - DAY
text: Paul sits at a table. Staring blankly at a row of CCTV
text: monitors. The door opens. Tom walks in.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You're lucky.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Am I?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: They’re not pressing charges.
dialog: 65.
text: Paul doesn’t look up. He’s miles away.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What the hell’s wrong with you?
dialog: (holds his fingers close together)
dialog: You're this close to fucking up your
dialog: career.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (suddenly looks up)
dialog: You know what he told me? He told me
text: Anna's alive.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You didn’t believe him did you?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No. Of course not.
text: Tom’s relieved. Paul turns back to the monitors. The
text: ghostly figure of a YOUNG FEMALE TEACHER drifts
text: hypnotically across the screen.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It’s just... I’m having these...
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Nothing. Forget it.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY
text: Eliot leans over Frank’s body on the slab. Rolling a
text: ball of wax in his hands to warm it up. He gently moves
text: Frank’s head to one side. In the b.g. Anna lies on her
text: slab watching Eliot work.
speaker_heading: ANNA'S POV
text: Frank stares back at her with open dull eyes. His face
text: partially reconstructed with plaster of Paris.
speaker_heading: PREP ROOM
text: Eliot smooths the wax over the plaster to give Frank’s
text: face a more natural texture. Then picks up a piece of
text: wire with a fishhook-like barb at each end.
speaker_heading: ANNA (0.C.)
dialog: What’s that for?
text: Eliot looks up surprised. Anna stands beside him. He
text: leans down. Peels back Frank’s upper lip.
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
text: His mouth. To keep it closed.
text: Eliot imbeds one barb into the upper gum then pries back
text: Frank’s lower lip. He attaches the other barb into the
text: lower gum, then twists the wires tightly together. He
text: picks up two plastic caps covered in small knobs.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
text: Now his eyes.
text: He inserts the caps into Frank’s eyes. Pulls his eyelids
text: over them. Glues the eyelids together.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Is this how you’1ll prepare my body?
text: Eliot looks at her for a moment. Smiles reassuringly.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: No. There’s no need. I had to rebuild
dialog: his face. You're still beautiful.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Does he have family?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
text: Yes. A brother. He’s coming in later.
text: Anna touches the white sheet covering Frank’s body.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: My mother... She didn’t cry did she?
dialog: When she came to see me?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: And Paul?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: It’s not important anymore.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I need to know.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: No. He didn’t cry.
text: We see a brief flicker of pain in Anna’s eyes.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I knew he wouldn’t. He always got
dialog: upset when I cried. He said crying
dialog: never helped.
text: Anna suddenly looks very weary. She leans heavily
text: against the slab. As if she’s about to fall.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You should rest.
text: He guides her back to the slab. Helps her lie down.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You're getting weaker. It’s almost time.
text: Eliot strokes her hair tenderly. She looks up at him.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Can I ask you something?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Yes. Of course.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Why do we die?
text: A long beat.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: To make life important.
text: Anna's fingers curl around his hand. Like a vulnerable
text: child. Totally trusting in him. Eliot looks down at Anna
text: sadly. We sense he’s conflicted. Confused. Wavering.
text: But then reluctantly he reaches for a SYRINGE filled with
text: AMBER LIQUID on the steel trolley. He injects her gently
text: in the neck. Watches over her for a moment. Then moves
text: to the window. He picks up a window pole. Pulls the
text: shutter across the window plunging the room into darkness.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY
text: Eliot moves through the Funeral Home pulling heavy drapes
text: over the windows and closing doors. It feels like a
text: ritual. The once airy sunlit rooms are darker now. More
text: ominous. Claustrophobic.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT’S ROOM - DAY
text: CLOSE ON a stream of crystal blue water. We pull back.
text: Eliot picks up a white towel. Dries his hands. Deep in
text: thought. He moves to his desk. Picks up a Polaroid.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: ON POLAROID
text: The Old Woman, Mrs. Whitehall, lying in her casket.
speaker_heading: ELIOT (0.C.)
dialog: Mrs. Whitehall. Susan. I hope you found
dialog: what you were looking for.
speaker_heading: ROOM
text: Suddenly Eliot looks up sharply. As if someone had spoken
dialog: to him.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Think nothing of it Mr. Houseman. No
dialog: need to apologize.
text: Eliot moves over to the wall.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I really enjoyed our time together.
text: We pull back slowly. Eliot’s talking to a POLAROID of an
text: OLD MAN. We pull back further... the wall’s covered in
text: HUNDREDS OF POLAROIDS of BODIES in open coffins.
text: Most of them have closed eyes but we glimpse some with
text: their eyes wide open. Eerily staring at us. Eliot
text: touches the Polaroid of a YOUNG MAN. We see the fear in
text: the Young Man’s eyes.
speaker_heading: ELIOT (0.C.)
dialog: Anthony. Anthony. Always confused.
text: Just then we hear the doorbell ringing downstairs. Eliot
text: moves to the window.
speaker_heading: ELIOT'S POV
text: A POLICE OFFICER stands at the front door. A SQUAD CAR
text: parked on the driveway.
speaker_heading: ELIOT’S ROOM
text: Eliot steps back. Calmly continues to dry his hands.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. HALLWAY - DAY
text: Eliot leads the Police Officer through the hallway.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: How can I help you Officer?
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: I’d like to see the body.
dialog: 69.
text: Eliot stops. We see a brief flicker of unease in his eyes.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Frank Merano. I’m his brother. Vincent
dialog: Merano? I called this morning.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Mr. Merano. Yes. Of course.
speaker_heading: VINCENT (OFFICER)
dialog: I hope it’s no trouble. I’d just like to
text: see him before the funeral.
text: Eliot glances at his watch. Smiles at Vincent.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: It’s no trouble at all.

text: Eliot leads Vincent to Frank’s covered body. Vincent
text: looks over at Anna. The white sheet only comes to her
text: shoulders, her head facing straight upwards.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Your brother's here.
text: Vincent turns back to Eliot. We’re not sure if Eliot was
text: speaking to Frank or to Vincent. Eliot pulls the sheet
text: away. Frank’s face is flawless. No sign of any damage.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: He looks so peaceful. You’ve done a
dialog: beautiful job. Thank-you.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You should remember him as he used to be.
text: Suddenly we hear a FAINT RUSTLING sound. Vincent glances
text: again at Anna's body. Her head is now turned to one side.
text: Wasn't she facing upwards a moment ago? Vincent’s puzzled
text: for a second then shrugs. Must have been his imagination.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: That’s the schoolteacher isn’t it?
text: Eliot pulls the sheet over Anna's face.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Yes. Very tragic. Now is there anything
dialog: else I can help you with?
text: Vincent frowns. Turns back to Eliot.
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Something’s not right here.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: (looks up sharply)
dialog: Not right?
text: Vincent nods towards Frank's body.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: His smile. It was a bit more...
text: Vincent raises his fingers to his mouth, trying to find
dialog: the right word.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: ..-smiley.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Smiley.
scene_heading: ON FRANK'S MOUTH
text: Eliot manipulates Frank’s lips.
speaker_heading: VINCENT (0.C.)
dialog: A touch more.
speaker_heading: PREP ROOM
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: That’s much better. Thank-you.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I’m glad I could help.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Do you mind if I have a couple of minutes
dialog: alone with him?
text: Eliot hesitates. Then smiles.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
text: No. Not at all. I’11 wait outside.
text: As Eliot leaves, Vincent looks at Frank’s body. After a
text: moment he glances at Anna again. Then at the door. He
text: quickly moves over to Anna. Looks at her curiously then
text: pulls down the sheet. He reaches over... and CARESSES
text: HER BREAST. Mesmerized by her naked body.
text: As Vincent’s hand moves down her body, he bumps against
text: the trolley. Instruments CRASH to the floor. He pulls
text: back the sheet just as Eliot enters the room.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I’m sorry. I didn’t see...
dialog: 71.
text: Eliot notices the sheet covering Anna’s body is slightly
text: askew. He reaches over and straightens it. Then looks
text: coldly at Vincent. There’s an uncomfortable silence.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Well. I guess I should be off then. I’11
dialog: see you at the service. Thanks again.
text: Vincent glances one last time at Anna then leaves. The
text: door locking shut behind him. Eliot stares at the door.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I just told you. That was your brother.
dialog: (turns to Frank)
dialog: You had an accident. You’re dead. Why
dialog: do you people never listen to me?
text: Frank doesn’t move. His mouth still wired shut.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: No. It's not a gift. It's a curse.
text: Eliot picks up a compact. Roughly layers Frank’s cheeks
text: with thick rouge. With every word he gets more agitated.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I take care of each of you as if you were
dialog: my children. I wash the shit from your
dialog: bodies. I dress you. I do everything to
dialog: make you look more beautiful than when
dialog: you were alive. And what do you do?
text: Eliot’s extremely irritated now. He grabs a garish red
text: lipstick. Smears Frank’s lips.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You argue with me. As if it were my fault
dialog: you’re dead. As if I was to blame.
dialog: (slams down the lipstick.)
dialog: What? You’re not talking to me now? You
dialog: don’t want to?
speaker_heading: ON FRANK’S FACE
text: The crudely drawn bright red lips. Clown-like circles of
text: rouge. Gaudy and macabre.
speaker_heading: ELIOT (0.S.)
dialog: You don't talk because you have nothing
dialog: to say. And you have nothing to say
dialog: because you’re a corpse.
speaker_heading: PREP ROOM
text: From Eliot’s reaction it seems as if Frank has started to
dialog: talk again.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: No. Now I don’t want to talk to you
dialog: anymore.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: The curtains are drawn. Jack’s Mother, still motionless,
text: in front of the blaring TV. Jack stops in the doorway.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I’m off to school now.
text: His mother doesn’t reply. Jack leaves. After a moment
text: she slowly turns her head. Stares at the empty doorway.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - LATER
text: Jack cycles through the cemetery. He pulls up by a bush.
text: Stares at the Funeral Home in the distance.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: The service hasn’t started yet. Jack walks nervously
text: through the empty room to an open casket. He glances
text: back, then leans over the coffin.
speaker_heading: JACK'S POV
text: Frank Merano lies nestled in the velvet interior. His
text: face placid. No sign of the gaudy make-up.
speaker_heading: VIEWING ROOM
text: Jack stares in fascination at Frank’s body. He reaches
text: into the casket. Touches Frank’s cold hand.
text: In the b.g. Eliot walks into the viewing room. He stops
text: surprised. Watches Jack intently.
speaker_heading: ON JACK
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to Frank)
dialog: What’s it like? Are you afraid?
speaker_heading: ELIOT (0.C.)
dialog: Jack.
speaker_heading: VIEWING ROOM
text: Jack turns quickly. Eliot stands over him.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You have empathy with the dead. You’re
text: drawn to them. Just as they’re drawn to
dialog: you. It’s a rare gift.
text: Jack can’t look Eliot in the eye.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I know you saw Anna.
text: Jack hesitates. Then nods his head.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You're frightened by it. I was scared
dialog: too the first time. But you shouldn’t
dialog: be. Christ had the same gift. He raised
text: Lazarus and spoke to the dead.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (intrigued)
dialog: You spoke to Miss Bryant?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You've spoken to others?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Yes. Many others.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Who was the first one you spoke to?
text: A long beat.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: My mother.
text: Jack looks up sharply. Eliot’s words have clearly struck a
dialog: chord.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You shouldn't be afraid.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The others. They won’t understand. They
dialog: don’t see what we see.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I can help you. I can teach you.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY
text: Anna stares vacantly at the ceiling. Eliot places a bunch
text: of tulips on the trolley. Turns on a CD. CLASSICAL MUSIC
text: fills the room as before. He moves over to Anna. Gently
text: Pulls away the sheet.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Your fingernails are dirty.
text: Eliot smiles. Examines his nails.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Your hands are normally so clean.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I’ve been gardening.
text: He walks over to the sink. Scrubs his nails.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Is it sunny outside?
text: Eliot fills a bowl with water. Carries it to the slab.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Yes. The tulips love the sun.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I miss the sun.
text: Anna glances up at the shuttered window. Eliot snaps on
text: his latex gloves. Picks up a sponge and wets it in the
text: bowl of water. Anna turns to the tulips.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Are they your favorite flower?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Tulips? Yes. I think so.
text: Eliot raises Anna’s arm. Delicately washes her armpit.
text: Along the length of her arm. Her skin pale.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I thought it’d be lilies. White lilies.
dialog: Don’t they symbolize death?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: No. They symbolize purity.
text: He moves to her breasts, following the contours of her
text: body. Pausing every now and then to rinse the sponge.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: And tulips?
text: Eliot hesitates for a second before replying.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Unrequited love.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What’s your favorite flower?
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Violets.
text: Eliot softly washes her legs.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
text: A beautiful flower. They need shade and
dialog: lots of water.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What do they symbolize?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Faithfulness.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (distractedly)
dialog: Do they?
text: Eliot puts down the sponge. Dries her body with a towel.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Roses are red, violets are blue...
text: He reaches over to the CD player to switch it off.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No. Leave it on. It’s so peaceful.
text: Eliot smiles. Leaves the music on.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. PAUL’S CAR. STREETS - DAY
text: Paul drives aimlessly past strip malls. He stops at a
text: red light. Lights a cigarette. Just then he notices
text: something across the street. He looks puzzled.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET/STORE WINDOW - CONTINUOUS
text: Paul gets out of his car. Quickly walks over to the
dialog: store window.
scene_heading: ON STORE WINDOW
text: A RED-SLIP on a mannequin. Just like ANNA’S RED SLIP.
speaker_heading: STREET
text: The light’s turned green. The DRIVERS HONK angrily.
text: Paul doesn’t hear them. He places his hand against the
text: plate glass. Stunned.
dialog: 76.
scene_heading: EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - DAY
text: Eliot prunes a low hedge by the front door.
speaker_heading: PAUL (0.C.)
dialog: Deane.
text: Eliot turns. Paul’s clearly agitated.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Mr. Conran. A pleasure.
text: Eliot stands stiffly. Rubs his back.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I love gardening, but I’m not sure
dialog: gardening loves me anymore.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: She’s not dead is she?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Mr. Conran.
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: Someone saw her.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I’m sorry?
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: One of Anna’s students.
dialog: (nods towards the funeral home)
text: In the window.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Do you mean Jack?
text: Paul’s momentarily taken aback.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You know him?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Of course I know him. He’s often round
text: here. He seems to have a strange
dialog: fascination with death. He's eleven
dialog: years old Mr. Conran. And like all young
dialog: boys has a vivid imagination. Now if
dialog: you'll excuse me--
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I don’t think he imagined it. I think he
dialog: really saw her.
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Maybe you just want to believe he saw her.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Fuck you.
text: Paul pushes past Eliot and strides into the Funeral Home.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Mr. Conran!
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Paul moves quickly through the hallway.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (shouts )
dialog: Anna!
text: Eliot calmly heads towards Paul.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Mr. Conran. I think you should leave
dialog: before I call the police.
text: Paul notices the stairs leading down to the Prep Room.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What’s down there?
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Paul runs over to the Prep Room door. He grabs the handle.
text: It’s locked. Eliot appears behind him. Paul turns.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: She’s in here isn’t she? Give me the
dialog: key.
text: Eliot stares at Paul with pity.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Give me the fucking key.
text: Paul turns back. POUNDS the door in rage.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME
text: The POUNDING echoes through the room. Anna awkwardly
text: sits up. Struggling with her emotions. She wants to
text: call out but knows she has to let Paul go.
speaker_heading: PAUL (0.S.)
dialog: Anna!
dialog: 78.
text: Anna gets up. Hesitates. Weakly stumbles to the door.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - SAME TIME
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I’m here Anna.
dialog: (desperate)
dialog: I’m sorry. Please Anna.
text: He places the palm of his hand against the door.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME
text: Anna places her palm against the door. As if touching
text: Paul’s hand. A tear falls down her cheek.
speaker_heading: PAUL (0.S.)
dialog: We'll be happy again. I promise.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - SAME TIME
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I can’t live without you.
text: Eliot looks up at Paul with sudden interest.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME
text: Anna shakes her head. Takes her hand away from the door.
text: Walks back to her slab.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - SAME TIME
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Anna!
text: Eliot gently puts his hand on Paul’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
text: Mr. Conran. She’s dead.
text: Paul pushes him away.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I know what you’re going through.
dialog: Denial’s a natural part of grieving...
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME
text: Anna lies down on the slab. Closes her eyes. ELIOT'S
text: VOICE seems far away now. Receding.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: ELIOT (0.S.)
dialog: .»..-but you’ve got to accept she’s gone.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: She needs my help.
text: Eliot looks at him for a moment.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You can’t help her anymore. Believe me.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
text: An open plan office. Paul weaves quickly through the
text: rows of desks. He seems unbalanced. Manic. DETECTIVES
text: cautiously watch Paul approach Tom sitting at his desk,
text: his head bent over paperwork.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I need you to issue a search warrant.
text: Tom looks up. He’s shocked by Paul’s appearance.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: I need a fucking search warrant. Now are
dialog: you going to help me or what?
text: JEFF (20s) a Young Detective at a nearby desk stands.
text: Tom nods to him. It’s under control.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Paul. Sit down.
text: Paul hesitates for a second.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (firmly)
dialog: Sit. Down.
text: Paul sits. Tom leans forward. He’s not amused.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Just what the hell do you think you’re
dialog: doing? I got a call from Eliot Deane.
dialog: Are you out of your fucking mind?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Anna’s not dead Tom. He won’t let me see
dialog: her. He’s keeping her there--
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: TOM
text: Anna was in a car accident. Her car was
dialog: wrecked Paul. Remember? It’s downstairs.
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: She’s not dead.
text: Tom calmly gets up. Moves to a filing cabinet. Takes
text: out a file. Hands it to Paul.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Here’s the Coroner's report.
text: Paul manically rifles through the file.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Look.
dialog: (shows file to Tom)
text: The paramedics phoned it in. They only
dialog: checked for eye dilation and pulse. The
dialog: doctor signed the death certificate
text: without even seeing her body.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: So? That’s standard procedure.
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: There was no EEG. Nothing. He could
dialog: have drugged her to make it look like she
dialog: was dead.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Drugged her? Are you serious?
text: Jeff looks up eagerly from his desk.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: There are drugs like that chief.
dialog: Hydronium Bromide. Total paralysis
text: within seconds. The heartbeat slows to
dialog: almost nothing.
text: Tom shoots Jeff a look.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: See? I’m telling you. She’s not dead.
text: The boy at school. Jack. He saw her.
speaker_heading: VINCENT (0.C.)
dialog: I saw her.
text: Paul turns hopefully. Finally someone believes him.
text: Vincent Merano stands by Jeff’s desk.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
text: She was on the slab. Dead.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I’ve seen dead bodies. Believe me, she
dialog: was definitely dead.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Tom. Just go down there and check the
dialog: place out.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: On what grounds Paul? Do you have any
dialog: evidence?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No. But--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Do you have anything?
text: Paul hesitates. We sense his uncertainty.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I think she called me.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Called you?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (weakly)
text: On the telephone.
text: Jeff snickers. Paul’s beginning to realize how absurd
dialog: this all sounds.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Collect or long distance?
text: Jeff snorts with laughter.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: First you hit a fucking kid. Then you
dialog: attack Deane. And now you’re telling me
dialog: your dead girlfriend called you? What the
dialog: fuck’s going on? You’re loosing it Paul.
text: Merano and Jeff shake their heads, looking at Paul as if
text: he were crazy. Tom’s voice softens.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I know you feel guilty but you’ve got to
dialog: pull yourself together.
text: Paul slumps in the chair. Rubs his face.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Maybe you’re right. But why won’t he let
dialog: me see her?
text: Tom signals to Merano and Jeff. Merano walks back to his
text: desk. Jeff turns back to his work.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Look Paul. The funeral’s tomorrow.
dialog: You'll see her then. It’ll help. It
dialog: will give you closure. Trust me.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - LATE AFTERNOON
text: The sun’s low on the horizon. Eliot whistles softly to
text: himself as he digs a grave. Working meticulously. Like
text: everything else he does. Suddenly a SHADOW falls over
text: Eliot. He calmly looks up. The sun’s behind the figure.
text: For a moment Eliot can’t tell who it is.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You said you could teach me.
text: Eliot smiles. Gestures to Jack to come inside the grave.
text: Jack steps back. The grave terrifies him.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: It’s only a hole in the ground. I’m
dialog: digging it for--
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Miss Bryant.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Exactly. For Anna. She belongs here.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Because she’s dead.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
text: No. Because there’s no life left in her.
text: Jack carefully considers Eliot’s words.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Don’t you see? I have no choice. I’m
dialog: the only one who can see all these
text: corpses. Wandering the earth
text: aimlessly. All they do is piss and
dialog: shit. Suffocating us with their
dialog: stench. Doing nothing with their
dialog: lives. Taking the air away from those
dialog: who actually want to live. I have to
dialog: bury them all. I have no choice.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now there’s two of us.
dialog: 83.
text: Eliot holds up the shovel. Jack looks at him for a
text: moment then reaches for the shovel.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - EVENING
text: Anna watches Eliot brush an invisible speck off her
text: mother’s black dress.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You did well this morning.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: This morning?
text: She talks with difficulty now. Her voice SLURRED and
text: HOARSE. Her words muddled and rambling. Her eyes even
text: more sunken. Her skin even more pale.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: When Paul came. You did the right thing.
dialog: You let him go.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: He’1l be all right now? Won’t he?
text: Eliot looks away. Doesn’t reply. He drapes the dress
text: over his arm, picks up a pair of shiny black shoes and
text: moves over to her.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Why do I have to get dressed?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Tomorrow’s your funeral.
text: Eliot lifts Anna’s arms and puts them through the sleeves
text: of the dress. Her body’s stiff and unyielding.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Already?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I told you. You only had three days.
text: He delicately turns her onto her side. Buttons up the dress.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I told you to use your time well.
text: Anna frowns. As if trying to remember something. Eliot
text: gently lifts her legs. Pulls on a pair of black tights.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I need to... I have so many regrets. I
dialog: have nothing but regrets.
dialog: 84.
text: She looks up at him. Suddenly realizing.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: That’s why I’m here isn’t it? To be
dialog: judged.
text: Eliot picks up Anna’s shoes. Slips them onto her stiff feet.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You’re here to understand your life. So
dialog: you can finally be at peace.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I wanted a different life.
text: Eliot picks up a nail-clipper. Gently holds Anna’s hand
text: as he carefully cuts her long nails.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Then why didn’t you do anything about it?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No matter what I did everything just
dialog: stayed the same. I’d wake up. I'd
dialog: shower. Sit in the same traffic
dialog: everyday on my way to work. Go home.
dialog: Go to sleep. Then wake again.
text: Eliot stops clipping her nails. Irritated.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: What did you really want from life?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I just wanted to be happy.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: (derisively)
dialog: Happy? You all say you wanted to be happy.
dialog: What does it mean Anna? To be happy?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I don’t know. Don’t you understand?
dialog: That’s the whole point. I don’t know.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Yes you do! You’re just too scared to
dialog: admit it to yourself.
text: Anna turns away ashamed. She knows he’s right.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I don’t want to talk about it anymore. I
dialog: just want this to be over.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: What did you want from life?
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I don’t fucking know!
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: WHAT DID YOU WANT ANNA?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (screams back)
dialog: I WANTED LOVE! OK!
text: Anna’s stunned. She’s finally admitted it.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I wanted love.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You had love. Paul loved you.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No. You don’t understand. I was scared.
dialog: I wanted to love but I didn’t know how.
dialog: I was...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: When I was a child... my mother.
text: Anna struggles to pull together her thoughts.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: When I was a child. I learnt that love.
dialog: That when you love someone. You get
dialog: hurt. So I learned not to love. That
dialog: way no one could ever hurt me again.
text: She looks down at the slab. Touches the cold marble.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I was always pushing Paul away. He
dialog: thought I didn’t love him.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Did you?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: He was the only one I ever loved. But I
dialog: never told him that. And then he stopped
dialog: loving me.
text: Eliot stares at her intently. Comes to a decision.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: What would you do if you had another
dialog: chance?
text: Anna‘s puzzled. Eliot goes to the door and unlocks it.
text: Moonlight floods in from upstairs. Washing it with a cold
text: light. Anna doesn’t move.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Well? Isn’t this what you wanted?
text: Eliot holds out his hand. Anna takes it hesitantly and
text: rises from the slab.
scene_heading: EXT. FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT
text: Mist drifts through the cemetery. Anna stands in the
text: driveway. Pale and ghoulish in her black funeral dress
text: and shiny black shoes. She starts walking.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Anna approaches her mother’s house. Paul opens the door.
text: He’s not surprised to see her.
text: Beatrice stands just behind him. A black shawl over her
text: head and arms.
scene_heading: INT. MOTHER’S HOUSE. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: In the candlelight we can see the house is full of OLD
text: WOMEN. Their faces deeply lined. Wearing identical
text: black shawls. They stare at Anna, whispering in
text: different rhythms. Unintelligible words undulating like
text: an ANCIENT PRAYER.
scene_heading: INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Paul and Beatrice lead Anna to the bed. As she lies down
text: we realize the bed is full of BLACK SOIL. Clouds of ugly
text: flies hang in the air. BUZZING noisily.
text: The Old Women surround Anna in a tight circle. Leaning
text: over her. Making her feel claustrophobic. She can smell
text: their rotting breath as their prayers grow LOUDER.
text: Through the chaos of words we begin to make out...
speaker_heading: OLD WOMEN
dialog: Spit it out.
text: Anna doesn't understand. Then she feels something in her
text: mouth. Growing. Gagging her. The Women are SCREAMING.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMEN
dialog: Spit it out.
text: Anna spits out... white maggots. She gags again. Closes
text: her eyes. Shakes her head.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No.
dialog: 87.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - NIGHT
text: Anna’s eyes snap open. She’s still in the Prep Room.
text: She steps back from the doorway. Terrified.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I thought you were different. You all
dialog: Say you’re scared of death. But the
dialog: truth is you’re more scared of life.
text: Eliot switches off the lights.
speaker_heading: ANNA (0.C.)
text: I’m glad I’m dead. I’m glad it’s over.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD BY FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT
text: Paul sits in his car. Staring out at the Funeral Home as
text: he nervously smokes a cigarette. The light in Eliot’s
text: room goes off. Paul waits for a moment. Then gets out
text: of his car. Stubs out his cigarette.
scene_heading: EXT. FUNERAL HOME - MOMENTS LATER
text: Paul treads carefully along the side of the Funeral Home.
text: It’s a full moon. The trees rustle ominously in the
text: wind. Casting eerie shadows against the dark house.
text: He finds a window. Tries to open it. It won’t budge.
text: Just then he hears a noise in the bushes. He crouches
text: down quickly. Listens hard. Nothing.
scene_heading: FROM THE BUSHES
text: Someone watches Paul tentatively move to another window.
speaker_heading: FUNERAL HOME
text: Paul strains to open the window when suddenly... he’s
text: caught in a circle of bright light. Paul turns quickly.
text: A DARK FIGURE stands over him. Menacing.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: What the fuck are you doing here?
text: The Figure lowers the flashlight. It’s Tom.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I’m taking you home.
scene_heading: EXT. JACK'S HOUSE. GARDEN - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON black earth. A trowel digs into the soil.
dialog: 88.
text: We pull back. Jack’s just finished digging a hole in the
text: flower bed. A shoebox beside him. He takes off the lid.
text: The Chick trembles in the corner of the box. Jack slowly
text: replaces the lid. Puts the box into the grave. He
text: pushes the earth over it. The box jerks. We hear the
text: faint RUSTLING of the Chick inside.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don’t be scared. It’s better this way.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT’S ROOM - DAWN
text: Eliot lies on his bed. Dressed in a dark suit. He hasn’t
text: slept at all. His eyes rimmed red. He checks the clock on
text: the bedside table. It’s 4.30am. He glances to the
text: window. Dawn light seeps into the room.
scene_heading: EXT. FUNERAL HOME - DAWN
text: Eliot walks through the garden. A pair of small secaters
text: in his hand. He stops by a bed of violets. Still
text: covered in morning dew. He kneels and starts cutting the
text: delicate flowers.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAWN
text: Anna lies on the slab in her burial dress. Her eyes closed.
text: Eliot enters the room. He doesn’t lock the door behind
text: him. Doesn’t turn the lights on. Doesn’t change into
text: his mortician smock.
text: He approaches the slab. The violets in his hand. Pulls
text: over a chair and sits next to Anna. Places the violets
text: on the steel trolley beside her.
text: He looks at her intently. For the first time he seems
text: uncertain. Vulnerable. As if questioning himself.
text: After a while he suddenly gets up and heads towards the
text: door. He’s about to close the door behind him...
speaker_heading: ANNA (0.C.)
dialog: I don’t even know your name.
speaker_heading: ON ANNA
text: Her eyes still closed.
speaker_heading: ON ELIOT
text: Eliot pauses. Too confused to look back at her.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: It’s...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It’s not important.
text: He closes the door.
scene_heading: INT. BEATRICE'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - DAY
text: CLOSE ON Beatrice’s face. Her eyes closed.
text: A HAND delicately powders her forehead. As if she's
text: being prepared for her own funeral. We pull back.
text: Beatrice, dressed in black, sits in front of a mirror.
text: Diane applies her make-up. Beatrice opens her eyes.
scene_heading: INT. PAUL’S APARTMENT. BATHROOM - DAY
text: Paul, badly shaven, leans against the washbasin. Wearing
text: a crumpled black suit. Staring vacantly in the mirror.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY
text: Anna lies in a casket as Eliot arranges her hair.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: (gently)
dialog: It’s time now.
text: She looks up smiling. Eliot positions her hands,
text: entwining her fingers.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You have to look beautiful for your
dialog: funeral.
text: He picks up a SYRINGE and an ampoule of AMBER LIQUID.
text: Fills the syringe.
speaker_heading: ON AMPOULE
text: We glimpse the label: HYDRONIUM BROMIDE.
speaker_heading: ELIOT (0.C.)
dialog: This will relax your muscles. Make your
dialog: skin radiant. As if you were still
text: alive. Just sleeping.
speaker_heading: PREP ROOM
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: This is how they’1l all remember you.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Can I see myself for the last time?
text: Eliot smiles. Picks up a mirror. Hands it to Anna.
speaker_heading: ON MIRROR
text: Anna looks peaceful. Beautiful. Serene.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Is this the end?
speaker_heading: ELIOT (0.C.)
dialog: The last part is the most difficult.
dialog: You’1ll have to face it alone. But you’ll
dialog: be at peace soon.
text: Anna nods. SIGHS deeply... her BREATH FOGS the mirror.
text: She frowns. Touches the SMALL CIRCLE OF CONDENSATION on
text: the glass. Looks up at Eliot in shock.
speaker_heading: PREP ROOM
text: Eliot glances anxiously at the fogged mirror, then at Anna.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You lied to me.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Anna. We've been through this before.
dialog: You're just imagining--
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You lied to me.
text: Eliot injects her in the side of the neck. Anna tries to
text: raise her hand to push him away but she’s too weak.
speaker_heading: ELIOT (0.C.)
dialog: You’re still clutching onto life. Don’t
dialog: give in to your fears. You’re so close.
text: Anna’s fading away. Her hand drops limply to her side.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Why did you lie to me?
text: She stops struggling. Stares blankly at us.
text: Eliot looks at her for a moment. Sadly. Regretfully.
text: He picks up a Polaroid camera. The flash explodes in a
text: blinding white light. He pulls out the Polaroid. Peels
text: off the front and fans it in the air. Then...
dialog: gl.
speaker_heading: ON ANNA
text: ...-delicately closes Anna’s eyelids.
speaker_heading: ELIOT (0.C.)
dialog: Good bye Anna.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Anna’‘s funeral is in progress. Eliot stands by her
text: casket. Surrounded by wreathes of tulips and lilies.
text: Beatrice, in her wheelchair, in the front row. Diane
text: beside her. A SCHOOLTEACHER sits behind them with Jack
text: and other CHILDREN.
speaker_heading: FATHER GRAHAM (0.C.)
dialog: I am the resurrection and the life.
dialog: Those who believe in me, even though they
dialog: die, will live.
text: Tom and Paul appear at the door. Tom guides Paul to a
text: seat near the back.
speaker_heading: FATHER GRAHAM (0.C.)
dialog: They that sleep in the earth will awake
dialog: and shout for joy; and the earth will
dialog: bring those long dead to birth again.
speaker_heading: ON CASKET
text: Anna lies in an open casket. Her eyes closed. She can
text: hear the DISTORTED VOICE of the Priest.
speaker_heading: FATHER GRAHAM (0.C.)
dialog: We have come here today to remember
dialog: before God our sister Anna. To give
dialog: thanks for her life.
speaker_heading: ON ANNA'S FACE
text: We see an almost imperceptible frown.
speaker_heading: VIEWING ROOM
text: Eliot gestures to Beatrice. Diane wheels her to the casket.
text: Beatrice looks at Anna for a moment, then touches the
text: violets in Anna’s hands.
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: Violets. They were her favorite flowers.
dialog: (turns to Eliot)
dialog: How did you know?
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Violets just seemed appropriate somehow.
dialog: 92.
text: Next we see Mrs. Hutton at the casket. Then Jack. He
text: stares at Anna’s body before being moved on by the
text: Schoolteacher. Finally Paul and Tom approach the coffin.
speaker_heading: PAUL'S POV
text: Anna looks serene.
speaker_heading: VIEWING ROOM
text: Paul takes out the ring box from his pocket. Gently
text: slides the engagement ring onto Anna’s stiff finger.
text: Suddenly he looks alarmed. Turns quickly to Tom.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: She’s so cold.
text: Paul turns back to Anna. Tears prick his eyes. He
text: touches her cheek again. Finally accepting her death.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm sorry Anna.
text: He kisses her lips. Eliot watches him carefully. It's
text: almost as if he's jealous. Jack notices Eliot’s look
text: then turns and stares at Paul.
text: As Paul and Tom walk away Eliot closes the casket.
text: Begins to screw down the lid.
scene_heading: INT. INSIDE THE CASKET - SAME TIME
text: It’s dark. We hear the screws TIGHTENING. Anna's eyes
text: FLICKER OPEN then close again.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - SAME TIME
text: Just then Paul turns back sharply. As if he sensed
text: Anna’s reaction inside the casket. Tom gently stops him.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (shakes his head)
text: She’s at peace now.
text: Paul glances at the casket again, then reluctantly allows
text: Tom to lead him away.
text: Eliot tightens the last screw. His back to the room.
text: Suddenly the screwdriver slips. Gashes his finger.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: ON COFFIN
text: A drop of blood falls onto the polished wood.
speaker_heading: VIEWING ROOM
text: Eliot stares at the blood for a moment. Takes out a
text: pristine white handkerchief. Carefully wipes off the
text: blood. Then places his hand on the coffin.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Don’t be scared. It’s better this way.
text: Eliot turns. Signals to the PALLBEARERS standing nearby.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY. ANNA'S GRAVE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: The Pallbearers slowly lower Anna's casket into the open
text: grave. The casket lurches as it settles in the grave.
scene_heading: INT. INSIDE THE CASKET - SAME TIME
text: Anna’s eyes SNAP OPEN in terror. She tries to scream out.
text: But only a SOFT RATTLING WHISPER escapes from her throat.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY. ANNA'S GRAVE - SAME TIME
text: The TEACHER throws a handful of earth onto the coffin.
text: Jack steps up. Looks down curiously. As if he could
text: sense Anna. Then slowly pours the soil from his hand.
speaker_heading: FATHER GRAHAM (0.C.)
dialog: We have but a short time to live. Like a
text: flower we blossom and then wither. In
dialog: the midst of life we are in death.
scene_heading: INT. INSIDE THE CASKET - SAME TIME
text: Blackness. Earth CLATTERS HEAVILY onto the wooden lid.
text: Anna GASPS softly. Hyperventilating. The earth keeps
text: falling. The sound becoming SOFTER with each shovelful.
text: She struggles. Bangs her fists against the wood.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY. ANNA’S GRAVE - LATER
text: The grave’s covered with a stone slab now. Votive candles
text: flicker on top. In the b.g. MOURNERS head to their cars.
text: Paul and Tom stand by the grave.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You sure you’re going to be OK?
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah. Thanks Tom.
text: Tom squeezes Paul’s shoulder then walks away.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - SAME TIME
text: Eliot carefully pins Anna's Polaroid to the wall.
speaker_heading: ON POLAROIDS
text: We pan slowly across the other photographs we saw before.
dialog: But now we look at them differently. In some faces there
text: is the glimmer of life. In some a despairing pleading
text: look. In others passive resignation.
speaker_heading: ELIOT’S ROOM
text: Eliot moves towards the window.
speaker_heading: ELIOT'S POV
text: The dark cemetery. In the distance flickering candles
text: illuminate Anna’s grave.
speaker_heading: ELIOT (0.C.)
dialog: Imagine Anna. The whole world, your
dialog: mother, your fiancée, your friends.
dialog: Everyone has buried you. They've placed
dialog: a stone above your body.
speaker_heading: ELIOT’S ROOM
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: They've said their good byes and gone
text: back to their TV dinners and shopping
dialog: malls. Thinking that this is never going
dialog: to happen to them. Until it’s their turn
dialog: to be buried. Think about it Anna...
text: Eliot glances at his watch.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: ...think about it while you still can.
scene_heading: EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Paul unlocks his car. He’s about to open the car door
text: when he feels someone watching him. He turns. Jack’s
text: observing him carefully.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You said she was alive.
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I never said she was alive. I just said
dialog: I saw her.
text: Paul simply nods his head. Too drained of emotion to react.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You need a ride?
text: Jack shakes his head.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: OK. See you.
text: Paul opens the car door.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Mr. Conran?
dialog: (Paul turns)
dialog: Don't forget to fasten your seat belt.
text: Paul nods. Gets in his car. Jack looks up at the
dialog: Funeral Home.
speaker_heading: JACK'S POV
text: Eliot stands in the window smiling at him.
scene_heading: INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: We're at Anna’s wake. PEOPLE talk quietly in small groups.
text: Paul fills a glass with whiskey. Knocks it back in one.
text: PEOPLE stare disapprovingly. WHISPERING to each other.
speaker_heading: ELIOT (0.C.)
dialog: Don't you think you've had enough to
dialog: drink?
text: Paul turns. Eliot stands beside him. Paul pours himself
dialog: another drink.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Go to hell.
text: An ELDERLY COUPLE shake their heads and walk away.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Mr. Conran. We’re at a wake. You should
dialog: show more respect.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I know she wasn’t dead.
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Wasn’t she?
text: Eliot’s suddenly tired of Paul’s allegations.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Mr. Conran. You come to my Funeral
dialog: Home, making wild accusations. You have
dialog: no idea what happens when someone dies.
dialog: What happens to their body. What
dialog: happens to their soul.
dialog: (taunting)
dialog: You think Anna was alive after the
dialog: accident? Maybe you’re right.
text: Paul’s stunned.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Maybe she’s still alive. You obviously
dialog: don’t believe a word I say. So why don’t
dialog: you go and find out for yourself Mr. Conran.
text: Find out whether she’s alive or dead.
text: Paul grabs Eliot by his lapels. Shoves him against the wall.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: You twisted fuck.
text: The room’s SILENT. Everyone turns towards Paul. Eliot
text: whispers in Paul’s ear.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You don’t have much time left.
text: Father Graham puts his hand on Paul’s arm.
speaker_heading: FATHER GRAHAM
dialog: Please. Paul. You're not well.
text: Paul pushes his hand away. Eliot shakes his head sadly.
text: Everyone looks at Paul with pity as he runs out.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Paul sprints across the lawn to his car.
scene_heading: INT. PAUL’S CAR - NIGHT
text: Paul slips his key into the ignition. His hand’s shaking.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Eliot watches Paul’s car ROAR OFF.
dialog: 97.
scene_heading: INT. INSIDE THE CASKET - SAME TIME
text: We can’t see a thing. But we can hear Anna’s SHORT
text: SHALLOW GASPS. And the sound of her nails desperately
text: SCRATCHING at the coffin lid.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. PAUL’S CAR. ROAD - NIGHT
text: Paul drives fast. Accelerating then quickly braking as
text: he weaves through heavy traffic. He comes up behind a
text: slow Tractor-Trailer. Hits the HORN.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Come on. Come on.
text: He swerves into the middle of the road. There's a blind
text: curve ahead... suddenly an SUV comes out of the corner.
text: A bright white light sweeps through his car. Paul's
text: momentarily blinded.
text: THE SCREEN FLASHES TO WHITE.
text: Paul opens his eyes. The ROAD’S EMPTY. No sign of any
text: traffic. He’s confused. The road was busy a moment ago.
text: Just then flashing red and orange lights illuminate the
text: car. Paul looks in his rear-view mirror.
scene_heading: ON REARVIEW MIRROR
text: An AMBULANCE moves quickly towards him. Blasts past.
speaker_heading: CAR
text: Paul looks through the front windshield. Nothing. He
text: frowns. Where did the ambulance go?
speaker_heading: UP AHEAD
text: We see the Funeral Home. Bone white in the moonlight.
text: The cemetery next to it.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
text: Eliot’s White Van sits by the side of the road.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Paul’s car slams to a halt. He jumps out. In the
text: distance the candles still burn on Anna's grave.
dialog: 98.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY. ANNA'S GRAVE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Paul grabs a shovel by the grave. Starts digging. Then
text: the shovel clunks against wood. He kneels down. Scrapes
text: away the earth from the coffin. Then pulls open the lid.
text: Anna's eyes are WIDE OPEN. Her fingernails torn and bloody.
text: Paul grabs her shoulders. Pulls her out of the grave. Her
text: body slumps limply like a rag doll.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Anna. I’m here. Please God. Anna.
text: He desperately tries to revive her. But there’s no life
text: left in her. He’s about to give up when...
text: Anna’s hand TWITCHES. Then after a moment she GASPS.
text: Her eyes slowly focus on Paul.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Paul?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Baby. Thank God.
text: Paul gently helps Anna to her feet. She looks round.
text: Dazed. Turns back to Paul.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You came back for me.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I came back for you. You're safe now.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Promise?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Promise.
text: Just then Paul hears a rustling sound behind him. He
text: turns. Nothing. He cocks his head slightly. There’s
text: something unnerving about the silence.
text: Suddenly a CROW rises noisily into the air. Paul starts.
text: Then watches, relieved, as the crow disappears into the
text: dark sky. He turns back to Anna... she’s not there.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Anna?
text: Paul looks round desperately. Runs between the stone
text: crosses and statues of grieving angels searching for her.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Anna!
text: Just then he glimpses SOMETHING MOVE among the trees.
text: Runs over. Nothing. The cemetery is empty. The trees
text: appear to SHIMMER for a moment. Paul shivers. Pulls his
text: jacket around him. He doesn’t notice the candles on
text: Anna’s grave behind him suddenly BLOW OUT.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. ELIOT’S VAN. ROAD - NIGHT
text: We hear the sound of a SIREN. The AMBULANCE blasts past.
text: Eliot slides a disc into the player. CLASSICAL MUSIC
text: fills the van. He strums the wheel. Enjoying the music.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Paul frantically runs into the parking lot. still
text: calling out for Anna.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Anna!
text: Suddenly the interior light in his car comes on. Paul
text: looks at the car nervously.
text: He heads over to it. Apprehensive. Then... the car door
text: slowly CLICKS open.
text: Paul stops. Stares into the car. There’s no one there.
scene_heading: INT. PAUL’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Through the windshield we see Paul approach the car.
text: He peers in nervously. Then cautiously gets in. As he
text: switches the interior light off, the camera moves slowly
text: around him revealing...
text: ... ANNA sitting in the passenger seat.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Are we going home?
text: Paul turns sharply. Stunned. Anna moves towards him.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Or do you want to make love here?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Where did you go?
text: Anna puts her fingers on Paul's lips. Clearly turned on.
text: We hear the sound of something being UNZIPPED.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: I’ve been waiting for you. I missed you
dialog: so much.
text: A line of BLOOD trickles from his nose. He touches his
text: lips. Looks blankly at the blood on his fingertips. A
text: drop of blood falls on Paul’s white shirt. It unfurls
text: like a flower. Spreading out over the material.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I love you. I always did.
text: Anna hungrily kisses him. He responds passionately.
text: Suddenly we hear a SHARP METALLIC SOUND.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (alarmed)
dialog: What was that?
text: Anna responds as if it was nothing strange.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: It's only the scissors...
text: We see the growing anxiety in Paul's eyes. Anna's just
text: interested in his lips.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Scissors? What scissors?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Scissors. For your clothes. Eliot just
text: put them on the table.
text: Paul pulls back. Terrified.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You're safe now. We’re finally together.
text: A strong bright light sweeps across Paul’s face. Like
text: the headlights of the car on the blind curve earlier.
text: FADE TO SEARING WHITENESS.
text: Paul blinks as he gradually gets used to the harsh light.
text: Slowly the room comes into focus...
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - NIGHT
text: Eliot stands over Paul holding a pair of BLOODY SCISSORS.
text: Paul looks down. His white shirt soaked with blood, the
text: material sliced open.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Where am I?
dialog: 101.
text: He talks with difficulty. His breath labored.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You’re in a funeral home.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You’re dead.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I’m not dead.
text: Jack appears at Eliot’s side.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You had a car accident. You swerved off
text: the road. On the way to the cemetery.
text: Hit a tree.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I saw Anna. You buried her alive.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: I’m sorry Mr. Conran. You never made it
dialog: to the cemetery. You never saw Anna.
dialog: You’re dead.
text: Paul’s glazed eyes widen in shock.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I’m not dead.
text: Eliot speaks calmly. Soothingly.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: Your skull was crushed. Your spinal cord
dialog: pulverized. Your brain cells are slowly
dialog: dying. Your body’s already decomposing.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I’m not dead.
text: Eliot sighs wearily. He's had this conversation many
dialog: times before.
speaker_heading: ELIOT
dialog: You people. You all say the same thing.
text: Eliot's voice, with each word, fades further and further
text: away. Paul closes his eyes.
text: FADE TO SEARING WHITENESS.
speaker_heading: PAUL (0.S.)
dialog: I’m not dead.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
dialog:
