dialog:

text: BUMPS into it with a GRINDING CRUSH of metal.
dialog: 
text: Not stopping, Pinkerton's taxi continues to GRIND into
text: Carnby's taxi. The momentum pushes Carnby's taxi around
dialog: sideways.
dialog: 
text: Pinkerton's taxi then SLAMS Carnby's sideways taxi into a

dialog: 
text: There's a moment as Carnby, trapped inside the CRUSHED taxi
text: and Pinkerton, flooring the accelerator to add more pressure,

dialog:

dialog: 
text: This gives Carnby the brief moment he needs to extract

text: It's another ORPHAN, with the same fierce, gaunt look and

dialog: 
text: Carnby's bullet WHIZZES past Burke and hits an ORPHAN dead

dialog: 
text: There's a moment as Burke and Carnby look at one another.
text: Burke realizes Carnby just saved his life.
dialog: 
text: The ORPHANS attack.
dialog: 
text: They are the grown-up Children from Carnby's Orphanage. Like
dialog: Pinkerton, they are difficult to kill, immune to pain, fast,
text: and deadly. They all have the same gaunt, wild look, with
text: sunken eyes and nearly clear irises.
dialog: 
text: The Orphans leap out at the Agents, quick and fierce. They
text: bite and claw and use their superhuman strength to throw
text: around the Agents and tear them apart.

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURKE (INTO COMM-LINK)
text: Confirmed. Spinal shot's a kill shot.
dialog: 
text: With this information, the Agents quickly gain the upper-hand

dialog: but they have no organization. Now that the Agents have a

dialog: 
text: Soon, the battle is over. Dozens of bodies of dead Agents and

dialog: Our early work was crude, I admit. But
