scene_heading: INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: It is dark; we don't see clearly. a man and woman make love
text: on a brass bed. There are mirrors on the walls and ceiling.
text: On a side table, atop a small mirror, lines of cocaine. A
text: tape deck PLAYS the Stones "Sympathy for the Devil."
text: Atop him... she straddles his chest... her breasts in his face.
text: He cups her breasts. She leans down, kisses him...
text: JOHNNY BOZ is in his late 40's, slim, good-looking. We don't
text: see the woman's face. She has long blonde hair. The CAMERA
text: STAYS BEHIND and to the side of them.
text: She leans close over his face, her tongue in his mouth... she
text: kisses him... she moves her hands up, holds both of his arms
text: above his head.
text: She moves higher atop him... she reaches to the side of the
text: bed... a white silk scarf is in her hand... her hips above his
text: face now, moving... slightly, oh-so slightly... his face strains
text: towards her.
text: The scarf in her hand... she ties his hands with it...
text: gently... to the brass bed... his eyes are closed... tighter...
text: lowering hips into his face... lower... over his chest... his
text: navel. The SONG plays.
text: He is inside her... his head arches back... his throat white.
text: She arches her back... her hips grind... her breasts are high...
text: Her back arches back... back... her head tilts back... she
text: extends her arms... the right arm comes down suddenly... the
text: steel flashes... his throat is white...
text: He bucks, writhes, bucks, convulses...
text: It flashes up... it flashes down... and up... and down... and
dialog: up... and...
scene_heading: EXT. A BROWNSTONE IN PACIFIC HEIGHTS - MORNING
text: Winter in San Francisco cold, foggy. Cop cars everywhere.
text: The lights play through the thick fog. Two Homicide detectives
text: get out of the car, walk into the house.
text: NICK CURRAN is 42. Trim, good-looking, a nice suit; a face
text: urban, edged, shadowed. GUS MORAN is 64. Crew-cut, silver
text: beard, a suit rumpled and shiny, a hat out of the 50'sa face
text: worn and ruined the face of a backwoods philosopher.
scene_heading: INT. THE BROWNSTONE
dialog: There's money here -- deco, clean, hip -- That looks like a
text: Picasso on the wall. They check it out.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Who was this fuckin' guy?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Rock and roll, Gus. Johnny Boz.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I never heard of him.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (grins)
dialog: Before your time, pop.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Mid-sixties. Five or six hits.
dialog: He's got a club down in the Fillmore
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Not now he don't.
text: Past the uniformed guys... nods... waves... past the forensic
text: men... past the coroner's investigators... they get to the
dialog: bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. THE BEDROOM
text: They walk in, stare -- it's messy.
text: It's like a convention in here. LT. PHIL WALKER, in his 50's,
text: silver-haired, the Homicide guys; JIM HARRIGAN, late 40's,
text: puffy, affable; SAM ANDREWS, 30's, black. A CORONER'S MAN is
text: working the bed.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: (to Nick and Gus)
dialog: You guys know Captain Talcott?
text: They nod.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: What's the Chief's office doin'
dialog: here.
scene_heading: CAPT. TALCOTT
text: Observing.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: (to the Coroner's
dialog: Guy)
dialog: What do you think, Doc?
scene_heading: THE CORONER'S GUY
text: The skin blanches when I press it --
dialog: this kind of color is about right
dialog: for six or eight hours.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
text: Nobody say anything. The maid
text: came in an hour ago and found him.
dialog: She's not a live-in.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Maybe the maid did it.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
text: She's 54 years old and weighs 240
dialog: pounds.
scene_heading: THE CORONER'S GUY
dialog: (deadpan)
text: There are no bruises on his body.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (grins)
dialog: It ain't the maid.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
text: He left the club with his girlfriend
dialog: about midnight. That's the last
dialog: time anybody saw him.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (looks at body)
dialog: What was it?
scene_heading: THE CORONER'S GUY
text: Ice pick. Left on the coffee table
text: in the living room. Thin steel
dialog: handle. Forensics took it downtown.
speaker_heading: HARRIGAN
dialog: There's come all over the sheets --
text: he got off before he got offed.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (deadpan)
text: That rules the maid out for sure.
scene_heading: CAPT. TALCOTT
dialog: This is sensitive. Mr. Boz was a
dialog: major contributor to the mayor's
dialog: campaign. He was Chairman of the
dialog: Board of the Palace of Fine Arts --
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (to Nick)
dialog: I thought you said he was a rock
dialog: and roll star.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: He was a retired rock and roll
dialog: star.
scene_heading: CAPT. TALCOTT
dialog: A civic-minded, very respectable
dialog: rock and roll star.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: What's that over there?
text: We see the white powder laid out in lines on the small mirror
text: on the side table.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: It looks like some civic-minded,
dialog: very respectable cocaine to me,
dialog: Gus.
scene_heading: CAPT. TALCOTT
dialog: (evenly, to Nick)
dialog: Listen to me, Curran. I'm going
dialog: to get a lot of heat on this. I
dialog: don't want any... mistakes.
text: Nick and Talcott look at each other a beat, then --
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Who's the girlfriend?
text: Lt. Walker looks at the notepad in his hand.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: Catherine Tramell, 162 Divisadero.
text: Nick writes it down. He and Gus turn, leave. Captain Talcott
text: watches them. He looks disturbed.
scene_heading: INT. THE LIVING ROOM
text: As they head out --
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Talcott doesn't usually show up at
dialog: the office 'till after his 18 holes.
dialog: What are they nervous about?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: They're executives. They're nervous
dialog: about everything.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: Nick!
text: He stops, turns, sees Walker behind them. Walker comes up to
dialog: them.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: (to Nick)
dialog: Keep your three o'clock.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Do you want me to work the case,
dialog: Phil, or do you want me to --
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: I said keep it.
scene_heading: EXT. A VICTORIAN ON DIVISADERO - DAY
text: It is more a mansion than a house. They ring the bell. An
text: Hispanic MAID answers. They flash their badges.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I'm Detective Curran, this is
dialog: Detective Moran. We're with the
dialog: San Francisco Police Department.
dialog: We'd like to speak to Ms. Catherine Tramell.
speaker_heading: THE MAID
text: (after a beat, an
dialog: accent)
dialog: Just moment. Come in.
text: She leads them into a lavish, beautifully done living room
text: that offers a sweeping view of the Bay.
speaker_heading: THE MAID
dialog: Sit, please. Just moment.
text: They look around, impressed. There is a Picasso on the wall
dialog: here, too.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Ain't that cute? They got his and
dialog: her Pig-assos, son.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I didn't know you knew who Picasso
dialog: was, Gus.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (grins)
dialog: I'm a smart sonofabitch. I just
dialog: hide it.
text: Nick smiles -- and at that moment a beautiful BLONDE walks
text: into the room. She looks like she has been asleep. She is in
text: her early 20's. She wears a very sheer robe.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: We're sorry to disturb you, we'd
dialog: like to ask you some --
speaker_heading: THE WOMAN
dialog: Are you vice?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Homicide.
speaker_heading: THE WOMAN
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: When was the last time you saw
dialog: John Boz?
speaker_heading: THE WOMAN
dialog: Is he dead?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Why do you think he's dead?
speaker_heading: THE WOMAN
dialog: You wouldn't be here otherwise,
dialog: would you?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Were you with him last night?
speaker_heading: THE WOMAN
dialog: You're looking for Catherine, not
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: THE WOMAN
dialog: I'm Roxy.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I'm her -- friend.
text: She looks at them a beat.
speaker_heading: ROXY
text: She's out at the beach house at
text: Stinson. Seadrift. 1402.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Thanks.
text: They start to head out.
speaker_heading: ROXY
dialog: You're wasting your time. Catherine
dialog: didn't kill him.
text: A beat, they look at her, and go...
scene_heading: EXT. SEADRIFT - STINSON BEACH - DAY
text: Foggy. Cold. It is an expensive spit of land on the ocean.
text: Multi-million dollar "beach houses" with gardens and swimming
text: pools. There are two Ferraris in the driveway -- one black,
dialog: one white.
text: They get out of the car in front of the house. They see a
text: woman in back of the house, sitting on a deck chair, staring
text: at the sea, a blanket around her. As they get to her --
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Ms. Tramell?
text: She takes a long look a Nick, then looks away.
text: CATHERINE TRAMELL is 30 years old. She has long blonde hair
text: and a refined, classically beautiful face. She is not knockout
text: gorgeous like Roxy; there is a smoky kind of sensuousness about
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I'm De...
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (evenly)
dialog: I know who you are.
text: She doesn't look at them. She looks at the water.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: How did he die?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: He was murdered.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Really. Maybe that's why you're
dialog: from Homicide. How?
text: Nick glances at Gus.
speaker_heading: NICK
text: With an ice pick.
text: She closes her eyes a beat and then, still staring out, we see
text: a thin smile. They see it, too, and glance at each other.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: How long were you dating him?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I wasn't dating him. I was fucking
dialog: him.
text: They glance at each other again.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: What are you -- a pro?
text: Catherine looks at him -- that thin smile again.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: No. I'm an amateur.
text: She looks away.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: How long were you having sex with
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: About a year and a half.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Were you with him last night?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Did you leave the club with him?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Did you go home with him?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: No. We had a drink at the club.
dialog: We left together. I came here.
dialog: He went home.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Was there anyone with you last
dialog: night?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (looks at Nick)
dialog: No. I wasn't in the mood to have
dialog: sex with anyone last night.
text: They look at her a beat.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Let me ask you something, Ms.
dialog: Tramell? Are you sorry he's dead?
text: Catherine looks at him.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Yes. I liked fucking him.
text: They stare at her. She looks out at the water.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I don't really feel like talking
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Listen, lady, we can do this
dialog: downtown if you --
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Read me my rights and arrest me
dialog: and I'll go downtown.
text: She doesn't even look at them.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Otherwise, get the fuck out of
dialog: here. Please.
text: A long beat as they look at her.
scene_heading: INT. A CORRIDOR - POLICE HEADQUARTERS
text: The door says Dr. Elizabeth Gardner, Counseling. Nick opens
text: the door, peeks in. The receptionist is not there. A clock
dialog: says 3.
scene_heading: INT. THE COUNSELING OFFICE
text: He walks in -- sees the inner door open, walks in.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I'm sorry, Beth. I -- I got hung
text: up in Stinson.
text: DR. ELIZABETH GARDNER, the police psychologist, is a very good-
text: looking, dark-haired woman. She is 30.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: How are you, Nick?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I'm fine. Come on, Beth! You
dialog: know I'm fine! How the hell long
dialog: do I have to keep doing this?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: As long as Internal Affairs wants
dialog: you to, I suppose. Sit down, Nick.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It's bullshit. You know it is.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I know it is -- but sit down anyway
dialog: so we can get it over with, okay?
text: He sits down.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: So -- how are things?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Things are fine. I told you.
dialog: They're fine.
text: She watches him closely.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: How is your -- personal life?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: My sex life is fine.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: My sex life is pretty shitty
dialog: actually since I stopped seeing
dialog: you -- maybe I should think about
dialog: my Electrolux again.
text: That embarrassed her; she looks away from him.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Sorry.
text: She shrugs. A beat.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: How about the booze?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It's been three months.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (after a long beat)
dialog: How about the coke?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (hard)
dialog: No! I'm working my tail off. I'm
dialog: off the sauce, I'm not even smoking
dialog: anymore.
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: How's not smoking?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It's fucked -- now will you please
dialog: tell I.A. that I'm just you average
dialog: healthy totally fucked-up cop and
dialog: let me get out of here?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (after a beat; smiles)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Thank you.
text: And he starts heading out.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (behind him)
dialog: I still miss you, Nick.
text: He doesn't even turn, pretends he didn't hear.
scene_heading: INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU
text: He walks in. Gus Moran gets up from his desk as soon as he
text: sees him.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Talcott's in there. They're
dialog: waiting.
text: They start heading for Lt. Walker's office.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: How'd it go, son?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: She misses me.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (grins)
dialog: Hallelujah.
scene_heading: INT. LT. WALKER'S OFFICE
text: He and Gus sit there with Lt. Walker, Harrigan, Andrews and
dialog: Captain Talcott.
speaker_heading: HARRIGAN
text: Sixteen stab wounds to the chest
dialog: and neck. No usable prints, no
text: forcible entry, nothing missing.
dialog: No prints on the ice pick, either --
dialog: it's available at any Safeway.
dialog: The scarf is Hermes, expensive --
dialog: they sell about 20,000 a year
dialog: worldwide.
speaker_heading: ANDREWS
dialog: The powder was cocaine, high-
dialog: quality, high-content. He inhaled
dialog: it; there were minute quantities
text: on his lips and penis. Mr. Boz
dialog: leaves five million dollars, no
dialog: insurance, no direct survivors.
dialog: He liked his coke, he liked his
dialog: girls, and he liked rock and roll.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: He liked the mayor, too, right?
text: Talcott gives him a look.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: What about his girlfriend?
speaker_heading: TALCOTT
dialog: Is she relevant here? I didn't
dialog: know she was a suspect.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: She's a suspect.
speaker_heading: TALCOTT
dialog: On what basis?
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: (looks a notes)
dialog: Catherine Tramell. Age 30. No
dialog: priors, no convictions. Double
dialog: major, magnum cum laude, Berkeley,
dialog: 1980. Literature and Psychology.
dialog: Daughter, sole survivor -- Marvin
dialog: and Elaine Tramell, killed in a
dialog: boating accident, 1978, Catherine
dialog: Tramell sole heir. Estimated assets
dialog: $110 million.
text: It hangs there.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Are you kidding me?
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: (continues)
dialog: Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez,
dialog: deceased --
speaker_heading: ANDREWS
dialog: Bobby Vasquez?
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: Bobby Vasquez, former middleweight
text: contender, killed in the ring
dialog: Atlantic City, 1984.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I love it. She's got a hundred
dialog: million bucks. She fucks fighters
dialog: and rock and roll stars. And she's
dialog: got a degree in screwing with
dialog: peoples' heads.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: You forgot her degree in literature.
dialog: She's a writer. She published a
dialog: novel last year under a pen name.
dialog: Do you want to know what it's about?
text: They just stare at him.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: It's about a retired rock and roll
text: star who is murdered by his
dialog: girlfriend.
text: It hangs there a long beat.
scene_heading: INT. NICK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: His apartment is very bare -- very few things -- with wide
text: open spaces. There is a lot of chrome.
text: He sits on the couch, reading a book. It is a paperback.
text: We see the title -- Love Hurts, by Catherine Adams. He puts
text: the book down a beat, then picks the phone up, dials.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Page 67, pop. Do you know how she
dialog: does the boyfriend? With an
text: icepick, in bed, his hands tied
text: with a white silk scarf.
scene_heading: INT. A POLICE DEPARTMENT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: Nick, Gus, Lt. Walker, Harrigan, Andrews, Captain Talcott --
text: and Beth Gardner. With them is an older, white-haired man,
text: DR. ANDREW LAMOTT. There are copies of "Love Hurts" around
dialog: the table.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: Dr. Gardner?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I've asked Dr. Lamott to consult
dialog: with us. This isn't really my
text: turf. Dr. Lamott teaches the psycho-
dialog: pathology of psychopathic behavior
dialog: at Stanford and is also a member
dialog: of the Justice Department's
dialog: Psychological Profile team. Dr.
dialog: Lamott?
scene_heading: DR. LAMOTT
dialog: There are two possibilities. One.
dialog: The person who wrote this book is
dialog: your murderer and acted out the
dialog: killing described in ritualistic,
dialog: literal detail. Two. Someone who
dialog: wants to do the person who wrote
dialog: this book harm read the book and
dialog: enacted the killing described to
dialog: incriminate the writer.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (after a long beat)
dialog: What if the writer did it? What
dialog: are we dealing with?
scene_heading: DR. LAMOTT
dialog: You're dealing with a devious,
dialog: diabolical mind. This book must
dialog: have been written at least six
dialog: months, maybe years before it was
dialog: published. That means the writer
dialog: planned the crime, at least in the
dialog: subconscious, back then. The fact
dialog: that the writer carried it out
dialog: indicates psychopathic obsessive
dialog: behavior in terms not only of the
dialog: killing itself but in terms of
dialog: applied advance defense mechanism.
text: A long beat.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Most times I can't tell shit from
dialog: shinola, Doc. What was all that
dialog: you just said?
text: Some grins, titters.
speaker_heading: BETH
text: She anticipates the book to be her
dialog: best alibi.
scene_heading: DR. LAMOTT
dialog: Correct.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: She's going to say Do you think
dialog: I'd be dumb enough to kill anyone
dialog: in the exact way I've described in
dialog: my book? I wouldn't do that because
dialog: I'd know I'd be a suspect.
text: A long beat -- as they think about it.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What if it's not the writer? What
dialog: if it's someone who read the book?
scene_heading: DR. LAMOTT
dialog: You're dealing then with someone
text: so obsessed that he or she is
dialog: willing to kill an irrelevant and
dialog: innocent victim to place the blame
dialog: on the person who wrote this book.
dialog: We are talking about deep-seated,
dialog: obsessional hatred; an utter lack
dialog: of sense of proportion or
dialog: perspective.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: We've got a top-of-the-line, once-
dialog: in-a-lifetime loony-tune either
dialog: way you cut it -- that's what you're
dialog: saying, right, Doc?
scene_heading: DR. LAMOTT
dialog: You're dealing with someone very
dialog: dangerous and very ill.
scene_heading: INT. THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
text: PROSECUTOR JOHN CORRIGAN, a big man in his 50's, with Captain
text: Talcott, Lt. Walker, Nick, and Gus.
text: Corrigan is reading a file. He gets up, yawns, goes to his
text: window, looks out.
speaker_heading: CORRIGAN
dialog: Come on, you know there's no case
dialog: here. There's no physical evidence --
dialog: okay, she doesn't have an alibi
dialog: but there's no motive. Her defense
dialog: would just beat us to death with
dialog: the copycat thing. Anybody who
dialog: read the book could have done it.
text: A long beat; no one says anything.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: So what do we do -- nothing?
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: We bring her in for questioning.
speaker_heading: TALCOTT
dialog: She's got enough money to burn
dialog: this whole department down.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: She was the last person seen with
dialog: the guy -- I'll take the
dialog: responsibility.
speaker_heading: TALCOTT
dialog: It's yours.
speaker_heading: CORRIGAN
dialog: It won't do any good. She'll come
dialog: in with Lee Bailey and Mel Belli
text: trailing behind her on a solid
dialog: gold chain from Tiffanys.
speaker_heading: TALCOTT
dialog: Yes she will.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: No she won't.
text: They look at him.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I don't think she's going to hide
dialog: behind anybody. I don't think
dialog: she's going to hide at all.
speaker_heading: TALCOTT
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: I think you're as crazy as she
dialog: probably is, Curran.
text: Nicks says nothing.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: You know what they say: It takes
dialog: one to know one.
text: Nick looks a Gus, grins.
scene_heading: EXT. HER HOUSE IN STINSON - DAY
text: They walk from the car to the door of the big beach house.
text: They ring the bell. They hear typing inside. The typing stops.
text: She comes to the door in jeans and a tight-fitting sweatshirt.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come
dialog: downtown and answer some questions
dialog: for us.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Are you arresting me?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: If that's the way you want to play
dialog: it.
text: They look at each other a beat.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Can I change into something more
dialog: appropriate? It'll just take a
dialog: minute.
text: He nods.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Come in.
scene_heading: INT. THE HOUSE
text: It is beautifully done in a Santa Fe motif. She goes to a
text: bedroom of the living room.
text: Nick sits down on a couch facing the bedroom she's walked into.
text: Gus sits across from him, his back to the bedroom.
text: There is a coffee table between them. She leaves the bedroom
text: door halfway open.
text: An old newspaper is on the coffee table. Nick reaches for it.
text: The headline says VICE COP CLEARED IN TOURIST SHOOTINGS. A
text: headline underneath says GRAND JURY SAYS SHOOTINGS ACCIDENTAL.
text: There is a photograph of Nick.
text: He stares at the paper.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: How long will this take?
text: Nick puts the paper down on the coffee table. He is lost in
text: his thoughts. Gus picks the paper up.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (looks up)
dialog: I don't know.
text: Nick, facing the half open bedroom door, sees a mirror near
text: the wall of the bedroom. The mirror reflects her in the other
text: corner of the bedroom. She is taking her clothes off. He
text: stares. She strips down. He sees her back. She has a beautiful
text: body. Naked, she puts a dress on. She doesn't put any
text: underwear on.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Do you always keep old newspapers
dialog: around?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Only when they make interesting
dialog: reading.
text: And she is suddenly out of the bedroom. She stands there,
text: smiles. They look at each other a long beat.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (finally)
dialog: I'm ready.
text: They get up, head out.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: You have the right to an attorney.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Why would I need an attorney?
scene_heading: INT. THE CAR - DAY
text: They sit in the front; she is in the back. The car goes over
text: the winding, two-lane Mt. Tamalpais road.
text: The fog is heavy. It's starting to rain. We see the beach
text: far below.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Do you have a cigarette?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I don't smoke.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Yes, you do.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I quit.
text: She smiles, looks at him. A beat, and he turns away. Another
text: beat, and she lights a cigarette up.

text: He turns back to her.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I told you -- I quit.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: It won't last.
text: A beat, as she looks at him, and then he turns away.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: You workin' on another book?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Yes I am.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: It must really be somehtin' --makin'
dialog: stuff up all the time.
text: He watches her in the rearview mirror.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: It teaches you to lie.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: How's that?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: You make it up, but it has to be
dialog: believable. They call it suspension
dialog: of disbelief.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I like that. "Suspension of
dialog: Disbelief."
text: He smiles at her in the mirror.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What's your new book about?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
text: A detective. He falls for the
dialog: wrong woman.
text: He turns back to her.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What happens to him?
text: She looks right into his eye.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
text: She kills him.
text: A beat, as they look at each other, and then he turns away
text: from her. Gus watcher her in the rearview mirror.
scene_heading: INT. A POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
text: It is large, fluorescent-lighted, antiseptic.
text: She walks in with Nick and Gus. In the room are prosecutor
text: John Corrigan, Lt. Walker, Captain Talcott, Harrigan, and
text: Andrews. There is a police stenographer a plain young woman
text: in her 20's.
text: As soon as she comes in --
speaker_heading: CORRIGAN
dialog: I'm John Corrigan. I'm an assistant
dialog: district attorney, Ms. Tramell.
dialog: Can we get you anything? Would
dialog: you like some coffee?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: No thank you.
speaker_heading: TALCOTT
dialog: Are your attorneys --
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (hiding a smile)
dialog: Ms. Tramell waived her right to an
dialog: attorney.
text: Corrigan and Talcott glance at Nick. She sees the look.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Did I miss something?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I told them you wouldn't want an
dialog: attorney present.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: Why have you waived your right to
dialog: an attorney, Ms. Tramell?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (to Nick)
dialog: Why did you think I wouldn't want
dialog: one?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I told them you wouldn't want to
dialog: hide.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I have nothing to hide.
text: The two of them keep their eyes on each other.
text: She sits down. They sit around her. Nick sits directly across
text: from her. She lights up a cigarette. They watch her.
text: She is poised, cool, in complete command of herself.
speaker_heading: CORRIGAN
dialog: There is no smoking in this
text: building, Ms. Tramell.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: What are you going to do? Charge
dialog: me with smoking?
text: Ever so casually, she blows her smoke across at Nick.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER
speaker_heading: CORRIGAN
dialog: Would you tell us the nature of
dialog: your relationship with Mr. Boz?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I had sex with him for about a
dialog: year and a half. I liked having
dialog: sex with him.
text: She has control of the room; she looks from one man to the
text: other as she speaks.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: He wasn't afraid of experimenting.
dialog: I like men like that. I like men
dialog: who give me pleasure. He gave me
dialog: a lot of pleasure.
text: A beat, as they watch her. She is so matter-of-fact.
speaker_heading: CORRIGAN
dialog: Did you ever engage in sado-
dialog: masochistic activity with him?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Exactly what do you have in mind,
dialog: Mr. Corrigan.
speaker_heading: CORRIGAN
text: (after a beat, little
dialog: flustered)
dialog: Did you ever tie him up?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ANDREWS
dialog: You never tied him up.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: No. Johnny liked to use his hands
dialog: too much. I like hands and fingers.
text: They stare at her.

scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: You describe a white silk scarf in

speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I've always had a fondness for
text: white silk scarves.
dialog: (she smiles)
dialog: I have a very vivid imagination.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: But you said you liked men to use
dialog: their hands.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: No. I said I liked Johnny to use
text: his hands.
dialog: (she smiles)
dialog: I don't give any rules, Nick. I
dialog: go with the flow.
text: They have their eyes on each other.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER
speaker_heading: CORRIGAN
dialog: Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I'd have to be pretty stupid to
dialog: write a book about a killing and
dialog: then kill him the way I described
dialog: in my book. I'd be announcing myself
dialog: as the killer. I'm not stupid.
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: TALCOTT
dialog: We know you're not stupid, Ms.
dialog: Tramell.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: Maybe that's what you're counting
dialog: on to get you off the hook.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Writing a book about it gives you
text: an alibi for not killing him.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Yes it does, doesn't it?
text: She holds his eyes a second, then --
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: The answer is no. I didn't kill
dialog: him.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE

speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: What kind of drugs?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Cocaine.

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You like playing games, don't you?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I've got a degree in psych. It
dialog: goes with the turf. Games are
dialog: fun.
text: They are holding each other's eyes.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: How about boxing? That's a game.
dialog: Was that fun for you?
text: They don't take their eyes off each other for a second.
speaker_heading: TALCOTT
dialog: I think that's irrelevant to this
dialog: inquiry.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (to Nick)
dialog: Yes it was. Bobby died.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: How did you feel when he died?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I loved him. I hurt.
text: Their eyes are still on each other.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: How did you feel when I told you
dialog: Johnny Boz had died -- that day at
dialog: the beach.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I felt somebody had read my book
text: and was playing a game.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: But you didn't hurt --
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Because you didn't love him --
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: That's right.
text: Their eyes are digging into each other.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Even though you were fucking him.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: You still get the pleasure. Didn't
dialog: you ever fuck anybody else while
dialog: you were married, Nick?
text: A beat; he stares at her, expressionless.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: How did you know he was married?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (watching Nick)
dialog: Maybe I was guessing. What
dialog: difference does it make?
text: She lights a cigarette. He stares at her.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Would you like a cigarette, Nick?
text: He just stares at her, expressionless.
speaker_heading: CORRIGAN
dialog: Do you two know each other?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: No.
scene_heading: INT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER
speaker_heading: ANDREWS
dialog: How did you meet Mr. Boz?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I wanted to write a book about the
dialog: murder of a retired rock star. I
dialog: went down to his club and picked
dialog: him up. Then I had sex with him.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: You didn't feel anything for him.
dialog: You just had sex with him for your
dialog: book.
text: She looks at Nick.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: In the beginning. Then I got to
dialog: like what he did for me.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I'm a writer, I use people for
dialog: what I write. You write what you
dialog: know. Let the world beware.
text: She and Nick have their eyes on each other, then --
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (to Corrigan, smiles)
dialog: Would you like me to take a lie
dialog: detector test?
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE POLICE BUILDING - NIGHT
text: We see her in a glass-enclosed cubicle with a polygraph
text: EXAMINER. Nick stands outside watching her with Gus and Lt.
text: Walker. Her back is to them. The Examiner shuts the machine
text: down, gathers rolls of papers, and comes out of the cubicle.
speaker_heading: THE EXAMINER
dialog: No blips, no blood pressure
dialog: variations, no pulse variance.
text: Either she's telling the truth or
dialog: I've never met anyone like her.
text: A long beat, then --
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: Well, I guess that's it.
text: A long beat, Nick watches her as she sits inside.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: How does somebody beat this machine?
speaker_heading: THE EXAMINER
dialog: Ninety-nine point nine percent of
dialog: the cases, they don't. You'd have
dialog: to be able to mask the truth from
dialog: your own central nervous system,
dialog: your circulatory system, your
dialog: adrenal glands. In my opinion,
text: this woman is telling the truth.
text: The Examiner walks away. They stand there. Catherine stands
text: at the door of the cubicle behind them --
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Can I go now?
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Yes. Thanks for coming in, Ms.
dialog: Tramell. I'm sorry to inconvenience
dialog: you.
text: She says nothing, has a thin smile.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Can I ask one of you for a ride?
text: They look at her a beat.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Thanks.
text: And he and Catherine walk away. Gus and Walker watch them.
scene_heading: INT. HIS CAR - NIGHT
text: It is an old, mint-condition silver Porsche. It is pouring
text: rain; the wind is blowing a San Francisco winter storm. Nothing
text: is said a long beat as he drives. She yawns. Stretches. He
text: looks at her.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I'm tired.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It's got to be tiring to beat that
text: machine.
text: She looks at him and looks away. A beat.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: If I were guilty, and if I wanted
dialog: to beat that machine, it wouldn't
dialog: be tiring. It wouldn't be tiring
dialog: at all.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Because I'm a professional liar.
dialog: I spend most of my waking hours
dialog: dwelling on my lies.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: For my writing.
text: He looks at her.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I love the rain, don't you?
text: He says nothing, doesn't look at her.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: You took a polygraph after you
dialog: shot those two people, didn't you?
text: He looks at her now.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I passed.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: You see? We're both innocent,
dialog: Nick.
text: He pulls up in front of her house on Divisadero, stops. He
text: sees the white Ferrari in the driveway.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: How do you know all this stuff
dialog: about me?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: You know all about me.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I don't know anything that isn't
dialog: police business.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: You know I don't like to wear any
dialog: underwear, don't you, Nick?
text: They look at each other a beat.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Thanks for the ride.
text: And she's out of the car. He watches her as she hurries in
text: the rain -- his eyes on her until the moment she opens the
text: door and is inside.
scene_heading: INT. THE TEN-FOUR - NIGHT
text: It is a police bar, San Francisco style. Ferns Joe Montana
text: and Will Clark posters. The jukebox has a lot of Tony Bennett.
text: He walks in. He sees Lt. Walker at a back booth with Gus,
text: goes to them, sits down.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: What is all this "Nick" stuff --
dialog: Nick would you like a cigarette.
dialog: Nick can you give me a ride.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: She didn't ask me for the ride.
dialog: She asked anybody.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: And you volunteered.
text: A BARTENDER stays behind the bar, but yells to him.
speaker_heading: THE BARTENDER
dialog: Perrier, Nick?
speaker_heading: NICK
text: Double Black Jack rocks, Harry.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (with concern)
dialog: What you doin', son?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It's my first drink in three months.
dialog: That okay with you, pop?
dialog: (to Lt. Walker)
dialog: She doesn't know me. I never saw
dialog: her before Gus and I talked to
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: THE BARTENDER
dialog: Here you go, Nick.
text: He gets up, gets his drink --
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Thanks, Harry.
text: He sits back down. He takes a big slug. They watch him.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I'm sure.
text: He takes another big slug.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Now what?
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: What now what? Now nothing. She
dialog: passed the polygraph. That's it.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: She knew she could beat it. That's
dialog: why she asked to take it.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: How the fuck do you know? What is
dialog: it with you and this broad anyway?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Come on, Phil. You're not gonna
dialog: let this slide. What about her
dialog: parents? What about what else
dialog: she's published? At least we should
dialog: get the stuff to see if we find
dialog: anything else that's an amazing
dialog: real-life coincidence.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: Her parents died in an accident.
dialog: I don't care what else she's
dialog: written. What are you -- a book
dialog: critic?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: How did they die? Was there an
dialog: investigation?
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: How you're saying she killed her
dialog: parents? Did she kill Bobby
dialog: Vasquez, too?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Not unless she got up in the ring
dialog: and turned into one mean
dialog: sonofabitch.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: Maybe she did, Gus. Maybe she
dialog: grew herself an Afro and learned a
text: left hook and put shoe polish on
dialog: her face. Let's polygraph her
dialog: again and ask her about it.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (casually)
dialog: Fuck you, Phil.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: Fuck you, too Nick.
dialog: A beat, then --
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (calls to the
dialog: Bartender)
dialog: Can you get me another double Black
dialog: Jack, Harry.
text: Gus looks at him with concern. A man in his 50's -- LT. MARTIN
text: NILSEN is suddenly there. He is overweight, florid.
speaker_heading: NILSEN
dialog: (to Nick)
dialog: Hey, shooter -- You back on the
dialog: Black Jack, Shooter?
text: He grins. Nick doesn't look at him.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: We're discussing a case, Marty.
speaker_heading: NILSEN
dialog: I know that. I had no doubt of
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: THE BARTENDER
dialog: Here you go, Nick.
text: Nilsen takes the drink, hands it to Nick.
speaker_heading: NILSEN
dialog: (grins)
dialog: Double, huh, Shooter?
text: Nick turns to him. He's sitting in the booth; Nilsen is
text: standing there. Nick looks like he's barely restraining
dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I'm off-duty, Nilsen. You hear
dialog: me? I'm off-duty discussing a
dialog: case. Internal Affairs shouldn't
dialog: have any trouble with that. Maybe
dialog: I should put in for overtime.
speaker_heading: NILSEN
dialog: (grins)
dialog: You do that, Shooter. Why don't
dialog: you send it to me? I'll give it
dialog: special attention.
text: A beat, and then Nick gets up, faces him.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I'm gonna tell you once more, Nilsen --
text: Lt. Walker and Gus get up and hold Nick back.
text: Beth Gardner, the police psychologist, is suddenly there.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What's the problem?
speaker_heading: NILSEN
dialog: (grins)
dialog: No problem, Doctor. Here comes
text: the Doctor just in time to save
dialog: her patient. Take care, Shooter.
text: And he walks away. Nick still looks like he wants to go after
text: him. Beth pulls him away from the booth.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: You don't look so okay.
text: Nick looks at her a beat.
speaker_heading: NICK

dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (smiles)
text: Baby-sitting.
dialog: (she shrugs)
dialog: Rookie cop.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: What else is new?
text: A beat. He looks at her again.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You want to get out of here?
text: She looks at him a beat.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Yes.
text: At the booth, Gus and Lt. Walker watch the two of them leave.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Maybe it's for old-time's sake.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: (watches them go
dialog: out)
dialog: Sometimes I think he started banging
dialog: her just to get himself off the
dialog: hook with Internal Affairs.
speaker_heading: GUS
text: (after a beat, smiles)
dialog: He ain't that way. He's got heart.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Yeah. I know.
scene_heading: INT. BETH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: He is kissing her -- hard, rough. He forces her against the
dialog: wall.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Don't -- please, Nick --
text: We hear her dress RIP. He kisses her harder -- we hear her
text: panties RIP. He gets the dress off, pushes his hands under
dialog: her bra --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Please don't -- don't --
text: He puts his mouth to her shoulder, bites it -- as they move
text: down to the floor.
scene_heading: INT. BETH'S LIVING ROOM - LATER
text: It is dark. The are still partially dressed. They are on the
text: floor. He lies on his back, staring at the ceiling.
text: She lies next to him -- the torn dress wound around her.
text: There is a bite mark on her shoulder. A long beat, silence --
dialog: then --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What was she like?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Catherine Tramell.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: She said what you said she'd say.
text: She sits up, looks away. He looks at her, puts his finger on
text: the bite mark idly, gently. A beat, and he kisses her shoulder
text: gently, then lies back down.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I met her at Berkeley.
text: He looks at her.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: We were in some of the same classes.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Why didn't you tell me?
text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I'm telling you.
text: They look at each other a long beat.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (with difficulty)
dialog: You've never been... like that...
dialog: before.
text: He says nothing, looks away from her.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Why?
text: He doesn't look at her a long beat, says nothing.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You're the shrink.
text: She keeps looking at him. He won't look at her.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You weren't making love to me.
text: A beat; he looks at her.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Who was I making love to?
text: She looks at him a long beat.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You weren't making love.
text: They look at each other, a long beat, then away. He lies back
text: down. Beth doesn't look at him, keeps sitting up.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (finally)
dialog: I need a cigarette.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: I thought you quit.
text: He says nothing.
speaker_heading: BETH
text: Top drawer in the foyer.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Get it on your way out.
text: He looks at her; she won't look at him.
scene_heading: INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - MORNING
text: He walks in. He looks hung-over. He sees Gus with Harrigan
text: and Andrews and Lt. Walker in Lt. Walker's glass-enclosed office
text: at the end of this big room.
text: They look at him when they see him.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: You look like dogshit.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (grins)
text: He looks a little shrunk, that's
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: ANDREWS
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: We got a call from Berkeley P.D.
text: There was a killing. A professor.
text: Icepick. In his bed. Multiple
dialog: stab wounds. 1977.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (a thin smile)
dialog: She was there, wasn't she?
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: University records say she was
dialog: there.

scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: Gus -- go over to Berkeley.
dialog: Harrigan -- find out what else
dialog: she's published. Andrews -- get
text: the files on her parents' accident.
dialog: Carbon Beth on everything. I want
dialog: some psychological input on this
text: Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is
text: left there with Gus.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What about me?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: You're already gettin' psychological
dialog: input, son.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: (to Nick)
dialog: Go stick your head in a tub of ice
dialog: water.
dialog: (a beat; then
dialog: seriously)
dialog: See where she leads.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BEACH HOUSE AT STINSON - DAY
text: The black Ferrari is in the driveway. He sits in an unmarked
text: police car on a hillside above the house, watching. It is a
text: bleak, leaden gray day.
text: Catherine comes out of the house. She is dressed casually.
text: She gets into the Ferrari.
scene_heading: INT. HIS POLICE CAR
text: He stays behind her at a safe distance on the winding panoramic
text: highway -- a two-lane mountain road which leads from Stinson
dialog: Beach into Marin County.
text: She suddenly starts speeding up on this dangerous road, cutting
text: in and out, passing cars very fast.
text: He has to start cutting around cars to keep up. This woman
dialog: really drives.
text: He cuts out and can barely pass a car without hitting a Grey
text: Lines Tour Bus head-on. Close call: sheer drops on either
dialog: side.
text: He looks frazzled.
scene_heading: INT. HIS POLICE CAR
text: He is behind her at a distance on a hilly Mill Valley road --
text: little streets, terraced hillsides, sharp turns.
text: He goes slowly, looks around, thinks he's lost her. And then
text: he sees the black Ferrari parked in front of a house obscured
text: by hedges.
text: He parks the car a distance behind the Ferrari, sits there a
text: long beat. He gets out, goes carefully up to the hedges, looks.
text: A small, nondescript house. He watches. He can't see anything
text: inside the house.
text: A beat, he reaches over to the mailbox and opens it. He takes
text: an envelope out, looks at the name Hazel Dobkins.
scene_heading: INT. HIS POLICE CAR - NIGHT
text: He watches as she comes out of the house. A frail old woman
text: in her 70's is with her. She hugs the old woman, gets into
text: the Ferrari, STARTS it up.
text: He waits a beat and then STARTS after her. He stays behind
text: her at a distance -- she is going slowly. And then she suddenly
text: GUNS it, cuts her lights -- her wheels SCREECH.
text: He GUNS his car after her. He makes a turn. She is gone.
text: There is a fork in the road. He turns one way, goes a few
text: hundred feet.
text: Nothing. Blackness. He stops.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Shit.
scene_heading: INT. HIS POLICE CAR - NIGHT
text: He pulls his car up to her house at Stinson Beach. The black
text: Ferrari is in the driveway.
text: A light goes on in an upstairs bedroom. The curtain is drawn.
text: He sees the outline of her body now.
text: She starts to take her clothes off -- there in the window,
text: behind the curtain. He watches her body as she does an almost
text: languorous strip. His eyes are intense... ravishing.
scene_heading: INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - NIGHT
text: He is alone, nobody else in the big room.
text: He sits in front of a computer. We see the screen. He has
dialog: punched in
scene_heading: HAZEL DOBKINS, WF, 145 ALBION RD., MILL VALLEY.
text: He is waiting for a response. We see it come on screen
scene_heading: NOTHING CURRENT.
text: A long beat, as he stares at the screen, and then we see these
dialog: words

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (slowly)

scene_heading: EXT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE - NEXT DAY
text: He pulls up to the house, gets out of his unmarked police car.
text: He stands there a beat, thinking. He walks down to the beach
text: entrance of the house. He hears a Rolling Stones SONG playing
text: inside. He stands there. The door suddenly opens. Catherine
text: stands there, smiles. She wears very tight-fitting spandex
dialog: leotards.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Hi.
text: He looks at her a beat, then --
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Am I... disturbing you?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: No. Come in.
text: They have their eyes on each other. A beat, and she turns to
dialog: go in.
scene_heading: INT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE
text: She goes in ahead of him -- he follows her inside. He watches
text: her body. His movements are tentative, off-balance. She turns
text: the Stones DOWN.
text: On a table by the window, he sees a word processor. Spread
text: around it are newspaper clippings. They are all about him.
text: We see the headline on one KILLER COP TO FACE POLICE REVIEW.
text: She sees him glancing at the clips.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I'm using you for my detective.
dialog: In my book. You don't mind, do
dialog: you?
text: She smiles. He looks at her, expressionless.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Would you like a drink? I was
dialog: just going to have one.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No, thanks.
text: She goes to the bar.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: That's right. You're off the Jack
dialog: Daniels too, aren't you?
text: She is making herself a drink. She takes the ice out and then
text: opens a drawer and gets an icepick. It has a fat wooden end.
text: She uses the icepick on the ice, her back to him. He watches
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I'd like to ask you a few more
dialog: questions.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I'd like to ask you some, too.
text: She turns to him, icepick in hand, smiles.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: For my book.
text: She turns back to the ice, works on it with the pick. She
text: raises her arm, plunges it. Raises it, plunges it. He watches
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (wary)
dialog: What kind of questions?
text: She puts the icepick down, pours herself a drink, turns to
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: How does it feel to kill someone?
text: He looks at her a long beat.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (finally)
dialog: You tell me.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I don't know. But you do.
text: Their eyes are on each other.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (finally)
dialog: It was an accident. They got in
text: the line of fire.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Four shootings in five years. All
dialog: accidents.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (after a long beat)
dialog: They were drug buys. I was a vice
dialog: cop.
text: A long beat, as they look at each other.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
text: BEAT.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: There's a name from the past.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You want a name from the present?
dialog: How about Hazel Dobkins?
text: She looks at him a long beat, sips her drink, never takes her
text: eyes off him.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Noah was my counselor in my freshman
dialog: year.
dialog: (she smiles)
dialog: That's probably where I got the
dialog: idea for the icepick. For my book.
dialog: Funny how the subconscious works.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Hazel is my friend.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: She wiped out her whole family.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Yes. She's helped me understand
dialog: homicidal impulse.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Didn't you study it in school?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Only in theory.
dialog: (she smiles)
dialog: You know all about homicidal
dialog: impulse, don't you, shooter? Not
dialog: in theory -- in practice.
text: He stares at her a long beat.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: What happened, Nick? Did you get
dialog: sucked into it? Did you like it
dialog: too much?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: No.
text: He stares at her, almost horrified.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Tell me about the coke, Nick. The
dialog: day you shot those two tourists --
dialog: how much coke did you do?
text: She steps closer to him.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Tell me, Nick.
text: She puts her hand softly on his cheek, He grabs her hand
text: roughly, holds it.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I didn't.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Yes, you did. They never tested
dialog: you, did they? But Internal Affairs
dialog: knew.
text: They are face to face. He is still holding her roughly by the
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Your wife knew, didn't she? She
dialog: knew what was going on. Nicky got
dialog: too close to the flame. Nicky
dialog: liked it.
text: He twists her arm back behind her -- their bodies are pressed
text: against each other -- their eyes digging into each other.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (in a whisper)
dialog: That's why she killed herself?
text: He is twisting her arm, staring at her, pulling her against
text: him. We hear the DOOR behind them. A beat, and he lets her
text: go, turns away from her.
text: Roxy stands there, staring at them. Her hair is up. She wears
text: a black motorcycle jacket, a black T-shirt, and black jeans
text: and cowboy boots.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (brightly)
dialog: Hiya, hon. You two have met,
dialog: haven't you?
text: Roxy looks at Nick. Catherine goes to her, kisses her briefly
text: on the lips, stands there with her arm around her --both of
text: them looking at Nick.
text: He walks by them, opens the door to go, his face a mask.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: You're going to make a terrific
dialog: character, Nick.
text: He doesn't look at her; he's gone.
scene_heading: INT. BETH GARDNER'S OFFICE - DAY

text: RECEPTIONIST sits there.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: She's on the phone -- she'll be
dialog: right with you, detective --He
text: sweeps by her into Beth's inner
text: office. She hangs up when she

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Who has access to my file?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What are you talking about, Nick --
dialog: what's wrong with you?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Who's got access to my goddamn
dialog: file?
text: She gets up -- he goes closer to her; she backs away from him.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Nobody.
text: He goes closer to her; she backs away.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: It's a confidential psychiatric
dialog: record, it'd be illegal --She backs
text: into a wall. She looks very scared.
dialog: He comes very close to her -- puts
text: an arm behind her to the wall.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Don't, Beth. Don't lie to me.
text: She says nothing, looks scared.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: No, Nick, please --
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (loud, hard)
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: BETH

dialog: Nilsen.
scene_heading: INT. THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS DIVISION - DAY
text: He storms into the big room. He sees MARTY NILSEN. He is
text: sitting behind his desk in his glass-enclosed office inside
text: this big room. About a dozen plainclothes policemen are in
text: the big room. He goes by them into Nilsen's office.
scene_heading: INT. MARTIN NILSEN'S OFFICE
text: He closes the door. Nilsen sees the look on his face, backs
text: his chair away towards the wall.
speaker_heading: NILSEN
dialog: What do you want, Curran?
text: He goes to him, picks him up by his lapels, slams him against
text: the wall.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (out of control)
dialog: You sold her the file, didn't you?
speaker_heading: NILSEN
dialog: (scared)
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (out of control)
dialog: What'd she pay you?
text: He slams him against the wall again. The glass EXPLODES behind
text: them -- a chair comes into the room. Nick is frozen, holding
text: Nilsen by the throat against the wall.
scene_heading: ONE OF THE I.A. GUYS
dialog: Let him go, Curran. Nice and easy.
text: He looks back, sees two Internal Affairs men with their guns
text: drawn, pointed at him. A beat, and he lets Nilsen go. He
text: turns calmly and starts to walk out.
speaker_heading: NILSEN
dialog: You're on sick leave, Shooter. As

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (after a long beat)
dialog: I got tired of being played with.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: You sure got real conclusive ways
dialog: of demonstrating that.
text: They almost smile at each other, then --
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (almost to himself)
dialog: She knows where I live and breathe.
text: She's coming after me.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (after a long beat)
dialog: What is it you got between you?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (after a beat; to

speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Somethin', though.

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Somethin'.
scene_heading: INT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: He sits in front of the TV, watching a lame sitcom. A bottle
text: of Jack Daniels is half-empty in front of him. He is smoking
text: a cigarette.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (behind him)
dialog: I still have my key.
text: He looks at her, looks away at the sitcom.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I don't want to see you, Beth.

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (suddenly angry)
dialog: Damnit! Don't shut me out! You
dialog: owe me more than that?
text: He goes to the TV, shuts it off.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I don't owe you anything; you don't
dialog: owe me anything.

dialog: We went to bed -- what was it? --
dialog: ten or fifteen times?
dialog: (he smiles)
dialog: It wasn't memorable enough to carry
dialog: any obligations.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (after a long beat)
dialog: Sometimes I really hate you.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Yeah? Well why don't you find
dialog: some friendly therapist and work
dialog: some of that hostility out.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: But take my advice. Put a little
dialog: more life into it than you usually
dialog: do.
text: A beat, and she suddenly hurls herself at him in absolute fury,
text: trying to claw at his face. He grabs her, blocks her. They
text: look at each other a long beat and then he lets her go.
text: The emotion of the moment is gone now -- they turn away from
dialog: each other.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (finally)
dialog: I'm sorry... I don't usually...
dialog: act like that.
text: Nick looks at her a beat.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: How could you let him have my file,
dialog: Beth?
text: A long beat, then --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (not looking at him)
dialog: He was going to recommend your
dialog: discharge a behavioral disability.
dialog: I made a deal with him. He could
text: review the session notes himself.
dialog: It was the only way I could keep
dialog: you on the force.
text: She looks at him. He looks away from her.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You did it for me.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Yes. I care about you. I did it

speaker_heading: NICK

text: him pour it and turns to go.
scene_heading: INT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: He is asleep on the couch -- the TV is on to a blank screen.
text: The Jack Daniel's is mostly gone. The phone on the coffee
text: table RINGS. It RINGS again. He wakes, picks it up, listens.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Okay.
text: He hangs it up. He sits there a long beat, staring. He looks
dialog: disturbed.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ALLEY BEHIND THE TEN-FOUR BAR - NIGHT
text: He walks down the alley. There are lots of police cars,
text: flashing lights, uniformed men, coroner's men.
text: As he walks down the alley, he sees Lt. Walker, Gus, and several
dialog: of the Internal Affairs men we saw earlier in Nilsen's office.
text: They are standing around a Lincoln Town Car.
text: They look at him as he comes closer to them -- then move aside.
text: He can see into the car now. Martin Nilsen lies against the
text: front seat. He has been shot in the head. Nick stares.
speaker_heading: GUS
text: One shot. Close range. Probably
text: a .38 caliber revolver.
text: Nick stares at Nilsen's body. They watch him.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: Give me your gun, Nick.
text: A beat, and then Nick gives him his gun. Walker smells it,
text: shakes his head, gives it to one of the Internal Affairs men.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (to Walker)
dialog: You think I --
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I don't son, but I got the minority
dialog: opinion.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: He sits in the same room that Catherine sat in --surrounded by
dialog: four or five Internal Affairs men, Lt.
text: Walker, Gus, and Captain Talcott. Lt. Walker and Gus sort of
text: sit back -- I.A. is running the investigation. The same police
text: stenographer -- the same plain young woman -- is sitting in
text: the room who was there with Catherine.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Okay. I went after him. I lost
dialog: my temper.
speaker_heading: AN I.A. MAN
dialog: Do you have any evidence that he
dialog: showed your psychiatric file to
dialog: anyone?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: No.
text: Beth Gardner comes into the room. They look at her.
speaker_heading: AN I.A. MAN
dialog: We'll speak to you afterwards, Dr.
dialog: Gardner.
text: Nick gives her a look.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I'd like to sit-in if you don't
dialog: mind.
scene_heading: THE I.A. MAN
dialog: I'd really rather --
speaker_heading: TALCOTT
dialog: I don't see anything wrong with
dialog: Dr. Gardner sitting-in if Detective
text: Curran doesn't object.
text: Nick looks at her, shrugs.
speaker_heading: AN I.A. MAN
dialog: Where were you tonight?
speaker_heading: NICK
text: Home. Watching TV.
speaker_heading: AN I.A. MAN

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: AN I.A. MAN
dialog: Were you drinking?
text: He looks at Beth.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah, I was drinking.
speaker_heading: AN I.A. MAN
dialog: When did you start drinking again?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: A couple days ago.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I saw Detective Curran at his
text: apartment around ten o'clock. He
dialog: was sober and lucid. I asked him
dialog: in my capacity as his departmental
dialog: therapist about his altercation
dialog: with Lt. Nilsen. He expressed
dialog: regret and displayed no hostility.
speaker_heading: AN I.A. MAN
dialog: (to Beth)
dialog: How long were you at his apartment?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: About fifteen minutes. I saw there
dialog: was no reason for my concern and
dialog: left.
text: She and Nick look at each other. He looks away and lights a
dialog: cigarette.
speaker_heading: AN I.A. MAN
dialog: There's no smoking in this building.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: What are you gonna do -- charge me
dialog: with smoking?
text: It is the exact line that Catherine used. A long beat.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the
dialog: record did you kill him?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No.
text: They look at him a beat.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Come on -- I'm going to storm into
dialog: his office in front of everybody
dialog: in the afternoon and then that
dialog: night I'm going to kill him? I'd
dialog: have to be really dumb to do that.
speaker_heading: AN I.A. MAN
dialog: Going after him before gets you
dialog: off the hook for killing him that's
dialog: your alibi.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: Like writing a book about killing
dialog: a guy gets you off the hook for
text: killing him.
speaker_heading: AN I.A. MAN
dialog: (to Walker)
dialog: I don't understand. What are you
dialog: talking about? What book?
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: (to Nick)
dialog: Private joke.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I don't think it's funny.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (grins)
dialog: Well, hell, son, it's got a certain

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Thank you.

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: It's the least I could do...
dialog: considering I got you into this
dialog: mess with those reports.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: No. I mean it, thank you.
text: She looks at him, smiles.
speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (after a beat)
text: She must really be something.
dialog: (she smiles)
dialog: From a clinical point of view.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What was she like in school?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I hardly knew her. She gave me
dialog: the creeps, though. I don't know
dialog: why.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BUILDING - NIGHT
text: They get outside. Beth kisses him quickly, softly on the cheek.
speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Beth. I didn't mean what I said.

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Did you find out about her parents?
speaker_heading: ANDREWS
dialog: You're on leave, man.

dialog: You're on psycho leave. I'm talking
dialog: to a possible whacko here.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd
dialog: you find?
text: A beat, and Andrews opens the file.
speaker_heading: ANDREWS
text: The boat blew. There was a leak
text: in the gas line. There were two
dialog: previous repairs. There was a
dialog: five-mil policy on both of 'em. A
text: real heavy investigation. Zilch.
dialog: Goose-egg. It was an accident.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Thanks.
text: He sees Lt. Walker looking at him. He goes into Walker's
dialog: office.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER

dialog: Stay in touch with Dr. Gardner,
dialog: it'll help on the evaluation.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: She killed him.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: Beth? Now you've got Beth killing
dialog: people?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Catherine Tramell. It's part of

scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: First you've got her buying your

dialog: Nilsen. Forget her, willya? Go
dialog: someplace. Sit in the sun. Get
dialog: away from this goddamn fog. Get
dialog: her out of your system.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You don't but it, do you? She
dialog: knew nobody would but it.
dialog: (he smiles)

dialog: she knew nobody would buy it.
text: Lt. Walker looks at him a long beat.
scene_heading: LT. WALKER
dialog: She's screwing with your head,

scene_heading: EXT. HIS APARTMENT

speaker_heading: CATHERINE

speaker_heading: NICK

scene_heading: INT. HIS APARTMENT - DAY
text: They walk in. She looks at the bareness of the place.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: You should put some warmth into

text: She turns, smiles at him. He looks at the bottle of Jack
dialog: Daniel's; there's not much left.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Jack Daniel's okay? It's gonna

speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Let me do that. You like to watch
