dialog: 
text: K-KRASH! SMASHES against the chain-link right next to his

dialog: 
text: A vicious AERIAL PREDATOR a meter across gnashes glass fangs
text: against the steel. It STABS at him through the chain link

dialog: 
text: The hair is clipped short. The scalp is etched by long

text: calling to him, somehwere, but he doesn't hear them -- he's
text: running. RUNNING!
dialog: 
text: He finds himself in the COMPOUND GARDEN, and stops amid
text: neatly tended rows of ALIEN PLANTS. He looks down, wiggling
text: his toes in the warm soil. Then inhales deeply -- revelling

dialog: 
text: He and Wainfleet leap out to secure the LZ, scanning the tree-

dialog: 
text: Grace jogs forward to the cockpit, motioning Trudy to shut

dialog: 
text: A PLANT with swaying tendrils which reach toward Jake as he

dialog: 
text: This forest is more alive than any on Earth, with plants that

text: as if every shadow conceals razor-fanged death.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Relax, Marine. You're making me nervous.

speaker_heading: SHTOONK!
dialog: 
text: A chain reaction begins and the whole colony pulls down into
dialog: the ground, REVEALING --
dialog: 
text: A HAMMERHEAD TITANOTHERE. Like a six-legged rhinoceros, but

text: of bone giving it the look of a hammerhead shark.
dialog: 
text: Its baleful eyes lock onto him. Jake raises his rifle.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What do I do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Hold your ground!
dialog: 
text: The hammerhead SLASHES its head sideways, splintering

dialog: 
text: Jake SCREAMS at the top of his lungs, spreads his arms wide
text: and runs straight at the thing.
dialog: 
text: It STOPS abruptly, with an oversized BLEAT.
dialog: 
text: ON JAKE -- amazed the gambit worked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Oh yeah! Who's bad?! That's right.
dialog: 
text: SOMETHING rises up behind him out of focus --
dialog: 
text: A THANATOR. The most awesome land predator the universe has
dialog: ever conceived This thing could eat a T-rex and have the
dialog: Alien for desert.
dialog: 
text: It is a black six-limbed panther from Hell, with an armored

dialog: hammerhead --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: That's what I'm talkin' about, bitch!

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: That's right motherf--
dialog: 
text: A guttural SNARL behind him. Jake spins in time to see --
dialog: 
text: THREE TONS of rippling thanator LAUNCH over him, landing
text: between him and the hammerhead. The ground shakes.
dialog: 
text: The thanator emits an earsplitting ROAR, enraged that the

text: Jake, and bares its fangs with a lethal HISS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What about this one? Run, don't run?
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRACE

dialog: 
text: SK-RASH!! CLAWS SLASH the air behind him, EXPLODING bark off
dialog: a trunk as --

dialog: 
text: JAKE dives under a massive root system, and --
dialog: 
text: CRASH! Kindling rains around him as the beast tears into the
text: root-trunks above him. Claws SLASH down next to him as he
dialog: rolls and crawls --
dialog: 
text: Glistening jaws SMASH and SNAP against the barrier trunks,
text: sending chunks of wood flying. It's spittle sprays across
text: Jake, jaws inches away as --
dialog: 
text: He rolls onto his back, and FIRES his AR point blank but the
text: rifle is SNATCHED out of his hands. The beast SCREECHES an

dialog: 
text: GLISTENING JAWS lunge downward, SNAP SHUT and --
dialog: 
text: The creature rips Jake out of the tree, shaking him like a

dialog: 
dialog: 34.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: It has him by the BACKPACK, so Jake unlatches it and --
dialog: 
text: He FLIES FREE as the thanator crushes the pack with its
text: teeth. Giving Jake a moment to sprint away, but --
dialog: 
text: With a hideous BELLOW the thanator crashes after him,
text: splintering trees.
dialog: 
text: JAKE RUNS in a blur, dodging between trunks as a glistening

dialog: 
text: He sees WATER ahead and DIVES OUTWARD with all his might --
dialog: 
text: The thanator's jaws SNAP SHUT inches behind him as he flies
text: out into open space and --
dialog: 
text: JAKE SPLASHES down into a swiftly moving river.
dialog: 
text: The thanator LEAPS DOWN AFTER HIM, pursuing from rock to
text: rock, its claws swiping like a grizzly fishing for salmon.
dialog: 
text: Jake ducks under as -- FWHOOSH! -- black claws SLASH past
text: his face amid turbulent bubbles.
dialog: 
text: A WATERFALL ahead. Jake is swept over the falls, with the
text: thanator SWIPING at him from a rock, just MISSING and --
dialog: 
text: Jake disappears down the throat of the thundering cataract.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER BELOW FALLS - DAY
dialog: 
text: The water boils below the cataract. Jake's head bursts
text: through the surface, and he gasps for breath.
dialog: 
text: He is carried along by the current, but manages to grab a
text: limb on a fallen tree. He weakly pulls himself up, and just
text: lies there gasping on the trunk.
dialog: 
text: Above him, on the cliff, the THANATOR BELLOWS, a roar which
text: echoes across the jungle.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
text: POV FROM ABOVE -- looking down through leaves we watch Jake
text: move warily through the forest.
dialog: 
text: ECU -- TWO GOLDEN EYES, bright in the shadows.
dialog: 
text: DOWNANGLE as Jake passes under a tree limb. Invisible to
text: him, draped on the limb like a leopard, is a striking NA'VI
text: GIRL. She watches, only her eyes moving.
dialog: 
text: She is lithe as a cat, with a long neck, muscular shoulders,
text: and nubile breasts. And she is devastatingly beautiful --
text: for a girl with a tail. In human age she would be 18. Her
speaker_heading: name is NEYTIRI(nay-Tee-ree).
dialog: 
text: Jake passes less than 2 meters beneath her, oblivious.
dialog: 
text: NEYTIRI rises soundlessly. In one fluid, sinuous movement
text: she NOCKS an arrow to her BOW and DRAWS, aiming RIGHT AT
text: JAKE. Utterly silent.
dialog: 
text: Below her Jake is totally unaware of the arrow aimed at his
speaker_heading: THROAT.
dialog: 
text: ON NEYTIRI as she follows him with the bow, muscles tensing
dialog: for the shot --
dialog: 
text: -- and SOMETHING drifts down in front of her, F.G. She
text: hesitates.
dialog: 
text: RACK FOCUS to the tip of the arrow -- where a single
text: WOODSPRITE floats down to land on the arrow-head.Like a
text: dandelion seed, but larger, the WOODSPRITE waves its silky
text: CILIA, feather light, as it balances on the deadly point. It
text: glows faintly in the dark shadows.

scene_heading: EXT. RAINFOREST - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: LONG LENS-- POLYPHEMUS. The giant planet rises behind the

dialog: 
text: Jake's got a new problem. He sees shapes moving with liquid
text: grace in the NIGHT shadows behind him. He is being stalked by
text: a pack of VIPERWOLVES.
dialog: 
text: Jake catches only glimpses -- a glint of eyes, a slinking
text: black movement -- then nothing. Darkness.
dialog: 
text: TIME CUT -- TIGHT ON Jake's hands as he knots his T-shirt
text: around the butt end of the spear.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON THICK SAP trickling down a tree-trunk. Jake jams
text: the makeshift torch into the sap, soaking the shirt with it.
dialog: 
text: A WATERPROOF MATCH from his survival kit lights the torch.
dialog: 
text: The torch creates a pool of light surrounded by pulsing,
text: leaping shadows. Jake turns warily as he moves along the
dialog: trail.
dialog: 
text: Behind him are several pairs of reflective green EYES.
text: Another pair flanking him beside the trail. Black-on-black
text: SHAPES which seem to flow like liquid.
dialog: 
text: He looks up -- sees one cross a limb overhead. Another on
text: his opposite flank.
dialog: 
text: Then a hideous sound, like a hyena's psychotic LAUGH.
dialog: 
text: The VIPERWOLVES can run like a dog and climb like a monkey.
text: They are hunting Jake from the ground and the trees.
dialog: 
dialog: 37.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: JAKE RUNS by torch-light, on the edge of panic. He reaches a
text: steep banked stream and -- without thinking -- runs across it
text: on a horizontal trunk --
dialog: 
text: -- and STOPS DEAD on the other side. The torch illuminates
text: GREEN EYES cutting ahead of him across the trail. The
text: viperwolves have him encircled.
dialog: 
text: The psychotic BARKS become more intense as they signal each
text: other, getting excited. ONE MAKES A RUN at him, angling on
text: his legs from behind but --
dialog: 
text: JAKE WHIRLS, jamming the torch in its face. It yips and goes
text: past, but ANOTHER moves in --
dialog: 
text: He jabs it with the business end of the spear and it SNARLS,
text: retreating, baring its fangs.
dialog: 
text: Now half a dozen are circling him in the open, and he sees
text: what he's up against. The VIPERWOLVES are six-limbed with
text: shiny chitinous skin, their paws leathery BLACK HANDS.
text: Intelligent eyes. Glistening black teeth in dead white gums.
dialog: 
text: Jake realizes that he is making his final stand. He whirls
text: the torch in an arc, keeping them at bay --
dialog: 
text: And feels a rush of adrenaline. It goes through him like a
text: lightning bolt and the fear is gone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
speaker_heading: (SCREAMING)
dialog: I don't have all goddamn night! Come on!
dialog: Come on!
dialog: 
text: With snarls and a blur of motion THEY ATTACK.
dialog: 
text: Jake CRACKS the spear down on one, then SPINS as --
dialog: 
text: ANOTHER LEAPS at him and he plants the spear in it, striking
dialog: true, but --
dialog: 
text: Its momentum wrenches it from his hands, and the torch goes
text: flying. Left in semi-darkness, Jake draws his KNIFE as--
dialog: 
text: A WOLF LUNGES, sinking its teeth into his arm. He YELLS in
text: pain and fury, SLASHING with the knife which --
dialog: 
text: CUTS deep into the beast's shoulder and it lets go.
dialog: 
text: JAKE SPRINTS, trying to escape, but a snarling viperwolf
text: leaps, GRABBING him by the ankle with its fore-hand. Jake
text: tears away, sprawling, SCRAMBLING to get up as --
dialog: 
dialog: 38.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: THREE WOLVES charge at once. The nearest LEAPS at his throat
dialog: just as --
dialog: 
text: THUNK!! -- an ARROW appears in its chest.
dialog: 
text: The wolf lands on him, already a dead weight. He pushes it
dialog: off in time to see --
dialog: 
text: A BLUE AMAZON emerge from the trees, nock another arrow, draw
text: and FIRE in one fluid motion. AN UNEARTHLY YOWL as another
text: wolf falls.
dialog: 
text: NEYTIRI LEAPS right over Jake, and CRACKS her bow down on the
text: skull of a circling wolf.
dialog: 
text: ANOTHER SPRINGS at her and she drops under its weight, but
text: rolls, coming up on top of it with a knife in her hand.
dialog: 
text: Her knife FLASHES down, buried to the hilt in its chest.
dialog: 
text: SNARLING, a wounded wolf attacks Jake, and he KICKS it away,
dialog: but --
dialog: 
text: It SPINS and leaps back onto him, and Jake barely catches its
text: throat in time to keep the SNAPPING JAWS away from his face.
dialog: 
text: MEANWHILE Neytiri swings her bow in a big arc, CRACKING IT
text: across the heads and shoulders of two remaining wolves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEYTIRI
dialog: Rrreeyaaah! Hyaaaah!!
dialog:

text: They bound away through the foliage as she SHOUTS after them--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEYTIRI
dialog: Raaaarrrr!
dialog: 
text: Jake has his adversary pinned and is choking it with all his
text: weight. Finally it stops thrashing. Panting, he releases it
text: and looks up at --
dialog: 
text: NEYTIRI. Her tail LASHES as she scans the forest, listening
text: to the fading YELPS of the wolves. Satisfied the attack is
text: over, she turns.
dialog: 
text: She regards him coldly for a second, then walks past him.
text: Neytiri picks up the torch and extinguishes it in a stream.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Wait, don't --

dialog: 39.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jake blinks around at the darkness -- realizing he can still
text: see. In fact, with the blinding torchlight gone, the forest
text: is transformed.
dialog: 
text: The jungle has come alive with BIOLUMINESCENCE -- spots and
text: patterns, ghosts and galaxies of blue-green light.
dialog: 
text: Jake scrambles to recover his spear. Neytiri kneels beside --
dialog: 
text: A DYING WOLF. It's CRIES are pitiful. It paws the air,
text: trying to raise its head. She pulls her KNIFE from its
dialog: chest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEYTIRI
dialog: (in Na'vi)
dialog: Forgive me, my brother.
dialog: 
text: She cuts its throat, ending the pitiful cries. She touches
text: its head gently, regarding it with sadness.
dialog: 
text: Neytiri wipes the knife and returns it to the sheath at her
text: waist. She crosses to another slain wolf and kneels, pulling
text: the arrow from its heart.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Look, um, I know you probably don't
dialog: understand this. But -- thanks. Thank
dialog: you. I owe you.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Slow down a second will you. I just want
dialog: to thank you for killing those --
dialog: 
text: He makes the mistake of grasping her shoulder and --
dialog: 
dialog: 40.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: WHACK! She WALLOPS him upside the head with her bow in a
text: fierce backhand swing, laying him out flat.
dialog: 
text: He looks up to see a FURY standing over him. A Fury who
text: speaks English -- accented, halting, angry English.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEYTIRI
dialog: Don't thank! You don't thank for this!
dialog: This is sad. Very sad, only.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: HERE--
dialog: 
text: She silences him with the tip of her bow at his throat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEYTIRI
dialog: Your fault! You are like a baby, making

speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: JAKE

dialog:

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: If I'm so ignorant, maybe you should

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEYTIRI

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Whooaa.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Then teach me to "see."

scene_heading: EXT. GORGE - NIGHT

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Whooaaa -- shit!
dialog: 
text: Neytiri catches him with one hand, gripping his bicep. He
text: watches the spear cartwheel down to splash in the river.

speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: JAKE

dialog: 
text: NEYTIRI, sensing a presence, looks up to see --
dialog: 
text: The WOODSPRITES, PULSING with purpose, float right towards
text: Jake. They dance gently around his shoulders and head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (off her amazed look)
dialog: What?
dialog: 
text: More woodsprites gather around him. Several ALIGHT on him.
dialog: 
text: Jake holds still, knowing he should be afraid -- but somehow
text: he's not. He spreads his arms. More sprites come, landing
text: all over his arms, hands, body.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What are they?

text: -- WHOOSSHH! the woodsprites whirl up and away, scattering
text: into the darkness.

speaker_heading: JAKE

dialog: 
text: JAKE untangles himself, getting up to run just as --
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TSU'TEY
speaker_heading: (SUBTITLED)

scene_heading: INT. COMMONS/HOMETREE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: An open CENTRAL AREA. The villagers gather to see the
text: arriving hunt party. We see the people of the tribe --
text: mothers with babies, old women, young hunters.
dialog: 
text: They gawk at the alien, expressions ranging from curiosity to
text: outright hostility. The huge eyes of the children follow
dialog: him.
dialog: 
text: Jake is amazed at the size of HOMETREE inside. By the light
text: of the COOK-FIRES he can see up into a vast cylindrical
text: gallery -- a living cathedral.
dialog: 
text: Clear membranes -- sturmbeest bladders -- filled with
text: fluttering bio-luminescent insects, act as area lighting.
dialog: 
text: The central space is dominated by the SKULL of some enormous
text: creature, mounted with much embellishment on a TOTEM.
text: Standing in front of this, awaiting their approach, is --
dialog:

speaker_heading: MO'AT
speaker_heading: (SUBTITLED)

speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: MO'AT
dialog: Why did you come to us?

speaker_heading: JAKE

dialog:

dialog: rush.
dialog: 
text: He drops down from the last leaf, landing next to her on a

dialog: 
text: NIGHT -- they enter a CLEARING filled with chest-high ferns.
text: Neytiri signals him to move slowly. They approach a creature

text: perched on a frond. As he approaches --
dialog: 
text: SNAP! A long spine whips in a circle, unfurling a

dialog: 
text: Jake WHAPS the bolo across its snout. The weighted thong

dialog: 
dialog: 72.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: queue but --
dialog: 
text: The bony head SLAMS sideways, and BAM! -- clocks him right in

dialog: 
text: The bolo is coming loose as the creature shakes its head, way
dialog: pissed off now, but --
dialog: 
text: Jake scrambles up and leaps straight at it. Claws rake his

text: HARD. They flop to the ground and he scrambles on top,
dialog: pinning it and --
dialog: 
text: Grabs its whipping antenna, locks it under his arm, and jams
text: the end of his queue into it. They FUSE together and --
dialog:

speaker_heading: JAKE

dialog: 
text: NEYTIRI'S BANSHEE falls into formation with him. She signals
dialog: "follow me" and DIVES.
dialog:

text: Jake's wobbles and dips, almost falling out of the sky.
dialog: 
text: THE CAMERA SWOOPS after them as Neytiri leads an arcing DIVE
text: around the flank of Mons Veritatis. The scenery is stunning.

dialog: 
text: Neytiri leads Jake in a sharp bank, skimming close to the
text: cliffs. They punch through streamers of cloud and emerge
dialog: into sunlight.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Norm looks up, startled at the VEHEMENCE in GRACE' voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Our life out there takes millions of

dialog: visit -- and you leave.
dialog: 
text: During this, Jake pulls himself from his wheelchair, levering

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRACE
speaker_heading: (SOFTENING)
dialog: You can never truly be with her.
dialog: 
text: Jake stops, pinioned by the truth. He seems suddenly very
dialog: lost.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You know why I'm here? Because Quaritch
dialog: sent me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: What?
dialog: 
dialog: 84.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: That's right -- to embed with the
dialog: Omaticaya. To find out how to screw them
dialog: out of their home. By deceit or by
dialog: force, he didn't care. And if it turned
dialog: out to be force, then how best to do it.
dialog: 
text: Norm is in shock. But Grace is eerily calm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: And what about now, Jake?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I'm not that guy any more.
dialog: 
text: Grace nods. She's been on his journey every step of the way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: But if I tell Quaritch the truth, he
dialog: yanks me out -- I never see her again.
dialog: And if I tell her the truth, the clan
dialog: throws me out -- that's if they don't cut
dialog: my heart out and show it to me.
dialog: 
text: Jake looks hopelessly at the two of them. In his own perfect
dialog: Hell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: They won't understand what you've done.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: They don't even have a word for "lie" --
dialog: they had to learn it from us.
dialog: 
text: Grace sees he is on the verge of tears. Lost and alone,
dialog: between worlds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I know. I taught it to them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
speaker_heading: (PLEADING)
dialog: Grace. I've gotta go. They're waiting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Link is ready.
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 85.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Jake. You can't carry this burden much
dialog: longer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (smiling wanly)
dialog: It's okay. Mo'at says an alien mind
dialog: probably can't survive the Dream Hunt
dialog: anyway.
dialog: 
text: Grace closes the lid. It feels like closing a coffin. She
text: watches his psionic patterns aligning to his avatar,
text: somewhere out in the night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: (to Norm)
dialog: Prep my link. I'm going in.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COMMONS/HOMETREE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: JAKE SITS, eyes closed, as Neytiri and another young hunter
text: paint his face and body in preparation for uniltaron -- the
dialog: Dream Hunt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEYTIRI
dialog: When your Spirit Animal comes, you will
dialog: know.
dialog: 
text: Their eyes meet with emotion neither can conceal any longer.
dialog: 
text: TIME CUT. GRACE stands with the crowd at the ramp to
text: HOMETREE'S LOWEST LEVEL. Jake barely sees her as he goes down
text: the spiral. She tries to follow, but is barred by a hunter.
dialog: 
text: BELOW, seemingly in the womb of the earth, Jake walks slowly
text: into the center of a tight circle of seated elders and
text: hunters. An ELDER is slowly rapping a large WATER DRUM.
dialog: 
text: TIME CUT -- MO'AT purifies him with smoke from burning herbs,
text: CHANTING in a low monotone. Jake, squatting, washes the
text: smoke over himself with his palms.
dialog: 
text: MACRO - MO'AT'S FINGERS unwrap a piece of wood riddled with
text: holes. She catches the end of a glowing purple WORM, and
text: draws it out of the wood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MO'AT
speaker_heading: (SUBTITLED)
dialog: Oh wise worm, eater of the Sacred Tree --
dialog: bless this worthy Hunter with a true
dialog: vision.
dialog: 
dialog: 86.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: MO'AT places the worm on Jake's out-stretched TONGUE. It
text: twists on itself, lighting his mouth before he closes it. She
text: indicates he should chew. He does.
dialog: 
text: MACRO -- AN EARTHEN JAR is opened. EYTUKAN removes a
text: writhing black ARACHNOID, the Pandoran equivalent of a
text: scorpion.
dialog: 
text: He places it against the back of Jake's neck and presses. The
text: insect drives its stinger into Jake's skin and --
dialog: 
text: Jake grimaces. Mo'at and Eytukan step back, leaving Jake
text: alone in the circle.
dialog: 
text: Neytiri watches intently, joining in the low chant.
dialog: 
text: SLOW DOLLY IN on Jake. His eyes OPEN. He looks around at the
text: faces -- they seem to TRANSFORM, becoming threatening.
dialog: 
text: Jake looks down at the palms of his hands.
dialog: 
text: JAKE'S POV -- his hands recede, his whole body, the ground
dialog: and --
dialog: 
text: INSTANTLY the circle of Na'vi recedes, as if to a distant
text: horizon, leaving vast ground in between. SPACE is utterly
text: distorted, and SOUND as well -- echoing, THUNDEROUS.
dialog: 
text: ECU JAKE -- pupils DILATED black. He looks around and --
dialog: 
text: The onlookers are gone, replaced by a ring of glowing trees,
text: which seem miles high. The whole image is bathed in spectral
text: radiance. Jake looks down --
dialog: 
text: JAKE'S POV -- his body and hands transforming -- fingers
text: stretching into tendrils, legs becoming roots which spread
text: outward across the ground, a thousand glowing dendrites which
dialog: connect to the roots of the trees and --
dialog: 
text: CUT TO REALITY -- Jake is on his hands and knees, PUKING in
text: the dirt. He contorts, crying out in agony as the venom
dialog: contracts his muscles but --
dialog: 
text: IN HIS VISION Jake stands serene on a FLOATING MOUNTAIN
text: CLIFF. A GREAT BLACK SHADOW covers him, the unmistakable X
text: silhouette of a diving LEONOPTERYX. The LAST SHADOW.
dialog: 
text: CAMERA SCREAMS down on him as the shadow grows larger -- WE
text: RUSH into his face, into the blackness of his pupil which
scene_heading: FILLS THE UNIVERSE and --
dialog: 
dialog: 87.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: REAL JAKE writhes in the dirt, his back arched as his muscles
text: seize. He foams and thrashes, his eyes rolled back in his
dialog: head, while inside --
dialog: 
text: TIME ITSELF HAS ACCELERATED -- clouds scream around the
text: mountain tops, mist boils through the forest. He feels the
text: wind of time blowing through him as --
dialog: 
text: REAL JAKE claws the ground, moaning, staring blindly while --
dialog: 
text: INSIDE, IN POV he FLIES over the landscape of Pandora --
dialog: 
text: --but the forest is BLASTED. Fires flicker among trees that
text: are BURNED black and lifeless in a smoky twilight.
dialog: 
text: A great WINGED SHADOW is cast below, rippling over the
text: devastated ground. AVATAR JAKE looks down at the shadow.
text: Realizes HE is casting it, and we RUSH IN to his PUPIL and --
dialog: 
text: PULL BACK from the eye of a GREAT LEONOPTERYX, flying lordly
text: and terrible over the land. It lets out an almighty SHRIEK
text: which seems to echo to eternity and --
dialog: 
text: SLAM CUT to Jake, on his back, GASPING -- back in his body.
text: He weakly rolls up to one elbow and looks around the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MO'AT
text: It is finished.
dialog: 
text: Neytiri's face is flooded with relief. The faces of the clan
text: elders look at Jake expectantly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EYTUKAN
speaker_heading: (SUBTITLED)
dialog: Did your Spirit Animal come?
dialog: 
text: Jake looks from Eytukan to Mo'at, Tsu'tey and the elders. How
dialog: can he tell them what he has seen?
dialog: 
text: Mo'at puts her splayed fingers against his face, seeming to
text: peer into his troubled soul.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MO'AT
dialog: (to Jake)
dialog: Something has come.
dialog: (to the others, subtitled)
dialog: It will take time for the meaning to be
text: clear.
dialog: 
text: She steps back, and Eytukan motions for Jake to stand. He
text: gets up, weakly.
dialog: 
dialog: 88.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: OUTSIDE THE ENCLOSURE -- Eytukan emerges with Jake and the
text: others. The entire clan is gathered, waiting to hear what
text: has happened. Jake looks up at the Leonopteryx Skull Totem,
text: which seems to stare down at him.
dialog: 
text: GRACE watches, her eyes brimming. Proud. Relieved. Amazed.
dialog: 
text: Eytukan places both hands on Jake's chest and holds them
dialog: there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EYTUKAN
speaker_heading: (SUBTITLED)
dialog: You are now a son of the Omaticaya. You
dialog: are part of the People.
dialog: 
text: All the members of the clan press forward, crowding around
text: and putting their hands on Jake's shoulders, back, chest --
text: hands upon hands, until he is connected to everyone.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RAINFOREST - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: JAKE and NEYTIRI run silhouetted in the night. Behind them
text: waterfalls cascade down in the silvery light. POLYPHEMUS
text: RISES behind the trees.
dialog: 
text: NEYTIRI DIVES from a rock, slicing into a mirror of water.
dialog: Jake follows her and --
dialog: 
text: UNDERWATER, they swim over glowing ANEMONES.
dialog: 
text: They seem to float in a cosmic dance above a luminous garden
text: of waving shapes. Tiny purple fish swirl around them.
dialog: 
text: Their hands come together, fingers twining, as they float
text: weightlessly, as if between worlds.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WILLOW GLADE
dialog: 
text: Laughing, they run together into a stand of WILLOWS. Their
text: trunks are as gnarled as bonsai. Long faintly glowing
text: tendrils hang straight down in pastel curtains.
dialog: 
text: Underfoot, a bed of moss glows faintly. It REACTS to their
text: footsteps with expanding rings of light.
dialog: 
text: It is an exquisitely beautiful spot.
dialog: 
text: The willows stir, responding to their presence. She holds up
text: her hands, letting the TENDRILS caress her.
dialog: 
dialog: 89.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEYTIRI
dialog: This is a place for prayers to be heard.
dialog: And sometimes answered.
dialog: 
text: Jake puts out his hands and the tendrils play over his
text: fingers, his palms, his forearms. His eyes go wide. We hear
text: the WHISPERING of ancient Na'vi VOICES.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: It's like -- a sound you feel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEYTIRI
dialog: We call this utraya mokri -- the Tree of
dialog: Voices. The voices of our ancestors, who
dialog: live within Eywa.
dialog: 
text: A few WOODSPRITES circle around them, some alighting on their
text: shoulders and arms.
dialog: 
text: They stand, very close together now. Her eyes are intense,
text: almost luminous. He feels drawn into them.
dialog: 
text: But she pulls back a little.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEYTIRI
dialog: You are Omaticaya now. You may make your
text: own bow from the wood of Hometree.
dialog: (she looks away)
dialog: And you may choose a woman.
dialog: 
text: The Amazon warrior trying so hard to sound casual. Jake
text: suppresses a smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEYTIRI
dialog: We have many fine women. Ninat is the
dialog: best singer --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I don't want Ninat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEYTIRI
dialog: There is Beyral -- she is a good hunter --
dialog: 
text: Jake puts his fingers on her lips to stop her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I've already chosen. But this woman must
dialog: also choose me.
dialog: 
text: She takes his hands and their fingers intertwine, moving
text: gently over each other.
dialog: 
dialog: 90.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEYTIRI
dialog: She already has.
dialog: 
text: He puts his face close to hers. She rubs her cheek against
text: his. He kisses her on the mouth. They explore each other.
dialog: 
text: Then she pulls back, eyes sparkling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEYTIRI
dialog: Kissing is very good. But we have
dialog: something better.
dialog: 
text: She pulls him down until they are kneeling, facing each other
text: on the faintly glowing moss.
dialog: 
text: Neytiri takes the end of her queue and raises it. Jake does
text: the same, with trembling anticipation. The tendrils at the
text: ends move with a life of their own, straining to be joined.
dialog: 
text: MACRO SHOT -- The tendrils INTERTWINE with gentle
dialog: undulations.
dialog: 
text: JAKE rocks with the direct contact between his nervous system
dialog: and hers. The ultimate intimacy.
dialog: 
text: They come together into a kiss and sink down on the bed of
text: moss, and ripples of light spread out around them.
dialog: 
text: THE WILLOWS sway, without wind, and the night is alive with
text: pulsing energy as we DISSOLVE TO --
dialog: 
text: LATER. She is collapsed across his chest. Spent. He
text: strokes her face tenderly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Neytiri, you know my real body is far
text: away, sleeping.
dialog: 
text: She raises up, placing her fingertips to his chest --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEYTIRI
dialog: This body is real.
dialog: (she touches his forehead)
dialog: This spirit is real.
dialog: 
text: Her eyes are luminous, honest, infinitely deep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEYTIRI
dialog: When I was first your teacher, I hated

dialog: me.
speaker_heading: (WHISPERING)
dialog: Spirit is all that matters.

dialog: 91.
dialog:

speaker_heading: NEYTIRI
dialog: I am with you now, Jake. We are mated for

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: We are?

speaker_heading: NEYTIRI
dialog: Yes. It is our way.
speaker_heading: (INNOCENTLY)

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Really, we are?

speaker_heading: NEYTIRI
dialog: We are.
dialog: 
dialog: Jake considers this.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SHACK - DAWN
dialog:

dialog: 
text: The staves whistle through the air, and CLACK together like

dialog: 
text: Jake's eyes go blank just as -- K-RACK! Tsu'tey puts one

dialog: 
text: Neytiri crouched like a lioness over Jake, her KNIFE and

speaker_heading: SELFRIDGE
speaker_heading: (FRUSTRATED)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: (to Jake)
dialog: I can't do this. How am I supposed to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Alright, look -- I don't have the answers
dialog: yet, I'm just now starting to even frame
dialog: the questions. What we think we know --
dialog: is that there's some kind of
dialog: electrochemical communication between the
text: roots of the trees. Like the synapses
dialog: between neurons. Each tree has ten to the
text: fourth connections to the trees around
dialog: it, and there are ten to the twelfth
dialog: trees on Pandora --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELFRIDGE
dialog: That's a lot I'm guessing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: That's more connections than the human
dialog: brain. You get it? It's a network -- a
dialog: global network. And the Na'vi can access
dialog: it -- they can upload and download data --
dialog: memories -- at sites like the one you
dialog: destroyed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELFRIDGE
dialog: What the hell have you people been
dialog: smoking out there? They're just.
dialog: Goddamn. Trees.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You need to wake up, Parker. The wealth
dialog: of this world isn't in the ground -- it's
dialog: all around us. The Na'vi know that, and
dialog: they're fighting to defend it. If you
dialog: want to share this world with them, you
dialog: need to understand them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUARITCH
dialog: We understand them just fine. Thanks to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE (RECORDED)
dialog: They're not going to give up their home --
dialog: they're not gonna make a deal. For what?
dialog: Lite beer and shopping channel? There's

dialog: 
text: High up in the trunk, TSU'TEY and his hunters leap rapidly
text: from spoke to spoke, climbing barely ahead of the fireball.
dialog: 
text: OUTSIDE the fire is driven by the rotor-wash toward JAKE and

dialog: 
text: Out of the smoke, MO'AT appears in front of Jake. She raises

dialog: 
text: THE VALKYRIES blast the ground with their powerful lift jets.
text: They land. The ramps drop. Troopers pour out, weapons

dialog:

dialog: 
text: TWO CHARGING DIREHORSES have a heavy log slung between them
text: like a battering ram. At a full gallop they hit an ampsuit,
text: FLIPPING IT onto its back with a blown-out canopy. Victory
text: is short lived as the two riders are cut down.
dialog: 
text: NORM'S HORSE is hit by tracer fire. He is flung off as the

dialog: 
text: A WARRIOR HURLS his spear a moment before his horse is cut

dialog: 
text: STROBOSCOPIC GLIMPSES of terrified horses rearing, Na'vi

dialog: 
text: INSIDE THE SHUTTLE'S cargo bay, a row of DAISYCUTTERS are

dialog: 
text: THE PALLET falls into the jungle below and --
dialog: 
text: BA-WHOOOOOM! -- an enormous high-explosive blast rips a huge
text: hole in the forest. A white concussion wave flashes out

dialog: 
text: AT GROUND LEVEL it is an apocalypse. Running Na'vi are

dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON JAKE, rushing straight down, SCREAMING a war cry as
dialog: he leads the charge and --
dialog: 
text: SCORES OF BANSHEES SLAM into the gunships and Samsons like

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: JAKE'S GREAT LEONOPTERYX flairs into its signature crimson X
dialog: shape just before --
dialog: 
text: K-WHAM!! -- it knocks a Scorpion tumbling. It coils around
text: the gunship, slashing furiously as they spin together. JAKE
text: can barely hang onto the gyrating creature.
dialog: 
text: The pilot of the Scorpion sees nothing but jaws slamming into
text: his canopy. Jake releases the gunship and it careens into a
text: CLIFF, tearing off one rotor -- then plummets into the trees.
text: There is a satisfying FIREBALL.
dialog: 
text: SCORPIONS fall out of formation to pursue individual banshee
text: riders, FIRING cannons and rockets.
dialog: 
text: JAKE BANKS as the cliff face next to him explodes with
text: cannon rounds. SCREAMING down on him is another Scorpion.
dialog: 
text: JAKE tucks and dives along the cliff, feeling the rounds
text: splitting the air around him and --
dialog: 
text: The Scorpions bank after the furiously jinking banshees as
text: they head for cover among the floating mountains, or dive
text: down into the trees.
dialog: 
text: DOOR GUNNERS in a SAMSON are shooting down banshees like
dialog: Messerschmidts from a B-17 as --
dialog: 
text: WE FOLLOW TSU'TEY'S BANSHEE in a full delta dive. He swoops
dialog: in from its blind spot and --
dialog: 
text: THE GUNNERS SWIVEL too late as Tsu'tey flashes past them,
text: SHOOTING ARROWS with deadly accuracy.
dialog: 
text: A SCORPION gunship dives after a banshee. It fires an air-to-
text: air missile and the banshee vanishes in an EXPLOSION.
dialog: 
text: WIDE SHOT as thirty ships and hundreds of banshees wheel and
text: dive, like the Battle of Britain. Banshees are hit by guns
text: and missiles, falling out of the sky. The occasional trail of
text: smoke and fire marks the demise of a tilt-rotor.
dialog: 
text: IN THE CENTER the Dragon is pouring out hellacious fire --
text: tracer rounds from multiple turrets and missiles from the
text: stub-wing pods.
dialog: 
text: NEYTIRI BANKS hard as TRACERS flash past her. A Scorpion is
dialog: right on her ass as --
dialog: 
text: SHE ROLLS inverted and dives under the edge of Mons
text: Veritatis, then rolls out, zig-zagging through the dangling
dialog: vines but --
dialog: 
dialog: 134.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: THE GUNSHIP stays on her. It rips through the vines, and
text: tracers FLASH toward us as --
dialog: 
text: SHE JINKS the banshee around a thundering waterfall but --
dialog: 
text: HER PURSUER explodes right through the curtain of water. It
text: launches an air-to-air missile. NEYTIRI jinks hard, diving.
text: The missile hits a rock outcropping, pummeling her with the
text: shock wave.
dialog: 
text: THE GUNSHIP follows her through a narrow slit between Mons
text: Veritatis and a smaller floating island. They run this slot
text: rolled up on their sides and --
dialog: 
text: THE SCORPION GUNNER locks up Neytiri for a missile shot but --
dialog: 
text: A SHADOW crosses his canopy. Out of the sun comes a crimson
text: demon, shrieking over the roar of the turbines, and --
dialog: 
text: K-WHAMMM!! The leonopteryx SLAMS the gunship, driving it
text: downward in a dive. The leonopteryx lashes at it with claws
text: and teeth as they fall together out of control.
dialog: 
text: Jake kicks the gunship loose and it falls like a brick,
text: breaking its back on a rocky promontory and EXPLODING.
dialog: 
text: FLYING WITH A SAMSON as a SECOND SAMSON falls in beside it.
text: This one has its pilot door off, and the PILOT is wearing a
text: breathing mask. The door gunners wave at --
dialog: 
text: TRUDY, her expression grim behind her mask. She holds the
text: cyclic stick between her knees while she RAKES the other ship
text: with BURSTS from an AR in her lap.
dialog: 
text: The pilot slumps over and the craft tumbles out of control.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRUDY
dialog: You're not the only ones with guns, you
dialog: pricks.
dialog: 
text: NEYTIRI JINKS her banshee hard, an enemy Samson right behind
text: her. The pilot is a hotdog, following her down into the
text: trees, under the canopy.
dialog: 
text: They slalom among the trunks at high speed. The gunners hang
text: half out the doors, firing. Bark and leaves explode around
text: Neytiri as she zig-zags through the jungle.
dialog: 
text: THE BANSHEE dives under a huge tree limb, and the pilot
text: follows. He looks up at the last second, catching a glimpse
text: of blue-skinned figures.
dialog: 
text: THE HUNTERS drop a net of woven vines behind Neytiri and --
dialog: 
dialog: 135.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The SAMSON hits it hard. The net fouls the ship, FLIPPING IT
text: backwards. It crashes upside down to the forest floor.
dialog: KABOOM!!
dialog: 
text: NEYTIRI'S BANSHEE is hit by GROUND-FIRE. It folds up like a
text: broken kite, crashing down through branches and --
dialog:

dialog: 
text: IN THE DRAGON Quaritch looks ahead, seeing the WELL OF SOULS.

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: We have to stop the shuttles, no matter

dialog: 
text: TSU'TEY nods. He signals, gathering other hunters, who fall

dialog: 
text: A GUNSHIP drops in behind him and he is forced to evade as --
dialog: 
text: TSU'TEY LEADS the attack on the first shuttle. Hunters jink
text: and weave through WITHERING FIRE from the escort ships.
dialog: 
text: GUNNERS with jerry-rigged gun mounts ride the broad backs of
text: the shuttles, picking off banshees who get past the escort.
dialog: 
text: TSU'TEY is RAKED by a burst from the dorsal gunners. His
text: mount crumples, plummeting with a dying scream and --
dialog: 
text: WE SPIRAL DOWN with him, the forest rushing up and --
dialog: 
text: A BLINDING BLIZZARD of green as he tears downward, catching
text: at leaves and vines. He SLAMS to the ground, badly injured.
dialog: 
text: NEARBY, ampsuits and troopers advance across the forest

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Norm, firing as he retreats, is HIT. He collapses, his avatar

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAINFLEET
dialog: I hear this is worse than death for you,

text: Grinning, Lyle holds up the queue -- Tsu'tey's only
text: connection to the world-consciousness which is his life.
dialog: 
text: NEYTIRI -- bleeding, bruised -- staggers amid burning

dialog: herself for a last kamikaze shot when --

speaker_heading: TROOPER
dialog: Right flank -- something's coming! It's

dialog: 
text: NEARBY the foot-soldiers see LIVING SHADOWS flow out of the

dialog:

dialog:

dialog: 
text: She senses something and turns slowly to see --
dialog: 
text: A THANATOR emerging from the smoke behind her. A glistening

scene_heading: EXT. LAKE
dialog: 
text: THE DRAGON lies half submerged. Out of the water FG, a shape

text: bloody, his eyes burning.
dialog: 
text: He slogs out of the water, covered with mud, then strides
text: into the forest.
dialog: 
dialog: 145.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: QUARITCH'S AMPSUIT THUDS relentlessly through the jungle. He
text: sees something through the foliage ahead -- the SHACK.
dialog: 
text: INSIDE THE SHACK Jake is oblivious under the link. Through a
text: window we see Quaritch's AMPSUIT step into the clearing.
dialog: 
text: QUARITCH levels his GAU-90 at the shack. His finger goes to
dialog: the firing button--
dialog: 
text: WHAM!! A six-legged BLACK DEMON tackles him.
dialog: 
text: Quaritch pivots as he falls, FIRING the cannon. It misses
text: Neytiri by inches. He grapples with the THANATOR as its
text: razor claws SCREECH over his metal armor.
dialog: 
text: THE TITANS twist and struggle. QUARITCH UNLEASHES a long
text: burst from the cannon. Rounds tear into the creature, which
dialog: SHRIEKS but --
dialog: 
text: NEYTIRI wills it to SMASH the cannon hard against a rock,
text: tearing it loose from the `suit's hand but --
dialog: 
text: Quaritch SLAMS the thanator back against a tree-trunk, almost
text: crushing Neytiri.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON one hydraulic hand, as it draws the `suit's KNIFE
dialog: and --
dialog: 
text: QUARITCH TWISTS violently, ramming the knife up under the
text: thanator's chest armor. The creature ROARS and Quaritch flips
text: on top of it, stabbing.
dialog: 
text: QUARITCH STABS DOWN AGAIN. The thanator slumps, pinning
text: Neytiri's legs under its great bulk. She is trapped.
dialog: 
text: Quaritch looks down at Neytiri. She glares back at him,
text: panting, scared but defiant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE (O.S.)
dialog: It's all over Quaritch --
dialog: 
text: Quaritch turns, seeing Jake DROPPING from a tree limb. The

dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUARITCH
text: Nothing's over while I'm breathing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Kinda hoped you'd say that.
dialog: 
text: QUARITCH SURGES forward. JAKE closes fast, snatching up the
speaker_heading: broken CANNON as --
dialog: 
dialog: 146.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Quaritch SLASHES DOWN with the knife and Jake parries,
text: blocking it with the cannon. He CLOSES faster than the suit
dialog: can move and --
dialog: 
text: K-CRACK! -- SLAMS the end of the cannon into the canopy,
text: crazing it with a web of cracks as QUARITCH SLICES air with
text: the huge knife. Jake ducks, coming up to meet the next slash
dialog: and --
dialog: 
text: SMASHES the knife hand with the cannon once -- twice -- again
text: -- in a furious attack -- knocking the knife flying.
dialog: 
text: QUARITCH catches him with the other arm, hurling him away.
text: Jake rolls just before --
dialog: 
text: THUDDD! -- the massive foot stomps down where he just was. He
text: scrambles up as Quaritch CHARGES and --
dialog: 
text: JAKE DUCKS another round-house, LEAPING forward to smash the
text: canopy again -- then again -- until it is WHITE with cracks.
text: Quaritch manages to GRAB the cannon barrel but --
dialog: 
text: INSIDE THE COCKPIT, he sees nothing but the sun on the
text: shattered glass. HE HURLS the cannon blindly, but Jake ducks.
text: The massive cylinder cartwheels toward the shack and --
dialog: 
text: FROM INSIDE we see it CRASH against pressure window, crazing
text: it but not penetrating. Jake's link sits just inside.
dialog: 
text: INSIDE THE COCKPIT, Quaritch yanks a yellow handle and --
dialog: 
text: P-FOOM! -- the canopy BLOWS OFF, flying through the air.
text: Quaritch can see again. He dons his breathing mask. Bends to
text: pick up his KNIFE.
dialog: 
text: NEARBY NEYTIRI struggles furiously, trying to get her legs
text: free from underneath three tons of thanator.
dialog: 
text: QUARITCH, panting, glowers at Jake.

speaker_heading: QUARITCH
dialog: How does it feel to betray your own race?
dialog: 
text: Then, inexplicably, he TURNS. Walks away.
dialog: 
text: FROM INSIDE the shack, we see him charge straight toward us
dialog: and --
dialog: 
text: CRASH! -- he puts his hydraulic fist right through the
text: window. He is reaching inside for the Link when --
dialog: 
text: JAKE HITS in a flying tackle with every ounce of force he
text: has, knocking the ampsuit sideways and --
dialog: 
dialog: 147.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: JAKE REACHES around the suit, grabbing Quaritch's shoulder
text: and, yanks him forward HARD, SMASHING his face into the edge
dialog: of the cockpit but --
dialog: 
text: QUARITCH flings him off with a sweep of his arm, and Jake
text: slams to the ground.
dialog: 
text: INSIDE THE LINK Jake is holding his breath as the toxic
text: Pandoran air swirls in. GAS ALARMS SHRIEK.
dialog: 
text: NEYTIRI shoves with one free leg, desperately trying to pull
text: her other leg out.
dialog: 
text: THE AMPSUIT charges, the knife flashing down and --
dialog: 
text: JAKE just manages to catch it in both hands, but the force of
text: the attack drives him to his knees as --
dialog: 
text: QUARITCH pushes the knife down inexorably, until Jake is
text: pinned against a rock, the blade now inches from his throat.
dialog: 
text: INSIDE THE LINK Jake is straining to stay conscious, to stay
dialog: connected as --
dialog: 
text: THE KNIFE reaches his throat as --
dialog: 
text: THWAP! AN ARROW APPEARS in Quaritch's chest. He looks up.
dialog: 
text: NEYTIRI STANDS -- a FURY released. A classic archer figure,
text: she NOCKS another arrow. Then draws and releases smoothly.
dialog: 
text: TH-WHAP! The machine TOPPLES off Jake and lies still.
dialog: 
text: QUARITCH STARES at the two arrows in his chest. He touches
text: the feathers of the ancient weapon, then -- with an ironic
dialog: laugh -- he dies.
dialog: 
text: NEYTIRI runs up, another arrow nocked, bow drawn. Seeing
text: Quaritch, she lowers her father's bow.
dialog: 
text: JAKE sees her, then goes limp, his eyes rolling back, and --
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SHACK
dialog: 
text: HUMAN JAKE EXPLODES out of the Link, slamming to the floor
text: where he gags for breath. With his last strength, he claws
text: toward an emergency breathing mask -- across the room.
dialog: 
text: He scrambles toward it, on the edge of unconsciousness.
dialog: 
text: NEYTIRI VAULTS through the shattered window, landing in the
text: debris like a cat. She GRABS the mask and flashes to Jake's
text: side -- puts the mask over his face and --
dialog: 
dialog: 148.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: JAKE drags in breath after breath. He looks up at Neytiri,
text: studying him as she holds him -- seeing his human body for
dialog: the first time.
dialog: 
text: Jake touches her face, his pale human hand against the blue
text: of her skin. There eyes meet across the glass of the mask --
