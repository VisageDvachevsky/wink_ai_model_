speaker_heading: CAA/Sally Willcox
text: A woman, about 30, lies in bed, her head propped up by four
text: pillows. It’s very dark -- we see only her silhouette.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: (speaking to someone below
dialog: her)
dialog: Burt?
text: There’s some shuffling under the sheets.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: What’s wrong?
text: More shuffling in the bed. A voice from under the covers.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: That’s what I mean. Why’d you stop?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I'm trying to figure out the best
dialog: way to say what I’m about to say.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: It’s been a while since I waxed...
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: No, no.
dialog: (still trying to find the
dialog: best way to say it)
dialog: Uh. You taste different.
text: Verona sits up, sighing.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Please. Last time you complained
dialog: about the taste I banned you from
dialog: my region for a year. You want me
dialog: to shower?
text: Burt emerges from under the covers and stares at Verona.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: No, you’re clean. But you know a
dialog: woman can taste different depending
dialog: on various co-factors.
text: Verona sits up in a huff.
dialog: *
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I don’t want to hear this. And I
dialog: thought we agreed you wouldn’t use
dialog: the word “co-factor.”
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I said I wouldn’t MISuse it. All
dialog: I’m saying is that from what I’ve
dialog: read about vaginal flavor--
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Jesus!
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: From what I’ve read, I know that
dialog: abrupt changes happen when a
dialog: woman’s either menopausal...
dialog: (registering a new,
dialog: momentous thought)
dialog: or--
text: Verona slaps him as hard as she can.
scene_heading: INT. DRUGSTORE -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS
text: They're at the checkout counter with two pregnancy tests.
text: It's evident they’ve pulled their clothes on hastily. Burt is
text: still holding his face where Verona slapped him.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Sorry. I don’t know why I did that.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: It’s okay.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Have I ever done that before?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: It just seemed the right thing at
dialog: the time.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: It’s okay. After the initial shock,
dialog: it was kind of exciting.
text: BURT FARLANDER is white, about 30, looking like he could be
text: either an assistant professor or a lunatic shooting people
text: from a tower -- there’s that funny-crazy look in his eyes.
dialog: *
dialog: He’s very smart, very straightforward and earnest, but also
dialog: eccentric -- the type of guy who’s never done drugs, but has
text: often gone camping nude. He reads widely but not deeply
text: enough, and has many strange hobbies, which he indulges for
text: short periods of time but with utter seriousness. The last
dialog: such hobby was bear-tracking. He works in the insurance
dialog: industry.
text: VERONA DE TESSANT is of mixed race - her mom was white, her
text: father black. She’s very cute, diminutive, a bit feisty.
dialog: She’s a medical illustrator and has the necessary combination
dialog: of the artistic and the exacting. Of the pair, she is the
text: more socially presentable and stable, and finds herself
text: apologizing for her partner at least once a week. Still, she
text: is devoted to him and he to her. Her beauty and sense of
text: humor are alluring and inspire many admirers.
scene_heading: INT. CAR -- DRIVING HOME
text: Verona’s driving.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I can’t wait.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I’m pulling over.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: We’re ten minutes away. No.
text: She pulls over.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: What're you...
text: Verona is already out of the car and pushing down her jeans.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: At least get off the shoulder!
text: Sounds of urine hitting gravel.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: It’ll be less accurate out here.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: You're supposed to do this ina
dialog: bathroom. The air out here is
dialog: different. The alkaline...
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: The alkaline? The alkaline? Just...
dialog: please. I’m done. Hold this on the
dialog: end here.
text: Verona hands him the stick. He holds it at a distance, the
text: way you would a steaming pot, while she pulls up her pants.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Lay it flat.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Lay it flat? Like on the road?
dialog: Should I lay it on the road?
speaker_heading: VERONA
text: No...on the dashboard or something.
text: Verona gets back in the driver’s seat. They’re
text: staring at the stick, which has been placed on
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: It’s time. Turn on the light.
text: in the car,
dialog: the dash.
text: Burt turns on the light. It’s far too dim to see anything.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: That’s the light? That’s your
dialog: interior light?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: What? Yes that’s my interior light?
dialog: What’s wrong with my interior
dialog: light? You've never had a problem
dialog: with my interior light before...
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Just-- Shut up. Turn on the
text: headlights.
text: She gets out and slams the door.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY SHOULDER -- IN FRONT OF THE CAR
text: They're both bathed in the white light of the headlights.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Damn. I can’t tell. I need a
dialog: control sample. Here.
text: She hands him a second stick from the package.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: No. This is insane. Let’s do it in
dialog: the bathroom.
text: Verona gives him a look. Burt turns away from the car. Sounds
text: of urine hitting gravel.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Okay, now bring it over here.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: But you said not on the road.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I don’t care what I said. We need
dialog: the light.
text: Verona lays Burt’s stick next to the other one on the road.
text: Her movements are meticulous, precise. Burt reads the
text: instructions while they’re waiting.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: So basically one line is nothing,
dialog: two lines is baby...
text: Verona holds up both test sticks to the beam of the
text: headlight. One stick shows one line, the other two.
text: Burt grins.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Holy mother of God.
scene_heading: -- TITLE, CREDITS --
scene_heading: EXT. COLORADO TOWN -- FIRST LIGHT OF DAWN
text: We see a quick montage of local landscapes -- mountains,
text: trees, valleys, snow-capped peaks, ex-urban sprawl. This is
dialog: where our couple lives.
text: The montage blends seamlessly into a new, strange kind of
dialog: landscape.
text: The sun is rising over a hill. It’s beautiful but also stark
text: and perhaps even eerie, given that the hill is caramel-
dialog: colored.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM -- FIRST LIGHT OF DAWN -- MONTHS LATER
text: We back up a few inches and realize that the camera has lined
text: up so Verona’s belly -- 5 months pregnant -- looks like a
text: small round mountain, and the sun appears to be rising behind
text: it. We hear vague sounds of scraping.
text: Verona wakes up, turns over, sees Burt sitting up, with a
dialog: knife and
dialog: Verona is
text: a piece of wood.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Hey. I’m glad you’re up.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: What does it look like? I’m
text: cobbling.
text: in disbelief.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I want to be a dad who knows how to
dialog: carve stuff out of wood. I want our
dialog: kid to get up in the morning and
dialog: find me cobbling.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: You're not cobbling.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I am cobbling. Look. I’ve got a
dialog: knife and some wood and I’m making
dialog: a toy...
text: (looking at the shapeless
dialog: blob of wood)
dialog: «+. stick. I’m cobbling.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: You’re not. That’s not what it’s
dialog: called.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Of course it is. How would you
dialog: know? You don’t have one of these.
dialog: (indicating the knife)
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Burt, cobbling is shoes. That’s why
dialog: they're called cobblers. You're not
dialog: cobbling. You’re carving.
text: Burt thinks for a while. It dawns on him that she’s right.
text: This takes some of the appeal out of it for Burt. He stops
text: carving. He rests his pathetic wooden worm/stick on Verona’s
dialog: stomach.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Look, she likes it. I saw her kick.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: No you didn’t.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I can do other things, too. I just
dialog: bought a book about knots. 300
dialog: knots, and I’m gonna learn them
dialog: all. And I’m gonna build a kiln.
dialog: We've got to be ready!
text: Verona goes into the bathroom. We follow her.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Remember we go to your parents’
dialog: house at noon. Be ready for that.
text: Burt pops his head into the bathroom. He’s now wearing
text: goggles and fatigues.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I pushed it back to 12:30. I’ve got
dialog: that family-defense class today.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: No, no, no. You’ve been so normal
dialog: for the past few weeks...
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I‘1l be back at noon. Might be
dialog: later if we get into some hand-to-
dialog: hand action. See you guys.
text: He leans down to kiss Verona’s lips passionately and her
text: stomach gently, and then walks out.
text: We follow Burt out of the house, where we see that it’s a
text: small ranch house, one step up from a trailer, attached to a
text: small grungy yard. He gets into a crumbling old Toyota and
text: drives off.
scene_heading: INT. KARATE-TYPE STUDIO
text: Burt is in a class with a dozen other men, lined up in neat
text: rows. The instructor is a Navy SEAL-type, also wearing
text: goggles. Behind him are inflatable models of a wife and two
text: small children. The wife is wearing a halter top and the
text: children both have (real) iPods attached to them.
speaker_heading: INSTRUCTOR
dialog: Will you be there to defend your
dialog: family?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (in unison with the
dialog: others)
dialog: I will!
speaker_heading: INSTRUCTOR
dialog: Do you have the skills to prevent
dialog: them from being taken from you,
dialog: leaving you bereft and emasculated?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (in unison with the
dialog: others)
dialog: I do!
text: With that, the instructor steps over to Burt and gives hima
text: kick round-house kick to the side of the head. Burt goes
text: down. We see the instructor from Burt’s perspective, hovering
text: over him, the inflatable family in the background.
speaker_heading: INSTRUCTOR
dialog: Not yet you don’t.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE -- VERONA’S OFFICE/STUDIO -- MIDMORNING
text: The sounds of huffing and puffing. We think for a second that
text: Verona’s exercising or in labor. But we turn the corner and
text: see Verona sitting at her drafting table, brush in hand,
text: working on a medical illustration.
text: It’s a cramped and messy place -- illustration board, a
text: drawing table, canvases, hundreds of markers and small paint
text: containers. All over the walls are insane photos of people
text: and animals in mid-surgery.
text: Verona’s on the phone, looking at a TV in the corner, where a
text: prenatal exercise video is playing. On screen, there are
text: three women doing supra-geeky aerobic routines.
dialog: 10.
text: They look like they’re direct from 1986, with headbands and
text: leg-warmers and poofy hair. The decor is ridiculous -- as if
text: they're exercising in a “Price Is Right” living room
dialog: interior. The saddest thing is that this is a brand-new pre-
dialog: natal fitness DVD.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I wish you could see this, Grace.
text: We see Grace, Verona’s sister, on the other end of the phone.
text: GRACE is striking-looking: caramel-skinned, thin, curvy.
text: She's immaculately dressed, projecting an air of
text: sophistication and professionalism. She paces around her
text: office at work -- a glass building in Phoenix, dramatic
text: desert view -- with a hands-free device attached to her ear.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: You want to hear the rhyming
dialog: couplets?
text: Instead of reaching for a bagel
dialog: Do another Kegel
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: You like that? Jesus. Grace, tell
dialog: me: Do I have to be uncool for the
dialog: rest of my life?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: What are you doing? You’re talking
dialog: to me while you're exercising?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: No, I’m just watching it. I’ve got
text: a cranial surgery thing due Friday.
dialog: Trying to finish it before dinner
dialog: at Burt’s parents tonight.
text: We see that Verona is working on an illustration of a cranial
text: operation. The subject’s skin is peeled back, revealing the
text: brain, and there’s a scalpel entering the subject’s front
text: lobe via the nostril. It’s incredibly graphic, and Verona is
text: doing the work with incredible nonchalance -- she’s snacking
text: on cold lasagna set unsettling close to the open-brain
dialog: illustration.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: They must be out of their minds
text: excited.
speaker_heading: + HH HH
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: You have no idea.
dialog: (touching up part of the
text: painting where a scalpel
dialog: is inserted into the
dialog: skull via the nostril)
dialog: I think part of them is happy to be
dialog: the only set of grandparents. To
dialog: have the baby to themselves.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Don’t say that.
text: Grace looks at a photo of her and Verona’s parents, on her
text: desk. In it, their parents are chasing the two girls -- 6 and
text: 8 years old at the time -- in front of a big, funny old house
text: in the country. In the picture, it’s winter, a bit bleak.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You’re so lucky to have them so
dialog: close. Burt’s lucky to have them
dialog: both still--
text: Now we see that Verona’s looking at the same picture of her
text: parents in her studio.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I know, I know. That’s why we moved
dialog: here. I think it’s just a matter of
text: setting some boundaries.
text: Lost in her thoughts, she lets her brush drift a bit.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Oh shit. I just gave this guy’s
text: brain a vulva.
scene_heading: INT. CAR -- DRIVING TO BURT’S PARENTS’ HOUSE
text: Verona is driving. Burt is holding ice to his head.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: So lame.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Forget it.
dialog: (changing his mind)
dialog: Wait. Tell me something.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: BURT (cont'd)
dialog: Do I look like I can’t jump from a
dialog: two-story building?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Wha-
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Just tell me that. Just... let’s
dialog: Say you see me on the street, and
dialog: you have to make a judgment: can
dialog: that guy jump from a second-story
dialog: building or not?
speaker_heading: VERONA
speaker_heading: Burt—
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Please. I need this.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: (seriously)
dialog: Yes. I think you could do it.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: See! But those fuckers were...
dialog: Whatever. It doesn’t matter.
text: They pass over a river. The landscape is wintery and spare.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I really want her to have an epic
dialog: kind of childhood. I want her to
dialog: run along the streams and to know
dialog: how to work a canoe, and to be able
dialog: to entertain herself when she’s
dialog: outside. I want her childhood to be
dialog: Huck Finny, you know?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I had that.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I know, that’s what I mean. I want
dialog: her to have what you had.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Without it being in Arkansas.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Exactly.
text: Burt’s cellphone rings.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Burt Farlander.
dialog: (listens)
dialog: Oh you old so-and-so! Sorry about
dialog: your Celtics, my friend. If you
dialog: think Paul Pierce can carry more
dialog: than a bucket of water, I have a
dialog: bridge you might be interested in!
text: Burt laughs uproariously. This entire time, he’s been
text: speaking in the voice of a 50s radio announcer. Actually, it
text: sounds eerily like Casey Kasem, and it’s obvious that this
text: voice-change Burt uses for clients drives Verona around the
dialog: bend.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Well thanks for calling back. I
dialog: wanted to talk to you about
dialog: hurricane season. I just.. No, I
dialog: know you’re covered, but are you
dialog: covered-covered?
text: When it’s clear the call will go on for a few minutes, Verona
text: pulls the car over on the highway and gets out, shutting
text: Burt/Casey Kasem inside.
text: Finally he motions to her that he’s almost done. She gets
text: back inside.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (finishing up)
dialog: Okay then. I will! I will! Ha ha.
dialog: Yes. Yes. Oh please. You’re too
dialog: much. Okay now. Talk to you soon.
text: They drive for a few minutes in silence. Verona is
text: contemplating divorce or murder.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: They expect that from me.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: They expect you to sound like Casey
dialog: Kasem.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Listen, Rona, these guys are all in
dialog: their fifties and sixties. We’re
dialog: dealing with hundreds of millions
dialog: of dollars in insurance futures.
dialog: They don’t want to be dealing with
text: some 31-year-old who didn’t finish
dialog: college.
dialog: 14.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: So Casey Kasem finished college?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Yes.
text: Silence for a few moments.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Do you think your mom’s gonna grope
dialog: me this time?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: She always gropes you. She loves
dialog: you. She wants to be you.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Ten bucks your dad says I look
dialog: glorious.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Listen. He spent 18 months in
dialog: prison, Rone--
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: White collar prison. They live
dialog: better than we do.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: And now everything is glorious for
dialog: him. The English muffins are
dialog: glorious. The margarine is
dialog: glorious. I gave him my old
dialog: sandals, and those were
dialog: “spectacular.” But the baby is
dialog: really important to them. Now that
dialog: they’re retired and I really think
dialog: they’re gonna build their world
dialog: around little Zeus.
speaker_heading: VERONA
text: It’s a girl. Her name isn’t Zeus.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (with purpose)
dialog: Jesus, Rona. Think about it: Zeus.
dialog: Excelsior. Farlander. Zeus
dialog: Farlander. That’s the name of a
dialog: girl of ... of...
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Destiny?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Thank you. A girl of destiny.
scene_heading: INT. PARENTS’ HOME
text: It’s a very clean upper-middle-class home, a bit on the
text: overwrought side -- lots of figurines and glass and mirrors.
text: The door bursts open as Burt and Verona walk up the steps. We
text: see GLENDA, who is about 60, very fit, wearing a jean jacket
text: with a faux-fur collar, turned up. She has very short white
text: hair, cut in that severe style favored by many women her age.
text: Inexplicably, she’s also wearing a headband.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: (to Verona)
dialog: Oh! Look at you! You look so big.
dialog: Good for you!
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Your hair. What'd you do?
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: I cut it!
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: And the headband.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: I know! I know! Come in, your dad’s
dialog: inside.
text: In the front hall, Burt stops upon a large fountain. It seems
text: to be a sculpture of a colonial pilgrim pumping water from a
text: tap into some kind of earthenware, held by a Native American
text: woman. Both are smiling gravely.
text: In the living room, Glenda is already sitting on the couch,
text: patting the cushion next to her.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Sit, Verona. Sit next to me and let
dialog: me hear the heartbeat.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: You can’t hear her heartbeat. The
dialog: placenta’s on this side--
text: Verona sits, trying to indicate that the placenta is on the
text: outside, and thus muffles the sound of the heartbeat...
dialog: 16.
text: Too late. Glenda has already arranged her head on Verona’s
text: stomach. She has one hand on Verona’s thigh and the other
text: between her breasts and stomach. It’s very intimate. Verona
text: would be horrified if she were surprised, but she isn’t.
text: JIM, Burt’s father, enters the room. He is 65, handsome,
text: successful, with hair longer than Glenda’s, and is limping. A
text: self-made man, he grew up poor but cultivates an air of
dialog: incredible suaveness.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Hey Jim! You're looking so much
dialog: better! You can barely see where
dialog: you broke it.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Thank you my dear. Verona, you look
dialog: glorious.
text: Verona smiles at Burt.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Did you bring the pictures from the
dialog: sonogram?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: We did.
text: Verona tries to get up but Glenda is burrowed into her so
text: deeply that she can't move.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I'll get them.
text: Burt removes an envelope from Verona's purse. He starts to
text: hand it to Glenda, but she’s so busy groping Verona that he
text: changes course and instead hands the envelope to Jim.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: These are fabulous.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: You haven't opened the envelope
dialog: yet.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I can just tell. He’s a beauty.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: It's a girl.
dialog: (to Burt)
dialog: Did --
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I told you that, Dad.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: She's a beauty.
text: Jim finally opens the envelope.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Wow. Spectacular. Exquisite.
text: Glenda is now laying in Verona's lap.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Jim, do you want your glasses?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I’m fine, Love.
text: Jim, struggling without his glasses, is looking at the
text: pictures judiciously, like a doctor examining an X-ray. We
text: cut to a shot of the sonogram, which is horrifying. A
text: straight-on picture of the baby’s face, it looks almost
text: precisely like the skull of an alien with vast ocular
text: cavities and a row of fangs.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Talk about perfection!
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: So, how dark do you think she'll
dialog: be?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Mom.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: No, really. Jim and I were kind of
dialog: disappointed when Burt’s brother
dialog: Courtney married that white woman.
text: Glenda indicates a wedding picture on the nearby end table,
text: of Courtney -- shaggy and appealing -- next to a fake-smiling
text: woman with what seem to be breast implants bursting from her
text: low-cut wedding dress.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Helena.
text: Glenda rolls her eyes at the name.
dialog: + eH
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Jim and I think it would be
dialog: wonderful to have an African
dialog: granddaughter.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Glenda, the correct terminology is
dialog: African-American. It will be
dialog: wonderful to have a granddaughter
dialog: of African-American persuasion.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Forget the semantics. We're all
dialog: family. Verona, how black do you
dialog: think she'll be?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: (looking to Burt for help)
dialog: Uh, I don't really know...
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Because you know she won't be very
text: dark at first. It takes a while for
text: the pigment to settle in.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Well, maybe we could leave her out
text: in the sun for the first couple of
dialog: days...
text: Glenda and Jim look at each other like this might be a valid
text: option. A judicious look overtakes Jim.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Verona, are you on schedule?
text: Jim pronounces the word “shheduuel.”
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Don’t ask her that. Verona, we’re
dialog: just concerned about your tilted
dialog: uterus...
text: Verona shoots dagger-eyes at Burt. He looks very surprised
dialog: that his mom remembered this detail.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Do you think that might present
dialog: problems during delivery?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Okay, that's enough.
dialog: (changing the subject)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: BURT (cont'd)
dialog: So we've been reading all these
dialog: books, trying to decide what kind
dialog: of birthing experience we want to
dialog: have...
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: That's terrific.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: -..and we think we want to limit
text: the amount of people in the room.
text: Or near the room.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Oh you don’t have to worry about
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Right. No sweat.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: And we decided that we don’t want
dialog: any videotaping.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Right. I won’t. Fabulous.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: But we really want you to share
dialog: this with us. Your presence is
dialog: really important.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: You are so right. We're so looking
dialog: forward to it. We will definitely
dialog: be there.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: And the only reason we won't be
dialog: there is if we’re living in
dialog: Belgium.
text: Burt and Verona are dumbstruck. They have no idea what Jim’s
dialog: talking about.
speaker_heading: GLENDA

speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: We're leaving in June.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: We're finally doing it.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: You're leaving in June? The baby’s
dialog: due in July.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Right. To Antwerp. City of Light.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: That’s not--. No you’re not.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: We are. It going to be superb.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Don’t say that word.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: We thought you'd be proud of us.
dialog: We've been talking about this for
dialog: fifteen years and now we can
dialog: finally do it.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: You're leaving a month before the
dialog: baby’s born? You’re moving 3000
dialog: miles away from your grandchild?
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: It’s more than 3000 miles, isn’t
dialog: it, Jim?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I can’t believe this.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: There are planes, Burt.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: This is what we’ve been planning to
dialog: do forever, son. You know that.

speaker_heading: JIM (cont'd)
dialog: We'll make a fortune if we can
dialog: declare residency over there.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: How long will you be gone?
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Just two years.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Are you selling the house?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Well, that’s the best part. We were
dialog: going to rent out the house, with
dialog: the help of a very handsome
dialog: gentleman named Fareed. But no
dialog: one’s come forward yet--
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: How long have you planned this? Has
dialog: our house--
text: At that moment, Burt sees, on the coffee table, a large ad in
text: the paper offering the house he grew up in, for rent.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: It’s just been running since
dialog: Christmas.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: We heard from your old gym teacher!
dialog: He came here with another man. They
dialog: were both wearing...
text: (gesturing up and down her
dialog: leg to indicate stripes)
text: ++. running suits.
text: This news is doubly disturbing to Burt.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: But if we don’t get a renter in the
dialog: next month, you guys can stay here
dialog: while we're gone. You can have the
dialog: house for the next two years!
text: Jim is gesturing around him, as if showing the house to his
text: son for the first time.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Outstanding.
dialog: 22.
text: Verona looks impressed with this idea. Burt, too, softens.
text: They share a brief day-dream of their daughter running
text: through the house, playing on the immaculate lawn, swimming
text: in the pool. The idea grows on them by the minute.
text: The phone rings, shaking them from their reverie.
text: Glenda goes to the kitchen to answer it. We hear Glenda’s
text: excited voice off-screen. Meanwhile, Burt and Verona notice
text: an unfamiliar sculpture in the living room.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: That new?
text: It’s a bronze sculpture of a young Native American woman,
text: wearing little more than a cowhide bikini, raising her arms
text: to the sky, nipples insanely erect.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Magnificent, isn’t it? I was
dialog: wondering when you’d notice. Twelve
dialog: thousand dollars.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I can’t believe it.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I know! She’s a Choctaw princess,
dialog: I’m told.
dialog: (nodding seriously)
dialog: It’s important that we honor our
dialog: Indian... Our indigent ... our
dialog: indigentous people.
text: Glenda returns, barely able to contain her excitement.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Was it Fareed?
text: Glenda nods.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Did he....?
text: Glenda nods quickly, barely containing her euphoria.
speaker_heading: JIM

dialog: Verona)
dialog: Well, it looks like we have some

text: They're driving home from Glenda and Jim’s house.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: They’re very strange people. I
dialog: always forget how strange they are.
text: Burt is fuming.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: We can get different grandparents.
dialog: The second they said “Belgium” I
dialog: started thinking of ways to hurt
dialog: them. We’1ll make someone else the
dialog: grandparents. Our neighbors.
dialog: What're their names?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: They look old enough. We can give
dialog: them nicknames and tell the baby
dialog: that those are the grandparents.
dialog: The baby won't know the difference.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: It really is an awful thing to do.
dialog: They knew we moved here for them. I
dialog: mean, we’ve only been here for a
dialog: year and now... They’1ll miss the
dialog: baby’s first two years. It sort of
text: takes selfishness to a new level.
text: This crosses a line with Burt.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: It’s not like your parents are
dialog: doing anything.
speaker_heading: VERONA

text: clearly freezing inside.
speaker_heading: VERONA
text: I can see my breath.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I'll get the thing.
text: Burt pulls a space heater out from under Verona’s desk. The
text: second he plugs it in, the lights go out; he’s blown a fuse.
text: The house is in total darkness.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I’1ll get the candles.
text: The opening of drawers. A match is struck. This outtage is
text: routine. Now we see them in candlelight. The conversation
text: continues as they get candles lit all over their small house.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: There’s nothing keeping us here.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (busy with the candles)
dialog: Huh.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Did you hear me? We could leave,

speaker_heading: BURT

dialog: attention)
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Burt. I’m serious.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Fine. Where do you want to go?
speaker_heading: VERONA

dialog: don’t say Belgium.
dialog: Verona hadn’t thought this far.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I don’t know.
text: Now Burt is excited by the idea.

speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: We could go to Idaho. Fishing and

speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Lots of Aryans.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Not lots. Some. And they’re all in
dialog: that one town. It’s better that way
dialog: -- we know where they are. Like ...
dialog: druids and... Stonehenge.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: What about Phoenix? We could live

speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Yeah, but the snakes... And all

speaker_heading: BURT

text: DR. HILL knocks on door and enters. She is young, blond, with

text: wearing Dr. Hill’s rubber gloves. She stares at the hands,
text: deeply confused.
speaker_heading: DR. HILL
dialog: How are you doing, Verona?
text: Dr. Hill speaks in a slow whisper, as if she’s mixing her
dialog: meds.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I'm good.
speaker_heading: DR. HILL
dialog: Nothing surprising?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: No, everything’s pretty
dialog: predictable. I'll get a mole and
dialog: then look in the pregnancy book
dialog: under “moles” and it’1ll say “At
dialog: this point you may be getting
dialog: moles...”
text: A snap draws Dr. Hill’s attention to Burt. He’s just finished
text: putting on rubber gloves, as if he and Dr. Hill will be
text: performing the exam together.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: This is Burt.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I’m the husband.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: He’s not my husband.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I’m the father.
text: Dr. Hill looks to Verona to confirm this, which she does with
text: an almost reluctant closing of her eyes.
speaker_heading: DR. HILL
dialog: (putting on gloves)
dialog: Okay. I'd like to listen to baby's
dialog: heartbeat and see if it's as...
text: (she hesitates, searching
dialog: for the right word)
text: relaxed as it was last time.
dialog: 28.
text: Dr. Hill smooths gel on Verona's stomach and uses a Doppler
text: to listen to the baby. We hear the sounds of the heartbeat.
text: Verona smiles. Burt smiles. Dr. Hill frowns.
speaker_heading: DR. HILL
text: It's still on the slow side. I
dialog: don't think it's anything to worry
dialog: about. Baby’s just...
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: It’s a girl.
speaker_heading: DR. HILL
dialog: She's just a little mellow.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (his face lighting up)
dialog: Could it mean she's an athlete?
text: Athletes have slow heartbeats.
speaker_heading: DR. HILL
dialog: (dismissively)
dialog: No. It’s probably a bit soon to
dialog: know if she’ll be playing sports.
dialog: (turning to Verona)
dialog: Um... I'm going to do a quick exam
dialog: down there.
text: Burt switches positions so he’s standing near Verona’s head.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (to Dr. Hill)
text: She hasn't been able to shave. She
dialog: can’t see down there and she won’t
dialog: let me do it. But it’s a thicket,
dialog: right? You almost expect thorns,
dialog: blackberries--
speaker_heading: DR. HILL
dialog: (proceeding with the exam,
dialog: ignoring Burt)
dialog: Well, your uterus has expanded, so
text: it's no longer tilted.
text: Verona gives Burt a triumphant look.
speaker_heading: DR. HILL
dialog: Everything else there is looking
dialog: good. Nice job.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (now taking off the rubber
dialog: gloves)
dialog: Thanks.
text: Dr. Hill deposits her gloves in the garbage, and Burt does,
text: too, as if together they’ve just finished surgery.
speaker_heading: DR. HILL
dialog: (suddenly wistful)
dialog: You're really, really lucky.
text: Verona and Burt recognize that Dr. Hill has things on her
text: mind. There’s a long awkward pause.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: What about traveling? Is there any
dialog: reason I can’t get on a plane?
speaker_heading: DR. HILL
dialog: Where are you going? Don’t say
dialog: Dallas.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: No. Phoenix. And a few other
dialog: places.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: We're looking for a new place to
dialog: live.
speaker_heading: DR. HILL
dialog: Wow. That sounds nice. To get away.
dialog: To keep going. Like a quest...
text: Dr. Hill says the word like a Tolkein wizard would, while
text: staring at the walls. Instead of medical charts or cheerful
text: pictures, there’s a large self-portrait Dr. Hill has done.
text: It’s insanely depressing, seemingly painted with mud and hay.
speaker_heading: DR. HILL
dialog: Are you videotaping?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Huh?

dialog: stomach)

speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I am. I do feel happy. Sort of
text: exuberant.
speaker_heading: DR. HILL
dialog: (saying the word like it’s
dialog: completely foreign)
dialog: Exuberant.
dialog: (thinking on it)
dialog: Well, be prepared. After birth, a
dialog: lot of people -- a lot of my
dialog: patients at least -- experience a
dialog: severe depression after giving
dialog: birth. There’s the usual baby
dialog: blues, but then there’s the real
dialog: deal. It’ll drag you through the
dialog: clouds till you can’t see the sun.
text: Burt and Verona begin feeling depressed, then and there.
speaker_heading: DR. HILL
dialog: Just let me know and I can write
dialog: you a prescription. Most of my
dialog: patients are on Zoloft and they ...
dialog: love ... it.
text: (she takes a pad and rips
dialog: off the top page; it’s
dialog: pre-written -- she gives
dialog: the same drugs to
dialog: everyone)
dialog: Actually, here’s a script just in
dialog: case.
text: She pauses a moment, staring into the eyes of her self-
dialog: portrait.
speaker_heading: DR. HILL
dialog: Just keep the end result in mind.
dialog: When you have your baby, it’1l be
dialog: just great.

dialog: There is no way Dr. Hill, or anyone, could have said this in
dialog: a less convincing way.

scene_heading: INT. DENVER AIRPORT -- DAY
text: Burt and Verona are sitting at the gate. They look not unlike
text: Dustin Hoffman and Katharine Ross at the end of The Graduate:
dialog: they’ve made a big decision and now are very unsure about it.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Now I’m wondering what we're doing.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: We're going to Phoenix. On an
dialog: airplane. This is where they keep
text: the airplanes.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: But in general. Are we nuts?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: We’ll look around. See if we could
dialog: live there. We agree we need to be
dialog: near some kind of family, some
dialog: friends -- something, some
dialog: connection, someone we know. So
dialog: we'll see Phoenix, see my sister--
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: .+. and our new closest friends...
text: Burt can’t remember their names. He still has no idea who
dialog: these people are.
speaker_heading: VERONA
text: Lily and Sam. And then we go to
dialog: Hartford for your job interview.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: My what?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Oh god. Your interview. You're
dialog: meeting with Providential Life to
dialog: see if they’1l give you a better
dialog: commission. You set it up.
text: Verona removes a small plastic bag full of pre-cut carrots
text: from her bag. She eats them as they continue talking.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: So then from Hartford we go home?
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: No. Did you look at the itinerary?
dialog: I stapled it to your jacket.
dialog: (Burt locates it -- it’s
dialog: actually stapled to the
dialog: inside of his jacket)
dialog: We go from Hartford to Montreal.
dialog: Montreal’s where I think we should
dialog: live if we don’t live in Phoenix.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Okay. Montreal.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: This is exciting, if you think
dialog: about it. We’re completely
text: untethered, Burt -- this is a dream
dialog: scenario!
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Yeah!
text: They sit for a long, awkward moment. It’s not particularly
text: dreamy. Verona keeps eating her carrots.
text: In front of them, the DEPARTURES lists dozens of
dialog: destinations, from Houston to London to Mexico City.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Then again, it seems weird, to just
dialog: decide on a place and move there.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: C'mon! How did the pioneers do it,
dialog: Rona? They just spun that globe,
dialog: picked a spot because there was
dialog: gold there, or ... wheat ... and
dialog: then the whole family got moving,
text: in their covered wagons and with
text: their horses and oxen. They
dialog: traveled through rain and sleet,
text: over mountains and plains, and then
dialog: three-fourths of them died on the
dialog: way. We’re just following in their
dialog: footsteps, honey.
text: Burt lunges for a kiss, and they do, open-mouthed, until Burt
text: pulls away.
text: Burt spits out a mouthful of carrots. Now Verona begins
text: hacking the carrot shrapnel from her throat. Carrots all over
text: the airport carpet.
dialog: 33.
text: A dozen people are watching them. Verona and Burt are used to
text: this. Their mouths carrot-free, they go back to making out.
scene_heading: INT. RENTAL CAR -- PHOENIX
text: They're parked at a 7-11. Verona is in the driver’s seat of
text: the rental car while Burt is inside the store.
text: Verona is on the phone with Lily.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Sure... That sounds fun. We’ll get
dialog: there. No problem.
text: Burt is still in the store, trying on a visor that says
text: PHOENIX IS PHANTASTIC. Now he’s holding two bottles of wine
text: up to the glass for Verona’s approval. She points to the one
text: on the left.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: It’‘ll be good to see you, too.
dialog: What? Of course I can walk. I’m
dialog: only six months! What? No. No. Not
dialog: much. Okay. See you there.
text: Burt emerges from the store with the wine. To comment on the
text: incredible heat of Phoenix, he is walking in slow-motion, as
text: if swimming through molasses. By the time he’s near the car,
text: he’s on his knees.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: (to Burt, who is now
dialog: laying beside the car)
dialog: Lordy. I forgot about Lily’s mouth.
dialog: She’s a good person -- I mean, the
dialog: best when you’re really in trouble -
dialog: - but the shit that comes out of
dialog: her mouth...
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (still laying on the
dialog: pavement)
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: She just asked if my discharge
text: smelled like broccoli.
speaker_heading: BURT

speaker_heading: BURT (cont'd)
dialog: (beat)

speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Just... (dropping the subject)
dialog: You think we can bring wine to a
dialog: dog track?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (still laying on the
dialog: pavement)
dialog: Chardonnay? Sure.
dialog: (realizing what she’s
dialog: actually asking)
dialog: Wait. Are we going to a dog track?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Hold on.
text: He goes back into the 7-11.
scene_heading: EXT. GREYHOUND TRACK -- AFTERNOON
text: Verona and Burt -- who is now wearing the PHOENIX IS
text: PHANTASTIC visor -- get out of the car and wander through the
text: complex. At the fence near the track, they find LILY and SAM,
text: with their two children. LILY is 40, average-looking, a bit
text: matronly, wearing red cowboy boots which someone has told her
text: look sexy. SAM is rigid, with a mustache and short, gelled
text: hair. He wears a button-down shirt and shorts that are a size
text: too small. Their children are ASHLEY, 10 years old and a
text: tomboy, and TAYLOR, 6 years old and on the pudgy side. He’s
text: wearing a shirt that also says PHOENIX IS PHANTASTIC.
text: Lily is turning to tuck in Taylor’s shirt when she sees Burt
dialog: and Verona.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (rushing toward Verona)
dialog: Oh god, look at you! You’re only
dialog: six months in! Jesus, you're huge.
dialog: And your face! It’s like you’re
dialog: half Chinese. Wow. Come here and
dialog: give us a hug! Sam, come give a hug
dialog: to the most beautiful woman in the
dialog: world!
text: Sam walks over. Lily sees something in Sam’s face that
text: indicates he has no idea who these people are.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Verona and I were desk buddies in
dialog: Chicago! At the agency! That was
dialog: before she broke out on her own...
dialog: (to Verona)
dialog: I still have no idea where you

text: Sam is still fuzzy.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: You met them at our going away

text: Now Sam remembers. Almost.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Good party.
text: Sam gives Verona an awkward hug and shakes Burt’s hand. He's
text: holding a half-full plastic cup of white wine. He sees the
text: bottle of wine in Burt’s hand.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh good.
dialog: (taking the bottle)
dialog: I was almost out. Can I get you
dialog: guys something?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Water.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Beer would be good.
text: Sam gulps the contents of his plastic cup, chucks it into the
text: garbage and walks toward the concession stand.
text: Taylor is sitting on the ground, holding a Crayola marker and
text: a racing form, circling the dogs he thinks will win. Ashley
text: is standing against the fence, watching the action on the
text: track, wishing she were living a different life.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: So you're in Arizona! You're
dialog: Arizonans! I can’t believe how big
dialog: the kids are. Taylor’s so handsome!

dialog: Well, thanks. We’re gonna do
dialog: something about the ears. You see
dialog: them? He looks like a trophy. You
dialog: know what I mean, one of those
dialog: trophies with the arms on it?
text: Lily is finding herself hugely amusing. She has been told a
dialog: few times that she should do stand-up comedy, and in her mind
text: she’s constantly testing out her material.
text: Lily now turns her attention to Ashley.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: This one has that dyke look.
dialog: (wrinkling her nose)
dialog: Doesn't she? Isn’t that weird?
dialog: She’s only ten but I’m sure she’s a
dialog: dyke. She’s gonna be a point guard
dialog: for the WNBA. Aren’t they all
dialog: lesbians? I think that’s weird, how
dialog: the lesbians sort of rule that
dialog: whole sport. Walk for Verona,
dialog: Ashley. Show us your tough-girl
dialog: walk. Go butch on us.
text: Ashley doesn’t move or turn around.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Oh now she’s shy. And look at her
dialog: ass -- she’s got... what is it,

dialog: junk in her trunk. I don’t know if
dialog: the dykes go for that or not. Burt,

speaker_heading: LILY

speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (now in a louder whisper)
dialog: I just ... don’t know if we should

speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Oh god. It’s just white noise to
dialog: them.

dialog: wine.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: (holding the corkscrew,
dialog: indicating the concession-
dialog: stand workers)
dialog: Those bastards didn’t want to give
dialog: me this. Fuck those motherfuckers.

text: Burt is taken aback. Sam switches back to perfect
dialog: congeniality.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What’s your line again, Burt? Lily
dialog: was telling me but it was all
text: gibberish coming from her.
text: Burt takes a swig of his beer and seems very thankful for it.
text: He and Sam take a few steps toward the track -- having their
text: own conversation while Verona and Lily have theirs.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: It’s not that complicated, really.
dialog: I trade insurance futures. Just
dialog: like you get insurance, insurance
dialog: companies need it themselves...
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Dammit, right! Shit. Of course it
dialog: would come to this.
text: Sam is speaking in an urgent whisper, as if he’s finally
dialog: figured it all out.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: They made us afraid of everything.
dialog: Insurance for insurance for
text: insurance. Bunkers and bubbles and
dialog: .»+. aw hell. This country is shit.
dialog: Shit shit shit.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: SAM (cont'd)
dialog: But everyone else in the world is
dialog: just the flies on our shit, am I
dialog: right?
text: Burt has nothing to say. On the track, there is a brief
text: ceremony saluting the soldiers killed in Iraq.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Watch the big one, number 8. I’ve
dialog: got eight bills on him to place.
text: Sam pats Burt on the back and throws a steely-eyed glare
text: across the greyhound track.
speaker_heading: LILY
text: (throwing her voice over
dialog: from the conversation
dialog: she’s having with Verona)
dialog: Hey Sam, I used to have boobs,
dialog: right? Verona doesn’t remember, I
dialog: don't think. I had nice tits,
dialog: right?
dialog: (indicating her kids)
dialog: They sucked me dry.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: This is correct. I married a busty
dialog: woman, and now--
speaker_heading: LILY
text: Now they look like rolls of
text: quarters stuck into two thin socks.
dialog: Are you ready for that, Burt? I can
dialog: tell you’re probably a boob-man.
text: Burt forces a weak chuckle. The dog race ends.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Ah shit.
dialog: (to Burt)
dialog: Looks like dinner’s on you.
text: Sam downs his wine.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Let’s do it.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 39.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT ABOVE THE RACETRACK
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: So Burt, you excited about all
dialog: this?
text: Burt thinks she means the dog track.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Yeah, this is the best one I’ve
dialog: seen, I think.
text: He looks around approvingly.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: No, the baby, dummy. Does this mean
dialog: you guys will finally get married?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (to Lily)
dialog: They're not married?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I told you that. Burt wants to, but
text: Verona doesn’t see the point.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: The point? Insurance, for one. If
dialog: anyone, you should understand that,
dialog: Bart. Does anyone ever call you
dialog: Bart? That’d be sort of funny.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Well, we didn’t have insurance when
dialog: Ashley was born.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: We thought we did and then we
dialog: didn’t. And I couldn't get it --
dialog: pre-existing condition.
dialog: Burt and Verona are expected to know what this condition is,
text: but they don’t. She twirls her finger around her ear.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I'm crazy.
text: A wild giggle escapes her mouth.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Or whatever.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (pointing to Ashley with
dialog: his thumb)
dialog: That girl cost us $24,000. Had to
dialog: borrow from every relative we were
text: still speaking to.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Every time she’s acting up or
dialog: whatever, you can’t help thinking,
dialog: “We shelled out 24-thou for this?”
text: Lily lets out a cackle. She thinks she’s hilarious.
speaker_heading: LILY
text: (laying a hand on Ashley’s
dialog: shoulder)
dialog: You know I’m kidding, honey.
text: Ashley wants to disappear.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I just don’t think the certificate
dialog: and a huge wedding will change the
dialog: way we feel about each other.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: At the very least, it’1l keep you
text: from taking off in the middle of
dialog: the night when there’s trouble.
text: Sam is nodding vigorously.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I almost left Sam about a dozen
dialog: times. The kids don’t know that.
text: The kids, of course, are right in front of them.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: But then you start thinking of the
dialog: wedding, all that money--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (pouring himself another
dialog: full cup of chardonnay)
dialog: $46,000 for ours. It was worth
dialog: maybe $31.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: I hope you guys move here. We’re
dialog: having a hell of a time getting
dialog: into the social world here. Seems
dialog: very cliquish. Or maybe it’s
dialog: something about Sam they don’t
dialog: like. I don’t know what it is. We
dialog: didn’t get into the good golf club.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Run by a Pakistani couple! How do
dialog: you like that? My family goes back
dialog: to the Santa Maria. I get turned
text: down by a Paki named Taqi.
text: Lily and Sam are greatly amused by this, though it’s clear
dialog: he’s used this anecdote a few dozen times.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: You really think you might come
dialog: down here?
speaker_heading: VERONA
text: (looking around, as if
dialog: judging the liveability
dialog: of Phoenix based on the
dialog: dog track)
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Okay, it’s not perfect. But what
dialog: is? No place is perfect, just like
dialog: no marriage is perfect. Sam and I
dialog: have both had...
dialog: (searching for an
dialog: appropriate word)
dialog: dalliances, and we're still
text: plugging away. Good as ever. But
dialog: families are fucked up. They’re
dialog: created that way. There’s no way
dialog: around it, so there’s no use
dialog: pretending it can be all roses and
dialog: love and that shit.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT OF DOG TRACK -- EVENING
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (gushing, utterly sincere)
dialog: Well, that was wonderful.
dialog: 42.
text: Sam walks by, throws the bottle of wine, now empty, loudly
text: into the garbage can, and heads into the parking lot to find
text: the car. The kids shuffle after him. He says nothing to Burt
text: and Verona -- he’s either too drunk or has forgotten them
dialog: completely.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: You know, people will offer all
dialog: sorts of advice to you, but
dialog: whatever you do, don’t listen to
dialog: any of it. Kids are resilient --
dialog: and they're genetically
dialog: predetermined anyway. They’1ll be
dialog: fine no matter what.
text: Ashley has wandered off and is leaning into the window of a
text: pickup truck -- talking to two middle-aged cowboys. Taylor is
text: nearby, picking gum off the hot cement.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL POOL, PHOENIX -- LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Burt and Verona are sitting on deck chairs by the pool,
text: positioned side-by-side, very much like sunbathers. It’s
text: about 9 o’clock and quite dark.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: You think that’s right, that all
dialog: families are inherently screwed up,
dialog: that we can’t hope for any kind of
dialog: normal happiness?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I don’t.
text: Beat. The sound of crickets.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Wait. You don’t what? You don’t
dialog: think it’s possible, or you don’t
dialog: agree with her?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: You know I don’t agree, Burt. I
dialog: hate that attitude -- “Everything's
dialog: broken so let’s
dialog: (putting her feet on the
text: ground and stomping, as
dialog: if crushing the shards of
dialog: a vase into dust)
dialog: break everything again and again
dialog: and again.”
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: But you’re the one who won’t get
dialog: married. If you’re so optimistic...
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: But it’s beside the point! I’m
dialog: saying we can be perfect, we can be
dialog: happy, and it doesn’t have anything
dialog: to do with paper titles or a ring
dialog: or a $42,000 wedding-- Was it
dialog: $42,000?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: It was, but it was only worth $31.
text: They chuckle and stare into the starry sky.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Did you hear what Lily was saying
dialog: about her boobs? Did you know her
dialog: when she had boobs?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: She was huge.
dialog: This is very disturbing news to Burt. He hadn’t thought of
text: this, and would miss Verona’s medium-sized chest.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Oh god.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
text: Burt and Verona are moving about the room, unpacking and
text: changing into their sleep clothes.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: So how do you prevent that? You
dialog: don’t wanna go flat, do you?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: No, but I don’t know how much
dialog: control I have over it.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Was your mom... Did she breastfeed
dialog: you guys?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I don’t know.
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: You don’t know?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: She died when I was twenty-four. I
dialog: didn’t get around to asking her.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL -- CONTINUOUS
text: Burt and Verona are laying in bed. Burt is rubbing stretch-
text: mark cream on Verona’s stomach and hips. It’s a delicate
text: moment, but Burt can’t leave the subject alone.
text: He jumps up and grabs Verona’s wallet and finds her pictures
dialog: of her parents.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: What are you looking for?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Did your mom have... I can’t tell
dialog: from these...
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: She looked like me, Burt.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: After she had you guys, too?
text: Burt is beginning to brighten.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Yes.
text: Now Burt realizes he shouldn’t be grinning about the size of
text: Verona’s dead mother’s breasts. He takes a more studious
dialog: approach.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: But she might not have breast-fed
dialog: you guys...
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Please, Burt.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: This is the most interest you've
dialog: ever shown in my mother, and it’s
dialog: about her boobs. It’s making me not
dialog: like you.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I just think we need to do the
dialog: research. I think we need to know
dialog: what kind of strategies there might
dialog: be. I mean, I see plenty of older
dialog: women who still have their boobs.
dialog: So there must be a way to keep
dialog: them. You like your boobs, right?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: So you’d want to keep them if you
dialog: could...
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Good. So I’'ll do the research. I’1l
dialog: figure out what it takes. I’m sure
dialog: there are some guidelines.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Some tricks. Together we'll do
dialog: this. I’1l do this. For you.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL -- LATER, CONTINUOUS
dialog: 45.
text: Burt and Verona are laying in bed, spooning, each looking out
text: the window at the pulsing highway beyond.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I have good news.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: What?
text: Burt turns onto his back and stares at the ceiling,
text: folded across his chest.
dialog: his hands
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I decided wood-carving is just as
dialog: good as cobbling.
text: (now whispering, with much
dialog: gravitas)
dialog: Our daughter's father will be a
text: wood-carver.
text: He puts his leg over hers. She reaches back, grabbing his
text: ass, and pulls him closer. They drift off to sleep.
scene_heading: INT. CAR -- DRIVING TO SISTER’S HOTEL
text: Burt and Verona are driving to meet her sister, Grace. Grace
text: works as a concierge at a very high-end hotel in Phoenix.
text: Burt is driving, and this is a problem. He tends to push the
text: accelerator down in bursts, making anyone in his vehicle
text: seasick.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: This is why I don’t let you drive.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Tell me one more time why we’re not
dialog: staying at the hotel where your
dialog: sister works?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: They’ve been booked for year. A
dialog: conference of Belgians who now live
text: in the southwest.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: No. Belgians?
text: As Burt pulls the car into the hotel parking lot, he sees
text: three men, perhaps Belgian, walking on the sidewalk. He honks
dialog: angrily.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: What the fuck with the Belgians all
dialog: of a sudden? For thirty-three years
dialog: I have no interaction with Belgians
dialog: and now they’re fucking up every
dialog: aspect of my life.
text: Burt honks at another group of Belgians, this batch including
text: some children. They look startled and utterly innocent.
text: Burt parks the car. Verona adjusts her dress over her belly
text: and turns to Burt.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Listen. Grace has been dating some
dialog: guy named Rob, who seems nice but
dialog: she thinks he’s boring. He likes
dialog: going to steakhouses, that kind of
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Wait, was that a good thing, or a
dialog: bad thing, the steakhouses?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Bad.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Like an Outback Steakhouse? Ruth’s
dialog: Chris Steak House?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I honestly don’t know. But we need
dialog: to make him seem cool. She likes
dialog: you, Burt. She’1l value your
dialog: endorsement of this guy.
text: They get out of the car and make their way through the
text: parking lot.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: So you want me to make steakhouses
dialog: sound cool?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: And sherbet.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: No. Not sherbet.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Apparently Rob’s family lives
dialog: around here and they had her over
text: for dinner. They served sherbet.
dialog: (registering Burt’s
dialog: confusion)
dialog: Instead of sorbet. This was a big
dialog: deal for Grace. It made her sad.
text: Burt is still at a loss.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: We just need to make him seem like
dialog: a good, decent man. And also an
dialog: exciting sort of guy. I don’t know.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 47.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: VERONA (cont'd)
dialog: We'll figure it out. And don’t look
text: at her tits.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I’m over it. I was good last time.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: But she’s bigger now. She went on
dialog: the pill and now she’s complaining
dialog: about getting new bras and
dialog: everything.
text: Burt's eyes light up.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Huh....
text: There’s a long pause, where Burt tries to figure out the best
text: way to make his suggestion, and while it dawns on Verona that
text: he’s about to say what he’s about to say.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Why don’t you go on the pill?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I’m pregnant, moron.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL -- LUNCHTIME
text: While waiting for Grace, Verona and Burt see a MOM with her
text: two kids, 5 and eighteen months. The mother, white, is
text: talking to her kids very loudly, as if everyone nearby should
dialog: be interested in hearing what she says to her children -- and
text: all aspects of her fascinating child-rearing.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Yes, Martin Luther! That’s a fern!
text: Burt and Verona keep watching. Verona is getting annoyed.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Yes, that’s a cactus. And the
dialog: plural of cactus is...
speaker_heading: MARTIN LUTHER
dialog: Cacti?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: That's right! Oh Amelie, you've
dialog: dribbled on your new French dress!
dialog: 49.
text: The mom looks around, expecting everyone in the vicinity to
text: smile at the wonder of childhood and her spectacular little
text: family. She finds only Verona, staring her down with a look
text: of unmitigated disgust.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: (to Burt, between her
dialog: teeth)
dialog: Performance moms. Nothing goes un-
dialog: narrated.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: There’s Grace.
text: Grace is saying goodbye to a group of Belgians. She sends
text: them onto their tour bus and turns to see Verona and Burt.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Hi!
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Wow, look at you! Finally showing!
dialog: You are radiant! Luminous!
dialog: Effervescent! Hey Burt!
text: She gives Burt a quick but very tight hug. She and Verona
text: think nothing of it, but Burt is in a momentary daze.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You guys want to eat here, or go
dialog: out...?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: We don’t want to go out there...
dialog: for a while. Feels like we’re being
dialog: cooked.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Yeah, it’s hot.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: No, I mean truly. Think about it.
dialog: If you were actually being cooked
dialog: by someone, that’s what it would
dialog: feel like. As if God had formed us
dialog: from clay, but it was the kind of
dialog: clay you needed to bake, as opposed
dialog: to the kind you just leave out to
dialog: dry.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: (meaning it)
dialog: Wow, Burt. That is so stoney!
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Well, it’s the Bible. QED.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT -- MIDDAY
dialog: Mid-conversation:
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Two days ago he asked me if I like
dialog: movies. Like movies are something
dialog: some people don’t like. He actually
dialog: posed the question like it was some
dialog: great conversation-starter.
dialog: (imitating his voice)
dialog: “Do you like movies?”
dialog: (looking into her salad)
dialog: It was painful.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I wish someone would ask me that
dialog: sometime. That’s a probing sort of
dialog: intelligence, I think.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: BURT
text: He doesn’t assume the obvious.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: But the way he dresses! He wears
dialog: basketball jerseys without any
text: shirt underneath.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: It’s Phoenix.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: But he’s so white!
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Is he buff?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: No.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Most basketball players aren’t. Or
dialog: they didn’t use to be. You ever see
dialog: the Celtics from the 70s? They were
text: mostly white and not very buff. Is
dialog: this guy from Boston?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I think his family is from Boston.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: There you go.
speaker_heading: GRACE
text: He drives a Cabriolet.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Great design. Good mileage.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: He uses the word “robust.”
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Lots of things are robust!
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: He took me to Long John Silver's.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (to Verona)
dialog: I thought you said it was a
dialog: steakhouse.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: When I told him I didn’t want the
dialog: steakhouse, he took me to Long John
dialog: Silver's.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: He’s being sensitive to your needs
dialog: and desires. You say no turf, he
dialog: goes surf. He’s a quick thinker.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: But every time I have an issue with
dialog: something, he just accommodates me.
dialog: I tell him not to wear bleached
dialog: jeans and he doesn’t wear them. I
dialog: think he read somewhere that he’s
dialog: supposed to laugh at my jokes, so
dialog: for a week he would literally
dialog: double-over every time I made an
dialog: attempt. Like this:
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: GRACE (cont'd)
dialog: (she demonstrates by
text: throwing her head
dialog: forward)
dialog: You know, like even when he was
dialog: driving. I had to ask him to stop.
text: Verona gives Burt a look, like he needs to step up for Rob.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: This guy seems like a goddamned
dialog: champ, Grace. He seems awesome. I’d
dialog: marry him if it wasn’t against the
dialog: law here.
text: Grace now sees through the gambit. Verona gives Burt a
text: withering look.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I’ll get the check.
text: Burt leaves the table and walks to the front desk.
text: seconds, he’s talking to the woman there, older and with a
text: sizable chest.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Look at him. We’re having a baby
dialog: that might have three feet or one
dialog: eye and the thing he’s most worried
dialog: about is whether or not I‘’1ll keep
dialog: my boobs.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I think that’s sexy.
text: Burt returns. He winks at Verona, like he’s got news for
dialog: later.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: So I’m meeting Rob at the driving
dialog: range?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Yeah. Hey thanks, Burt. It means a
dialog: lot to me. Just... get a feel for
dialog: him.
dialog: (mock-dramatically)
dialog: Tell me if I can be as happy with
dialog: him as Rona is with you.
text: Young Martin Luther, son of the Performance Mom, has appeared

dialog: Baby!
speaker_heading: PERFORMANCE MOM
dialog: (delighted)
dialog: Right, Martin Luther! This woman is
dialog: about to have a baby -- any day
dialog: now!
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Or in three months.
dialog: (giving the mom a fake
dialog: smile)
dialog: Thank you.
text: The kid is still at Verona’s side, inspecting her. The
dialog: Performance Mom thinks she has an audience and is thus more
text: delighted than ever.
speaker_heading: PERFORMANCE MOM
dialog: Martin Luther, tell the pretty lady
dialog: what you know about babies.
text: The boy says nothing. He’s frozen up.
speaker_heading: PERFORMANCE MOM
dialog: C’mon, tell the nice people.
text: The boy directs a malevolent look at his baby sister.
speaker_heading: PERFORMANCE MOM
dialog: Martin. You’re being rude--
speaker_heading: KID
text: (still staring at his
dialog: sister)
dialog: Babies like to breathe and are good
text: at hiding it. I put a pillow over a
dialog: baby and I thought she wasn’t
text: breathing but then she was. She was
dialog: sneaky. She was breathing the whole
dialog: time. But I’1l try again.
text: Ashen-faced, the Performance Mom and her kids leave.
text: Burt’s phone rings.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I’m gonna take this on the way to
dialog: meeting Rob. I’1l see you guys
dialog: later.
dialog: 54.
text: He leaves.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (on phone, in loud, Casey
dialog: Kasem voice)
dialog: Ned! I can’t believe you're not
text: hiding under a rock with the way
dialog: your Titans played last Sunday! Ha
dialog: ha ha... What? Yes siree I had
dialog: money on it!
text: Grace wistfully watches him walk away.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You got lucky, sister.
text: Verona ponders this for a second. She’s inclined to cut the
text: compliment with self-deprecating humor, but she refrains.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Yeah. I know.
scene_heading: INT. BATHTUB SHOWROOM
text: Verona and Grace are walking through the aisles, touching the
text: bathtubs and fixtures. This is a high-end showroom for
text: decorators, and people with a lot of disposable income.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: So what would you think if we moved
dialog: here? You could be Auntie Grace all
dialog: the time. We could drive Burt
dialog: crazy.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I would love it, Rone. You have no
dialog: idea. But I don’t know if I’m here
dialog: for the long haul.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: But you’re looking at seven-
dialog: thousand-dollar tubs!
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I can sell my house for twice what
dialog: I paid for it. I can live five
dialog: years off the profit. So... I just
dialog: might do that. I don’t know. And I
dialog: wouldn’t want you moving all the
dialog: way here just to see me leave.
text: They walk through the showroom.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: It’s strange how we live, don’t you
dialog: think?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: How do you mean?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: You’re younger than me, you're
dialog: single, and you live in a 4,000-
dialog: square-foot house. Burt and I are
dialog: having a baby and we rent a three-
dialog: room ranch.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: It’s only because I try when it
dialog: comes to money, Rone. You have your
dialog: head in other places. I’m always
dialog: going to be good at making money
dialog: because I like making money. Why?
dialog: Because I’m good at it. I don’t
dialog: have a talent like you do.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: My talent is drawing people's
dialog: organs. I wouldn’t glamorize it too
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Get in.
text: Grace is sitting inside a large white tub set atop giant claw
dialog: feet.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I don’t need to get in. It’s a nice
dialog: tub.
dialog: (now really looking at it,
dialog: noticing something)
dialog: Looks like the one we used to have
text: at home.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Come on. I’1l pretend to wash your
dialog: hair.
text: Verona sheepishly steps into the tub and sits with her back
text: to Grace. Grace takes her hair into her hands and kneads it,
text: pretending to lather shampoo into it.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: When was the last time you went
dialog: back?
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Home? I haven’t. Not for ... a
dialog: while. When are you gonna sell that
dialog: place, anyway?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You mean when are we going to sell *
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I told you I don’t want anything to
dialog: do with it. You did the estate
dialog: sale, you sell the house, too.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I feel funny selling it at the
dialog: prices they’re offering. I’m going
dialog: to wait -- I have a feeling the
dialog: neighborhood's going to turn
dialog: around. Just need some families to
dialog: come back.

speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: It’s weird to think the baby won't
dialog: have grandparents from our side.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: It hits you again when these things
dialog: come up. When there are places they
dialog: should be but can’t be.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Ah ha.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Now I know why you won’t marry that
dialog: good man.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: That’s not it.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You don’t want to have Uncle Mark
dialog: or someone else walking you down
dialog: the aisle...
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: It’s not--
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: And giving you away! That would be
dialog: sad, I guess. I can understand
dialog: that. I’m not looking forward to it
dialog: myself. Maybe I’1l elope...
text: Verona’s eyes are wet, but Grace can’t see this. They sit in
text: silence for a moment.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: It’s not good to think about.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: No, it’s not.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Let's go.
text: Grace steps out of the tub and then offers Verona a hand up.
text: Verona struggles but gets herself up and out.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL -- EVENING
text: Verona is on the floor, doing pre-natal yoga stretches. Burt
text: bursts in.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: That was the most boring afternoon
dialog: of my life.
text: He throws himself against the wall, as if shipwrecked and
text: finally finding dry land.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: It’s hard to explain. He was
text: wearing Dockers. Everywhere -- on
text: his legs, on his head, his feet...
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Thanks for not saying anything to
dialog: Grace.
speaker_heading: BURT
text: He had a Dockers shirt, a Dockers
text: phone holster...
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I’m sorry, honey.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I can’t figure out how a guy can be
dialog: that boring. Even while he was
dialog: boring me, I thought maybe I could
dialog: study it, like, be interested in
dialog: how boring he was. But even that
dialog: failed. I was bored by being bored
dialog: by him. It was unprecedented.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Well, I know she probably won't
dialog: stay with this guy, but at least we
dialog: might ween her off the bad boys.
dialog: Since high school all she wants is
dialog: the bad boys. Even the guy she was
dialog: engaged to was a bad boy.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: The florist?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: The florist from Japan was a bad
dialog: boy?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: He was really rebellious.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: What... Too much baby’s breath?
dialog: That kind of thing?
text: Verona is struggling to get off the floor.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I’m so tired of being big.
text: Burt helps her up.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I’m tired of not having sex.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Do you want to have sex?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: No.
text: Burt stares blankly.
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: We haven’t had sex in a month.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: But you don’t want to have it now.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: We had sex last week.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: No. You came on my boobs.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Oh. Right.
dialog: (quickly losing himself in
dialog: a reverie)
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: It‘’‘ll be months before I get my
dialog: shape back.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: So we don’t have sex for a while. I
dialog: was prepared for that. This is one
dialog: of those dips we go through. There
dialog: are periods when you don’t have
dialog: sex, Rone. I mean, what if I got
text: into a horrible boating accident,
dialog: and was covered in third-degree
dialog: burns on most of my body? We’d do
dialog: without sex then, right?
text: Verona can’t believe this. She grabs the ice bucket and heads
text: to the door. She stops.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I’m pregnant, Burt. You didn’t get
dialog: in a boating accident. And how do
dialog: you get burns in a boating
dialog: accident?
dialog: (opening the door)
dialog: We don’t even HAVE a boat.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Yeah but--
text: She closes the door on him. Relief. We follow her all the way
text: down the hall, in utter silence. She savors the quiet, the
text: respite from Burt’s mouth.
dialog: 60.
text: She gets the ice, and when returning, slows down as she comes
text: upon the door, almost knowing that as soon she opens it,
text: he’1l begin again -- as if the conversation had never paused.
text: She takes a breath. She opens the door. She was right.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Funny you mentioned not having a
dialog: boat. I meant to talk to you about
dialog: that. I want the baby to grow up
dialog: knowing the joys of the high seas.
dialog: I want to raise her on the water. I
dialog: want the salt water running through
dialog: her veins!
text: Verona throws herself onto the bed and buries her face in her
text: pillow. Burt misinterprets this as a sign that she’s still
dialog: upset about being big.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Rona? C’mon. Don’t be sad. You’re
dialog: not that big. And you’re still
dialog: super-sexy. Hot even.
text: She buries her face deeper.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Oh honey. I’11 always love you,
dialog: even if you're enormous. Even if it
dialog: takes you MONTHS to lose the
dialog: weight! A year! I‘’1l love you
dialog: always, Rone -- even if you GAIN
text: weight after the baby.
text: Verona makes no sign she’s hearing him.
speaker_heading: BURT
text: (now quieter, as if he’s
dialog: saying something really
dialog: poignant now)
dialog: Even if you gain so much weight I
dialog: can’t find your vagina.
text: She screams into the pillow.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (now whispering)
dialog: Really. You can write that in
dialog: stone, in your heart. I ... will
dialog: -». love you ... even if... I can’t
dialog: find your vagina.
dialog: 61.
scene_heading: INT. PLANE -- ON WAY TO HARTFORD
text: Verona is listening to the baby’s heartbeat with a portable
text: Doppler machine.
speaker_heading: VERONA
text: Her heart-rate is still pretty
dialog: slow.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Like 115.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: That’s normal enough, right?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: It’s supposed to be between 120 and
dialog: 160.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: She's just mellow. Mellow’s good.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I don’t want mellow now. I want
text: lively now, mellow later.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I think it’s fine.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: It’s because you don’t want to
dialog: fight. We should fight more. Get
text: her riled up.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Didn't we fight last night?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: We discussed. We need to fight. You
dialog: never raise your voice.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Fine. Okay... You did something
dialog: wrong and I’m mad about it. Man, I
dialog: am cross. Real mad.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: No. It has to be convincing.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Should I swear?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: No. Just raise your voice.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (suddenly screaming)
dialog: You cunt-sucker!
text: Half the plane turns.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: (in an urgent whisper)
dialog: I didn’t mean now!
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: But the element of surprise is
dialog: crucial! You’ve never heard me say
dialog: cunt-sucker, have you?
text: Verona has sunk so low in her seat that she’s talking into
text: her breasts.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: See? I’ll get that heartrate up.
dialog: I know what I’m doing.
text: He pats her hand. She’s still recovering.
scene_heading: INT. CAR -- DRIVING TO HARTFORD CAMPUS
text: They drive through a nice part of Hartford, and the beginning
text: of a tree-filled college campus.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: This is nice.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Yeah. I haven’t seen Ellen in... I
dialog: have no idea when I saw her last.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I can’t believe you thought to call
dialog: her.
dialog: Beat.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Shit! My interview!
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: It’s tomorrow.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: How do you know?
text: She opens his jacket. The itinerary is no longer stapled to
text: the lining of his jacket.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: What did you do with it?
text: Burt smiles. He’s got it figured out. He reaches down and
text: takes off his shoe. He looks, but finds nothing inside. Now
text: the other shoe. Nothing.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I wore the wrong shoes.
text: They drive onto campus.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: So is Ellen a full professor, or an
dialog: associate or...? And which side is
dialog: she on -- she’s a first cousin?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Well, she’s not technically my
dialog: cousin. Her mom was an old friend
dialog: of my dad’s. I have no idea how.
dialog: They started calling us cousins
dialog: when we were kids. You met her at
dialog: my brother's wedding.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: She seemed really angry. She called
dialog: the band racist.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: She doesn’t think white people
dialog: should play soul music.
text: Verona scoffs.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Be nice.
dialog: 64.
scene_heading: EXT. AFTERNOON -- SMALL COLLEGE CAMPUS
text: They get out of their car and look around. Burt is trying to
text: call Ellen; he gets no answer.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: You didn’t get the address?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: She told me to call when I got to
dialog: campus.
text: The first person they see is a professor -- a woman of about
text: 38, with a baby in a stroller.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Excuse me. You wouldn’t happen to
dialog: know where Ellen Forney-Fisher’s
dialog: office is?
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Ellen Forney-Fisher.
dialog: (she says the name with a
dialog: remarkable amount of
dialog: distaste)
dialog: Well I do know, as a matter of
dialog: fact. She’s in Altgeld Hall. Room
text: 340. In the corner.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: You think she’s there now? We’re
dialog: early.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Well, if she’s not in her office,
dialog: she’ll probably be around campus.
dialog: She'll be the mom without the
text: stroller.
text: They thank the professor and head toward Altgeld.
scene_heading: INT. ALTGELD HALL -- DAYTIME
text: They're walking through the halls of the building, looking
dialog: for the room number.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: She doesn’t have a stroller? I
dialog: thought you said she got some big
dialog: trust fund.
dialog: %
dialog: + eH
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: She did. Her mother married a
dialog: Vanderbilt. Or a Carnegie. Which
dialog: one did the pants?
text: They arrive at the office. The door says LN HYLAND.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I thought her name was Ellen. What
dialog: does L N stand for?
text: It dawns on Verona that “Ellen” is spelled “LN.”
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: She must have changed it. Don’t say
dialog: anything about it. Please.
text: He knocks on the door.
speaker_heading: LN (0.S.)
dialog: It’s open!
text: They open the door upon a horrifying sight. There is a woman
text: standing behind a desk. The woman has one baby in a sling,
text: and this baby is sucking on her left nipple. On the desk
text: stands a four-year-old boy. He is sucking on her right
dialog: nipple.
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: (waving)
dialog: Hello!
text: The four-year-old peels his lips from the nipple and waves,
dialog: too.
scene_heading: FOUR-YEAR-OLD
dialog: Welcome!
text: LN gestures them forward, in a “Come in! Come in!” sort of
text: way. Burt and Verona are frozen. LN is about 37, blond,
text: attractive, with luxurious curly hair. She’s wearing a woven
dialog: poncho.
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: Come here, give me kisses!
text: Verona and Burt proceed, their feet leaden.
dialog: + eH
dialog: 66.
text: LN tucks her breasts back under her blouse and charges toward
text: Burt and Verona. The four-year-old wipes his mouth with the
text: back of his hand.
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: How are you two? Look at you!
dialog: You're hardly showing! What a
dialog: beauty you are, Verona. I thought
dialog: something might have been wrong
dialog: when you were so late.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Sorry about that. I blacked out.
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: How inventive! You used to be so
dialog: prompt, Burt. What are you doing to
dialog: him, Verona? He was always on
dialog: time... C’mon.
dialog: (getting her bag and
dialog: indicating the four-year-
dialog: old)
dialog: I have to get this one to crafting.
text: The four-year-old puts on what seems to be a coat -- no, it’s
text: a cape, black and velvet -- and they all leave the office.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS -- LATE-LATE AFTERNOON
text: They're walking through the quad, on the way to their cars.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Sorry about that. We tried to call
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: Oh yeah. I never answer the phone
dialog: when I’m feeding. Not fair to the
dialog: children.
text: They walk past a protest -- dozens of students with signs
text: (THE CIA TRAINED BIN LADEN) objecting to CIA recruiting on
dialog: campus.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: We got directions from a woman. She
dialog: seemed to know you. She had a baby,
dialog: very tall?
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: Oh god. Ruby Eng. She hates me. I
text: breastfed her baby.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: You what?
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: I was babysitting and the child was
dialog: fussing -- he was starving, didn’t
dialog: want the bottle. So I fed him. Took
dialog: to me right away. I shouldn't have
dialog: told her; she didn’t appreciate it.
dialog: She has lactation problems. Now she
dialog: won’t let me babysit, or get near
dialog: her husband. How paranoid is that?
dialog: So should we eat in? Out?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: How about in? We’ve been traveling
dialog: all day. Staying home would be so
dialog: nice.
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: Okay... Let’s think of what I have
dialog: at home...
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Let us get the food! We have a car.
dialog: We can go to the store and get
dialog: whatever we need. It would be our
dialog: pleasure.
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: Oh that’s great. Look at you, so
dialog: helpful. I guess it’s in the blood.
text: Verona has to take a second to figure out how many ways she
text: was just insulted. They’re still walking through campus.
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: I’m so glad you guys got pregnant
dialog: so easily. To be honest, I had my
dialog: doubts, given Verona’s tilted
dialog: uterus. Oh, here I am.
dialog: (indicating her car -- a
dialog: Prius)
dialog: I’1ll see you at the house.
scene_heading: INT. RENTAL CAR -- ON WAY TO GROCERY STORE
text: Verona is driving. Fuming.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: (furious)
dialog: You told her I have a tilted
dialog: uterus?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I don’t know. It might have been my
dialog: mom. Is your tilted uterus a
dialog: secret?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Yeah my tilted uterus is a fucking
dialog: secret!
text: Something occurs to Burt.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Oh really, you fucking bitch? Your
dialog: fucking uterus is a motherfucking
dialog: secret? Well fuck you!
text: Verona is shocked.
text: Burt grabs the Doppler from the bag.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GROCERY STORE -- AFTERNOON
text: Burt is pushing the cart through the aisles.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Why don't we divide up? You get the
dialog: wine and some beer and I'll get the
dialog: pasta and vegetables.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I don't want to get the wine.
dialog: People give me bad looks when I buy
dialog: wine.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: You're being totally paranoid.
dialog: Rone, you have to trust me on this.
dialog: Nobody even notices you now that
dialog: you're pregnant.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: That's supposed to make me feel
dialog: better?
dialog: 69.
text: Verona goes to the wine section. She selects a few bottles,
text: red and white, and a six-pack of beer. As she makes her way
text: back to Burt's cart, heads are turning, old women are
text: whispering. A mother pushing her child in a cart hisses.
text: She reunites with Burt near the checkout line.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: We need a gift.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Oh god. Really?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: We should. My parents will kill me
dialog: if we don’t.
dialog: (alighting on an idea)
dialog: A stroller! They don’t have one!
dialog: We'll be heroes. Look!
text: He points out the window, across the parking lot, to a BABIES
dialog: R US.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: If you check out, I’1l get the
text: stroller.
text: Burt is suddenly distracted. He’s spotted one of the check-
text: out women, about 50, with large breasts.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (already making his way to
dialog: the checkout)
dialog: Good plan, good...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BABY STORE
text: Verona loading a stroller into the back of the car.
scene_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. GROCERY STORE
text: Burt is talking intensely with the large-breasted checkout
text: woman. He’s got the checkout pen (the one on the spiral cord)
text: and he’s taking notes on an empty paper bag.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: So you're saying the trick is--
speaker_heading: a * + FH FH HH FF
dialog: *
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: You gotta stop breastfeeding at 6
dialog: months.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Interesting...
text: There’s a loud buzzing or beeping sound from outside. Burt
text: and the woman briefly look up but then resume their
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: And drink whole milk. And beer,
dialog: lots of beer. Good for the mams.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (admiring her chest)
dialog: They ARE good...
text: The noise from outside continues. They again look up, trying
dialog: to find the source of all the racket.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: And the thing about stretchmarks--
dialog: Wait. Is she with you?
text: They both look up to see:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CAR
text: Verona leaning on the horn. It’s been her the whole time,
text: watching Burt through the glass, furious.
scene_heading: INT. LN’S HOUSE -- EVENING
text: Burt and Verona ring the bell.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: One question about LN’s boobs and I
dialog: throw you through that window.
text: She's pointing to a second-story window.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: That one, huh? Okay. Gotcha.
text: LN opens the door, wearing a long flowing hippie robe-dress --
text: something like Joseph’s technicolor dreamcoat.
dialog: *
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: Namaste! *
dialog: Burt and Verona = blank looks. *
speaker_heading: LN *
dialog: Come in! Come in! The spirit within *
dialog: me salutes the spirit within you! *
text: They step inside. We see that there's an elaborate cubby-hole *
text: like set-up of shoes and slippers.
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: If you don’t mind...
text: Verona picks out a pair of black knitted slippers. Burt is
text: left with one option: an elf-like pair, with pointed toes.
dialog: Welcome to greater Hartford! *
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Here, we brought you something. *
text: Burt goes back to the porch to retrieve it. *
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: (to Verona)
dialog: That is so sweet. Aren't you a
dialog: dumpling?
text: Burt presents the stroller, assembled, to LN. LN looks at it
text: like a rolling mound of pig shit is coming toward her.
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: Oh no... no, no. We don’t use
dialog: those. No. Take it away.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: This is my house. Respect that, at
dialog: LEAST! Take that thing away.
text: Burt begins to roll the stroller into a side room. *
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: No! The porch. The door! Out!
text: Burt opens the front door and wheels it out. *
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: What the hell, LN?
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: Burt. I love my babies. Why would I
dialog: push them away from me like that?
dialog: (demonstrating with an
dialog: aggressive move of
text: pushing a stroller, as if
dialog: off a cliff)
dialog: No. We do continuum here.
text: (in a hush, still
dialog: traumatized)
dialog: Yes. Continuum.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: What is that -- continuum?
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: Continuum?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: (as if any mother-to-be
dialog: should know)
dialog: Continuum.
text: LN and Verona stare each other down for a second.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Please, LN, you should just cut the
dialog: shit and tell me.
text: Burt raises his eyebrows.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: (to Burt)
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: (faux-sweetly, to LN)
dialog: I can’t wait to hear.
text: Verona’s tone can’t keep LN from preaching the gospel.
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: The Continuum movement recognizes
dialog: that the world will give your baby
text: plenty of alienation and despair in
dialog: good time, so while we can we
dialog: should hold them close.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: So you can’t push the kid ina
dialog: stroller?
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: No, no. Why do you think this
dialog: country is so dysfunctional? Why we
dialog: feel disconnected from our homes
dialog: and loved ones?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Because of strollers?
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: In this house we carry the
dialog: children. We keep them attached. We
dialog: don’t sever the biological ties at
dialog: first opportunity.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: What about sleeping?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FAMILY BEDROOM
text: Burt and Verona are standing behind LN, who is showing them a
text: smallish, dimly lit, wood-paneled bedroom, dominated entirely
text: by a huge mattress. It’s almost twice the size of a king-size
dialog: bed.
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: We have one bed. Sleep-time is
dialog: their most fraught time, when they
dialog: most need to know that their
text: progenitors are near. Hi Roderick.
text: It wasn’t clear at first, but RODERICK, LN’s partner, is
text: laying on the bed. Roderick is tall, lanky, with longish
text: dirty-blond hair and a broad open face. He turns over and
text: greets them with a lazy wave. Both kids -- WOLF, 4, and
text: NEPTUNE, 2 -- are laying with him, attached, in slings. They
text: look barely able to breathe.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Hi. I don’t think we’ve met.
text: Burt tries to crawl over the bed on his knees, to shake
text: Roderick’s hand. Roderick makes almost no effort.
speaker_heading: RODERICK
dialog: Yes we have. Burning Man. 1997.
dialog: *
dialog: 74.
text: Verona looks at Burt, aghast. Burt quietly acknowledges that
dialog: this is true.
text: Burt and Verona take in the room. There are about two dozen
text: pictures of seahorses on the walls.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: What about sex?
speaker_heading: RODERICK
dialog: What about it?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: You go out to the car or what?
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: No we don’t go out to the car. Are
dialog: you planning to hide your
dialog: lovemaking from your kids, Burt? Do
dialog: you know what that does to a child,
dialog: to have their parents’ expression
dialog: of love kept a secret from them?
speaker_heading: RODERICK
dialog: That’s why I have an Electra
dialog: Complex.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Which one is that again?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: That’s when a woman wants to do her
dialog: father.
dialog: (to Roderick)
dialog: Do you mean Oedipal Complex?
speaker_heading: RODERICK
dialog: Don’t try to diagnose me, Verona.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (nodding toward the
dialog: paintings)
dialog: Why the seahorses, Rod?
text: Roderick tries to answer, but emotion has overcome him.
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: In the seahorse community, the
dialog: males give birth.
text: She gives Roderick a sympathetic look, as if to apologize.
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: RODERICK
text: The female inserts her ovipositor
text: into the male’s brood pouch. That’s
text: where she deposits her eggs.
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: (with such tenderness)
dialog: If I could, I would lay my eggs in
dialog: your brood pouch.
speaker_heading: RODERICK
dialog: (barely choking out the
dialog: words )
dialog: I know you would.
text: Burt and Verona are utterly stricken.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LN’S HOUSE -- EVENING -- DINNER TABLE
text: At dinner, Verona, Burt, Roderick and LN are joined by LN’s

speaker_heading: LN
dialog: It’s so good to have you two here.
speaker_heading: VERONA

text: Wolf nods proudly.
speaker_heading: RODERICK
dialog: So are you counting on this job
dialog: interview tomorrow? At.. Where is
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Providential. Not really. I already
dialog: do fine. This would just be a
dialog: better commission rate.
dialog: +e HF FF *
dialog: %
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: RODERICK
dialog: It’s weird what you do, isn’t it,
dialog: Burt? You sort of make money from
dialog: people’s fears. The more the
dialog: government and the media scares us,
dialog: the more cash you haul in.
text: Burt doesn’t take Roderick very seriously.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Nice to see you out of bed,
dialog: Roderick.
scene_heading: FOUR-YEAR-OLD
dialog: Would you like a dolma?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: What is it?
scene_heading: FOUR-YEAR-OLD
dialog: It’s an amuse-bouche.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: What?
scene_heading: FOUR-YEAR-OLD
dialog: It means “pleasing to the mouth.”
dialog: To whet your appetite.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Okay. Right. Thank you.
text: He takes one.
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: Have you decided on a doula?
speaker_heading: BURT
text: (holding up the appetizer
dialog: Wolf gave him)
dialog: I have one. Delicious.
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: A doula, not a dolma.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: We're not using a doula.
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: A midwife?
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (finally catching on)
dialog: Nope. No. Midwifes and doulas are
dialog: for when the husband is clueless or
dialog: doesn’t want to be involved. I am
dialog: neither of those things. You know,
dialog: I did successfully apply a
dialog: tourniquet to a man and I've been
dialog: doing some reading about the birth
dialog: process...
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: The tourniquet? I was there. It was
dialog: camp. We were twelve. Don’t you
dialog: think Verona might need someone who
dialog: understands the female experience?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: We haven't decided yet exactly what
dialog: we're doing--
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: We don’t need some stranger in the
text: delivery room who looks like Joan
dialog: Baez.
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: Who what?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: You know this is true. Every
dialog: midwife I’ve seen -- they always
dialog: look like Joan Baez. You know, with
dialog: the short hair and the
dialog: (demonstrating)
text: pointy, lady sideburns.
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: (changing the subject)
dialog: How’s Jim?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: My parents are fine, LN. They’re
dialog: moving to Belgium.
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: Belgium? Whose idea was that?
dialog: Sounds like Glenda’s.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: What does that mean?
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: LN
dialog: Uncle Jim was always more of a
dialog: romantic. He wouldn’t have chosen
dialog: Belgium. Don’t tell me they’re
dialog: going to Antwerp.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Just stop. You’re way inappropriate
dialog: about my dad. And don’t call him
dialog: Uncle Jim. He’s not your uncle.
dialog: Just ... gah.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Burt-—
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Dammit, LN, you've always done
dialog: this. You and your mom always got
dialog: too involved in my family. We
dialog: really -- just don’t give us advice
dialog: about the birth, okay?
speaker_heading: RODERICK
dialog: Alice Walker says there’s nothing
dialog: more important than how you enter
dialog: this world, and I agree with her.
dialog: My mom had a hospital birth -- the
text: stirrups, the drugs, the machines.
dialog: And she wonders why I can’t hold
dialog: down a job, why I can’t walk into a
dialog: dry cleaners without vomiting. It’s
text: astonishing, her complicity in
dialog: everything. And when I’m twelve she
dialog: catches me with some peyote and I’m
dialog: like, “What’d you expect? You
dialog: started it with the epidural.”
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (putting his silverware
dialog: down )
dialog: I’m going to ... put some quarters
text: in the parking meter.
text: Everyone knows there are no parking meters for miles, but no
text: one says a word. Burt walks out the front door.
scene_heading: EXT. LN’S DRIVEWAY
text: Verona has followed him outside. They’re standing in the
text: gravel driveway.
text: They hug,
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I’m sorry about that. If I didn’t
dialog: have to be almost related to her, I
dialog: wouldn’t even bother.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: It’s all right.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I swear I didn’t tell her about
dialog: your tilted uterus.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Thanks.
text: and this leads to a small kiss, which leads to a
text: passionate one, which leads to some groping. The action is
text: getting heated.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Stop.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: We shouldn’t do this here.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: What? Why?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Do you know what it does to a child
dialog: to have their parents’ friends’
dialog: lovemaking kept a secret from them?
dialog: What if I came and Wolfie didn’t
dialog: get to witness it? I don’t want an
dialog: Electra complex on my conscience.
dialog: c'mon--
text: She takes off her shirt and pretends to walk back toward the
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Okay, okay. Let’s go.
text: He grabs her from behind and tries to lift her to wheel her
text: around. He grunts involuntarily -- she’s heavier than he
text: expected -- and never quite gets her off the ground.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL -- LATER THAT NIGHT
dialog: 80.
text: Burt and Verona are in the hotel room, both trying to
dialog: capitalize on the sexual mood.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Okay, no more talking about LN.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: But she is nuts, right?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: She’s an awful person. An unholy
dialog: union of intentions and
text: pretensions.
text: Burt is lying in the bed and Verona is putting on a
text: nightgown, something distinctly unflattering. We see Burt
text: examining the nightgown, forming a thought.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Hey Verona...
text: Verona immediately can sense that an unsolicited remark about
text: her appearance is coming.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Can I tell you something?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: No. Burt. C’mon, don’t blow it.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I just want to tell you one little
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Burt, I’m helping you out here.
text: (kneeling on the bed,
dialog: crawling toward him)
dialog: Just stop talking. I don’t want to
dialog: hear it.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: You don’t know what I’m going to
dialog: say.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I do.
dialog: 81.
text: Verona goes into the bathroom and closes the door. Burt gets
text: up and stands on the other side.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Verona. Listen.
dialog: No response.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Verona.
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Please.
text: She opens the door.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I was just going to say that I
dialog: don’t think you look good in that.
text: She screams a frustrated scream and walks out of the room.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- LATER
text: Verona is sitting in the lobby, on the couch, in her
text: nightgown. She’s watching TV with the HOTEL MANAGER, Indian
text: and in his 60s. Burt takes a second to process the scene, and
text: then awkwardly sits between Verona and her new friend.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Sorry. I’m such a jerk.
text: Verona says nothing. There are tears of frustration in her
text: eyes. She gets up and walks toward the elevator. Burt
text: follows.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Man am I stupid.
dialog: Nothing from Verona.
dialog: 82.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR -- CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I am the worst. I know it.
text: Verona seems to be softening.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
text: They walk in and Burt embraces Verona from behind, his hands
text: around her waist. Verona relents, resting her hands on his.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: What can I do? Say it. Anything.
text: Verona smiles, thinking of something.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: You want me to come on your tits?
text: Now she bawls.
scene_heading: EXT. HARTFORD -- LUNCH
text: Burt’s interview is over. He and Verona have gathered at a
text: cafe. Verona is at the counter, alone.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Can I get a small latte?
speaker_heading: BARRISTA
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Am I sure about what?
speaker_heading: BARRISTA
text: It has caffeine.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: That's the point.
text: The barrista points to Verona’s stomach. Now Verona gets it.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Just give me the latte, Doctor. And
text: a muffin.
text: She gets her drink and muffin and finds Burt and sits down.
text: He has his laptop open.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Oh god. The myth that people are
dialog: nicer to pregnant women... White
dialog: men cut me in every line because
dialog: I'm slower -- they think I’m weak.
dialog: And every woman thinks the baby’s
dialog: theirs, that I’ve asked them to
dialog: judge me. The only people who know
dialog: how to treat me are black men.
text: At that moment, a black man in the cafe, maybe on the
text: effeminate side, notices her.
speaker_heading: BLACK MAN
dialog: The goddess is alive!
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: (to Burt)
dialog: See?
dialog: (stirring her coffee)
dialog: How was the interview?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Oh god.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: It was so weird. He kept saying
dialog: things about how I didn’t look like
dialog: my picture, how he expected someone
dialog: else... He was confused. It was
dialog: awkward.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Huh.
dialog: (something dawns on her)
dialog: Oh no.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Your website.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: What about it?
dialog: 84.
text: She grabs Burt’s laptop and types in a url. Up pops Burt’s
dialog: website, which features information about insurance futures,
text: and Burt's business philosophy, and, over the name BURT
text: FARLANDER, a picture of a handsome, silver-haired 58-year-old
text: man, in a perfect suit, sitting on the corner of a desk.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: That was your idea.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I thought it fit the voice. Sorry.
text: They sit in silence.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: How long till the flight leaves?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Six hours.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: LN signed us up for a birth class.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Of course she did.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: We haven’t been to one. We have
dialog: nothing else to do.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Could be funny.
scene_heading: INT. BIRTH CLASS -- AFTERNOON
text: We join Burt and Verona as they’re leaving for a mid-class
text: break. They file out of the room with all of the other
text: couples. Trailing behind is CONNIE, the woman running the
text: class. She looks exactly like -- or is actually played by --
dialog: Joan Baez.
speaker_heading: CONNIE
text: Ten minutes and come back. The hard
text: part is over.
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: (whispering to Burt)
dialog: I'm actually surprised. This class
text: has been almost completely normal.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: She’s not all bad.
text: Verona goes to the bathroom. Burt is at the vending machines
text: when he’s approached by a man of about 35, bearded, athletic -
text: - he looks like a 70s-era football player.
speaker_heading: BEARDED GUY
dialog: You gonna watch?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Excuse me?
text: Burt has his hand inside the machine, trying to retrieve his
dialog: Twizzlers.
speaker_heading: BEARDED GUY
dialog: Which side of the curtain you gonna
dialog: be on?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: In the delivery room? I’1l be right
dialog: there. I’m gonna watch every
dialog: minute.
speaker_heading: BEARDED GUY
dialog: Don’t do it.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I’m gonna do it.
speaker_heading: BEARDED GUY
dialog: Don't do it, man. Those movies we
dialog: watched (indicating the
dialog: classroom)... They don’t show
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: You've been through this?
speaker_heading: BEARDED GUY
dialog: Yeah. My first wife. Listen. How
dialog: big a man are you?
dialog: (indicating Burt’s pants)
dialog: Let's assume you’re average.
text: He takes Burt’s Twizzlers and peels one strand of licorice
dialog: off the bunch.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: BEARDED GUY
dialog: Now, for years now, your Twizzler
dialog: has had a nice, warm, compact
dialog: docking bay waiting for it, right?
text: Burt tries to straighten the Twizzler, which has drooped.
speaker_heading: BEARDED GUY
dialog: Now you’re sitting in the delivery
dialog: room, thinking “miracle of life,”
dialog: “spectacle of birth,” right? But
dialog: here’s your Twizzler. And here’s
dialog: the size of a baby. Once that
dialog: humanoid comes out of your wife,
dialog: are you ever gonna be able to see
dialog: your wife’s -- excuse me -- tootie
dialog: the same way again? No sir. That
dialog: space is no longer yours. It’s like
dialog: they built a superhighway in your
dialog: childhood bedroom.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: A what? Where?
speaker_heading: BEARDED GUY
dialog: My first wife did 1000 Kegels a day
dialog: and I swear she had the loosest
dialog: slot outside of Reno. I shit you
dialog: not -- I could stick a baby right
dialog: back in there with the hole she
dialog: had. Wouldn’t need a lubricant.
dialog: Ask me how much sex we had after
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BEARDED GUY
dialog: None. Now ask me why we got
dialog: divorced.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BEARDED GUY
dialog: Ask me why my son is living in
dialog: Mexico City with a semi-
dialog: professional soccer player they
dialog: call The Bandito.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: No.
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: BEARDED GUY
dialog: Stay behind the curtain, my man.
dialog: Don’t be a hero.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CLASS -- LATER
dialog: There are five or six other couples there, fairly
text: nondescript; if anything, they’re a bit on the artsy side.
text: They're gathered in a semi-circle.
speaker_heading: CONNIE
dialog: Okay gang. Now, finally: If there’s
dialog: one thing I want you to take away
dialog: from this, it’s that the
dialog: placenta...
text: Here she removes the towel that has been covering a jar.
text: Inside the jar is what appears to be some kind of long-
text: pickled sea squid.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: (in an urgent whisper)
dialog: Oh Jesus. No.
text: The squid is purple, red, and tentacled. Burt’s jaw drops
dialog: open. He loves it.
speaker_heading: CONNIE
dialog: .-.-is not your enemy....
text: She lifts the jar and begins walking it around the room.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Oh lord god.
speaker_heading: CONNIE
dialog: It’s not some disgusting thing to
dialog: be thrown away at first
dialog: opportunity. As you may know, in
dialog: some cultures...
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: That’s always bad, when they say
dialog: “in some cultures...”
text: Burt is still enthralled.
speaker_heading: CONNIE
dialog: «+. the placenta is buried in the
text: backyard after a birth.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: CONNIE (cont'd)
text: In others, it’s cooked and eaten by
dialog: the family....
text: Burt is still wide-eyed, while Verona looks pale, and is
text: listing heavily, as if seasick.
speaker_heading: CONNIE
dialog: I want to introduce another option,
dialog: one that I’ve had the pleasure of
dialog: seeing work very well with many
dialog: couples at this facility. Are there
dialog: any artists here?
text: All but two of the attendees raise their hands. Everyone’s an
text: artist. Burt raises his, too. The one actual artist in the
text: room, Verona, has her arms folded.
speaker_heading: CONNIE
dialog: So you know the pleasures of
dialog: working with archival-quality
dialog: watercolor paper. Now imagine the
dialog: power of a relief print of your
dialog: placenta, if applied to high-
text: density archival watercolor paper.
text: She holds up a sample. Oohs and ahhs ensue. There is general
dialog: agreement among the attendees that this is a superb idea.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Why do those look familiar...?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Oh no.
text: It dawns on Burt and Verona that this is what LN’s placemats
dialog: were -- laminated placenta prints.
speaker_heading: CONNIE
dialog: Now you’re probably wondering, “How
dialog: big should the paper be? And how
dialog: Many good transfers can you get
dialog: before the placenta becomes too
dialog: dry?”..
text: Verona sighs loudly, leans her head on Burt’s shoulder, and
text: closes her eyes.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL -- LATER THAT AFTERNOON
text: They're packing to leave for the airport. Burt finds
text: something in his suitcase -- the video camera.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Damn. We’ve totally forgotten to be
dialog: documenting.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: You’re not serious.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Rone, you want no record of this
dialog: whole miraculous transformation?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I want no cheap ugly grainy video
dialog: record of this miraculous
dialog: transformation.
text: Burt’s already got the camera out and is hooking it into the
dialog: tripod.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Let’s go. Get naked. And get up
text: against the window there, with the
dialog: light. It’1l look cool.
text: Verona not-so-reluctantly complies. Soon she’s undressed and
text: standing near the window, with a soft light falling on her
dialog: curves.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: That’s nice. Nice. Now stand on the
dialog: chair.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Please? You want it to look
dialog: artistic, don’t you? Stand on the
dialog: chair. Like this.
dialog: (indicating one leg up,
dialog: like a flamingo)
text: Soon she’s in the desired position, and Burt gets the video
dialog: camera ready.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: So glad I brought the tripod. It’s
dialog: gonna be good... Okay, ready?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Ready.
text: Burt turns the camera on. His eyes go wide.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Oh Jesus.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: What?
text: Through the viewfinder, we see that there’s a tape already in
text: the camera. The frame shows a very un-pregnant Verona, naked,
text: standing in much the same position as she is at the moment.
text: The contrast is interesting: in the video, the color is lurid
text: and cheap. Just beyond, in the hotel room, Verona is
text: illuminated softly, and looks ethereal.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: What is it?
text: Burt is watching, eyes popping.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: You didn’t bring the tape.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (in quiet awe)
text: It’s in the camera.
text: Verona comes down off the chair and around to Burt. Together
text: they slowly sit down on the edge of the bed.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Oh god. I haven’t seen this since
dialog: we made it.
text: Burt and Verona sit attentively on the edge of the bed. The
text: tape begins. It’s a homemade sex video. The camera has been
text: left on a bookshelf by their bed, and has captured Burt and
text: Verona engaging in a relatively standard sex session.
text: We watch Verona and Burt as they watch the tape, and the look
text: that comes over their faces is one of utter melancholy. They
dialog: miss those days.
text: A song begins as Verona and Burt both begin to get teary.
text: That song is “The Way We Were.” We watch them watch
text: themselves humping, and the lyrics begin.
dialog: Memories
dialog: Like the pages of my mind
dialog: Misty watercolor memories
dialog: Of the way we were...
dialog: gl.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPLANE -- EN ROUTE TO MONTREAL
text: “The Way We Were” continues, wall-to-wall.
text: Verona is sitting on the plane, alone, peaceful. The seat
text: next to her -- Burt’s -- is unoccupied.
text: Suddenly he appears behind her. Screaming. Though we can’t
text: hear him, it’s clear he’s cursing loudly. Verona’s eyes open.
text: Everyone on the plane turns, aghast.
dialog: “The Way We Were” continues.
scene_heading: INT. MONTREAL HOUSE -- NIGHT
text: Verona and Burt are outside a beautiful walk-up in a clean
dialog: and charming neighborhood of the city.**
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: We went to the same college as
dialog: these guys. We graduated the same
dialog: year. How can they be so grown up
dialog: while we're...
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Immature? Stunted? Confused?
dialog: American?
text: They ring the doorbell. The chime is a novelty -- the sound
text: of a mild electric shock, and someone reacting to it:
speaker_heading: DOORBELL
dialog: Zzzzt. Ahhh!
text: Burt plays with the doorbell for a minute -- Zzzzt! Aaaaaah!
text: Zzzzzzt! Aaaaaah! A 5-year-old Chinese girl answers the door.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Hi. Are your parents home?
speaker_heading: YOUNG GIRL
text: They're in their room.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Hey Abigail. Abby. Remember me?
text: She shakes her head. Burt is mildly hurt.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Should we come in?
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Yeah.
text: Abby leads them into the house and into the TV room, where
text: four kids are splayed out all over a system of couches. The
text: kids are JAMES, 16 and white; on his lap is STUART, a 6-year-
text: old South African boy. Nearby is KATYA, 10, an adoptee from
text: Kazakhstan wearing a huge rainbow afro wig. Together they’re
text: all watching The Sound of Music.
speaker_heading: ABBY
text: It’s almost over.
text: Verona and Burt are encouraged to sit and watch.
text: The movie is at the point where the Von Trapp children
text: perform their “So long, farewell,” song. Just after the song -
text: - and before any Nazis appear, the movie abruptly ends, and
text: the credits roll. The lights come on and the kids begin to
dialog: sit and stand up.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Wait. What--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Shh.
text: TOM GARNETT, the father of the children, appears. He’s about
text: 37, handsome, unaffected, dressed to go clubbing. He walks
text: through the room, touching all of the children’s heads in a
dialog: very comfortable and very affectionate way. He’s a big-
text: hearted, magnanimous guy. Each of the kids loves the
text: attention -- their bond with him is undeniable -- though
text: Stuart, who thinks he’s a dinosaur, tries to bite Tom’s hand.
text: Tom now motions Burt out of the room. Verona follows and the
text: three of them huddle in the kitchen. Tom gives hugs to both
dialog: Burt and Verona.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Great to see you guys!
dialog: (to Verona)
dialog: You look amazing, Verona. Perfect.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: So, uh...
text: Burt gestures back to the TV room.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: We sorta edited it.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: You cut out the Nazis.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Yeah. We kinda figured, What’s the
dialog: point, you know?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: They haven’t caught on?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Not yet. Not even the oldest. Or
text: maybe he has, but he plays along.
dialog: You won’t tell them about the
dialog: Nazis?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (genuinely relieved)
dialog: Thanks man. I appreciate that.
dialog: There are always people who want
dialog: the kids to know everything right
dialog: away -- sex! war! genocide! But we
dialog: think the longer we can keep them
dialog: from knowing about the Nazis, the
dialog: better. They heard something about
dialog: Pol Pot a few months ago and I was
dialog: doing spin control for a week. Hey
dialog: Munch!
text: MUNCH, Tom’s wife, walks down the stairs and greets everyone.
text: Munch is casual, confident, with a huge and convincing smile.
text: She's also preppy, almost conservative-seeming at first
dialog: glance.
text: They all go back into the family room.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Kids, this is Verona and Burt. Your
dialog: mom and I went to college with
dialog: them.
text: Munch is staring at Verona, with sudden tears in her eyes.
text: Abby, the 5-year-old, pulls up a kids’ chair so she can stare
text: at Verona’s stomach; Munch keeps a strange distance.
text: Meanwhile, Stuart, the 6-year-old, takes Burt’s hand and
text: leads him to a corner of the couch. He positions Burt to sit
text: as if he’s lounging on the couch, about to take a nap. Stuart
text: then climbs onto the arm of the couch.
dialog: 94.
text: Burt sits on the couch.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Lie there.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Okay.
text: Stuart arranges Burt so he’s on the couch, resting against
text: one end, as if taking a nap.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Close your eyes.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Okay.
text: Burt closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Gah!
text: Stuart has jumped from the arm of the couch, onto Burt’s
text: stomach, feet first.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (to Munch and Tom)
dialog: What the hell was that?
speaker_heading: MUNCH
dialog: That’s Garfield. You’re John. The
text: cartoon. You’re napping, he leaps
dialog: on you. This is the game.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Do it again.
text: Burt complies. Again Stuart jumps on him, which hurts like a
text: mother. This continues as someone is tapping Verona on the
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (seeing over Verona’s
dialog: shoulder)
dialog: You have a visitor. Someone
dialog: important.
text: Verona turns around. There is a tall person, very small-
text: faced, wearing a raincoat. It’s Abby, sitting on the
text: shoulders of her sister Katya.
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: (in very serious, KGB
dialog: voice)
dialog: Ma’am.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I have a question for you.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Do you know the way to San Jose?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Okay you guys. We have to go now.
dialog: Your mom and dad are going to tear
dialog: up the town. James’1ll watch you.
text: Burt is still on the couch, getting assaulted by Stuart.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (with eyes closed)
dialog: How many times does John get woken
dialog: up by Garfield?
text: Blank stares all around. It could take a while.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Close your eyes.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: We'll get the car and meet you out
dialog: front. James, we'll be back late.
dialog: Lock up and give Katya her
dialog: medicine. And you have my cell.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I do. Have fun.
text: Burt slips away from Stuart and meets Tom near the hall --
text: they're putting on their coats.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Who’s that? The tall one... You
dialog: would have been about 18...
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: James? He’s not mine. He’s a kid
text: who lives down the street.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: TOM (cont'd)
dialog: He worked on our crew over the
dialog: summer, good with wood, drywall,
dialog: and ...
dialog: (as if it just occurred to
dialog: him)
dialog: I guess he lives with us now. His
dialog: dad’s a meth addict. His mom’s a
dialog: bassist. Good kid. Wants to be an
dialog: architect.
scene_heading: EXT. GARRETT’S HOUSE
text: Verona and Burt are walking down the steps, on the way to the
text: street. Verona clutches Burt’s sleeve.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: (rapturously)
dialog: This is the family I want. Every
text: part of it. The kids from all over
dialog: the world--
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: So you want to adopt?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (pointing to her stomach)
dialog: What about this one? Should we
dialog: trade her in? I bet we could get
dialog: two Chinese girls, or three
dialog: Russians--
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: No. I want her, and them, too. I
dialog: want to live in a big house like
dialog: this, with all the kids, and the
text: couches, and carpets, and have
text: everyone laying all over each other
dialog: like that. This is a family.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Yeah. It works. It’s real.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: We should move here. Montreal.
dialog: These guys’ll be our best friends
dialog: and our daughter will be friends
dialog: with all these kids. And she won’t
dialog: have any of the American baggage!
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: VERONA (cont'd)
dialog: She won’t have to pretend to be
text: Canadian when she backpacks through
dialog: Europe... Think of that.
text: Tom and Munch screech to a halt beside them, driving a small,
text: older sports car. Munch is already drinking from a flask. Tom
text: is at the wheel and is wearing driving gloves.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Let’s do this.
scene_heading: INT. TOM’S CAR
text: Tom is driving very fast. Verona and Burt are in the back
text: seat. They’re passing the flask around. Music blares. They've
text: gone into high party mode with incredible speed.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: So you still find time to go out?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: We’re out a lot, I guess. Depends
dialog: on when. You have to find that
dialog: balance. I mean, the kids want you
dialog: there, but not all the time. They
dialog: need air as much as you do.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I think we’re moving here.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: To Montreal? We already won the
dialog: competition? Over Hartford? Over
dialog: Phoenix? Hell yeah!
speaker_heading: MUNCH
dialog: That’s wonderful news.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Let’s toast. Does anyone know a
dialog: toast?
dialog: No one knows a toast.
speaker_heading: MUNCH
dialog: Okay. So... Yay for Burt and Verona
dialog: moving here. Probably if they’re
dialog: not stupid.
text: They all cheer.
dialog: 98.
scene_heading: INT. BAR -- NIGHT
text: They're at a casual bar, eating dinner while a jazz combo
text: plays in the background. Tom and Burt are turned toward the
text: band. Munch and Verona are having a private talk.
speaker_heading: MUNCH
dialog: So did it take you guys a long time
dialog: to get pregnant?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I think it was the first shot.
dialog: Beginner's luck.
speaker_heading: MUNCH
dialog: Oh. That’s wonderful.
text: It’s clear that Munch doesn’t really find that news so
dialog: wonderful.
speaker_heading: MUNCH
dialog: Any problems so far?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Not so far.
dialog: (now sensing that she
dialog: shouldn’t be smug about
dialog: this)
dialog: I've been crying a little more than
dialog: usual.
speaker_heading: MUNCH
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: You're not pregnant, are you? You
dialog: look--
speaker_heading: MUNCH
dialog: No, no. No.
text: A couple walks by and sees Munch’s drink on the table. They
text: assume Verona is drinking while pregnant, and give her a
text: withering look.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I can’t stand it.
text: Tom leans in.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: We need to eat real food. I need
dialog: bacon.
speaker_heading: MUNCH
dialog: (to Verona)
dialog: He needs bacon.
scene_heading: INT. INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF PANCAKES -- MIDNIGHT
text: The four of them are in a booth. Tom is feasting on a large
text: stack of pancakes, with an enormous side of bacon. The other
text: three are drinking tea. Burt has a piece of apple pie.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (his face full of pig fat)
dialog: Wait. So you're still not married?
dialog: Burt, when are you going to
dialog: propose?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Propose? All I do is propose.
dialog: (to Verona)
dialog: Verona, will you marry me?
text: Verona does a quick shake of her head, as if she’s saying no
text: to fresh pepper on her salad.
speaker_heading: MUNCH
dialog: (to Verona)
dialog: Is this true? It’s you who’s behind
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I can’t see the point.
speaker_heading: MUNCH
dialog: There isn’t any, really. Not unless
dialog: you have parents who care one way
dialog: or the other, which you don’t.
dialog: Maybe there isn’t really a point.
dialog: Is there a point, Tom?
text: Tom shakes his head.
speaker_heading: MUNCH
dialog: It’s a nice tradition, though.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Your wedding was nice.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: MUNCH
dialog: It was, wasn’t it?
text: Now Tom has finished his bacon and is ready to expound.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You know what you need to be happy?
text: Munch rolls her eyes.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You need this.
text: Tom is holding up the maple syrup.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Here’s you two guys.
text: He takes two sugar cubes from the bowl on the table.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Or wait.
text: He replaces one of the sugars with a brown one.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Thanks, Tom.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Okay. So you have you two. And
dialog: let’s say here’s the baby.
text: He takes a smaller brown cube and adds it to the plate.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: And here’s your house.
text: He uses toothpicks to enclose the three of them in a very
text: crude house, with a coaster for a roof.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: But what is this? Is that home, is
dialog: that a family? No, no. Course not.
dialog: That's just the raw material -- the
dialog: people, the walls, the furniture,
dialog: your jobs, maybe a nanny or
dialog: grandmother. The basics. That’s not
dialog: a family, that’s not a home. The
dialog: thing that binds it all together is
dialog: this.
text: Now he holds up the maple syrup.
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Awesome.
text: He begins to pour it all over the sugar and toothpicks.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: This is love.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I knew it.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: This is your love, guys, your
dialog: patience, your consideration, your
dialog: better selves. Man, you just have
dialog: no idea how good you can be! But
dialog: you have to use all of it.
dialog: (the syrup is everywhere
dialog: now, inches of it)
dialog: It’s not like simple brick and
dialog: mortar, where you use a little
text: layer of mortar between the bricks.
dialog: With this, you have to use TONS of
dialog: it. For every brick, there’s a half-
dialog: ton of mortar.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I thought we were doing syrup.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Mortar, syrup, whatever. It’s the
dialog: same. It’s the glue. It’s all those
dialog: good things you have in you -- the
dialog: love, the wisdom, the generosity,
dialog: the selflessness, the patience.
text: Patience at 3am, patience after
dialog: work, patience when you feel like
dialog: your life is passing you by and
dialog: you're waiting for your baby to
dialog: burp -- you have to amp that
dialog: patience aspect so much it’1l make
dialog: you sick.
text: Reaction shot from Burt, who is staring at the mess of syrup
dialog: and sugar and coasters.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: And you have to be willing to make
dialog: the family out of whatever you
dialog: have. We’ve got a Chinese girl, a
dialog: South African AIDS baby, a Russian
dialog: orphan.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: TOM (cont'd)
dialog: We've got a teenager from down the
dialog: street who wanted some stability --
dialog: he likes to eat dinner at 7 every
dialog: night. So he cooks for us sometimes
dialog: -- anything to know that at 7,
text: he'll be at a table, with six other
text: faces, a plate of hot food in front
dialog: of him. But the point is largesse,
dialog: is breaking the piggy bank of your
dialog: own love. Man, you have to be so
dialog: much better than you ever thought!
speaker_heading: MUNCH
dialog: And once a week Tom and I go out
dialog: and at least one of us comes home
dialog: wasted... And it works, I think.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: And the kids never know.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Once in a while Munch gives me a
dialog: hickey and I wear a turtleneck the
dialog: next day. The kids are none the
dialog: wiser.
scene_heading: INT. STRIP CLUB -- LATER
text: Burt and Tom are at a table near the stage, both of them
text: drunk. There is a sign near the bar that reads AMATEUR NIGHT.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: There are a lot of couples here.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: It’s Montreal. World capital of
dialog: this kind of shit. Where’s Verona?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Bathroom. Where’s Munch?
text: Tom points to the stage, onto which Munch is crawling. Cyndi
text: Lauper’s “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” kicks in and Munch
text: begins dancing.
text: Burt watches, aghast and fascinated. Munch is at first
text: awkward, beginning a routine, but then grows more
text: comfortable. She knows what she’s doing, and has done it
text: before. She takes off her blouse, revealing a slinky tank-
dialog: top.
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: BURT
text: Uh oh. She’s using the pole now.
dialog: Don’t you want to say something?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Nah. Let her go.
text: Munch continues to dance -- a desperate sort of dance, a
dialog: dance of loss and defiance. The song, when you really listen
dialog: to it, is a sad one, too.
dialog: Someone takes a beautiful girl
dialog: And hides her away
dialog: From the rest of the world...
text: Verona walks into the room at that moment. She sees Munch on
text: the stage and freezes. After a moment, her eyes and Munch’s
text: meet; volumes pass between them.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (to Burt)
dialog: She had another miscarriage.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Thursday.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: No. Just this Thursday-- ?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Hell, Burt. We’ve had too many
dialog: miscarriages. They take so much out
dialog: of you. This is her fifth. I know
dialog: she loves all those kids like they
dialog: were her own blood, but...
text: They watch Munch. Verona hasn’t moved -- she’s still
text: standing, frozen. The song is, in this context, powerful,
text: searing, and Munch’s dance is one of great melancholy and raw
text: power. At this point, Verona turns to Burt, and they lock
text: eyes. Tom continues talking to Burt, oblivious.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I wonder if we’ve been selfish,
dialog: people like us.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: TOM (cont'd)
dialog: We wait until we’re thirty-five and
dialog: then we’re surprised that the
dialog: babies aren’t so easy to make
dialog: anymore...
text: All the while, Burt and Verona are staring at each other.
dialog: They know how lucky they are.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: ..-And every day another million
dialog: fourteen-year-olds get pregnant
dialog: without trying... I just wish I
dialog: could make it work for her. If I
dialog: could fix it all and just grow a
dialog: baby for her. It’s terrible feeling
dialog: this helpless, man. You just watch
text: these babies grow and then fade and
dialog: you don’t know if you’re supposed
dialog: to name them or bury them or... I’m
dialog: sorry.
text: The song is ending and Munch is stepping down from the stage
text: to many cheers.
text: Tom helps Munch off the steps and she sits on his lap,
text: holding him fiercely.
text: From either side of the couple, Verona and Burt stare at each
text: other intensely, feeling very lucky.
scene_heading: INT. MONTREAL HOUSE -- NEXT MORNING
text: Verona wakes up, hearing what seems to be a muffled
text: conversation. She looks over and sees that Burt’s not there.
text: She looks around; the voice she hears is close, and is
text: Burt’s, but he’s not visible. She looks in the bathroom: no
text: Burt. She opens the door to the bedroom: no Burt in the
text: hallway. In fact, whenever she ventures from the bed, the
text: voice grows fainter.
text: Eventually she squats down, realizing that Burt is -- could
text: he really be? -- under the bed. She finds him there. He’s on
text: the phone. Finally he sees her.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (to the phone)
dialog: Hold on a sec. Rone’s up.
dialog: (to Verona)
dialog: It’s Courtney.
dialog: (back into the phone)
dialog: No. I’m telling her now.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Verona and Burt are getting dressed in a hurry.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Why didn’t he tell you sooner?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: He’s embarrassed. He’s my brother.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I don’t get it. Grace would have
dialog: told me right away.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: This is different. It’s
dialog: embarrassing if your wife leaves
dialog: you. She just left, Verona. They
dialog: never fought, nothing. That’s a
dialog: sign that there’s some other guy,
dialog: or she was just bored or whatever.
dialog: It’s hard enough that he’s a
dialog: dentist. He’s already sensitive
dialog: about that kind of thing.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: About being left.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: About being boring. Helena was--
dialog: It’s not fair to say now, but she
dialog: was always a reach for him. She was-
dialog: - he knew I wasn’t that crazy about
dialog: her. I felt like she always had one
dialog: eye open for something better.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Poor Courtney. How old is
dialog: Annabelle?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Eight.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I know, I know.
text: They walk downstairs. The entire family is eating waffles.
text: Tom and Munch are wearing turtlenecks.
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You guys want blueberry or
dialog: chocolate?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PLANE
text: This time, the plane ride is more melancholy. They have a lot
text: on their minds. Verona sleeps across Burt’s lap. All around
text: them are soldiers -- National Guard of all ages -- on their
dialog: way to or from Iraq or elsewhere.
scene_heading: INT. TAXI -- DAYTIME -- MIAMI
text: Burt and Verona ride, still preoccupied by the news of
text: Courtney's wife’s departure. The stunning scenery has no
dialog: effect on them.
scene_heading: EXT. COURTNEY'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON
text: They arrive at Burt’s brother’s office. It’s in a small house
text: just outside of Miami’s downtown. The skyline is visible in
text: the background. It’s a cozy dentist’s office with signs out
dialog: front that welcome kids.
scene_heading: INT. BROTHER'S DENTAL OFFICE
text: It’s cozy inside too, though the waiting room is decorated
text: with posters and memorabilia celebrating the supremacy of the
dialog: 70s art-rock band YES.
text: Sitting at the appointment window is not an adult secretary
text: but a girl of eight. She has a pencil behind her ear. This is
scene_heading: ANNABELLE.
text: She hears the bells when the door opens, but doesn’t look up.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Are you Mrs. Alvarez?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: No. Are you ... eight?
text: Annabelle looks up and brightens when she sees Verona. Burt
text: emerges from behind Verona and Annabelle’s face explodes into
text: a phosphorescent smile.
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Burp!
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Hey Bellbottom! Come here.
text: Burt’s niece is cute in an awkward sort of way, with dark
text: rings around her eyes. Seeing Burt has her face contorted
text: into a wild sort of grin.
text: She can’t wait -- she crawls through the window and jumps off
text: the edge and into Burt’s arms. Burt lifts her over his head
text: and then hugs her for a long moment.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (whispering into her hair)
dialog: Hi sweetie-pie poop-a-loop. I
dialog: missed you so much.
text: Annabelle is too deep in a bliss-high to speak. She rests her
text: chin on Burt’s neck and chews her gum silently, her tiny
text: finger playing in Burt’s hair.
text: The moment is broken by a loud yelp from inside.
speaker_heading: PATIENT
dialog: Holy mother of god!
text: In a few seconds, COURTNEY, about 37, with shaggy hair and
text: glasses, emerges. There’s blood on his uniform.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: (wiping his hands)
dialog: Hey! I thought you weren’t coming
dialog: till tonight.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: We got an early flight.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Verona! You look fantastic.
text: He gives her a warm hug. While they embrace, he sees Burt and
text: almost instantly tears up.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Hey brother.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Hey brother.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Can you leave now?
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Yeah. Maria?
text: Maria, a young dental assistant, walks in.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Can you finish Mr. Hyland?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I don’t--
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Do your best.
scene_heading: EXT--MIAMI STREET--DAY
text: They leave the office and walk out to the street. Courtney
text: looks up at the sun as if he hasn’t seen it in weeks.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: I'll drive. You hungry? I’m here.
text: They arrive at his car. It’s a new Volvo.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Nice.
text: Courtney can’t find his keys.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: I had em here.
text: He looks in his backpack. No luck. He checks and rechecks his
dialog: pockets.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Belle, did I give em to you?
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: No.
text: Now he’s looking under the car.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: You think they’re under the car?
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Shush! I have a spare down here.
dialog: (fumbling)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY (cont'd)
dialog: (from under the car)
scene_heading: GODDAMMIT.
text: He gets up, and slowly composes himself.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: (adopting a tone somewhere
dialog: between saccharine and
dialog: about-to-explode)
dialog: Bella, are you sure I didn’t give
dialog: them to you? Remember that
dialog: sometimes you’re wrong. You were
dialog: wrong yesterday when I asked if you
dialog: had already brought in the mail and
dialog: then we didn’t see that check that
dialog: Dad needed. Remember that?
text: Annabelle nods.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: So do you have them?
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: I'll go inside.
text: Courtney is vibrating. His frustration is far out of
dialog: proportion to the problem at hand.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: C’mere, big brother.
text: Burt takes him aside and they huddle.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Hey. This isn’t you. I can’t let
dialog: you snap at Bella that way.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: I know, I know.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I don’t blame you, Cort. I mean,
dialog: this whole thing...
text: Burt sees Annabelle as she emerges from the office without
text: the keys. Seeing all four of them standing by the corner, a
text: cab slows, and Burt hails it.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Get in.
text: Courtney complies and they all pile in.
dialog: 110.
scene_heading: EXT. WATERFRONT RESTAURANT -- EVENING -- LATER
text: They exit the restaurant and walk along the South Beach
text: promenade. Verona and Annabelle walk ahead, inexplicably
text: giving military salutes to everyone they pass. They pass a
text: parent with a five-year-old boy on a leash. Annabelle and
text: Verona exchange looks.
text: Burt and Courtney walk some distance behind.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Have you heard from her?
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Not a word.
text: They walk a few steps.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Isn’t that strange? She was never
dialog: like that, really. She was kind of
dialog: normal, right?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: She was pretty normal.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: You know how many times I’ve
dialog: checked our messages? I check them
dialog: ten times an hour. I got all the
text: lines to bounce to my cellphone.
dialog: Maybe she was kidnapped.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: But you said she left a note.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Yeah. But it might have been
dialog: coerced....
text: Beat. Courtney comes to his senses.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: I guess not. It’s so weird. I've
dialog: never felt so emasculated. I feel
dialog: like such a chump. And the rage!
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (remembering the car-key
dialog: episode)
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: I have to invent new ways of
dialog: dealing with it every night. I
dialog: destroyed all the lawn furniture.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: What’d you use?
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Nine iron.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (interested)
dialog: Not a wedge...
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: I’m so confused, though. Part of me
dialog: is so angry I don’t want to ever
dialog: see her again. I mean, I have all
text: these daydreams of her in prison,
dialog: and getting painful tattoos all
text: over her body. And on the other
dialog: hand I just want her back and
dialog: things to be the same.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Belle seems okay.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Yeah. That’s even weirder.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: What’d you tell her?
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: At first I said it was a business
dialog: trip. I made the mistake of telling
dialog: her it'd be five days. I actually
dialog: thought that was a conservative
dialog: estimate. I thought I’d have
dialog: figured it out by then. Then five
dialog: days went by and Belle wanted to
dialog: know where she was. So I said her
dialog: grandpa died.
text: Burt looks mildly shocked.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: It took her mind off of her mom for
dialog: a while.
dialog: They walk.
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: I really need help. With what to do
dialog: next. Sorry I called. I just... If
dialog: she’s really gone for good, I need
dialog: to know what to say. It’s wrong to
dialog: say Helena was murdered, right?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: That might be traumatic.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Yeah, but there’s finality there...
scene_heading: INT. COURTNEY'S HOUSE -- LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Courtney, Burt and Verona are all sitting on Annabelle’s bed,
text: acting out a story together.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: And then the bullfrog said...
text: Silence. All eyes are on Verona.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Wait, was that me? I’m the
dialog: bullfrog, too?
text: The answer is yes. Verona looks at the page.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: (adopting the voice of a
dialog: bullfrog)
dialog: Where is my crown? I need my crown!
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: And to that the wolverine said:
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (in a German accent)
dialog: “You vill nevah have your crown,
dialog: stinky bullfrog! I have buried it
dialog: under zah giant acacia tree! Ha ha
dialog: ha ha ha!”
text: Burt’s wolverine voice and maniacal laugh are a bit over the
dialog: top.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: And so the story ends. At least
dialog: tonight it does. Say goodnight to
dialog: Uncle Burp and Verona.
dialog: 113.
text: Burt and Verona each lean down and give hugs to Annabelle,
text: who seems desperately happy that they’re there.
text: Annabelle settles into bed and then looks at Verona.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Your boobs are soft.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: My mom’s are harder.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Okay.
scene_heading: EXT. COURTNEY’S PORCH -- LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Burt and Courtney and Verona are on the porch. Verona is
text: asleep on an Adirondack chair.
text: Courtney pulls something from his wallet.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: You see this?
text: It’s Annabelle’s new school picture.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (examining it)
dialog: That’s cute. What’s on her upper
dialog: lip?
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Carrot juice.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Huh.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: She just took this on Monday.
dialog: Remember when we had to wait weeks
dialog: for the school pictures? Anyway...
dialog: So this is the picture. I don’t see
text: the carrot juice on her mouth when
dialog: she leaves the house. I’m never
dialog: going to see these things. Moms see
dialog: the carrot juice on their
dialog: daughters’ mouths. Moms know when
dialog: their daughters aren’t dressed
dialog: right.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY (cont'd)
text: Moms go shopping with them, and
dialog: make sure their hair doesn’t look
text: spazzy. In one fell swoop Helena
dialog: has changed this girl’s life from a
dialog: normal one, where she can be
dialog: popular and all that, to the
dialog: distinct likelihood that she’s
dialog: going to be introverted, a poor
dialog: dresser -- one of those girls who
text: looks longingly at the girls who
dialog: have new shoes and the right
dialog: backpack...
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: (suddenly awake)
dialog: At least it was carrot juice. Not
dialog: whisky.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: It’s just the beginning, though.
dialog: Things devolve from here. I’1l be
dialog: spending every waking moment trying
dialog: to reconstruct a normal life, but
dialog: everyone around will have more
dialog: tools, more money, more ability to
dialog: form a regular family. And
dialog: Annabelle will always be the girl
dialog: without a mom.
scene_heading: INT. COURTNEY'S HOUSE, GUEST BEDROOM -- MUCH LATER
text: Verona wakes up, notices Burt’s not there. She hears his
text: muffled voice, looks out the window and sees him on the back
text: patio, with a phonebook open, pacing while talking on his
dialog: cellphone.
text: She comes downstairs and joins him.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I’m looking for her. I’m calling
dialog: anyone she knew. Her old company,
dialog: her friends --
speaker_heading: VERONA
text: At 2 in the morning.
speaker_heading: BURT
text: Right. Element of surprise.
dialog: 115.
text: Verona notices the broken patio furniture -- victims of
text: Courtney's frustration.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Stop, please.
text: Burt sits down. Then stands up. He’s so agitated he can’t
text: stay still. Finally he gets onto Annabelle’s trampoline -- a
text: big rectangular one, 3 feet off the ground.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (now jumping)
dialog: What kind of goddamned person would
dialog: leave her daughter?
speaker_heading: VERONA
text: (watching him go up and
dialog: down )
dialog: I don’t know. Maybe not such a
dialog: strong person. Please stop.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (not stopping)
dialog: And there’s nothing we can do.
dialog: She's gone. This family can’t be
dialog: fixed. That’s it. What if one of us
dialog: freaks out like that?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: We won't. And it can be fixed and
dialog: you know it. And if you don’t stop
dialog: jumping I will find a way to hurt
dialog: you with that shovel.
text: She points to a large iron shovel. Burt stops jumping.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: C'mere. Sit down.
text: He pulls her onto the trampoline. Soon they’re both on their
text: knees, facing each other.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: But really -- what if something
dialog: happens to one of us and makes us
dialog: crazy? Like what if I walk by a
dialog: construction site and something
dialog: falls and my frontal lobe gets
dialog: chopped off and my personality is
dialog: altered and then I’m not a good
dialog: dad. What if that happens?
text: Verona doesn’t know how much she should humor him.
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: We'll be careful walking near
dialog: construction sites.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: And what about Munch?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: She'll be careful near construction
dialog: sites, too.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: No really. Don’t you just look at
dialog: her and want to give her everything
dialog: she wants? It’s insanely unfair
dialog: that she can’t--
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Of course it’s unfair. She can’t
dialog: conceive, and bad parents still get
dialog: to be parents, and good parents die
dialog: when their daughters are in high
dialog: school. So what.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I’m sorry, Rone.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: All we can do is be good for this
dialog: one baby. We don’t have control
dialog: over much else.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Let’s get married at least.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Never.
text: Burt's visibly disappointed. He really thought she’d say yes
dialog: this time.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: But I’1l never leave you.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: (dejected)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I promise.
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You promise to never marry me
dialog: because you don’t want to marry me
dialog: without your parents there -- and I
dialog: get that -- and you promise to
dialog: never leave me. But do you promise
dialog: to never leave this baby we're
dialog: having? Unless maybe part of your
text: brain gets knocked off by an I-
dialog: beam?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I do. And do you promise to stop
dialog: talking about your ability to find
dialog: or not find my vagina after I give
dialog: birth?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I do. And do you promise to let me
dialog: cobble--
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Carve.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: To carve in my spare time and teach
dialog: our daughter the lure of the great
dialog: Mississippi?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I do. And do you promise to never
dialog: try to make art out of my placenta
dialog: or any other bodily discharge?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. TRAMPOLINE -- CONTINUOUS -- LATER
text: They're lying down now, face to face. Burt has found a
text: tarpaulin and pulled it over themselves.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I do. And do you promise to let our
dialog: daughter be fat or skinny or any
dialog: weight at all because we want her
dialog: to be happy no matter what and
dialog: eating disorders are too stupid and
dialog: cliche for our daughter?
dialog: 118.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I do. And do you promise to raise
dialog: this kid without fear -- without
text: child-leashes and fences and
dialog: without buying into the insane and
dialog: almost totally unfounded child-
dialog: abduction paranoia crippling our
dialog: nation?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I do. And do you promise, if I get
dialog: one of those parasites that creeps
dialog: up your nose after you go swimming
dialog: in certain shallow lakes and then
dialog: slowly eats your brain and you die
dialog: within a week, that you’ll lie and
dialog: tell our daughter that her father
dialog: was killed by Russian soldiers in
text: intense hand-to-hand combat so he
dialog: could save 850 Chechnyan orphans?
text: They're both fading now. Verona’s eyes are closed.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Yes, Chechnyan orphans... I do...
dialog: And do you promise that sometime
dialog: tonight we'll figure out where the
dialog: hell we’re going to live with this
dialog: baby, coming very soon into this
dialog: world?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I do.
scene_heading: EXT. COURTNEY'S BACK PATIO -- MORNING
text: Burt and Verona are entwined on the trampoline. They’ve
text: fallen asleep there, after talking half the night.
text: Annabelle comes outside, crawls onto the trampoline and
text: kneels next to them. She pokes Verona’s breast.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: They really are softer.
text: Burt and Verona wake up.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: You're supposed to come inside like
dialog: normal people and eat food that
dialog: normal people eat, inside like
dialog: normal people.
dialog: 119.
text: She goes inside. Burt and Verona follow slowly. They catch
text: themselves, remembering what they decided the night before.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I had a dream we made a really
dialog: strange decision.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I think it’s the right one, though.
dialog: Don’t you think?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I honestly have no idea. All I know
dialog: is that I can barely breathe just
dialog: thinking about it.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: (at the door, waiting)
dialog: Are you normal people or not?
scene_heading: INT. COURTNEY'S HOUSE -- MORNING
text: They're all eating breakfast. We catch them mid-conversation.
dialog: Burt and Verona have figured out where they’re going next --
dialog: where they’re probably going to live -- and have just told
dialog: Courtney.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: You're welcome to come. There’s
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: It sounds good. I think it’s the
dialog: right thing for you guys. But no, I
dialog: better stay here for now.
text: Annabelle’s in the school play.
dialog: She’s the lead.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: (to Annabelle)
dialog: Really? What’s the play?
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
text: (with a mouth full of
text: oatmeal, using her spoon
dialog: to make a stabbing
dialog: motion)
dialog: Medea.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: But maybe someday. I don’t know. Is
dialog: Grace coming?
dialog: 120.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Ew. You can’t go after Grace now. I
dialog: know you always lusted after her
dialog: but that would be too weird.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Hey -- I was just asking. Idle
dialog: curiosity.
text: Burt winks at him; they share a lascivious sort of look, both
text: thinking of Grace.
scene_heading: INT. BURT AND VERONA’S CAR -- DAYTIME -- ROLLING HILLS
text: It’s late Spring. Verona is a month or so more pregnant. Burt
text: and Verona are driving through an unfamiliar landscape.
text: Hilly, semi-rural, beautiful, maybe a bit run-down.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Is it starting to look familiar?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: (uncertain)
dialog: I think so... I want it to... But I
dialog: also want it to be new, you know?
dialog: New for us? New enough to feel like
dialog: we found it? Does that make sense?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: It does.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: (seeing something)
dialog: Oh god, I remember that!
text: They both look at a tree in front of someone’s yard,
text: decorated with a dozen kinds of fruit -- apples, oranges,
text: bananas, pineapples. The owner has strung fake fruit from the
dialog: branches.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I have to call Grace.
dialog: (she dials)
dialog: Yup, we’‘re almost there.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: No, I’m fine.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: It is! That’s why I called. We just
dialog: passed it. Pineapples! Yes. No, I
dialog: didn’t see the cantaloupe...
dialog: (to Burt)
dialog: Wait, that was it.

speaker_heading: + HH HH HH HF
dialog: 121.
dialog: They've just missed a turn.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: (to Grace)
dialog: I’1ll call you after we get there.
dialog: Love you.
text: She hangs up. Sighs. Burt backs up.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: You ready?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I am. Are you?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I am.
text: They head down a narrow winding road canopied by wisteria and
text: kudzu. Burt is clearly in heaven; it’s the landscape of his
dialog: dreams.
scene_heading: EXT. BEAUTIFUL SEMI-RURAL CULDESAC
text: They pull up to a Victorian house, three-storied and grand,
text: though in disrepair.
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: Oh! I forgot how beautiful it is.
dialog: We realize this is Verona’s childhood home, the same house we
dialog: saw in the photo in Grace and Verona’s offices. It’s
text: dilapidated but full of character and potential.
text: They park and get out of the car.
text: There’s a creek running through the property; a bridge over
text: it connects the driveway to the front door. Burt is
text: astounded, taking it all in.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I love your parents so much right
dialog: now. They were geniuses. This is
dialog: what I want for our baby.
text: Tears burst from Verona.
text: As they walk toward the front door, Verona leans on Burt for
dialog: strength. She hasn’t been back home in 10 years.
dialog: +e HF
dialog: *
dialog: *
dialog: 122.
text: At the doorway, Burt opens it and Verona has to steady
text: herself on the frame. She slowly slides down until she’s
text: sitting, overwhelmed.
text: Burt sits with Verona, looking around the house, inside and
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: This is really us, don’t you think?
speaker_heading: VERONA
dialog: I think it is. I fucking hope so.
text: We pull back until we’re outside the door. The door closes.
text: THE END.
