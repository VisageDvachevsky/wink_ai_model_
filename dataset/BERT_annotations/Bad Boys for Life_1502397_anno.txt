speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Would if I could, but I got work.
dialog: I‘1l have to find you ladies later.

dialog: beard; the guy you want backing you in a firefight) and MARIA
dialog: SANCHEZ (Latina; sexy; teflon-tough).

speaker_heading: DALTREY
text: Ready to rumble, hoss.
speaker_heading: RESUME MIKE:
speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: CAM (V.O.)

text: Meet Mike’s new partner: CAM THEROUX, young and cocky.
scene_heading: INTERCUT ALL THREE CARS:
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Nice of your connection to pick

text: shopping, a candle from Wicks N
text: Sticks, maybe grab some Cinnabon.
dialog: Daltrey, some new bandanas?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Hey, you wanna do your job or you
dialog: wanna fuck around?
text: Cam gets quiet quick.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Now let’s go over it again: as soon
dialog: as I agree to the buy, I give the
dialog: call to Theroux to show up with the
dialog: green. Once we got the glass in
dialog: hand: Daltrey, Sanchez, you two
dialog: come in hard and fast, back us up.
dialog: No call, you’re all statues unless
dialog: I give the trouble signal. Any
dialog: questions?
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: Yeah. What’s the trouble signal?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: “Oh shit, I’m in trouble.” Now
dialog: let’s get sharp. It’s prove
dialog: yourself time.
text: Cam resents Mike’s condescending attitude. Under his breath:
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Prove yourself, my ass.
scene_heading: EXT. AVENTURA MALL - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Stores are closing. Mike and the TNT cops are still waiting.
scene_heading: RESUME DALTREY AND SANCHEZ:
speaker_heading: DALTREY
dialog: C’mon, top 3 country songs. Go.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: They're all the same. If it's not
dialog: about cheating, it's about
dialog: drinking. Or screwing.
speaker_heading: DALTREY
dialog: And that’s different from what you
dialog: listen to? It’s all about Kush,
dialog: bitches and doe.
text: Sanchez sits up. Spots a mousey WHITE GUY heading toward
text: Mike’s car. Into her mic:
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
text: Lowery, heads-up.
text: Mike sees the white guy approaching. His connection.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That's him. Get ready.
text: Cam zips open a gym bag on the passenger seat. A Strayer
text: Voight Infinity TIKI handgun rests atop wrapped stacks of
text: bills. He discretely pulls out the gun.
text: Mike gets ready to step out of his Ferrari but the connection
text: doesn’t slow down. Just keeps walking up to Mike’s car --
text: -- and drops a PRE-PAID CELL onto Mike’s lap.
text: Cam, Daltrey and Sanchez are all thrown. Mike was supposed to
text: meet him in the open.
text: Mike sees the connection vanish into the shadows of the
text: parking lot, then picks up the phone.
speaker_heading: VOICE ON PHONE
dialog: We need to change locations.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What are you talkin’ about? This is
dialog: where we agreed to meet.
speaker_heading: VOICE ON PHONE

dialog: Apagén. Be there in twenty minutes.
dialog: Bring the cash to the VIP section.
dialog: Come alone.
text: CLICK. The call ends. Back into his mic:

speaker_heading: SANCHEZ

speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: C’mon Mike, you're not serious.
dialog: That’s an invitation to a hit.
dialog: You gotta call this off.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Not callin’ anything off.
dialog: (urgent)
dialog: Sanchez, Daltrey: beat us to the
dialog: club. Make sure you got eyes and
dialog: ears in place when the deal goes
dialog: down.
text: Daltrey and Sanchez immediately drive away in the Escalade.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Theroux, you hold back out front
dialog: with the money and don’t release it
dialog: until you get the call from me. You
dialog: got it?
dialog: Cam’s not happy -- but Mike’s the senior officer here.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Yeah, I got it.
text: Mike drives off. Cam shakes his head.
speaker_heading: CAM (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DALTREY
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: Same thing you should be. This is a
dialog: club, not a Waffle House.
text: Sanchez removes her jacket and shirt to reveal a lacy
text: camisole. Daltrey takes off an outer-shirt, throws off his
text: bandanna and messes up his hair.
scene_heading: INT. CLUB APAGON - MOMENTS LATER
text: Looking club-hot, Sanchez and Daltrey step inside. Play the
text: role of boyfriend and girlfriend. Hands all over each other.

speaker_heading: DALTREY
dialog: (into a hidden mic)

scene_heading: INT. CLUB APAGON - MOMENTS LATER

text: Daltrey and Sanchez watch as Mike steps inside the VIP area.
text: But as soon as the glass door closes behind him --
text: -- the glass turns FROSTED. Sanchez and Daltrey can’t see in.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: Shit.
scene_heading: INT. DODGE CHALLENGER - SAME
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DALTREY
dialog: We can’t see inside.

dialog: fucker!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Whoa, let’s dial this shit down.
text: The LEAD GUNMAN steps forward, threatening:
speaker_heading: LEAD GUNMAN
dialog: Where’s the fucking money!?!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: There is no fucking money.
speaker_heading: LEAD GUNMAN
dialog: Call your boy and get us our money
dialog: or we kill your ass!
text: A GUNMAN presses a Glock into his temple.
scene_heading: INT. DODGE CHALLENGER - SAME
text: Hearing this, Cam grabs the gym bag off the passenger seat,
text: throws open his door and crosses the parking lot to the club.
scene_heading: INT. CLUB APAGON - VIP SECTION - SAME
text: Despite the guns aimed at him, Mike keeps cool.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: How about you all go fuck
dialog: yourselves instead?
speaker_heading: LEAD GUNMAN
dialog: What the fuck did you say to me,
dialog: asshole?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: The money is what's keeping me
dialog: alive. You get that, then what? No.
dialog: We do this, we do it my way.
scene_heading: EXT. CLUB APAGON - SAME
text: Cam gets intercepted by the bouncer -- his gun bulge visible.
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
text: Club’s full, homie.
text: Cam drops the bag, grabs the bouncer’s hand and elbow,
text: presses them together, KICKS out his knee and SLAMS his head
text: against the wall. The bouncer’s out-cold. He pulls out the
text: bouncer’s radio headset and pockets his cell phone and gun.
text: Then picks back up the gym bag and moves into the club.
speaker_heading: RESUME MIKE:
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Now put your guns down, show me the
dialog: glass and we can make this happen.
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: INT. CLUB APAGON - SAME
text: Sanchez and Daltrey see Cam go to the VIP area.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: Where the fuck’s he going? Lowery
dialog: hasn't given the signal yet.
speaker_heading: RESUME MIKE:
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: If not, just shoot me now cause
dialog: you’re not gonna see dime one of
dialog: that fucking money.
text: Cam SLAMS his hand on the door outside.
speaker_heading: CAM (0.S.)
dialog: Hey, open up, I got your money!
text: Mike rolls his eyes. Asshole. No choice --
text: Mike KNOCKS away the gun that’s pressed to his temple while
text: quick-drawing a SECOND GLOCK out of the gunman’s pants.
text: He aims it at the leader as another CREW MEMBER FIRES. Mike
text: uses his gunman as a HUMAN SHIELD, trading bullets. The glass
dialog: wall SHATTERS!
scene_heading: INSTANT PANDEMONIUM! EVERYONE IN THE CLUB GOES RUNNING!
text: Cam draws the bouncer’s gun and starts laying down cover
text: fire. Mike escapes the VIP section.
text: TWO MORE GANG MEMBERS run from the main area of the club. But
text: before they can shoot at Mike and Cam -- BANG! BANG! BANG!
text: Daltrey and Sanchez take them out.
text: It’s an ALL OUT GUN BATTLE -- bullets shooting electrical
text: equipment -- CAUSING SPARKS and FIRE. WATER GUSHES out of the

text: The Lead Gunman goes for an exit. Mike CHARGES after him.
text: Another SHOOTER takes aim, but before he can fire -- his head
speaker_heading: EXPLODES.
text: REVEAL: CAM -- having just taken the kill shot.
text: Mike gets closer to the Lead Gunman -- who whips around,
text: FIRING at Mike, who then SLIDES across the wet floor, legs
text: STRIKING the Lead Gunman, who drops onto his back.
text: Mike swings the gun right into his face.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Like I said: my way.
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: EXT. CLUB APAGON - LATER
text: Aftermath. Fire trucks. Cruisers. A Crown Victoria pulls up.
text: CAPTAIN LEO HOWARD steps out. Surveys the chaos and zeroes in
text: on the man responsible: Mike, currently fighting with Cam.
speaker_heading: MIKE CAM
dialog: You disobeyed a direct order! They were gonna kill you!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What you did was put the whole crew
dialog: at risk!
text: As tensions reach a fever pitch, Howard comes walking up.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN HOWARD
dialog: Yeah, yeah, this looks about right
dialog: for one of your Thursdays. Wait,
dialog: can that be? Oh my God yes, the
dialog: building’s still standing. You must
dialog: be losing your touch, Mike.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Captain, before you start in --
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN HOWARD
dialog: Over here.
text: Mike follows Howard away from Cam and the others.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Look it’s not my fault that things
dialog: got out of hand this time.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN HOWARD
dialog: Of course not. It was “ABM’s”
dialog: fault. Anyone But Mike’s. You said
dialog: this was gonna be a routine buy.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Which it would have been if Theroux
dialog: listened --
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN HOWARD
dialog: Wait, someone didn’t listen to you?
dialog: I’m sorry ‘CAUSE I HAVE NO IDEA
dialog: WHAT THAT’S LIKE! You know, ever
dialog: since the “Bad Boys” broke up,
dialog: you're like my nephew without
dialog: Ritalin. You weren’t a one man army
dialog: doing everything the way you want.
dialog: So I’m telling you now: you better
dialog: learn how to be part of a fucking
dialog: team again.
text: Howard walks away. OFF MIKE -- fuck that, MUSIC and GO TO:

scene_heading: EXT. MIAMI - MORNING

speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Oh shit!
speaker_heading: THERESA (0.S.)
dialog: Baby, that you?

speaker_heading: MARCUS

dialog: Investigator.”
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I think B.S. makes more sense.
text: Marcus snatches the phone. Clears his throat.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Good morning. Burnett Services
dialog: Unlimited.
text: He scrambles for something to write on. Quincy hands him a
text: torn-out page from his magazine. It’s an ad for MALE BOTOX.
dialog: 13.
text: “Because you’ve only got one face. BRO-TOX.” The tight face
text: of a middle-aged man peers back. Marcus leers at Quincy.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: You're adopted.
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Yes, ma’am, I got thirty years of

speaker_heading: THERESA

speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Theresa, excuse me, but no way.

speaker_heading: MEGAN
text: He’s not unemployed. He works at

speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: You know who also does freelance at

dialog: either.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: (storming past him)
dialog: You're unbelievable.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Megan!
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Good one, baby. Real slick.
text: Theresa follows her now-crying daughter. Marcus looks down.
text: He still has the BRO-TOX AD in his hand.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: What are you looking at?
text: A beat as the picture catches his gaze again. Lingers there.
text: He doesn’t break. Wait, is Marcus considering “Bro-Tox?”

text: Mike crosses the lobby to the elevator. As the doors shut --
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: Hold the elevator.
text: Mike stops the doors from closing to reveal LT. ELLIE

speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: (stepping inside)
dialog: Sergeant.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Lieutenant.
text: Ellie hits the button for 6. Mike has already pressed 8.

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I’m sure not everyone is being told
dialog: in person.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN HOWARD
dialog: Mike, the FBI has reason to believe
dialog: Luga’s on his way to Miami right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: To do what?
speaker_heading: AGENT KESSLER
dialog: To kill you.
text: For a second that hangs there -- but Mike is hardly rattled.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That it? Bad guys try to kill me
dialog: every day.
speaker_heading: AGENT KESSLER
dialog: I wouldn't be here if I didn’t
dialog: think I was saving your life. We've
dialog: got intel that his people back in
dialog: Albania have been running searches
dialog: on you. They have your social
dialog: security number, your home
dialog: address...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Luga’s not a fool. He’s not gonna
dialog: come all this way, risk all the
dialog: heat, just to kill me.
speaker_heading: AGENT KESSLER
dialog: (deadly serious)
dialog: That’s exactly what he’ll do. You
dialog: and Marcus Burnett killed his
dialog: brother. The Albanians call it
dialog: “Krvna Osveta”. Means he’s made a
dialog: blood oath to get revenge against
dialog: you both. His people have been
dialog: doing this for centuries. Luga’s on
text: a vendetta and he doesn't give a
dialog: shit if Miami PD, FBI, Interpol,
text: the Goddamn Marines, are after him.
dialog: Now for your own safety, you need
dialog: to be put into protective custody
dialog: immediately —-
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: MIKE AGENT KESSLER (CONT'D)
dialog: (insulted) -- while the FBI tracks down
dialog: My safety? and apprehends Luga.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: If anyone is gonna apprehend him --
speaker_heading: AGENT KESSLER
dialog: (cutting him off;
dialog: condescending as hell)
dialog: It’s gonna be the FBI. We know all
dialog: about how you operate, Lowery.
dialog: Shoot first, can’t ask a question
text: ‘cause the suspect’s now dead. Now
dialog: you’re to stand down like a good
dialog: boy --
text: Insulted by “boy”, Mike stands up -- towering over Kessler.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Boy, who you calling boy?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN HOWARD
dialog: (rising; before things get
dialog: out of hand)
dialog: Thank you, Agent Kessler. I
dialog: appreciate you bringing this to our
dialog: attention.
text: A beat, then Kessler, staring back at Mike, turns to Howard,
text: then leaves. The second the door closes behind him:
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Can you believe that shit, Captain?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN HOWARD
dialog: I absolutely do... That’s why
dialog: you're going into protective
text: custody immediately.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What? You gotta be kidding --
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN HOWARD
dialog: This guy broke out of a maximum
dialog: security prison. I’m not taking any
dialog: chances.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: There’s no way I’m sitting on my
dialog: ass alone in some Motel 6 while
text: there’s a target on my back.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN HOWARD
dialog: First of all... it’s a Red Roof Inn
dialog: and secondly, yes you are. Now go
dialog: pack yourself a bag.
dialog: 19.
dialog: OFF MIKE -- hating this:
scene_heading: EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. BURNETT HOUSE - DAY

speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Is your husband home, ma’am?
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: He’s at work. What’s this about?
text: The Burnett kids file up behind their mom, curious.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: I need you and your family to come
dialog: with us right now.
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Why, what’s happened?
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Everything's fine. I’1ll explain on

speaker_heading: GO TO:
text: A PERSONALIZED LICENCE PLATE.
dialog: Reads “STR8 PMPN.” We’re now:
scene_heading: EXT. MIAMI NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
text: A fire red CAMARO 228 is parked across from a small house.
scene_heading: INT. CAMARO - SAME
text: Marcus surveils the house of a client, MRS. WALLACE. Through

text: kitchen, washing the dishes.
text: Marcus readies a PARABOLIC MIC, unfolding a satellite dish.
text: He slips in the earpiece to hear:
speaker_heading: MRS. WALLACE (0.S.)
dialog: Oh, and can you remind me we need
dialog: to get the dog’s dewclaw trimmed?
text: He turns down the volume.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: MRS. WALLACE (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus, Tom. Why are you putting
dialog: those pans in the dishwasher? Are
dialog: you trying to strip the Teflon?
text: Marcus grimaces, muttering to himself.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Don’t let her punk you like that!
text: He sees the Wallaces arguing. Marcus just stares ahead, a
text: faraway look in his eyes. Suddenly -- THREE BLACK SUBURBANS
text: WITH TINTED WINDOWS ROAR UP TO THE CAMARO. CAGE HIM IN.
text: Marcus sits up. Who are these guys? Off which:
scene_heading: EXT. RED ROOF INN - MAGIC
text: Outside Miami, beside a highway, across from an empty field.
text: Sun setting, Cam’s Challenger drives up.
scene_heading: INT. RED ROOF INN - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Walking up with Cam, Mike wraps up a call on his cell.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Crawford. Lowery. Hit me back as
dialog: soon as you get this.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Thought Howard said no calls.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I’m not gonna sit on my hands. I
dialog: gotta find this guy before he finds
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: So this Luga...you and Burnett
dialog: killed his brother?
dialog: (Mike nods)
dialog: And now he wants to kill you.
dialog: (Mike says nothing)
dialog: Happens a lot with you, doesn’t it?
text: They round a corner. Cam leads Mike to his room, explaining:
speaker_heading: CAM (CONT’D)
dialog: Alright, you're in room 124.
dialog: Daltrey and Sanchez have set up a
text: surveillance room across the hall.
dialog: Captain’s orders: you are not to
dialog: leave the room under any
dialog: circumstances. You need something:
dialog: food, toothbrush, Q-tip, dial 125.
dialog: Otherwise, try to relax.
dialog: 21.
text: On “relax”, Cam unlocks room 124 and the door opens into:
scene_heading: INT. RED ROOF INN - ROOM 124 - CONTINUOUS
text: Where Mike is met by MARCUS -- sitting on the edge of the
text: bed, flipping through channels in a pair of SKINNY JEANS.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What’s he doing here?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: What am I doin’ here? No one said
dialog: anythin’ about you bein’ here.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Captain’s orders --
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Well, he can un-order it.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Luga wants to kill the both of you.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Which is why I need to get as far
dialog: away from this man as possible!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You need to be away from me?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: You're like a magnet for all things
dialog: life-threatening.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Here we go.
dialog: (to Cam)
dialog: Call down to the desk and get me
dialog: another room.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Can’t do it.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: This is not gonna work.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: This is the only secure room in the
dialog: hotel. We got it wired for sound
dialog: and video. We don’t have enough men
dialog: to watch and protect two rooms, so
dialog: what can I tell ya? You’re
dialog: roommates.
text: Cam steps out. Mike and Marcus lock eyes. Silence.
dialog: 22.
scene_heading: INT. RED ROOF INN - ROOM 125 (TNT ROOM) - SECONDS LATER
text: Across the hall. Daltrey and Sanchez watch the Mike and
text: Marcus reunion on a closed circuit feed. Daltrey packs a can
dialog: of dip -- SNAP, SNAP, SNAP.
text: Cam enters. Joins them at the monitor.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: Five bucks says Lowery swings
dialog: first.
scene_heading: RESUME MIKE AND MARCUS:
text: Mike notices the mess Marcus has already made in the tiny
text: room: fast food wrappers on the floor; used napkins on the
dialog: desk; clothes everywhere.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Nice to see you’ve learned how to
dialog: clean up after yourself.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Don’t start up with me. This is a
dialog: bad situation for both of us.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: So why don’t you --
text: Mike pauses, fully registering Marcus in his skin-tight
text: skinny jeans for the first time.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell are you wearing?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: What? These are my threads.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Look at you. You can barely move.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: They fit just fine.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: They're painted on!
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: You're just jealous cause you're
dialog: not the coolest looking --
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: How the hell am I supposed to take
dialog: you seriously in those?
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: What do I care if you take me
dialog: seriously or not. That’s the beauty
dialog: of not having to work with you
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: So why don’t you just walk out? Not
dialog: like you haven’t done that before.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Oh so that’s how it’s gonna be,
dialog: huh?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Wasn’t my call, remember?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Yeah, and I know how much that
dialog: bothers you.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What’s that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: It’s the Mike Lowery Show and we're
text: all just guest stars.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Is it possible for you to not talk
dialog: out of your ass?
scene_heading: RESUME CAM, DALTREY AND SANCHEZ:
speaker_heading: DALTREY
dialog: My folks used to fight the exact
dialog: same way.
scene_heading: RESUME MIKE AND MARCUS:
text: getting loud and tense.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I warned you not to screw around
dialog: with these Albanians! You know what
dialog: a blood oath means to these mother-
dialog: fuckers!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: So I should have just let Luga and
dialog: his family traffic coke, H and
dialog: molly all throughout Central
dialog: Florida?
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Luga’s brother could’ve been taken
dialog: down a whole other way, but no. You
dialog: had to go all Magnum Force on ‘em.
scene_heading: RESUME CAM, DALTREY AND SANCHEZ:
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Magnum Force?
scene_heading: RESUME MIKE AND MARCUS:
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You were a cop. That’s supposed to
dialog: mean something.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I was a cop. But you were a fucking
dialog: crazy cop.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Just admit it: you left ‘cause you
dialog: were scared.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Hell yeah, I was scared! And the
dialog: fact that I’m locked up here with
dialog: you ‘cause there’s some super
dialog: villain tryin’ to kill us proves me
dialog: right!
scene_heading: INT. RED ROOF INN - HALLWAY - SAME

scene_heading: RESUME MIKE AND MARCUS:
speaker_heading: MARCUS

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: If you hated me so much, why’d it
dialog: take you so long to quit?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Question I ask myself every single

dialog: 25.
scene_heading: INT. RED ROOF INN - HALLWAY - SAME

speaker_heading: FIGURE

scene_heading: RESUME MIKE AND MARCUS:

scene_heading: EXT. RED ROOF INN - DAY

scene_heading: INT. RED ROOF INN - ROOM 124 - SAME

speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Oh shit!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What?
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Did you see that?
text: Mike looks up. Doesn't see the cockroach. A SECOND COCKROACH
text: then appears. Bigger too. Marcus’s eyes go wide.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh shit! Fuck me!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Would you keep your voice down.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: That’s a fucking armadillo!
text: The second cockroach catches up to the first. Starts EATING

speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Holy shit. It’s eatin’ the mother-
dialog: fucka! I gotta get the fuck out of

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: DALTREY

speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Welcome, Mr. Luga. I’m Viktor. Mr.
dialog: Hess sent us. We’re to take --
speaker_heading: LUGA
dialog: Give me your phone.
text: Viktor’s caught off guard by the request. Luga just stares
dialog: him down, eyes clarifying “give me your fucking phone.”
text: Viktor doesn’t know what to do, but he knows better than to
text: piss someone like Luga off. Wisely hands it over.
text: Luga steps away. Pulls a paper with a number on it. Dials.
text: But we stay with Viktor and his men, watching Luga. They
text: trade looks. What the hell is going on? A beat later, Luga
text: returns. Now wants something else.
speaker_heading: LUGA (CONT'D)
dialog: Give me a gun.
text: Viktor trades confused glances with his men.
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Mr. Luga...?

speaker_heading: LUGA
dialog: I said give me a gun now.
text: Luga locks his eyes into Viktor again. No, he’s not fucking

text: He hands Luga a Glock. But it’s not enough.
speaker_heading: LUGA (CONT'D)
dialog: You have more?
dialog: (half-nod from Viktor)
dialog: Get in the car.

scene_heading: INT. RED ROOF INN - ROOM 124 - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. RED ROOF INN - HALLWAY - SAME

scene_heading: EXT. RED ROOF INN - SAME

text: hotel. Shit! He turns back to his men in the car:
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Get out here now!
scene_heading: INT. RED ROOF INN - HALLWAY - SAME
text: EMERGENCY LIGHTS FLICKER. Mike, Marcus, Howard and the TNT
text: cops are still on the floor, heads spinning, ears ringing.
text: Mike lifts his face up from the carpet, fighting to re-focus,
text: eyes soon adjusting to see:
dialog: 35.
text: LUGA -- machine gun in hand. Mike’s JOLTED ALERT.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: EVERYONE UP!
text: Luga takes aim. But Mike gets to his feet, SHOOTING, causing
text: Luga to DUCK BACK.
text: Marcus quickly jumps up too. Pulls up Howard. Cam, Daltrey
text: and Sanchez follow.
text: Luga swings back around, SPRAYING SHOTS, but the cops quickly
text: ESCAPE the corridor, BOMBING into nearby doors -- Mike,
text: Marcus and Howard in one that leads to a ROOM; Cam, Daltrey
text: and Sanchez in another that leads to an EMERGENCY EXIT.
scene_heading: INT. RED ROOF INN - ROOM - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN HOWARD
text: 10-24. Shooting at the Red Roof

scene_heading: EXT. RED ROOF INN - SAME
text: Backing Luga up, Viktor and his men unleash multiple rounds
text: at the hotel.
scene_heading: RESUME MIKE AND MARCUS:
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Mike, give me a gun!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I only got the one.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
text: HOW THE HELL YOU PICK THIS MOMENT
dialog: TO ONLY HAVE ONE GUN!?!
text: Mike twists to the window. Starts firing out.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: We can’t stay here, Mike!
text: But Mike keeps firing, not listening as --
scene_heading: INT. RED ROOF INN - HALLWAY - SAME
text: -- Luga appears outside the room. FIRES into the wall.
dialog: 36.
scene_heading: RESUME MIKE AND MARCUS:
text: Bullets SHOOTING THROUGH THE WALL, Mike joins Marcus and
text: Howard RACING to a rear door, leading to the adjoining room.
text: Marcus BARRELS into the door, BUSTING into the adjoining room
text: as Luga steps inside, still shooting.
scene_heading: INT. RED ROOF INN - ADJOINING ROOM - SAME
text: Marcus and Howard crash to the floor. Mike fires back out at
text: Luga, buying Marcus time to help Howard get to his feet.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: C’mon Captain, you gotta get up.
text: But Howard doesn’t move -- Marcus soon realizing that his
text: clothes are stained with blood -- HOWARD'S BLOOD.
text: He looks down. Howard's SHOT, bleeding BAD. Marcus looks up
text: at Mike, still trading shots with Luga.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Mike!
text: Mike turns back. Sees Howard -- trying to talk, but CAN'T.
scene_heading: EXT. RED ROOF INN - SAME
text: Cam kicks down a back door, firing out at Viktor and the
text: gunmen, Daltrey and Sanchez backing him up, the three soon
text: sprinting over to a parked Buick and ducking down behind it.
speaker_heading: RESUME MIKE:
text: still firing shots at Luga in the OTHER ROOM while Marcus
text: cradles Howard, fading fast. Luga whips back around to take
text: aim at Mike, but he fires first -- bullet SHATTERING Luga’s
text: weapon as he retreats back.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Marcus, stay with him!
text: Mike CHARGES after Luga. Marcus takes Howard's hand.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: It’s gonna be okay, Captain. You're
dialog: gonna be alright.
scene_heading: EXT. RED ROOF INN - SAME
text: TNT continues to trade fire with the gunmen.
scene_heading: INT. RED ROOF INN - HALLWAY - SAME
text: Mike enters, gun first. No Luga. But he sees a nearby door is
text: ajar. He rushes up, kicks the door.
dialog: 37.
scene_heading: INT. RED ROOF INN - ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Mike moves inside. Still no sign of Luga -- but the window is
text: OPEN. He rushes over. Looks out. Nothing. Then:
text: A REFLECTION. Mike whips around to find Luga CHARGING HIM --
text: the two CRASHING into each other, FLYING out the window --
scene_heading: EXT. RED ROOF INN - SAME
text: -- SLAMMING hard to the ground.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - SAME
text: Police cruisers roar toward the hotel, sirens wailing.
scene_heading: EXT. RED ROOF INN - SAME

scene_heading: INT. RED ROOF INN - HALLWAY - SAME
text: Marcus cradles Howard, slipping...
scene_heading: EXT. RED ROOF INN - SAME
text: Mike and Luga trade vicious blows on the ground. Luga reaches
text: behind his back. Draws a SIX INCH STILETTO.
text: He THRUSTS it down -- but Mike grabs his wrist. Luga presses
text: down HARDER. Mike BITES Luga’s hand. Kicks him off.
text: Then -- HEADLIGHT BEAMS hit Mike. He looks up to see the FORD
text: FLEX SCREAMING UP.
text: Mike quickly ROLLS out of the way, the SUV just missing him,
text: screeching to a sudden stop, on its way to picking up Luga.
text: POLICE CRUISERS appear in the distance, coming up fast.
text: The Ford Flex doors open, Viktor screaming at Luga to:
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: GET IN THE FUCKING CAR!
text: But Luga refuses to go, a man POSSESSED as he grabs a gun
text: from one of Viktor’s men and hurries around to the other side
text: of the SUV -- FIRING at Mike, who DIVES behind a parked car,
text: Luga keeping his finger firmly pressed on the trigger, rounds
text: ripping open the fuel tank.
text: Mike sees the car is about to blow and he quickly RUNS OFF as
text: Luga continues to shoot until --
text: -- BOOOOM! -- the car ERUPTS. Goes AIRBORNE. Mike DIVES.
dialog: 38.
text: The car comes CRASHING down, stopping short of crushing Mike
text: when it lands atop another car hood, right beside him.
text: Luga -- CLICK! -- runs out of bullets. Cam, Daltrey and
text: Sanchez run up, firing in his direction.
text: Luga turns. Sees the cruisers coming. Then whips around,
text: searching again for Mike -- but he can’t see him through the
text: rain, smoke and fire. FUCK! He missed his shot.
text: He gets back in the Ford Flex. It PEELS AWAY.
text: Covered in soot, Mike watches Luga disappear.
text: Then as police cruisers pull up, everything starts SLOWING
text: DOWN, SOUND DROPPING OUT, MUSIC TAKING OVER as WE GO TO:
scene_heading: INT. RED ROOF INN - ADJOINING ROOM - LATER
text: PARAMEDICS rush inside, over to Howard.
scene_heading: EXT. RED ROOF INN - MOMENTS LATER
text: Howard is loaded into the ambulance. Mike, Marcus and TNT

scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: The ambulance roars away, bubble lights blurred by rain.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - VARIOUS - LATER
text: Cops hold a vigil for Howard in the lobby. Sanchez prays in

text: Marcus are in one of the exam rooms, giving blood, silent.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - OPERATING ROOM - SAME
text: Howard goes under the knife. He has vital signs, but they’re
dialog: very faint. Don’t know if he’1l live or die as we GO TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PLG SHIPPING COMPANY - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. PLG SHIPPING COMPANY - OFFICE - SAME

speaker_heading: BARDHA

scene_heading: INT. PLG SHIPPING COMPANY - MAIN FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Hess and Bardha find Luga walking calmly inside.
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: HESS
dialog: (in Albanian; subtitled)
dialog: Do you know what you did? You’re
dialog: all over the fucking news!
text: Luga says nothing. Just lets Hess bluster.
speaker_heading: HESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Every law enforcement agent in
dialog: Florida is looking for you now.
speaker_heading: LUGA
dialog: You think I care about your police?
dialog: Back home, they’re the criminals.
speaker_heading: HESS
dialog: You’re not home. We have a way of
dialog: doing things here. And I’m not
dialog: gonna let you further jeopardize
dialog: everything I’ve worked toward --
speaker_heading: LUGA
dialog: You hide. You fear the police when
dialog: they should fear you.
speaker_heading: HESS
dialog: (not backing down)
dialog: Forager’s here in two days. You’re
dialog: not leaving until then.
text: Luga sees he’s surrounded by Hess’s GUNMEN. Trapped.
text: He then turns back to Hess. Says nothing. Just smiles. It’s
text: unnerving as hell. A chill runs down Hess’s spine but he
text: doesn’t let his anxiety show.
text: Moments later, a metal door SLIDES OPEN. Luga steps inside,
text: disappearing down into the basement.
text: Albanians SEAL the door behind him, locking Luga inside.
speaker_heading: BARDHA
dialog: Are you sure about him?
speaker_heading: HESS
dialog: I’m sure he’s essential. I’m sure
dialog: if he wasn’t the only one who could
dialog: do what needed to be done, I’d
dialog: drown him in the river myself.
dialog: (turning to Bardha)
dialog: The three you sent to bring him
dialog: here. .?
speaker_heading: BARDHA
text: They didn’t show. Luga came alone.
dialog: Viktor and them are probably
text: running. Scared for their lives.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: HESS
dialog: They should be. Find them -- and
dialog: kill them.
text: Bardha nods. Turns and leaves.
speaker_heading: AGENT KESSLER (V.O.)
dialog: What part of what I’m telling you
dialog: are you not clear about,
dialog: lieutenant?
scene_heading: INT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. HEADQUARTERS - SITUATION ROOM - MORNING
text: Ellie squares off against Kessler, passionate and intense.
scene_heading: Also on hand: MIAMI-DADE P.D. BRASS, including INSPECTOR
text: ROBERT LUTTRELL of Internal Affairs. 40's. Tough, but fair.
speaker_heading: AGENT KESSLER
dialog: You and your officers are to stand
dialog: down from this investigation
dialog: immediately.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: And what part of “I don’t give a
dialog: shit” are you not clear about,
dialog: Agent Kessler? That’s one of our
dialog: own fighting for his life ina
dialog: hospital bed right now. No way FBI
dialog: keeps us out of this!
speaker_heading: AGENT KESSLER
dialog: Do you even know who you’re dealing
dialog: with? Before he was an enforcer
dialog: with the Albanian mafia, Aleksander
dialog: Luga was in the Special Operations
dialog: Battalion. One of the best trained
dialog: units in Europe and part of the
dialog: elite Commando Regiment. He’s also
dialog: an experienced pilot, highly
text: skilled in hand-to-hand combat,
text: knife training and light and heavy
dialog: artillery readiness. Responsible
dialog: for at least 26 confirmed
dialog: assassinations, so even if we
dialog: allowed Miami PD to go after him,
dialog: you’re not equipped to do so.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: (not backing down)
dialog: That is total bullshit!
scene_heading: INT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - SAME
text: Mike moves with purpose up the corridor. He’s still in last
text: night’s blood-stained clothes.
scene_heading: RESUME SITUATION ROOM:
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: AGENT KESSLER
dialog: (softening)
dialog: Look, Lieutenant, I’m sorry about
dialog: Captain Howard... I am. But this is
dialog: bigger than you know.
speaker_heading: LUTTRELL
dialog: Why? What are you talking about?
text: Kessler pauses. Doesn’t want to give up any details, but his
text: silence betrays him.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Luga didn’t just come here to kill
dialog: Lowery and Burnett, did he?
speaker_heading: AGENT KESSLER
dialog: I can’t tell you that. Not until we
dialog: can be sure there are no more
dialog: leaks.
speaker_heading: LUTTRELL
dialog: Leaks?
speaker_heading: AGENT KESSLER
dialog: Luga found out where you were
dialog: keeping Lowery and Burnett. That
dialog: didn’t come from us. What you
dialog: should be focusing on now is
dialog: finding another safe place for them
dialog: to wait this out.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Because that worked so well the
dialog: first time? Or is it cause you
dialog: think setting up one of ours as
dialog: bait is a good way to flush out
dialog: your fugitive?
speaker_heading: AGENT KESSLER
dialog: Conspiracy theories aside, Luga is
dialog: an FBI matter -- which means Miami
dialog: PD will stand down. All evidence
dialog: relating to last night is under our
dialog: jurisdiction.
speaker_heading: LUTTRELL
dialog: Agent Kessler, with all due
dialog: respect, the shooting at the Red
dialog: Roof Inn involved our officers, not
dialog: yours. Miami PD Internal Affairs
dialog: has a responsibility to investigate
dialog: and every right to look at any
dialog: evidence you have.
text: Kessler pauses. He’s right. Can’t shut him out.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: AGENT KESSLER
dialog: Alright... I’1l allow access only
dialog: to Internal Affairs, but our
dialog: cooperation ends there, you
dialog: understand?
text: Luttrell nods. Fine.
scene_heading: INT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - SECONDS LATER
text: Mike reaches the situation room just as the door opens and
text: Kessler moves out past him. Ellie sees Mike and walks up.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Let me guess: stand down and shut
dialog: up?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: I know how you feel, Mike. No one
dialog: wants to get this asshole more than
dialog: me, but we have to let the Feds
dialog: take the lead.
text: But Mike doesn’t buy that, cutting past her, leaving.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Mike!
scene_heading: INT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Mike moves with purpose. Down the hall from him is Cam with

speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Mike, about Captain Howard, I just
dialog: wanted to say --

dialog: Jesus, Megan, how many suitcases

dialog: out.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: How do I know that? No one’s
dialog: telling me where we’re going or for
dialog: how long.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: That’s ‘cause you don’t need to
dialog: know. It’s not safe. I’m tryin’ to

speaker_heading: MEGAN

dialog: with me!
scene_heading: EXT. BURNETT HOUSE - SAME

speaker_heading: MIKE MARCUS

speaker_heading: MEGAN

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: What are you doin’ here, Mike? I

dialog: with me.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You still tight with Coleman at the
dialog: FBI Miami office?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: ...-He owes me a few favors. Why?
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Feds are shutting Miami PD out of
dialog: the Luga investigation. I need
dialog: access to the Feds’ evidence file
dialog: on the shooting last night.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: So you came here to use me.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Regardless of what’s going on with
dialog: you and me, I owe it to Howard to
dialog: go after Luga. Not to mention that
dialog: as long as he’s out there, neither
dialog: one of us is safe. No matter how
dialog: far you send your family away.
dialog: Marcus considers him, then:
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: You don’t have to convince me. I
dialog: wanna find him just as badly as you
dialog: do.
scene_heading: INT. BURNETT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Mike waits for Marcus to say his goodbyes.
speaker_heading: MARCUS

speaker_heading: JAMES /QUINCY/MEGAN

text: Mike beams, hugging them back -- while Marcus steams.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Yeah, keep on showin’ him the love.
dialog: It’s not like Uncle Mike’s the

speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: I’m scared, Marcus.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Don’t be, baby. These cops are
dialog: gonna make sure nothing happens to

speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Sure you can even get the keys out?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I can get the keys out!
text: Marcus struggles. Clearly he can’t.

speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Not a word.
speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: COLEMAN

speaker_heading: MARCUS

speaker_heading: COLEMAN
dialog: Alright...but this stays between
dialog: us. We ID’d one of the shooters
dialog: with Luga from the hotel
dialog: surveillance footage. His name’s
text: Viktor Gojahki. He’s tied into the

speaker_heading: CAM (CONT'D)

dialog: Come on, I saw your eyes at HQ and
dialog: after your couples therapy session
dialog: at the inn, there’s only one reason
dialog: you'd be sharing a car with
dialog: Burnett. You're going after Luga
dialog: and you're worried if Ellie sees me

speaker_heading: MARCUS

speaker_heading: CAM

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: MARCUS

speaker_heading: CAM

speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: That's right. Professor Marcus X.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Let me ask you something, Marcus.
speaker_heading: MARCUS

speaker_heading: CAM

speaker_heading: MARCUS

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah, it’s tough when you think

dialog: they don’t.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Mike, come on, that isn’t fair --
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Shut up, Cam.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Yeah, shut up, Cam.

speaker_heading: MIKE

scene_heading: EXT. LIBERTY CITY STREET - SECONDS LATER
text: The Camaro stops across the street from the #11 house.
scene_heading: INT. CAMARO - SAME
text: Peering out the window at Viktor’s mom’s house:
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You sure this is gonna work?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: These Albanians are nothing if not
dialog: tight with their families. Marcus,
dialog: you got any surveillance equipment?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I’m a PI, Mike. What do you think?
scene_heading: EXT. LIBERTY CITY STREET - MOMENTS LATER
text: The trunk pops open. Inside: various audio and visual
dialog: surveillance equipment -- along with personal defense
text: weapons, including a TASER GUN.
text: Marcus grabs a phone hacking device called a GYPSY WIRE while
text: Cam picks up a camcorder. Presses play. His jaw drops when --
scene_heading: A VERY SHAKY SEX TAPE
text: between Marcus and Theresa plays.
speaker_heading: THERESA (ON THE TAPE)
dialog: Come on, Marcus, forget the camera.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (ON THE TAPE)
dialog: Trust me baby, we’re gonna love
dialog: having this when we’re older.
dialog: 52.
text: Husband and wife go at it as Marcus’s eyes light up. Mike
text: looks over the screen.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Dude, two words “tri-pod”
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Give it back!
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I think I see the tri-pod.
text: Red, Marcus grabs the camera from Cam. Shuts it off.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Just say the word and I can give
dialog: you a few pointers.
text: Marcus tosses the camera back into the trunk. Replaces it
text: with a pair of SPIKED CLIMBING SHOES.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Who are you, Paul Bunyon?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: How else do you think I’m gettin’
dialog: up on that pole?
text: Marcus slips on the shoes:
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: So you call up the mom, tell her
text: that her son’s been shot. She tries
dialog: calling Viktor, but Marcus cuts the
text: line before the call is placed.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Mom has no choice but to see if
text: he’s alive for herself. She gets in
dialog: her car --
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: And takes us right to him.
text: Marcus rises. Grabs the gypsy wire. Puts his “game face” on.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Okay. Let’s do this.
text: Marcus shuts the trunk and walks off toward the TELEPHONE
text: POLE, spikes digging into the pavement with each step.
dialog: 53.
scene_heading: INT. VIKTOR’S MOM’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: An Albanian soap plays on a TV with rabbit ears.

scene_heading: INT. CAMARO - SAME
text: Same seats as before: Mike, up front. Cam in the back.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You really hate having a partner
dialog: don’t you, Mike?
text: Mike says nothing.
speaker_heading: CAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Marcus, me. If it was up to you,
dialog: you'd just do everything yourself.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Occasionally I need someone to get
dialog: me coffee.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You read my jacket before we were
dialog: partnered up. You know what I can
dialog: do. What I bring to the game.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah. Headache. Problem with you is
dialog: you have no idea what it takes to
dialog: be a real cop. You got no field
dialog: experience.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I think the only reason you give me
dialog: no respect is because I remind you
dialog: of you -- only you’re a step slower
dialog: and I’m the up and comer.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Please, if you reminded me of me,
dialog: I'd kick my own ass. Now shut up.
dialog: You may learn something.
scene_heading: EXT. LIBERTY CITY STREET - SAME
text: Sweat POURING, Marcus reaches the phone box. He pops it open
text: and connects the gypsy wire, tapping into the mom’s line.
dialog: 54.
scene_heading: INT. CAMARO - SAME
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: ++. cool. And you’re sure she just

dialog: Thanks, Lisa. I owe you one.
text: He hangs up. Dials a new number.
scene_heading: INT. VIKTOR’S MOM’S HOUSE - INTERCUTTING
text: An old-school ROTARY PHONE rings. Viktor’s mom grimaces and

speaker_heading: MRS. GOJAHKI
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: This is Viktor Gojahki’s mom?
speaker_heading: MRS. GOJAHKI
dialog: Who this?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I’m the guy who just shot your son!
text: He’s dead.
text: Mike hangs up. Cam looks at him, shameful.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: This is just mean, man.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Mean, but it works.
text: Mrs. Gojahki hangs up, concerned. Is it true? She immediately
text: picks back up the phone. Dials a new number.
speaker_heading: RESUME MARCUS:
text: hearing her dial a new number, but before she can get

speaker_heading: RESUME MRS GOJAHKI:
speaker_heading: MRS. GOJAHKI
dialog: (hearing nothing on the
dialog: other end)
dialog: Hello?... Hello?
text: Nothing. She hangs up. Thinks. Then steps out of frame.
speaker_heading: RESUME MARCUS:
text: climbing down the wooden pole. Gets a splinter along the way.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Ahh fuck!
dialog: (then another)
dialog: Shit.
dialog: (and a third for good
dialog: measure)
dialog: Mother-fucka!
text: He jumps the last few feet and hits the ground, swallowing a
text: yell. Then steels himself and gets back in the Camaro.
text: Viktor’s mom exits her house, gets into her own car and
text: drives down off. Marcus follows in pursuit. The plan worked.
scene_heading: EXT. MIAMI STREET - MAGIC
text: Sun setting, Viktor’s mom’s car passes, followed by Marcus.
scene_heading: EXT. MIAMI MARINE STADIUM - VIRGINIA KEY - MAGIC
text: Built in 1963, the concrete amphitheatre overlooking a man-

text: Viktor’s mom pulls up to the street to the stadium.
speaker_heading: RESUME CAMARO:
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Alright, she’s slowing down. Viktor
text: must be hiding out in the stadium.
dialog: Get in front of her. We’ll cut her
text: off. Marcus, get to her door.
text: Marcus hits the gas. Cuts in front of the mom’s car. She
text: stops short. Mike, Marcus and Cam explode out of the Camaro.
text: Marcus is the first to reach the mom -- going up to her door.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Ma’‘am, I need you step --
text: But that’s all he gets out. Viktor’s mom puts a STUN GUN to
text: his hand. Shocks him with 50,000 volts.
text: Marcus CONVULSES. CRASHES. Mike and Cam rush over. Viktor’s
text: mom BOMBS out of the car, SWINGING her purse in Mike’s face
text: over and over, kicking the crap out of him.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Do something!
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I have no field experience,
dialog: remember.
text: Mike catches the purse. Engages in a TUG OF WAR with the mom.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Jesus, she’s got a grip!
text: Cam gets an idea. Rushes off. Viktor’s mom starts SPITTING
text: and CURSING at Mike.
speaker_heading: VIKTOR’'S MOM
dialog: I kill you! I kill you!
text: Marcus staggers to his feet. Grabs the mom from behind. Tries
dialog: to yank her back when --
text: -- TWO PROBES ATTACHED TO TASER WIRES tag her in the chest.
text: Cam hits the trigger on Marcus’s TASER GUN. She gets SHOCKED
text: and FALLS BACKWARD onto Marcus -- the two HITTING THE GROUND,
text: Marcus breaking her fall.
text: Mike and Cam stand over the pair. Marcus winces.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Next time...you get the door.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: What do we do with her now?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Call in a uniform. Get him to take
text: her back home.
text: OFF MARCUS -- the 75 year old mother SEIZING on top of him:
scene_heading: EXT. MIAMI MARINE STADIUM - PARKING AREA - LATER
text: A few feet beside Viktor’s Ford Flex, Mike and Cam get guns.
text: Ready for war. Mike sees Marcus doing the same.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Whoa, hold up, what are you doing?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: What’s it look like?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: It looks like you’re gearing up for
dialog: police business and in case you
dialog: forgot, you’re not the police
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I wasn’t the police either when my
dialog: ass was climbing that telephone
dialog: poll.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That was different.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Because I wasn’t gonna do that.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: So you were just using me.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Hey, you were the one who didn’t
dialog: want to be a cop, remember? So
dialog: stand back, citizen.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Hey, Mike, come on, three sets of
dialog: guns are better than two.
speaker_heading: MIKE
text: Depends who’s doing the shooting,
dialog: and who asked you?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I told you: I’m here for Howard.
dialog: Not for you. You’re not my boss, my
dialog: partner or my friend anymore. I’m
dialog: going in.
text: Marcus cocks his gun and heads off. Mike can’t help but
dialog: respect his loyalty to Howard. Back to Cam:
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: And you: better follow my lead.
text: Mike heads off after Marcus. Cam follows.
scene_heading: INT. MIAMI MARINE STADIUM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Abandoned for decades, the metal seats now come in two
text: colors: rust and graffiti. Mike, Marcus and Cam move quietly
text: inside. There’s no sign of Viktor. The stadium looks EMPTY.
dialog: But --
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE: VIKTOR AND HIS TWO GUNMEN
text: hiding behind columns a few feet ahead, Glocks ready. When
text: Mike, Marcus and Cam approach -- they swing around, FIRING.
text: Mike, Marcus and Cam take cover behind seats and concrete
text: pillars, SHOOTING BACK -- GUNFIRE DEAFENING.
scene_heading: EXT. MIAMI MARINE STADIUM - PARKING AREA - SAME
text: Two black Suburbans ROAR UP. Doors explode open.
text: BARDHA AND A TEAM OF SHOOTERS hop out. Rush the stadium.
dialog: 58.
scene_heading: RESUME MIKE, MARCUS AND CAM:
text: still trading rounds with Viktor and his men when --
text: GUNSHOTS COME RAINING IN FROM BEHIND THEM!
text: Mike, Marcus and Cam whip around. See Bardha and his shooters
text: advancing, FIRING.
text: The trio return shots in both directions -- but they are OUT-
text: MANNED -- caught in a CROSSFIRE between Bardha and his team
text: and Viktor and his men.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Fuck, they’re flanking us! Move
dialog: back!
text: Mike, Marcus and Cam make a DASH up the aisle, making their
text: way up to an UPPER LEVEL to escape the gunfire, taking cover
text: behind a PLASTIC TARP hanging down from the roof.
text: But the GUNFIRE CONTINUES.
text: Mike quickly re-loads his gun and throws the plastic aside to
dialog: see what’s going on below -- and he’s thrown!
text: Bardha and his team aren’t pursuing them. They’re ADVANCING
text: on Viktor and his men. Mike seeing:
text: Bardha and his men fire multiple rounds at Viktor and the two
text: gunman, riddling Gunman #1 -- then tagging Gunman #2.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: They’re not here for us. They’re
dialog: here for them!
text: Viktor fires back at Bardha and his team -- then TAKES OFF,
text: RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE.
text: Mike gives chase -- following Bardha and his men, racing
text: after Viktor -- who reaches the end of an aisle and --
text: JUMPS OVER the side of the stadium -- dropping several feet
text: to the pavement below.
text: Bardha and his team run up and FIRE DOWN on him, but Viktor
text: ESCAPES, rushing UNDERNEATH the lowest level of the stadium.
text: Mike comes up behind Bardha and his men. Fires. Hits one, but
text: he’s wearing KEVLAR.
text: The others return shots. Mike ducks down behind seats,
text: bullets PINGING metal.
dialog: 59.
scene_heading: EXT. MIAMI MARINE STADIUM - SECONDS LATER
text: Viktor emerges from underneath the stadium and JUMPS into the
text: Ford Flex. SLAMS the door. He’s about to turn the key when --
text: Bardha and his team run up. Surround the car. Viktor goes to
dialog: duck down. Too late.
text: The SUV gets COMPLETELY DEMOLISHED WITH BULLETS that RIP
text: through the car and Viktor’s flesh, killing him.
text: Bardha then turns to the Camaro. Fires a shot into a tire.
text: Mike gets outside as Bardha and his team ROAR OFF in their
text: Suburbans. He goes to run into the Camaro to pursue. Stops
text: short when he sees the flat front tire. Shit.
text: IN THE DISTANCE: police sirens WAIL and cruisers approach.
scene_heading: INT. MIAMI MARINE STADIUM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Viktor’s men lie on the cement, dead. Marcus hovers over
text: their bodies, looking like he’s about to hurl.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Hey... you alright?
text: Holding back barf -- but trying to play it off:
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Yeah. You know. Just... acid
dialog: reflux.
text: He gags. Mike comes up. Immediately pats down one of the
text: bodies, pulling what he can from his pockets.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What you should be. Taking whatever
dialog: evidence we can before the Feds do.
dialog: These guys were our best shot at
dialog: gettin’ to Luga. Whatever they
dialog: could tell us, someone made sure we
dialog: couldn’t find out. We need to
dialog: figure out what.
text: Marcus and Cam soon join in. Go through pockets. Jackets.
text: Marcus finds a phone, Cam a wallet.
text: But then -- Cam sees something else: a FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER
text: sticking out of the sock of Gunman #2.
text: Cam pulls it out and unfolds the paper. Written on it: THREE
text: SETS OF STRANGE SYMBOLS MIXED WITH CYRILLIC LETTERS AND
scene_heading: RANDOM NUMBERS. A COMPLEX CODE.
dialog: 60.
text: Red and blue lights converge on the stadium and we GO TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MIAMI MARINE STADIUM - NIGHT
text: Mike, Marcus and Cam give statements to MIAMI PD. Agent
text: Kessler soon arrives, backed by THREE FBI AGENTS.
speaker_heading: AGENT KESSLER
dialog: (livid)
dialog: I hate to repeat myself, Lowery.
dialog: Now, this is the second time I’ve
dialog: had to warn you not to interfere
dialog: with this investigation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Some investigation. We’re the ones
dialog: who found the hotel shooters.
speaker_heading: AGENT KESSLER
dialog: What are you doing here anyway?
dialog: You’re a Goddamn civilian.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: (up in his face; pissed)
dialog: “I'm a Goddamn civilian? I’ma
dialog: Goddman civilian.”
dialog: (beat; realizing; backing
dialog: off)
dialog: Yeah, that’s right, I’m a Goddamn
dialog: civilian.
speaker_heading: AGENT KESSLER
dialog: (to his agents)
dialog: I want them searched.
text: Mike, Marcus and Cam protest but the FBI agents with Kessler
text: don't give a shit, patting them down, finding Marcus’s gun --
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I got a permit for that.
text: -- and a gunman’s phone in Mike’s pocket. Kessler grabs it.
speaker_heading: AGENT KESSLER
dialog: You got a permit for this?
text: Another agent finds a wallet in Cam’s pocket.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Hey, that’s mine.
text: The agent shows the ID to Kessler.
speaker_heading: AGENT KESSLER
dialog: (reading the Albanian name
dialog: on the card)
dialog: Enver Biba?
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: It’s my porno name. I also go by
dialog: Hung Frankenstein.
speaker_heading: AGENT KESSLER
dialog: Detain them.
text: The Feds quickly slap on cuffs.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What the fuck, Kessler!?!
text: Mike, Marcus and Cam are pulled over to the FBI sedans.
speaker_heading: LUTTRELL (0.S.)
dialog: Agent Kessler!
text: Kessler turns. Sees Luttrell walking up.
speaker_heading: LUTTRELL (CONT’D)
dialog: What are you doing to my
dialog: detectives?
speaker_heading: AGENT KESSLER
dialog: What the hell does it look like?
speaker_heading: LUTTRELL
text: A Federal agent detaining Miami PD.
dialog: You don’t want the headlines or the
dialog: headache. Trust me.
text: Kessler pauses. He definitely doesn’t.
speaker_heading: LUTTRELL (CONT’D)
dialog: Put them in my custody. Let
dialog: Internal Affairs handle them.
speaker_heading: AGENT KESSLER
dialog: Like you've handled them so far?
speaker_heading: LUTTRELL
dialog: They won’t be a problem anymore.
text: Kessler considers Luttrell. A beat, then warns:
speaker_heading: AGENT KESSLER
dialog: They interfere again, I’m gonna
dialog: arrest them for willful impeding of
dialog: a Federal Investigation. That
dialog: clear?
speaker_heading: LUTTRELL
dialog: Crystal.
text: Kessler orders his men to let Mike, Marcus and Cam free. As
text: soon as the Feds walk away:
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Thanks, man.
speaker_heading: LUTTRELL
dialog: Please. I love standing up to those
dialog: Federal pricks. Mike, I know how
dialog: bad you want Luga. I do too. But
dialog: you're bringing down too much heat.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Just tell me what else Kessler
dialog: knows about Luga.
speaker_heading: LUTTRELL
dialog: (beat, then: )
dialog: What I’ve managed to piece together
dialog: is: the FBI has intercepted a lot
dialog: of chatter on Albanian organized e-
dialog: mail communications. References to
dialog: something called “Forager.” And
dialog: according to their HUMINT sources,
dialog: they believe someone inside the
dialog: country has brought Luga here as
dialog: talent to pull off some major drug
dialog: operation.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: We gotta get this guy fast, Mike.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Maybe this will help.
text: Cam reaches down and takes off a shoe.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Your socks?
text: Cam pulls the paper he took off the gunman out of his shoe.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Got this off one of Viktor’s boys.
dialog: Stashed it in my shoe in case we
dialog: had to give the other evidence up.
text: Marcus is instantly impressed. Mike is too, but isn’t showing
text: it. Marcus picks up on this.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Okay, I’ll say it: “Fuck yeah.”
text: Mike takes the paper. Doesn’t know what to make of it.
speaker_heading: LUTTRELL
text: Mike, a word.
text: Mike hands the paper back to Cam and walks off with Luttrell.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: LUTTRELL (CONT’D)
dialog: There’s something else. Didn’t want
text: to say in front of the others.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What’s up?
speaker_heading: LUTTRELL
dialog: I’ve been looking into who had
dialog: knowledge that you guys were hiding
text: out at the hotel. Only a handful of
dialog: people knew and all of them were
dialog: cops. The leak definitely came from
dialog: inside Miami PD, maybe even your
dialog: unit. Somebody’s gone bad. I’m
dialog: gonna find out who, but in the
dialog: meantime, don’t trust anyone.
dialog: Mike considers that, as we GO TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. HEADQUARTERS - AN HOUR LATER
speaker_heading: ELLIE (V.O.)

speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: -- and you gave me your word that

speaker_heading: MIKE

dialog: different?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Not from Mike Lowery, no.
text: She leans forward.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I know you don’t respect me. But
dialog: you should at least respect that I
dialog: have a job to do.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: And so do I. This asshole’s come
dialog: here to kill me and because of
dialog: that, Captain Howard's fighting for
dialog: his life. You wanna talk respect?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: How ‘bout the respect you owe your
dialog: cops instead of the Feds -- or the
dialog: respect I owe Howard to go after
dialog: Luga and bring his ass down for
dialog: what he did?
dialog: (rising from his seat)
dialog: And I'd do the same if it was you
dialog: in the hospital right now instead
dialog: of him.
text: Ellie looks at Mike. He’s telling the truth but despite her
text: loyalty to Howard, she can’t let him off the hook.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: I would suspend you, but I don’t
dialog: think that would help. So you --
dialog: (to Cam)
dialog: -- get your toothbrush, your
dialog: pajamas, whatever you need, cause
dialog: from this moment on, you’re on Mike
dialog: watch. Every move he makes you’re
dialog: gonna tell me about it. And if he
dialog: screws up, it’s on you too.
dialog: (back to Mike)
dialog: This is not gonna end with you dead
dialog: or in jail. This is for your own

speaker_heading: SANCHEZ

speaker_heading: MIKE

text: Over the next SEVERAL HOURS, Cam tries to break down the code
text: with a pen, re-arranging letters, words and symbols onto a
dialog: piece of paper as:
text: Daltrey types an algorithm into a computer. Hits ENTER.
text: Immediately all the numbers, letters and symbols start to
dialog: move around and change order. Eventually --
text: Daltrey’s algorithm cracks the first cipher.
speaker_heading: DALTREY
dialog: Holy shit, I got it.
text: Cam snaps up, alert.
speaker_heading: DALTREY (CONT'D)
dialog: The code’s based off the Albanian
dialog: alphabet. We just need to figure
dialog: out which numbers correspond to
dialog: which letters --
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: And then add them to the letters
dialog: that already exist.
speaker_heading: DALTREY
dialog: Exactly.
text: Daltrey types more commands into the computer, cross-
text: referencing letters in the code with the Albanian alphabet.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Hold up. What about the symbols?
speaker_heading: DALTREY
text: The symbols are nothing. Garbage.
dialog: Noise to keep us from seeing the
dialog: real code.
dialog: 68.
text: Cam jots down a few ALBANIAN WORDS as they appear. Then types
text: into another computer. Translates the Albanian words in the
dialog: first coded entry into English. Comes up with:
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Morrow Airpark.
text: Daltrey does the same routine for the second code.
speaker_heading: DALTREY
dialog: Next code’s an address. 27309
dialog: Fleming Avenue.
text: Daltrey enters the address into his computer.
speaker_heading: DALTREY (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s a gas depot.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: And the last code?
text: Daltrey tries to crack it using the same method as the other
dialog: two, but can’t.
speaker_heading: DALTREY
dialog: ...I don’t know. This cipher’s
dialog: different from the other two. It’s
dialog: not based on the same alphabet.

speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MARCUS

speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: You guys make a good team.
text: Marcus looks away. Jealous, perhaps? Switching the subject:
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Talk to your family lately?
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I checked in on them this

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: How they holdin’ up?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Good... under the circumstances.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I missed them.
speaker_heading: MARCUS

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Must be nice. Having someone to go

text: Marcus looks at him sideways.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Are you jealous, Mike? ‘Cause you

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Just sayin’. It’s been on my mind
dialog: lately is all.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Mike Lowery wants to settle down?
dialog: Better get one of those crash

speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, uhh, since we’re sharin’ n’

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: MARCUS

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I asked.

speaker_heading: MARCUS

dialog: don’t get a say. And when you do it
dialog: all head-on like you do, you’re
dialog: puttin’ my life on the line. And
dialog: after so long, it’s clear that you
dialog: don’t care about me.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: And how do you think I felt? The
dialog: person I counted on to save my life
dialog: wasn’t there for me. “We ride
dialog: together. We die together. Bad Boys

dialog: me.

speaker_heading: HITMAN
dialog: They’re dead.

scene_heading: INT. CONTAINER SHIP - MID-SHIP CORRIDOR - SAME

speaker_heading: LUTTRELL

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Turn your ass around!

speaker_heading: LUTTRELL
dialog: (pleading)
dialog: Mike, please, you gotta understand.

dialog: gotta believe me.
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You're a goddamn traitor. I don’t
dialog: have to do shit but take your ass
dialog: in.
text: But Luttrell is merely stalling -- his hands (unseen by Mike)
text: grabbing a Glock off the desk. He swings it around. He won’t
dialog: be taken in. Gives Mike no choice but to --
text: BANG! BANG! BANG! Put three holes in Luttrell’s chest.
scene_heading: INT. CONTAINER SHIP - ENGINE ROOM - SAME
text: Marcus steps inside. Takes in the massive diesel engine, huge

speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: What the fuck am I suppose to --
text: He stops himself and moves over to the equipment.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck it.
text: And just starts throwing levers, hoping to shut the engines

scene_heading: INT. CONTAINER SHIP - HALLWAY - SAME

scene_heading: INT. CONTAINER SHIP - HOLD - MOMENTS LATER
text: Mike is dragged into the hold by two gunmen. Another two are

speaker_heading: RESUME MARCUS:
text: continuing through the ship, stopping when he hears VOICES.
text: He follows them. Comes up to the entrance to the hold.
text: He sees Luga keeping his gun on Mike. Counts the other
text: gunmen. Shit. He’s so out-numbered. He ducks back into
text: another compartment. Dials Cam.
scene_heading: EXT. CONTAINER SHIP - SAME
text: But Cam is occupied, mid-gun battle with the remaining gunmen
text: on the outer deck of the ship, COPS joining in.
speaker_heading: RESUME MARCUS:
text: hanging up.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Shit.
text: He checks his ammo. Half a mag. Thinks -- as TIME SLOWS DOWN.
speaker_heading: RESUME MIKE:

speaker_heading: RESUME MARCUS:
text: as he weighs his options, coming to the only conclusion he

text: weapon and kills the fourth gunman but --
text: -- LUGA_GETS THE DROP ON MARCUS -- getting behind him and
text: holding a gun to his head -- while using him as a HUMAN
text: SHIELD against Mike.
text: Mike pauses -- locking eyes with Marcus -- his friend -- in
text: danger -- then Luga -- his enemy.
speaker_heading: LUGA
dialog: Your gun -- put it down.
dialog: Mike considers.
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Don't do it, Mike.
speaker_heading: LUGA
dialog: Do it now!
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Don’t you fucking do it!
text: Mike debates.
speaker_heading: LUGA
dialog: Drop it!
speaker_heading: MARCUS LUGA (CONT'D)
text: He’s gonna kill us both! PUT THE FUCKING GUN DOWN!
text: Mike locks eyes with Marcus. A choice must be made. A beat
dialog: then --
text: Mike drops the gun, choosing Marcus over himself.
dialog: 
text: Luga then aims his gun at Mike -- but before he can shoot --
text: -- Marcus swings his arm back -- knocking Luga’s arm aside.
text: He then gets up to his feet and spins -- as Luga levels his
dialog: gun again -- Marcus --
scene_heading: -- PUTS HIMSELF IN THE LINE OF FIRE AS -- BANG! -- LUGA
scene_heading: SHOOTS -- BULLET RIPPING THROUGH MARCUS.
dialog: 
text: Mike’s eyes SCREAM as Marcus drops down in front of him.
text: Luga takes aim at Mike -- who RUSHES him -- moving so fast
text: that Luga can’t even get a shot off before Mike CRASHES INTO
text: HIM. Luga’s gun FLIES ASIDE.
text: And as Marcus BLEEDS OUT beside him --
text: Mike HURLS PUNCHES at Luga -- one after the other -- RAGING.
text: But Luga takes the blows -- before landing a closed-fist to
text: Mike’s jaw that stuns him.
text: Then Mike draws his blade and swings it -- the knife SLICING
text: Luga’s arm -- causing blood to spray.
text: Enraged -- Luga throws a flurry of mixed martial arts that
text: catch Mike off-guard -- punches knocking him to the ground --
text: Right beside Luga’s gun. He makes a grab for it -- as Luga
text: DARTS out the hatch -- disappearing before Mike can shoot.
text: Mike then turns back to his partner and rushes over, dropping
text: down beside him and turning him onto his back.
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Marcus -- Marcus!
text: He sees Marcus is bleeding bad -- but still alive -- his
text: breathing LABORED.
text: He doesn’t have a lot of strength -- or time -- but he still
dialog: manages to whisper to Mike to:
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Kill that fucker.
text: Mike nods -- committed -- then hurries out with Luga’s gun.
scene_heading: INT. CONTAINER SHIP - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: RESUME CAM:
speaker_heading: CAM

dialog: He calls for back-up as we --
speaker_heading: RESUME MIKE:
text: still on the move -- but stopping when he sees a BLOOD SMEAR
text: on the hatch that leads to:
scene_heading: INT. CONTAINER SHIP - STEERING GEAR ROOM - SECONDS LATER
text: Mike moves inside, gun up. A FIRE AXE GETS SWUNG AT HIM.
text: Mike DUCKS -- but Luga swings again -- KNOCKING the gun away.
dialog: 106.
text: He goes to hack Mike a third time -- but Mike catches the
text: handle before the axe connects with his face.
text: The two struggle for control and in the battle -- the axe
text: goes free -- in the opposite direction of Mike’s gun.
text: Luga knocks Mike down to the floor -- and locks his legs
text: around his head -- CHOKING HIM.
text: Mike tries prying Luga’s legs free but his grip is too TIGHT.
text: Mike’s arms search for something -- finding a tool box.
text: Rummaging around -- he locates a SCREWDRIVER and STABS LUGA
text: IN THE LEG WITH IT.
text: Luga HOWLS and releases his grip. Mike scurries away -- out
dialog: of breath.
text: Luga looks behind him. Sees Mike’s gun. He goes to make a
text: grab for it. Mike sees this. Knows he has one move left.
dialog: That's when he spies:
text: THE FIRE AXE. He picks it up just as Luga takes Mike’s gun --
dialog: turning to aim as --
text: Mike LAUNCHES the axe -- throwing it across the room at Luga.
dialog: 
text: THE BLADE CATCHES HIM IN THE CHEST -- PIERCING HIS HEART.
dialog: 
text: Luga’s STUNNED. He can’t even bring himself to fire.
text: He SLUMPS to the floor -- locking eyes with Mike as he drops -
text: - before keeling over -- DEAD.
text: OFF MIKE -- bloodied and exhausted:
scene_heading: EXT. CONTAINER SHIP - MOMENTS LATER
text: A MEDICAL HELICOPTER comes in for a landing.
text: Mike comes rushing out a hatch -- onto the main deck. He
text: looks around. Sees Marcus on a stretcher -- loaded into the
text: helicopter, its doors shutting.
text: No words. Just MUSIC. Mike hurries past his fellow officers
text: and off the boat as the helicopter FLIES OFF.
scene_heading: EXT. MIAMI DOCKS - SECONDS LATER
text: Mike commandeers a police cruiser -- slams the door -- hits
text: the gas -- and ROARS OFF as we BEGIN AN INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: EXT. SKIES ABOVE MIAMI - DAY

scene_heading: INT. MIAMI GENERAL HOSPITAL - ER - MOMENTS LATER
text: Mike arrives at the curtain area where Marcus is being

speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Sir, you're gonna have to wait
dialog: outside.
dialog: But Mike protests:
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That’s my partner in there!
text: He tries to look past the curtains -- but only sees Marcus's
text: legs and the doctors scrambling to save him.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Please, get back, let the doctors
dialog: do their job.
text: Mike -- no choice -- backs off.
dialog: 108.
text: And as he leaves -- we hold on his POV: his partner and
text: friend -- obscured by the curtain -- fighting for his life.
dialog: Off which -- FADE OUT.
dialog: A beat, then:
scene_heading: INT. MIAMI GENERAL HOSPITAL - ROOM - MORNING

text: asleep in a bed -- alive, but still in critical condition.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
scene_heading: INT. MIAMI GENERAL HOSPITAL —- ROOM — DAY
text: Mike is now asleep. Days have since passed. He slowly stirs,
dialog: eyes focusing on:
text: THE BED. But it’s now EMPTY. Marcus is GONE. Where did he go?
dialog: For a moment, we may think he’s dead -- but then --
text: A TOILET FLUSHES off-camera. Mike whips around to find:
text: MARCUS -- stepping out of the bathroom -- moving slowly back
text: to his bed.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Fair warning, Mike: keep clear of
text: the bathroom for at least an hour.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What the hell are you doin’, man?
dialog: You know your ass ain’t supposed to
dialog: get out of bed.
text: Marcus struggles to get back into bed. Mike helps.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: You know...I never did thank you
dialog: for what you did on that ship.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: No...you didn’t.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But you don’t have to. That’s what
dialog: partners are for.
text: Mike looks at Marcus, sincere:
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I’m sorry I didn’t respect you

speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I’m sorry you didn’t either.

speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I’m sorry, baby. Mike said it was
dialog: okay.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: No, no, you ain’t layin’ that shit

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Kiss asses.
text: A KNOCK at the door. Mike and Marcus turn to see Ellie.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Got room for a few more guests?
text: She then steps aside to allow -- CAPTAIN HOWARD to move
text: inside the room -- walking with the use of a cane.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN HOWARD
dialog: Well, well, well, it wasn’t good
dialog: enough that I got shot -- you
dialog: assholes had to end up in the
dialog: hospital, too.
speaker_heading: MIKE/MARCUS
dialog: Hey Captain! Good to see you, man!
text: Howard crosses up to his Bad Boys.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN HOWARD
dialog: That was some good cop work you
dialog: did. The both of you.
text: Mike and Marcus nod.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: So when did the doctors say you
dialog: could get back to bein’ captain,
dialog: Captain?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN HOWARD
dialog: About a month or so. But I may
dialog: stretch that a bit... since I know
dialog: the department’s in good hands.
dialog: 110.
text: That's in reference to Ellie -- who locks eyes with Mike. But
text: this time, she can’t hold back a smile. Maybe there is a
dialog: future for them...?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN HOWARD (CONT’D)
dialog: What about you two?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What about us what?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN HOWARD
dialog: The Bad Boys. They back together or
dialog: gone for good?
text: Mike and Marcus turn to each other -- then Marcus looks to
dialog: Theresa for permission.
text: She looks back at him -- then nods. It’s okay with me.
text: Marcus smiles and returns to Mike. Shrugs. I’m in if you are.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: ... What about Cam?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Cam’s a good cop. He’ll be an even
dialog: better one without your influence.
text: Mike looks back to Marcus. The classic Inner Circle song
text: starts to come up on soundtrack -- as we GO TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MIAMI GENERAL HOSPITAL - DAY
text: Mike pushes Marcus in a wheelchair -- away from us -- the two
text: of them awash with Miami sunshine.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Look, if Bad Boys 2.0 is gonna
dialog: happen, there’s gotta be some
dialog: ground rules.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: From now on, we’re gonna talk about
dialog: every move before we make it, you
dialog: understand.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Fine... on one condition.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Anything.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: We burn every last one of your
dialog: stupid ass skinny jeans.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: But, Mike man, that’s my look.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: And you look like an idiot. If
dialog: we’re gonna be partners again,
dialog: you’re gonna have to dress the
dialog: part.
text: The two continue on like that, playfully jabbing each other,
dialog: the best of friends -- the Inner Circle song playing on as we
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
speaker_heading: BLACK.
scene_heading: END CREDITS SEQUENCE. STILL IN DARKNESS:
speaker_heading: MARCUS (V.O.)

speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
text: We're in the midst of a high-speed pursuit -- Mike’s BRAND
text: NEW Ferrari ROCKETING through traffic.
scene_heading: INT. FERRARI - SAME
text: The flashing SIRENS of cruisers light up Mike’s face.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Better tell FHP this is us before
text: they start shootin’ the tires.
text: As Mike rips back over the median, the engine roars at a
text: downshift and the speedometer drops.
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: That’s it!? You slowing down?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I’m doing 85 in a school zone.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Eighty-five? Man, I used to know a
dialog: cop named Mike Lowrey. Didn’t even
text: sober up ‘til he hit a hundred.
text: Mike shoots through a red light; cars skid in his wake.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: School kids, crossing guards,
dialog: they'd be stuck in the fender. You
dialog: still the baddest cop? Drive like
dialog: it!
scene_heading: EXT. SMALL HOUSE - LUMMUS - MOMENTS LATER
text: The Ferrari screeches to a stop. Mike and Marcus bomb out.
text: Rush up. Marcus punches the door.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Marcus Burnett -- open up!
text: The door swings open. We expect a crack dealer or something,
text: but instead we get an EARTHMOTHER.
text: Mike and Marcus were racing to get to the WATER BIRTH of
text: Marcus’s grandson. We see Theresa is also there.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Congratulations. Grandpa.
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: It’s a boy. It’s a boy, Marcus!
text: Marcus is humbled.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Bad Boys, bad boys, what’chu gonna
dialog: do?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Quit it, Mike. That shit ain’t
dialog: appropriate no more.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I gotta film this.
text: Mike pulls out Marcus’s camcorder (which he’ll have taken
text: from the car) and turns it on. We HEAR:
scene_heading: THERESA (ON THE CAMERA MONITOR)
dialog: Oh Sgt. Burnett, YES, YES!
dialog: 113.
text: Marcus's eyes go wide like SAUCERS.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Oh FUCK!

text: quality than the previous version. No longer shaking.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Okay, finally some production
dialog: value.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: (taking the camera back)
dialog: I’m gonna kick your ass.
speaker_heading: MIKE
