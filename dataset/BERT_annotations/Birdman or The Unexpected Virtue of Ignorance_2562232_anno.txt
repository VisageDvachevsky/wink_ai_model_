speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: 1 INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - DAY 1
text: Close on the brilliant colors of a middle eastern rug, the
text: center of what seems to be a makeshift "meditation" space.
text: We slowly tilt up to discover the back of Riggan Thomson (55).
text: He is in the proper `Lotus' position, dressed only in tight
text: white briefs and he appears to be meditating deeply. And if all
dialog: this seems a little odd, it becomes all the more so when you
text: notice that he is levitating almost two feet above the floor.
text: His breath is calm and measured... in and out... in and out.
speaker_heading: MAN (V.O.)
dialog: How did we end up here?
dialog: (Beat.)
dialog: This place is a fucking dump.
text: We begin to slowly move toward Riggan's back while his measure
text: breathing continues. We see a clock on the wall, ticking.
speaker_heading: MAN (V.O.)
text: Smells like balls.
text: A slight twitch in Riggan's neck.
speaker_heading: MAN (V.O.)
dialog: We don't belong in this shithole.
text: A Skype call shatters the silence. Close on his back, we follow
text: Riggan as he walks over to the computer and answers the call.
text: On the computer screen appears Sam (21), in a pair of Levi's
text: and a Led Zeppelin T-shirt. She has simple and striking good
text: looks, with an edge in her voice and behind her eyes. She
text: stands in a Korean Deli among the flowers, talking to Riggan
text: through her iPhone.
speaker_heading: 1A 1A
text: The Korean Store owner (50) stands in the background screaming
text: at her the whole time.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Sam, I can't--
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 2.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Dad? What kind of--
dialog: (Turning to Korean.)
dialog: SHUT UP!!!
dialog: (Back to screen.)
dialog: What kind of flowers did you say you
dialog: wanted?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Alchemillas. Or something soothing that
dialog: smells nice. Listen I can't--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It all smells like fucking Kimchi!
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Then whatever looks nice. Anything but
dialog: roses. No roses.
speaker_heading: KOREAN
dialog: Flowers don't need you touch! They need you
dialog: buy!!!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (Close into the screen.)
dialog: I hate this job.
text: And the Skype call is over. Riggan closes the laptop and leans
text: forward trying to regain his calm. His reflection appears in
text: the mirror, and for the first time we see his face. He has a
text: dark goatee and his hair looks strangely abundant. There is a
text: piece of paper on the mirror with the handwritten phrase "A
dialog: thing is a thing, not what it is said of that thing."
scene_heading: ANNIE ON SPEAKERS
dialog: Riggan, they're starting scene
dialog: five. We need you on stage.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Shit...
text: Riggan throws on a sweater and stumbles into his slacks. He
text: hurries out...
scene_heading: 2 INT. HALLWAYS - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 2
text: ...through the narrow corridors of the theater. There is a lot
text: of activity as various workers and stage hands appear and
text: disappear carrying equipment and scenery. As Riggan descends the
text: stairs, a Stage Hand· passes by in the opposite direction.
speaker_heading: STAGE HAND·
dialog: Mr. Thomson.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 3.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Steve.
speaker_heading: STAGE HAND·
dialog: It's Daniel.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (Already passed.)
dialog: Okay.
text: Riggan continues on until he arrives backstage. He runs into
dialog: Jake (42) his producer and friend.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: How's it going, buddy.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Great. It'd be even better if I
dialog: could get Ralph to stop acting like
text: he's in an educational video for
dialog: syphilis...
text: The camera moves off of them and onto...
scene_heading: 3 INT. STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 3
text: ...the stage. Suddenly we are in the midst of an Americana style
dialog: kitchen.
text: Around the kitchen table sit Lesley (35), plain and no nonsense,
text: her simple hairstyle and makeup can't hide how attractive she
text: is. Laura (35), dark, exotic, the kind of woman who makes every
text: person she meets feel like she's seducing them. And Ralph (40),
text: slightly handsome, slightly balding, slightly invisible.
text: A half empty bottle of gin on the table, they drink from
text: highball glasses as they chat...
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: He loved me.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Yeah. He loved her so much he tried
dialog: to kill her.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: He tried to kill you?
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: No. (A beat.) Okay, well, he did
dialog: beat me up one night. He dragged me
dialog: around the living room by my
dialog: ankles, yelling "I love you, I love
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 4.
speaker_heading: LESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: you, bitch." What do you do with a
dialog: love like that?
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: How is that-- That is not love and you know
dialog: it. Why do you insist on calling it--
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: You can say what you want, but I know what
dialog: it was.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: What about you, Nick? Does that sound like
dialog: love to you?
text: Riggan arrives at the table and sits.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Sorry I'm late.
dialog: (Beat. In character.)
dialog: I'm the wrong person to ask. I didn't
dialog: know the man. I've only heard his name
dialog: mentioned in passing. You'd have to
dialog: know the particulars. But I think what
dialog: you're saying is that love is absolute.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Yeah. The kind of love I'm talking about
dialog: is... The kind of love I'm talking about,
dialog: you don't try and kill people.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: (Sadly.)
dialog: It was love, Mel. To Eddie, it was. I don't
dialog: care what anybody says. He was ready to die
dialog: for it.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Ask her what he did after she left him.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
text: He shot himself in the mouth. But he
dialog: screwed that up, too. Poor Ed.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Poor Ed, my ass. The guy was dangerous.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: How'd he screw it up if he shot himself in
dialog: the mouth?
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: (By the numbers.)
dialog: He used to carry this twenty-two. We lived
dialog: like fugitives those days. I never knew--
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 5.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (Breaking character to direct.
dialog: Exasperated.)
dialog: Okay. Fugitives are on the run, Ralph. How
dialog: many times do I have to-- Fugitives are
dialog: scared. Give me more of that.
text: Ralph nods. He takes a breath and dives in once again...
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: (The same but louder.)
dialog: We lived like fugitives those days...
text: Extremely frustrated, Riggan stares out into the auditorium.
text: From his POV we see Jake who is now sitting in the third row.
text: His head buried in his hands, tortured by Ralph's performance.
text: Riggan turns back to Ralph.
speaker_heading: RALPH (CONT'D)
dialog: ...I never knew if he was going to come out
text: of the bushes or from behind a car and just
text: start shooting.
text: Riggan watches Ralph act and sees his whole production headed
dialog: down the drain. Ralph is just that bad.
speaker_heading: RALPH (CONT'D)
dialog: The man was crazy. He was capable of
dialog: anything.
text: The actors all wait for a cue from Riggan, who is now staring
text: up into the lights above the stage. Laura finally picks up
text: Riggan's cue.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Christ. What a nightmare...
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: He used to call me at the hospital and
dialog: say...
dialog: (Over the top.)
dialog: "Son of a bitch. Your days are numbered."
text: Silence. Ralph looks over to Riggan.
speaker_heading: RALPH (CONT'D)
dialog: Too much? Little bit? I just wanted to give
dialog: you a range, so you could--
text: And with that a light comes barreling down from it's perch and
text: crashes into Ralph's head, making him hit the floor like a rag
dialog: doll. Silence.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Holy shit.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 6.
text: Lesley and Annie (35), the Stage Manager, run over to Ralph
text: who is out cold. Not knowing what to do, they stare at him.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Is he breathing?
text: Jake runs toward the stage.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Someone call 911!
text: Riggan slowly backs away from the chaos.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Is that blood coming out of his
dialog: ear?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (To Riggan.)
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Okay, he's breathing. What did he
dialog: have for lunch?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Did anyone call for help?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Clapping.)
dialog: Wake up! Wake up!
text: Two crew members try to help Ralph.
speaker_heading: CREW MEMBER
dialog: Grab his legs. I got the top.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Don't move him! Wait for the ambulance.
dialog: (Calling out.)
dialog: For the love of God! I could get a black
dialog: audience in this theater faster than a
dialog: doctor!
text: Riggan heads off the stage, and Jake chases after him. We
dialog: follow them as...
scene_heading: 4 INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 4
text: ...they walk through the corridor.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Where are you going? We'll have the
text: understudy ready to rehearse in five--
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 7.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Forget the understudy. We have to postpone
dialog: the preview.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What are you-- It's a full house. We would
dialog: have to refund all the--
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Then do it.
text: A crew member· passes in the opposite direction.
speaker_heading: CREW MEMBER·
dialog: How's Ralph?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: He'll be fine.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Wait. Wait. Fuck. Wait.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Listen to me. It was going to be a
dialog: disaster. That guy's the worst actor I've
text: ever seen. The blood coming out of his ear
dialog: was the most honest thing he's done so far.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: He's not that bad.
text: Riggan stops in his tracks and stares at Jake.
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, he's fucking horrible. But--
text: Riggan starts walking again.
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: You have the press in your dressing
dialog: room in a few hours. How are we--
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I'll make something up.
text: Two Technicians· hurry up in the opposite direction.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Jake. This happened for a reason. It wasn't
dialog: an accident.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 8.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I-- (A beat.) I made it happen.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Oh. Okay.
dialog: (Beat.)
dialog: Are you drunk?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Find me an actor. A good actor.
dialog: Philip Seymour Hoffman...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: He's doing the third Hunger Games.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Michael Fassbender?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Doing the prequel to the X-Men
dialog: prequel.
text: They arrive at Riggan's dressing room.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: What's his name? Jeremy Renner...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: The... the Hurt Locker guy.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yeah. He's an Avenger.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (With disgust.)
dialog: Fuck. They put him in a cape, too?
dialog: (A beat.) Look, I don't care. Find
dialog: me someone.
text: Riggan enters...
scene_heading: 5 INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 5
text: ...his dressing room and tries to shut the door. Jake, still in
text: the corridor, stops it with his foot.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (Sticking his head in.)
dialog: Ralph'll sue us. He'll sue us. And he's got
dialog: a case.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 9.
text: Riggan releases the door.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Then make him go away.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: How do you suggest I do that?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: You're my lawyer, my producer and
dialog: my oldest friend. We are going to
dialog: make this work. Now just get out
dialog: there and do what you were born to
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I have no idea. But I have faith.
dialog: Now go away from me.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Do you think we should--
text: Riggan slams the door shut on Jake. A beat. On a television, a
text: segment of E! News. A busty blond, with an exaggerated smile,
dialog: hosts.
speaker_heading: BLOND WOMAN
dialog: ...and when we come back, an exclusive
text: interview with Robert Downey Jr., who tells
dialog: us about the billion-dollar Iron Man
dialog: franchise. The talented actor invited us
text: onto the set of Iron Man 3...
text: Riggan slams the tv off, his mind racing. He sits on a chair.
speaker_heading: MAN (V.O.)
dialog: That clown doesn't have half your talent
dialog: and he's making a fortune in that Tin Man
dialog: get up.
text: Riggan stares into the mirror, in the reflection he catches
text: sight of a poster from a movie called "Birdman 3". The
text: superhero, Birdman (a younger Riggan in a bird costume), wings
text: widely spread, stares directly back at him. A hand written
text: note on the top of the poster reads: "Thomson, break a wing!
text: From the boys at Local 1." Riggan tries to calm himself with a
dialog: mantra...
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
text: "Breathing in, I embrace my anger.
text: Breathing out, I smile to it."
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 10.
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (V.O.)
dialog: Embrace it. Kiss it. Turn it around and
dialog: fuck it in the--
text: A knock on the door behind him.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Not now!
text: Laura opens the door and sticks her head in.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Can I come in?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Okay. Two words. Shia La Beouf.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: That's three words.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: It's two.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Get out.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: I love you.
text: She closes the door. Riggan tries to calm himself down, but
text: Laura opens the door again.
speaker_heading: LAURA (CONT'D)
dialog: I take it we're not going to dinner
dialog: anymore?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I don't have an actor.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: I don't have a life.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Laura...
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Fine. Whatever.
dialog: (Goes to leave but stops.)
dialog: You remember at Joan's when you
dialog: asked me to come do a Broadway play
dialog: with you? You said it would be
dialog: fun...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 11.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Go away.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: So far? No fun.
text: Riggan closes the door and looks at the Birdman poster.
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (V.O.)
dialog: Fun? You know what would be fun? Getting
dialog: the fuck out of here before we humiliate
dialog: ourselves. That would be fun.
text: Riggan looks at himself in the mirror and begins to pull at
text: his hair. As it comes off his head, we discover it was a wig.
text: He turns away from the mirror, trying desperately to stay
text: calm. Something catches his eye: a vase of roses on the end
text: of the table. A card in them says, "They didn't have the
text: whatever you wanted - Sam". Enraged, Riggan focuses on the
text: vase. It begins to shift. Then, with a surge of anger,
text: without ever touching it, he sends it crashing against the
text: wall on the other side of the room.
text: The camera pans over the roses scattered across the floor. It
text: hovers over the carpet and around the perimeter of the room,
text: until it finally settles on Riggan, now dressed in a casual
dialog: blazer.
speaker_heading: A5 A5
text: It is later the same day. He is sitting on the sofa and on three
text: chairs in front of him are three journalists:
text: Gabriel, a geeky theatre journalist, wearing thick glasses and
text: a thin tie. Clara, a reporter from an entertainment blog. And
text: Han, a polite, obese Japanese journalist, who sits next to his
text: translator, another Japanese guy.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Why does somebody go from playing the lead
text: in a comic book franchise to adapting
dialog: Raymond Carver for the stage?
text: Riggan tries to remain calm.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, as you're probably aware, Barthes
dialog: said, "The cultural work done in the past
dialog: by gods and epic sagas is now done by
text: laundry detergent commercials and comic
dialog: strip characters." It's a big leap you've
dialog: taken...
text: Riggan shifts nervously.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 12.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Well... Absolutely. As you said... that
dialog: Barthes said... Birdman, like Icarus...
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Hang on. Who's this Barthes guy? Which
dialog: Birdman was he in?
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Roland Barthes was a French philosopher,
dialog: who--
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Oh. Okay. Sure. Now, is it true you've been
dialog: injecting yourself with semen from baby
dialog: pigs?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: As a method of facial rejuvenation.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Who told you that?
speaker_heading: CLARA
text: It was tweeted by... (checks her notes)
dialog: @prostatewhispers.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: It's a lie.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I know. But did you do it?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Are you afraid at all that people will say
dialog: you're doing this play to battle the
dialog: impression that you're a washed-up super
dialog: hero?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: No. I'm not. And that's exactly why
dialog: 20 years ago I refused to do
dialog: Birdman 4.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Birdman 4??? You do Birdman 4???
text: Jake opens the door and the camera pans to him.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 13.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Okay. That's enough for today.
dialog: Thank you for coming. We're
dialog: expecting some great pieces from
dialog: you...
text: Riggan stares at the Birdman poster.
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Publicity guys are trying to get
dialog: you a Times feature.
text: Riggan stands up and pulls the Birdman poster off of the
dialog: wall.
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: So, How'd it-- Whoa. If I were you
dialog: I wouldn't do that.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I don't want to look at it anymore.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: That was a present from the crew.
dialog: Don't fuck with those guys, they're
dialog: union.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I don't care.
text: Riggan leaves the poster on the floor, facing the wall, and
text: walks to the window. He opens it. We can hear distant drums
text: coming from the street.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: So... How'd it go?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Great.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (Worried.)
dialog: Did they ask about Ralph?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Good. He did it, you know? The
dialog: motherfucker threatened to sue us.
dialog: Didn't even wait to get out of the
dialog: hospital.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: And, what did you say?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 14.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What'd I say? I said, "You
dialog: motherfucker. You're threatening
dialog: me? ME? I swear to god, you fuck, I
dialog: so much as get a letter from a
dialog: lawyer, the press'll get the
dialog: pictures we got off your computer."
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: What pictures?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: The guy has a thing for nuns... in
dialog: diapers. What do you care? You
dialog: shouldn't have any knowledge about
dialog: it anyway. The important thing is
dialog: that I made him go away.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Right. That's great.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yeah, it's fantastic. One problem.
dialog: We don't have an actor. And if we
dialog: cancel the first preview the press
dialog: will smell the blood. We can't
dialog: afford to lose any more money. At
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: What do you want me to do?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: We pay an understudy, let's use the
dialog: understudy.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: No? Riggan, listen to me. Our dream actor
dialog: is not going to knock on that door and
dialog: say: "Hey fellas, when do we start?"
speaker_heading: B5 B5
text: There is a knock at the door. Leslie peeks in.
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: Can I talk to you for a second?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Yeah. What's up?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 15.
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: Did you find another actor?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: Okay. Well... Mike's available.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: He is?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Mike who?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I thought he was doing--
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: He was. He quit. Or got fired.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Mike who?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Which one? Quit or fired?
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: With Mike it's usually both.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Mike Fucking Who?
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: Shiner.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Jake...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yes! How do you know Mike Shiner?
speaker_heading: LESLIE
text: We share a vagina.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: You think he'd want to do it?
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 16.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: Because he said he'd want to do it.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Jake. Hang on a minute.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (to Riggan)
dialog: Ask me if he sells tickets.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Does he sell tickets?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: A shitload of tickets. Now ask me if the
dialog: critics like him?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Do they like him?
speaker_heading: JAKE
text: They want to spooge on him.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (Indicating Lesley.)
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Leslie...
speaker_heading: LESLIE
text: Right on his face.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Everything for a reason, right?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: You think he'll be able to come tonight?
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: I can call him and find out.
text: Riggan gives Jake a look.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I'll call his agent.
text: Jake charges out of the room. The camera follows him into...
dialog: 10/29/14 / 17.
scene_heading: 6 INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 6
text: ...the hallway and as Jake makes a left turn, Annie enters from
dialog: the right.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Annie, turn the work lights on and get me a
dialog: fresh copy of the script. We're gonna have
dialog: a "put in" tonight.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You'll find out...
text: Jake disappears down the hall and we follow Annie through the
dialog: theater and onto...
scene_heading: 7 INT. STAGE - THEATER - EVENING 7
text: ...the stage, where she turns some of the stage work lights on.
text: We pan along the stage until we find Riggan, wearing the same
text: clothes as before, scanning the empty auditorium.
speaker_heading: MIKE (O.S.)
dialog: Intimidating. Isn't it?
text: Riggan sees Mike Shiner (39) coming down the aisle, slovenly
text: dressed with mussed hair and intense eyes.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you have any idea who walked these
dialog: boards before you?
dialog: (Beat.)
dialog: Geraldine Page, Marlon Brando,
dialog: Helen Hayes, Jason Robards... And
dialog: now you. Riggan Thomson.
text: Riggan, trying to hide the intimidation.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Thanks for coming on such short notice,
dialog: Mike. I appreciate it.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Hey. This is what we do.
dialog: (Indicates a script.)
dialog: So, you wrote this adaptation?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 18.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: And you're directing the adaptation and
dialog: starring...
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I am.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Ambitious.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Thank you.
text: A sly smile from Mike. He leaps onto the stage.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Why don't we do a bit of it?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Hey, I wasn't expecting you to--
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: First preview is tomorrow, right?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Yeah, but you can go on with the script
dialog: until you feel comfortable--
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Let's just do some of it.
text: Riggan tries to hide his excitement. He grabs the script from a
text: nearby table and walks it over to Mike.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Take a look at page twenty--
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah. I don't need that.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I don't need the script. Just give me a
dialog: cue.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Feed me a line.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I don't-- What?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 19.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Feed. Me. A line.
text: Riggan drops the script and begins the scene.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: "I'm the wrong person to ask. I didn't
dialog: know the man. I've only heard his name
dialog: mentioned in passing. I wouldn't know.
dialog: You'd have to know the particulars. But
dialog: I think what you're saying is that love
dialog: is absolute."
text: Mike stares at Riggan, hyper-focused.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (Ruminating.)
dialog: Am I saying that love is absolute?
dialog: (He transforms.)
dialog: "Yeah. The kind of love I'm talking about
dialog: is. The kind of love I'm talking about you--
dialog: "
dialog: (An intense pause.)
dialog: Well, you don't try to kill people.
text: Riggan is transfixed, and almost immediately intimidated.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: How do you know the lines?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I have a thing, a whatever, a gift.
dialog: (A beat.) Come on, I helped Lesley get
dialog: off book. Hey, give me that cue again.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: "I'm the wrong person to ask. I didn't
dialog: know the man. I've only heard his name
dialog: mentioned in passing. I wouldn't know.
dialog: You'd have to know the particulars. But
dialog: I think what you're saying is--"
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Okay, can I-- Do you mind if I--
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: No, go ahead.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Follow me. He says, "I'm the wrong
dialog: person to ask." What's his intention?
dialog: Is he fed up with the topic?
dialog: Deflecting? Guilt about his wife maybe?
text: Then four sentences all say the same
dialog: thing... "I didn't even know the man."
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 20.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: "I've only heard his name mentioned in
dialog: passing." "I wouldn't know." "You'd
dialog: have to know the particulars." First of
dialog: all, particulars? What are you, my
dialog: grandmother? But the point is, YOU
text: DON'T KNOW THE GUY, WE FUCKING GET IT.
dialog: Make it one line. "I didn't even know
dialog: the guy." Right? ...
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: You pretty much know my lines too, huh?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Can we-- Are we doing something here? Come
dialog: on let's go. Cut it down, give it to me
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: "I'm the wrong person to ask--"
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Oh, right, sorry, you see? "I'm the wrong
dialog: person to ask?" That's another fuck you.
dialog: "Don't put me on the spot. Don't make me
dialog: self conscious about my marriage when my
dialog: wife is sitting right here..." See? Give
dialog: it to me. Give me a good fuck you. Come
dialog: on...
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Okay, let me--
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Come on. Give it to me right now. Fuck me.
dialog: Right now. Right here. Let's do it.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Okay, yeah...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: DO IT!
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (Jumps in w/out thinking.)
dialog: "Hey. I'm the wrong person to ask, okay? I
dialog: didn't even know the guy. So what's your
dialog: point?"
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: "What's my point?"
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: "What's your point? What are you saying?
dialog: Spit it out. You're saying, what? That love
dialog: is an absolute?"
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 21.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (Exploding.)
dialog: "Yeah! Alright? The kind of love I'm
dialog: talking about is absolute. The kind of love
dialog: I'm talking about you--
dialog: (A painful memory.)
dialog: Well, you don't try to kill people.
text: Riggan stands silently, his heart pounding.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: So what do you think, boss? Do I have a
dialog: job?
text: Riggan calls over to the wings.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: What do you think?
text: Mike turns to see Sam, who has been there for a bit.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: Larry needs to see him for a fitting.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I'm gonna take that as a yes.
dialog: (Walking to Sam.)
dialog: And you are...?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: That's my daughter, Sam.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Right. Yeah. I can see it around the... (A
dialog: beat) She doesn't look anything like you.
dialog: (To Sam.)
dialog: And your job is...?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: She's my assistant.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Your assistant...
dialog: (To Sam.)
dialog: And can you speak?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yup. I can even 'sit', 'stay' or 'roll
dialog: over' if you have any treats.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Welcome aboard, Mike.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 22.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (Mock saluting.)
dialog: Thank you, Captain.
text: We follow Mike and Sam off as they...
scene_heading: 8 INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 8
text: ...advance through the hallways.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I'm Mike Shiner, by the way.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I know who you are.
dialog: (Reluctantly honest.)
dialog: I saw you in 'Hothouse' at the Geffen. It
dialog: was... great.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That ass is great.
text: She turns her head toward him with a disgusted expression.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Dude. Seriously?
text: Moving by her, into a dressing room.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: This is the theatre, honey. Don't be so
text: self-conscious.
text: She follows him into the room where we see...
scene_heading: 9 INT. COSTUME DEPARTMENT - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 9
text: ...Larry stressing out while he works on a costume. He turns
text: to see Mike standing there. Sam stands against the wall,
text: focused on her cell phone.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Oh, thank the Lord and pass the
dialog: biscuits! I finally have an actor to
dialog: dress. Hello, Mr. Shiner.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: How're you doing, Larry?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Better, now that you're here. Take off your
dialog: clothes.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 23.
text: Mike takes off his shirt and hands it to Sam. She doesn't budge,
text: and it hits the floor. He begins to unbutton his pants...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You gonna stand there?
speaker_heading: SAM
text: (Glancing at her cell.)
dialog: This is the theatre, honey. Don't be so
text: self-conscious.
text: Larry searches for a few costume pieces.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Okay. I'm gonna have to start from
dialog: scratch, with less than twenty-four
dialog: hours... Let's see if these--
text: He turns to see a completely naked Mike.
speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Holy-- What is happening? Where are
dialog: your underpants?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: At home, under the bed, I think.
text: Sam glances at Mike for a second, then returns to her phone.
text: Larry begins to help Mike into some pants which, given the
dialog: situation, is very awkward.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Okay. Everything is too small.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah, you're not kidding.
text: Lesley enters the room immediately coming face to face with a
text: naked Mike. She doesn't notice Sam who is partially hidden by a
text: clothes rack. She just goes about trying a costume shirt.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Oh, that's nice...
dialog: (To Larry.)
dialog: Forgive him, Larry. Mike's like my five
text: year old son. Neither one of them has
dialog: clean underwear...
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Or pubic hair, I imagine.
dialog: (Folding the pants.)
dialog: Okay, well, I can take out the suit but
dialog: we're going to need some new pants and
dialog: shirts.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 24.
speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: (Looking back.)
dialog: And underwear...
text: Mike just stands there naked, staring at his penis in the
dialog: mirror.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: (To Larry.)
dialog: This is too small.
dialog: (To Mike.)
dialog: What the hell are you doing?
speaker_heading: MIKE
text: Waiting for Larry to finish.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I'm finished.
text: Larry disappears deeper into the costume room.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Okay, well, then I'm just standing here
dialog: with my balls out.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
text: Get dressed. Riggan's daughter is hanging
dialog: around, and I don't need her to walk in
dialog: here and--
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Leslie...
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: No, Mike. You haven't seen her. She's
dialog: always hanging around, just-- I don't--
dialog: Watching everyone. It's creepy. It's--
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Les...
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: I don't know if the drugs fried her
dialog: brain or what, but I don't need her
dialog: running to her father saying you showed
dialog: her your junk.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Okay, then we should probably get her out
dialog: of here.
text: Lesley's expression goes blank.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Oh, God. Really?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 25.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Hey, Sammy...
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It's Sam.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Fuck.
text: Sam steps forward.
speaker_heading: LESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: (To Sam.)
dialog: I didn't mean--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (Totally relaxed.)
dialog: It's cool. He's a handful, huh?
text: They both look back at Mike.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Almost.
text: Sam smiles at her and exits. Lesley wheels on Mike.
speaker_heading: LESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus... How is it you always manage to find
dialog: a new way to humiliate me?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: To be fair, you make it really easy.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: What the hell was she doing here?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: She brought me.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: And stayed???
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I know, right? She's a little--
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Look at me, Mike. This is Broadway. I'm
dialog: here. Finally. And I'm begging you, if you
dialog: love me, please, do me a favor... don't
dialog: fuck it up.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (Gently.)
dialog: Come here.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 26.
text: Lesley moves toward Mike. He cups her face in his hands
text: tenderly. They are face to face.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Play with my balls...
text: She twists his nipples hard and walks out.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: I won't fuck it up... Probably!
text: Larry reappears holding some clothes. We follow him out...
scene_heading: 10 INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 10
text: ...through the hallway. He walks by Jake and Riggan who are mid
dialog: conversation. We stay with them.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (O.S.)
dialog: I don't care, sign it.
speaker_heading: JAKE (O.S.)
dialog: Listen to me.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (O.S.)
dialog: No you listen to me--
speaker_heading: JAKE (O.S.)
dialog: I can't afford to listen to you...
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I'm gonna need to go shopping
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Fucking sew something, you old
dialog: fuck!
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I don't care. Give him what he
dialog: wants.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: His agent is asking for almost four
dialog: times what we were paying--
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Then go into the reserve.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: The reserve is gone. You spent it
dialog: on the fog. And those fake trees...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 27.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: It's a dream sequence, it--
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: And three union midgets that dance
dialog: around like--
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: You're not supposed to call them
dialog: midgets--
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: The reserve is gone!
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Listen to me, you didn't see what I
dialog: just saw. But you will, at the preview
dialog: tomorrow. Look, get the contract done.
dialog: I'll get the money.
text: Riggan begins marching toward the stage.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (Calling after him.)
dialog: When???
text: Laura comes down some stairs and chases Riggan.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (Incredulous.)
dialog: Hey, is it true? Shiner?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: He's in.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Holy shit! When can I meet him?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
text: He's in a fitting with Larry.
text: Lesley comes down the hallway.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: I'm going to Starbucks. You guys
dialog: want anything?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I'm fine. How's Mike?
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Did you talk to your daughter?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 28.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: He's great.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (To Lesley. Matter-of-
dialog: factly.)
dialog: Honey, your tits look like fucking
dialog: anjou pears in that top!
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: (Uncomfortable.)
dialog: Okay, well I'm gonna-- Thank you.
text: She walks away.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: And that ass. Like two eggs in a hanky!
speaker_heading: A10 A10
text: Riggan walks, Laura follows him.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Okay, I was going to tell you this over
dialog: dinner, but everything-- I have some news
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Good or bad? Cause right now--
text: A technician walks by.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (Whispering.)
dialog: I missed my last two periods.
dialog: (Beat.)
dialog: I think it's happening this time.
text: Riggan stops. Silent. A beat.
speaker_heading: LAURA (CONT'D)
dialog: Is that good or bad?
text: (He stares at her.)
dialog: Riggan...?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: It's good. It's great.
text: She smiles, her eyes filled with emotion. Riggan smiles back,
text: and nods absently.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Say something else...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 29.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (Joking.)
dialog: You're pretty sure it's mine?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (Unamused but plays along)
dialog: Well, let's see. There's you. Jake. That
dialog: masseuse wore a condom so... Yes, it's
dialog: yours... idiot.
text: She puts her head on Riggan's chest. We see his mind racing.
text: Laura is moved, and confused.
speaker_heading: LAURA (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you excited?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Me too.
text: Laura moves slightly away from him and suddenly slaps him across
text: the face. Riggan looks at her, confused.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: What--?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: You're not funny.
text: She kisses him intensely on the lips and briefly places his
text: hand on her belly, then moves it up to her breasts. After a
text: moment, she backs away.
speaker_heading: LAURA (CONT'D)
dialog: First preview tomorrow. Here we go!
text: Laura turns and walks away. Riggan continues down the
text: corridor. He passes by a Security Guard· in front of a small
text: TV. The camera becomes Riggan's POV and advances until...
scene_heading: 11 INT. BACKSTAGE - THEATER - EVENING 11
text: ...we go through the stage door. We scan the backstage area to
text: see the stagehands ready to do their jobs. We can feel the
dialog: electricity of a first preview.
text: On stage part of the kitchen set from before is visible. Annie
text: stands at her podium, calling the cues for the show.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Into her headset.)
dialog: Cue 34 and 35. Go.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 30.
text: She turns and looks directly into the camera.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Places.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (O.S.)
dialog: Okay.
text: Riggan walks on screen wearing his costume, carrying a bucket of
text: ice and a bottle of gin. He goes to the opposite side of the
text: stage and takes his place in the wings. He peeks out at the
text: audience who seem to be watching with interest.
text: Then we pan to the stage to find Mike, Lesley and Laura
text: performing the scene we saw at the beginning, around the table.
text: Mike looks comfortable, sipping at his drink. A half empty
text: bottle of gin on the table.
speaker_heading: MIKE
text: The maniac shot himself right in front of
dialog: us. I rode with him in the ambulance to the
dialog: hospital.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: I'll never get that image out of my head.
text: Right before he did it, his eyes-- they
dialog: were so sad... lonely.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Did you have to treat him?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I didn't have to. But I did.
dialog: (Pouring another drink.)
text: He was in bad shape. His head swelled
dialog: up to like twice the size of a normal
dialog: head. I'd never seen anything like
dialog: it. And I swear to God, I hope I
dialog: never do again.
text: Riggan stands near Annie.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: He's good.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: He's incredible. I think he's
dialog: drinking real gin.
text: Riggan looks out at Mike, who is refilling his glass.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 31.
text: A stagehand gives Riggan a bottle. Riggan watches and waits
dialog: for his cue.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Ask Nick what real love is. He'll
dialog: agree with me. You watch.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Why don't we just head to the
dialog: restaurant?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Don't get him started, Mel. You
dialog: haven't seen how he's been lately.
dialog: He's been depressed. I'm worried
dialog: about him. He's been--
text: She gently pushes Riggan and we follow him on stage...
scene_heading: 12 INT. STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 12
text: ...where Mike goes to refill his glass with the last of the
text: real gin. Riggan snatches the bottle out of his hands and
text: gulps the rest, straight from the bottle.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Been what? (Beat.) I'll tell you
dialog: what real love is. This happened a
dialog: few months ago.
dialog: (Drops bottle on table)
dialog: And it ought to make us ashamed
dialog: when we talk like we know what
dialog: we're talking about when we talk
dialog: about love.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Nick, for God's sake. Are you
dialog: getting drunk?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (Pointed at Mike.)
dialog: I don't have to be drunk to say
dialog: what I think.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Nobody's drunk. We're just having a
dialog: few drinks.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: You've had more than a few.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: What are you, counting?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 32.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Don't you talk to her like that.
dialog: Don't talk like a drunk if you're
dialog: not--
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (Exploding.)
dialog: Shut up. For once in your life.
dialog: Will you do me a favor and shut up
dialog: for a minute?
dialog: (Beat.)
dialog: Like I was saying... There's this
text: old couple, had a car wreck out on
dialog: the interstate. Some drunk kid
text: plowed his dad's pick up into their
dialog: camper.
text: We begin to hear the underscoring of violins.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Fucking teenager. By the time I got
text: to the hospital, the kid was dead.
text: He was off in a corner laid out on
text: a gurney. We took the old couple up
dialog: to the O.R.. They were a mess. We
dialog: worked like hell on them for most
dialog: of the night...
text: Over the speech, Mike reaches for the new bottle that Riggan
text: placed on stage. He refills his glass.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: When we were done, we wrapped them in full
text: body casts. The husband was depressed.
dialog: Even when I told him his wife was gonna
dialog: pull through, he was still depressed. So,
dialog: I got up to his mouth hole and asked him,
dialog: and he told me it was because he couldn't
dialog: see her through the eye holes. Can you
dialog: imagine? I'm telling you, the man's heart
dialog: was breaking because he couldn't turn his
dialog: goddamn head and see his goddamn wife.
text: Riggan is doing a good job. Lesley and Laura are genuinely
text: moved. Mike notices. He sips his drink.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean... It was killing him. Killing him
dialog: that he--
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I'm tired of this shit.
text: They all look at Mike. In silence.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 33.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Riggan)
dialog: What the fuck is this? Water?
text: He hurls the glass against the wall. Some laughter from the
text: audience. Riggan stares at him, confused. He presses on.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: It was killing the old bastard...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Did you just give me water?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Come on, Mike.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Come on what?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Take it easy. You're drunk.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Of course I'm drunk! I'm supposed to
dialog: be drunk! This is Carver, man! The guy
dialog: lost a piece of liver every time he
dialog: wrote a page! If I'm supposed to drink
dialog: gin then bring me fuckin gin! I mean,
dialog: you fucked the time period! You took
dialog: all the good lines for yourself! At
dialog: least let me--
text: The audience is now hysterical. Dozens of cell phones
text: pointing at the stage. Mike walks toward the apron, facing
dialog: the audience.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, okay. Seriously? You people are
text: pathetic. Put the cell phones down and
dialog: join the real world! Will somebody
dialog: please just live in the real world?!!
text: He crosses to the refrigerator.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Where's he going?
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: (Firmly.)
dialog: Mike, cut it out.
text: Mike rummages through the fridge.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 34.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Look at this. It's all fake.
dialog: (Tossing items out of the
dialog: fridge.)
text: The milk is fake. The butter is fake.
text: Riggan storms off the stage.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: (To Riggan.)
dialog: Your performance is fake.
dialog: (He finds some fried
dialog: chicken.)
dialog: Hey! There's chicken. Real chicken. The
dialog: only thing real up here is the chicken.
dialog: So I'm gonna stick with the chicken.
text: The audience laughs harder.
speaker_heading: MIKE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, this is good bird, man!
text: Riggan charges through the chaos backstage running into a
text: panicked Annie.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Get Mike out of here.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: How do you want me to do that?
text: Riggan keeps walking up to...
scene_heading: 13 INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 13
text: ...the hallway. Jake chases him.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I want him gone.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: We can't do that.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: What are you-- Of course we can do that.
dialog: It's our show.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 35.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Riggan, listen to me--
text: Riggan comes to a halt and faces Jake.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: No. You listen to me. Get him the fuck out
dialog: of my play. Did you see him out there?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: It was a preview! Nobody gives a shit about
dialog: previews. Nothing matters until that old
text: bat from the New York Times is sitting in
dialog: that audience on opening night.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: We're getting rid of him. I'm not going to
dialog: stand up on that stage and--
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Shut up! Just shut up for once and
dialog: listen to me. As soon as we announced he
dialog: was taking over, the advance doubled. We
dialog: can't afford to lose a preview. We can't
dialog: afford to lose money. We can't afford to
dialog: lose Mike. This is about being
dialog: respected, validated, remember? That's
dialog: what you told me. That's how you got me
dialog: into this shit. Now, you're the
dialog: director. Get him under control.
dialog: (A beat. As a friend.)
dialog: These are not the nineties anymore.
text: Jake storms away. Riggan heads toward his dressing room. Out
text: of nowhere, Mike barrels into him, pinning him against a wall.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (Startled.)
dialog: Holy Fuck!
text: Mike presses up against Riggan, breathing down his neck. After a
dialog: painful silence...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (Like he's possessed.)
dialog: You were good...
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Meet me in front of the theater in
dialog: 10 minutes.
text: Mike chuckles and slaps Riggan gently on the face before he
text: disappears into his dressing room. Riggan begins walking
text: again. We follow him into...
dialog: 10/29/14 / 36.
scene_heading: 14 INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 14
text: ...his dressing room. He goes into the bathroom and quickly
text: washes his face.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA (O.S.)
dialog: What the hell was going on up there?
text: We pan over to see his ex-wife Sylvia (43), standing in one
text: corner, staring at Riggan. She is elegant and simply beautiful.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I didn't know you were here tonight.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: That guy's an asshole, huh?
text: Riggan dries his hands with a towel and comes out of the
dialog: bathroom.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Sam and I are going to grab a bite
dialog: after she's finished with--
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: No, I mean here. Now.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Well. I know how much this means to
dialog: you, so--
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I appreciate that.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: So, how's it going?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: The play?
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: No, you and Sam.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: It's good. (A beat.) It's the same.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Do you talk to her?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 37.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: We talk. We-- I don't know, it's been crazy
dialog: around here.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: You understand where her head is at right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: She's trying to stay away from everything
dialog: and everyone that got her into rehab in the
dialog: first place, but...
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: ...I know, Sylvia...
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: ...But that's all she had. So she's--
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I really do get it.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: I know you're caught up in all this stuff,
dialog: but--
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Stuff...
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: You know what I mean.
dialog: (Beat.)
dialog: Riggan... You don't have to be a great
dialog: father right now, you just have to be one.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Yeah.
text: Suddenly, Laura opens the door and sticks her head in.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (Noticing Sylvia.)
dialog: Oh, sorry.
text: She closes the door. Awkward silence.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: So how is that going? Is she and
dialog: Sam--?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I don't wanna talk about it.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 38.
text: He goes to a small fridge, takes out a beer and closes it.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: You're drinking?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I'm having a beer.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Okay...
text: He sits and sips in silence for a moment. Then he begins to
text: take out the wig.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: So, what's going on with you?
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Me? Nothing. Everything's the same I guess.
dialog: I'm going back to teaching.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I'm thinking about refinancing the Malibu
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Wh-- I'm sorry?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I'm thinking about--
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: No, I heard you. I just need a second to--
dialog: (A beat.) That's gonna be Sam's house. Why
dialog: would you-- (A beat.) What? For this play?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (Honest and vulnerable.)
dialog: I need the money.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Do you have any idea how crazy that sounds?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: What do you want me to say? My health
dialog: lasted longer than the money... Go figure
dialog: that out.
text: Riggan seems pensive and lost.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Riggan...
dialog: (Beat.)
dialog: What's going on?... Look at me.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 39.
text: Riggan gently looks up to Sylvia.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I have a chance to do something right. And I
dialog: have to take it. I have to.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: It's funny. I was sitting here waiting
dialog: for you, and all of a sudden I couldn't
dialog: remember why we broke up.
text: Silence. Then, as if he hasn't heard what she said.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: The last time I flew here from LA, George
text: Clooney was sitting two seats in front of
dialog: me. With those cuff links, and that...
dialog: chin. We ended up flying through this
text: really bad storm. The plane started to
text: rattle and shake, and everyone on board
dialog: was crying... and praying. And I just sat
dialog: there-- Sat there thinking that when Sam
dialog: opened that paper it was going to be
text: Clooney's face on the front page. Not
dialog: mine. (A beat.) Did you know that Farrah
dialog: Fawcett died on the same day as Michael
dialog: Jackson?
text: She smiles sadly. She kisses him on the head and goes to the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Why did we break up?
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: (Looks him in the eye.)
dialog: You threw a kitchen knife at me...
text: Riggan is smacked by that memory. His eyes on the floor.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA (CONT'D)
dialog: ...and one hour later you were
dialog: telling me how much you loved me.
dialog: (Beat.)
dialog: Just because I didn't like that
dialog: ridiculous comedy you did with Goldie
dialog: Hawn didn't mean I did not love you.
dialog: But that's what you always do. You
text: confuse love with admiration.
text: She smiles sadly. He looks at her. As Sylvia opens the door,
text: she turns back to Riggan...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 40.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA (CONT'D)
dialog: It's your house, so do what you want with
dialog: it. Just make sure you're there for our
dialog: daughter.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I will.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: You're not Farrah Fawcett, Riggan.
text: She exits. Painful silence... until...
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (V.O.)
dialog: We should have done that reality show they
dialog: offered us. "The Thomsons." That would've
dialog: been good. Crazy, druggy, wise ass daughter.
dialog: Milfy wife with the perky tits. People would
dialog: have watched that.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (To the poster.)
dialog: Shut up.
text: Riggan stands up and grabs his jacket. He opens the door and
dialog: goes out to...
scene_heading: 15 INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 15
dialog: ...the hallway.
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (V.O.)
dialog: Where are we goin'?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (Almost whispering.)
dialog: Leave me alone.
text: Riggan walks between crew members. Annie interrupts him.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: The sun bed is here.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: It means there's a sun bed out there
dialog: being delivered to in here.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Who ordered a sun bed?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 41.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Mike. He says it's for his character.
dialog: Carver's red necks, "people of the
dialog: land". Part of his process and that
dialog: shit.
text: Riggan cannot deal with this right now. He continues walking
text: until he arrives at a metal door that takes him out to...
scene_heading: 16 EXT. AN ALLEY WAY - OUTSIDE THE THEATER - CONTINUOUS 16
text: ...an alley way. Riggan walks toward the street. There is a man
text: playing drums. Riggan finds Mike leaning against a parked car,
text: dazed and looking up at the marquis...
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Let's go. Walk.
text: Riggan begins to walk, Mike follows.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: To get you some coffee. Have I done
dialog: anything to disrespect you?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Not yet.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I have a lot riding on this play.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Is that right?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: People know who I am, and--
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Bullshit.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Mike--
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Bullshit. People don't know you. They
dialog: know the guy in the bird suit. They
dialog: know the guy who tells those quaint,
text: slightly vomitous stories on Letterman.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Well, I'm sorry for being popular, but
dialog: that--
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 42.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (With irony.)
dialog: Popular? POPULAR?... Oh God, popularity is
dialog: just the slutty little cousin of prestige.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Okay, I don't even know what that--
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: My reputation is riding on this play.
dialog: And that's... That is...
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: A lot?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: A lot. Exactly. Fuck you. Yes. This
dialog: doesn't work out for you, you get to go
dialog: home to your studio pals and jump right
dialog: back into that cultural genocide you
dialog: guys are perpetrating. "There's a
dialog: douchbag born every minute". That was
dialog: P.T. Barnum's premise when he got rich
dialog: inventing the circus. And you and your
dialog: pals know nothing's changed, and
dialog: whatever toxic shit you make people are
dialog: still gonna pay to see it. But, after
dialog: you're gone, I'll still be here. I'll
dialog: still be making my living on the stage.
dialog: Baring my soul. Wrestling with emotions,
dialog: complex emotions.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Right. Is that what tonight was about then?
dialog: (Mocking him.) Wrestling with "complex
dialog: emotions"?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Tonight was about making it alive. About
dialog: making it bleed. This isn't the Warner
dialog: Brothers lot, Riggan. This is the city, and
dialog: this is how we do things.
text: Mike turns and opens the front door of The Rum House.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: They have coffee in here.
text: He walks into the restaurant. Riggan backtracks and we follow
dialog: him into...
dialog: 10/29/14 / 43.
scene_heading: 17 INT. RUM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 17
text: ...The Rum House. Mike stands at the bar, the bartender
text: already pouring two whiskeys.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (To bartender.)
dialog: Thanks, Tommy.
text: Tommy nods and walks away.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (Getting back on point.)
text: People were laughing in our faces.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (Handing Riggan a drink.)
dialog: Tonight they were laughing, tomorrow
dialog: they'll be... be.. tweeting about us. Fuck
dialog: `em. Who cares??? These are the people who
dialog: pay half price to watch us rehearse. Stop
dialog: fucking caring!
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: We're doing Raymond Carver. This play is a
dialog: drama. This play is--
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You don't know what this play is. These are
dialog: previews. This is where we find out what
dialog: the play is.
text: Mike points to an Older Woman sitting at the bar. She sips a
text: martini and scribbles in a notebook with a sour expression.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: You see that woman over there? The one that
text: looks like she just licked a homeless guy's
dialog: ass? Nothing matters until she writes five
dialog: hundred words about us in the New York Times.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: That's...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Tabitha Dickinson. Yes. And, believe it or
dialog: not, the only thing that matters in theater
dialog: is whether she likes us or not. She does,
dialog: we run. She doesn't, we're fucked.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (Preoccupied.)
text: She does look like she licked a homeless
dialog: guy's ass.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 44.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Do me a favor, don't get your panties in a
dialog: twist over a preview, alright? And don't tell
dialog: me how to do my job. Cause, this is my town.
dialog: And, to be honest, nobody gives a shit about
dialog: you around here.
speaker_heading: LADY (O.S.)
dialog: You're Riggan Thompson, right?
text: Two fat tourists in "Mamma Mia" t-shirts, with a seven year old
text: kid, approach the table.
speaker_heading: HUSBAND
dialog: (Timidly.)
dialog: We're sorry to interrupt...
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: Would you mind terribly if we got a
dialog: picture?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Of course. It's no trouble at all.
text: The Lady shoves her camera into Mike's hands.
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: (To Mike.)
dialog: Would you mind?
text: Mike gets up with a blank expression and takes the camera.
text: The Lady pushes the kid into the booth next to Riggan.
speaker_heading: LADY (CONT'D)
dialog: (Ordering Mike.)
text: The button right on top there.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Who is this guy?
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: (To his son.)
dialog: Come on, Billy. He used to be like Batman.
text: She yanks the kid closer and they squeeze up against Riggan.
text: Mike takes the photo and holds the camera to the lady.
speaker_heading: LADY (CONT'D)
dialog: (To Mike)
dialog: I think you screwed that one up. Take
dialog: another one.
text: Mike takes another picture.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 45.
speaker_heading: LADY (CONT'D)
dialog: (To Riggan.)
dialog: God bless you, darlin'. You're very sweet.
dialog: And handsome!
text: She kisses Riggan hard on the mouth. Then gets up, giddy, and
text: takes her son by the hand. As the couple leaves, husband shoves
text: a five dollar bill into Mike's hands.
speaker_heading: HUSBAND
dialog: We really appreciate it.
text: An agitated Mike takes a sip of whiskey.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Are we good here? Cause I'm gonna go.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: See you tomorrow.
text: Mike places the dollar under one of the shot glasses and begins
text: to walk away, but then stops and turns curiously.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Why Raymond Carver? You never told me.
text: Riggan looks at Mike for a second, than reaches for his wallet
text: and produces an old cocktail napkin with some writing on it. He
text: slides it to Mike.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: A long time ago, I did a play back in
dialog: high school in Michigan. He was in the
dialog: audience. He sent this backstage after.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: "Thank you for an honest performance. Ray
dialog: Carver." What is this?
text: Riggan looks vulnerable. He is trying to make Mike understand
dialog: the importance of the napkin, to build a bridge between them.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: And that's when I knew I was going to
dialog: be an actor.
text: Mike can't stop himself from smiling.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Why is that funny?
speaker_heading: MIKE
text: He wrote it on a cocktail napkin.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 46.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: So...
text: Mike slides the napkin back to Riggan.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: He was drunk.
speaker_heading: A17 A17
text: He walks away and we follow him as he passes by the bar next
dialog: to Tabitha Dickinson, the Critic.
speaker_heading: TABITHA
dialog: You headed to Hollywood, Mike?
text: Mike stops.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Hollywood's headed here, Tabby.
speaker_heading: TABITHA
dialog: (A devilish smile.)
dialog: Good luck with that.
text: Mike looks directly into her eyes.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: "A man becomes a critic when he can not be an
text: artist, in the same way that a man becomes an
dialog: informer when he cannot be a soldier."
dialog: Flaubert, right?
text: He flashes his own devilish smile. She stares back. If she
dialog: weren't so much older than him, you'd swear there was sexual
dialog: electricity between them.
speaker_heading: TABITHA
dialog: He's a Hollywood clown in a Lycra bird
dialog: suit.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah. And at 8 o'clock tomorrow, he's gonna
dialog: get on stage and risk everything. What're
dialog: you gonna be doing?
text: A standoff.
speaker_heading: TABITHA
dialog: Don't you ever worry that I'll give you a
dialog: bad review?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 47.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Oh, I'm sure you will. If I ever give a bad
dialog: performance.
dialog: (Beat.)
dialog: Ms. Dickinson.
speaker_heading: TABITHA
dialog: Mr. Shiner.
text: Mike smiles and waves over to an obviously nervous Riggan. He
text: goes toward the exit, but we stay with Tabitha, scribbling on
text: her notebook. Suddenly she raises her eyes and, with a dark
text: expression, looks at Riggan who is passing by.
text: We follow Riggan toward the exit. Through the window we see him
text: leave the restaurant. Then we pan to a wooden wall, and this
dialog: wall takes us to...
scene_heading: 19 INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - LATER 19
text: ...the theater hallway. Riggan walks through the quiet corridor,
text: until he arrives at...
scene_heading: 20 INT. GREEN ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 20
text: ...the Green Room. Sam sits listlessly, drawing some lines
text: across a roll of toilet paper.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: What're you still doing here?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (Continues scribbling.)
dialog: Nothing. I'm-- Nothing. Your costumes are
dialog: hanging in your room.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Great...
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I got the coconut water you wanted. If you
dialog: want me to get--
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I'm not sure if I said thank you.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 48.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: All of it. You've been doing a good job.
dialog: And I've been...
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: So, I just wanted to say that--
text: (He stops abruptly.)
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What...?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: That smell.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't--
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Look at me.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What are you--
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Look at me.
text: She does. He examines her eyes, then immediately rises, scouring
dialog: the room.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Dad...
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (Continuing to search.)
dialog: You have to be shitting me... Where is it?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Could we not do this?
text: Riggan pulls a jar of peanut butter from the trash.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That is chunky peanut butter that happens,
dialog: by the way, to have Omega--
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 49.
text: Riggan pulls a stubbed joint out of the jar.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: This.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh. That's pot.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Alright, just relax.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Relax? What the hell are you doing?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Protecting myself from cataracts?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: You can't do this to me!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: To you?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: SHUT UP! You know what I'm talking about.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah. You're talking about you. What else
dialog: is new?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Don't try to--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What? Make it about me? I wouldn't dream of
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Listen to me. I'm trying to do something
dialog: that's important...
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: This is not important.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: It's important to me! Alright? Maybe not to
dialog: you, or your cynical playmates whose sole
dialog: ambition is to end up going viral and who,
dialog: by the way, will only be remembered as the
dialog: generation that finally stopped talking to
dialog: one another. But to me... To me... This is--
dialog: God. This is my career, this is my chance
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 50.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: to do some work that actually means
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Means something to who? You had a career
text: before the third comic book movie, before
dialog: people began to forget who was inside the
dialog: bird costume. You're doing a play based on
dialog: a book that was written 60 years ago, for
dialog: a thousand rich, old white people whose
dialog: only real concern is gonna be where they
dialog: go to have their cake and coffee when it's
dialog: over. Nobody gives a shit but you. And
dialog: let's face it, Dad, it's not for the sake
dialog: of art. It's because you just want to feel
dialog: relevant again. Well, there's a whole
dialog: world out there where people fight to be
dialog: relevant every day. And you act like it
dialog: doesn't even exist! Things are happening
dialog: in a place that you willfully ignore, a
dialog: place that has already forgotten you. I
dialog: mean who are you? You hate bloggers. You
dialog: make fun of twitter. You don't even have a
dialog: Facebook page. You're the one who doesn't
dialog: exist. You're doing this because you're
dialog: scared to death, like the rest of us, that
dialog: you don't matter. And you know what?
dialog: You're right. You don't. It's not
dialog: important. You're not important. Get used
dialog: to it.
text: Silence. Riggan seems devastated, and Sam can see that.
speaker_heading: Sam (CONT'D)
dialog: Dad...
text: She looks at him sympathetically, but not knowing what to
text: say... exits.
text: After a moment Riggan gets up and heads for the trash can. He
text: digs out the roach, grabs some matches and lights it. Music
text: begins to sound. He inhales deeply and holds the smoke for a
text: few seconds and finally exhales. He coughs, tosses away the
text: joint and heads out of the kitchen. We follow him...
scene_heading: 21 INT. HALLWAY - THEATRE - CONTINUOUS 21
text: ...as he slowly walks until he disappears into the darkness of
text: the corridor. We keep moving forward until we end up...
dialog: 10/29/14 / 51.
scene_heading: A21 INT. BACKSTAGE - THEATRE - EVENING A21
text: ...backstage. We are in the middle of the second preview. The
text: music continues, it belongs to the play.
text: Laura is by herself on stage performing the end of a scene. She
text: stands in the middle of a surrealistic forest set, at dusk.
text: There is fog, and trees. A strong, artificial wind blows
text: through Laura's hair. Desolate music.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (To the audience as soliloquy.)
dialog: In the days before Nick's depression really
text: started to eat away at him, he had no idea
dialog: I was pregnant. And I never intended on
dialog: telling him. I guess we make choices in
dialog: life, and we choose to live with them. Or
dialog: not. I didn't want that baby...
text: Three dancers on stage pass by in front of Laura. We follow
text: the dancers backstage where we find Mike and Lesley wearing
dialog: pajamas.
speaker_heading: LAURA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: ...Not because I didn't love Nick. And not
dialog: because I didn't love the-- The idea of
dialog: it. But because I just wasn't ready to
dialog: love myself. There's a certain distance to
text: it all now. A wistful distance.
text: Underscored by a gentle breeze and the
text: sound of the birds... laughing at the
dialog: whimsy of it all.
text: A stage hand helps Mike and Lesley into a double bed. The
text: camera slips under the covers with them and stays there.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (Whispering.)
dialog: Hey, Les...
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: (Whispering.)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I'm hard.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: No, you're not. It's just that sometimes
dialog: you don't consider other people's feelings.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: No. I'm hard. Feel.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 52.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Oh, you gotta be kidding.
text: The stage begins to revolve as we hear...
scene_heading: 22 INT. STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 22
text: ...music through the transition. It remains dark.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Let's really do this. Let's fuck.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Are you crazy? No.
text: Mike rolls on top of Lesley.
speaker_heading: LESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Cut it out...
text: Mike continues to maneuver himself.
speaker_heading: LESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm serious, Mike. Stop!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I'm Mel. Not Mike. Mel.
text: A knock on a door.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (O.S.)
dialog: Terri! Terri!
text: A furious Lesley tries to reposition herself under Mike.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Terri! I know you're in there!
text: The knocking gets louder.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Terri???
text: Mike, lost in his libido, has begun to have sex with Lesley.
text: The camera comes out from under the covers and pans to Riggan
text: who stumbles into what is now the Motel Room set. He wears a
text: mustache and a long wig, that makes him look like a wild man.
text: He holds a gun in his right hand. A neon "Motel" sign is
text: illuminated. A clever effect of falling rain is visible behind
text: the set, accompanied by the appropriate sound effect. Riggan
text: is wet because of the "rain".
text: Lesley uses Riggan's entrance to escape from Mike.

dialog: 10/29/14 / 53.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Ed!
text: Mike hops out of bed, unaware of the very noticeable erection
text: protruding underneath his pajama bottoms.
text: Some laughter from the audience.
speaker_heading: LESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing here?
text: Lesley doesn't understand the audience response, until she
text: notices the erection herself.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (To Lesley.)
dialog: Why? I need you to tell me why. I lived for
dialog: you. I worshipped you...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Listen Ed, I know this is hard but--
text: More laughter. Riggan is disturbed, but he continues...
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (to Mike)
dialog: Fuck you. Shut up. Fuck you.
text: He shoves Mike violently to the floor.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Eddie! Please!
text: Riggan points the gun at Mike's head.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: What's wrong with me? Why do I end up
dialog: having to beg people to love me?
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Ed. Eddie. Please... Give me the gun.
text: She begins to cry. Her performance is beautiful.
speaker_heading: LESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Just look at me. I was drowning. I
dialog: was not capable of-- You deserve to
dialog: be loved. You do.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I just wanted to be what you wanted.
dialog: (Beat.)
dialog: Now I spend every fucking minute praying to
dialog: be someone else. Someone I'm not. Anyone...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 54.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Put down the gun, Ed. She just doesn't love
dialog: you anymore.
text: The audience is silent.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (A sad smile.)
dialog: You don't, do you?
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: (With sympathy.)
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: And you never will...
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (A revelation.)
dialog: I don't exist. I'm not even here. I don't
dialog: exist. None of this matters.
text: Riggan points the gun at Lesley. Then at Mike. Finally, he puts
text: the gun to his own head and pulls the trigger. PUM! And with the
text: explosion, a fake blood mechanism splatters brains onto the
text: stage. Riggan drops to the floor.
text: A blackout. The audience applauds politely. The curtain falls.
text: We follow Riggan off stage and into...
scene_heading: 23 INT. BACKSTAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 23
text: ...the wings, where Annie immediately helps him remove the
text: bloody and wet wig with the propeller mechanism. Laura waits
text: next to them for their bows. Meanwhile, a stage hand crosses
text: behind them, and we follow him as he goes on stage to...
scene_heading: 24 INT. STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 24
text: ...reposition some scenery for the curtain call. The camera
text: carries us to the other side of the stage, where Mike and Lesley
text: are in a heated exchange...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Just, keep your voice down...
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: (Furious.)
dialog: You have to be shitting me. You can't get it
dialog: up in six months...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 55.
speaker_heading: LESLEY (CONT'D)
text: (She starts hitting him.)
dialog: ...and now you try to fuck me in front of
dialog: eight hundred strangers???
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What do you want from me? I have to feel it.
dialog: You know that. I told you that from the--
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Oh, fuck you...
text: Music begins and the curtain rises. The audience applauds as
text: Lesley and Mike stride onto the stage and take their bows,
text: smiles plastered on their faces.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: ...I was in the moment...
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: I told you to stop. You fucking animal.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: But... You were incredible.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: What is wrong with you?
text: Lesley starts back for the wings, and Mike follows her. In the
text: background we see Riggan and Laura enter from the other side to
dialog: take their bows.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Listen I'm sorry, alright, I--
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: I want your shit out of the apartment.
text: They go back on stage and join Riggan and Laura for the company
dialog: bow.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Can we--
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: No we can't. Maybe up here you're Mr. Truth,
dialog: Mike. But in the real world, where it counts,
dialog: you're a fraud. How's that for truth? You...
dialog: dick.
text: Lesley storms off, leaving Mike and a confused Riggan on stage.
text: Laura chases her off and straight into...
dialog: 10/29/14 / 56.
scene_heading: 25 INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 25
dialog: ...the hallway.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: He's an asshole.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: What did he do now?
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Oh, nothing. He just tried to fuck me in
text: front of a full house.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Oh, my God...
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Right?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: That's kind of hot.
text: She follows Lesley into...
scene_heading: 26 INT. LESLEY AND LAURA'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 26
text: ...the dressing room and closes the door. Lesley proceeds to
text: smash everything on her dressing table. Then she looks in the
text: mirror holding a hairbrush.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Why don't I have any self-respect?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: You're an actress, honey.
text: Lesley begins to cry. Laura hugs her.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: I'm pathetic. You know, I've dreamt of
dialog: being a Broadway actress since I was a
dialog: little kid. And now I'm here. And I'm not a
dialog: Broadway actress. I'm still just a little
dialog: kid. And I keep waiting for someone to tell
dialog: me I made it.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (Hiding how moved she is.)
dialog: Hey. You made it.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 57.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: I did?
speaker_heading: LAURA
text: Sadly, it was with Mike Shiner, on a fake
text: motel bed, in front of--
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: (A little laugh.)
dialog: Shut. Up.
text: Riggan steps into the doorway and sees Laura hugging Lesley.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Is she okay?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: She's gonna be fine.
text: Riggan enters gingerly and walks up to Lesley.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: None of this is your fault.
dialog: (Into her eyes.)
dialog: You're beautiful. And talented. And I'm
dialog: lucky to have you. Okay?
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Okay.
text: Riggan leaves the room. Laura leans on the makeup table.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: That was very sweet.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Yeah.
text: Laura is suddenly teary.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: What's wrong?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (Smiling.)
dialog: Nothing. Two years, he's never said
dialog: anything like that to me.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 58.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: (Into her eyes.)
dialog: Hey. You're smart. And beautiful. And
dialog: talented. And I'm lucky to have you. Okay?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: We're gross.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: We are.
text: Laura smiles and caresses Lesley's hand. They look at each
text: other. Then Laura leans forward, close to Lesley's face...
speaker_heading: LESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: (Nervous.)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Nothing.
text: Laura kisses Lesley tenderly on the lips. Lesley seems
text: confused. A few seconds of silence. Then...
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Do it again.
text: Laura kisses her again. A knock at the door. They separate.
text: Mike opens the door holding the prop gun.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (To Lesley.)
dialog: Can we talk about this like two--
text: Lesley hurls the hair brush at his head.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: FUCK YOU!!!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Okay, well, you're not ready.
text: Mike points the prop gun at her, pretends to fire and...
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: That was hot.
text: He exits the room. We follow him...
scene_heading: 27 INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 27
text: ...down the hallway up to Riggan's dressing room. Riggan sits
text: at his table, picking the brains out of his hair.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 59.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (Holding the gun.)
dialog: Your gun is ridiculous. It looks like a
text: plastic toy. And it still has the red plug
text: in the barrel.
dialog: (Shows the plug.)
dialog: You look like a seven year old when
dialog: you're holding it. I'm not threatened
dialog: by it at all.
text: He tosses the gun onto Riggan's table.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Have some self respect and get a new one.
text: (Takes a step then turns.)
dialog: That was a fun crowd, huh?
dialog: We follow Mike to...
scene_heading: 28 INT. STAIRS - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 28
text: ...the stairs. He climbs them as he lights a cigarette. He goes
text: through a metal door that takes him out onto...
scene_heading: 29 EXT. ROOFTOP - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 29
text: ...a rooftop. The Marquis' of the other theaters glowing with
text: the street lamps, a classic Broadway view.
text: Mike is surprised to find Sam sitting on the cornice of the
text: building, a good fifty feet above 45th street. He goes next to
text: her, looking down at the street.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I don't think it's high enough.
text: Sam turns to him, uncomfortable by his presence.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Me neither.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: So, what are you doing up here?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (Hesitant.)
dialog: Adrenaline. Just came out of rehab. Closest
dialog: I get to a drug.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You were in rehab?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 60.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (Distant.)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Cool.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It wasn't all Dr. Drew or anything, but
dialog: that dude from American Pie was there.
speaker_heading: A VOICE
dialog: (From the street below.)
dialog: Juuump!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (Calling down.)
dialog: Eat me!
speaker_heading: A VOICE
dialog: Okay. Jump on my face!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (To Mike.)
dialog: I love this city.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (Casually.)
dialog: Why do you act like a dick all the time? Do
dialog: you just do it to antagonize people?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Maybe...
text: Sam turns and faces Mike.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You really don't give a shit if people like
dialog: you or not...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (More comfortable.)
dialog: God, that's cool.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Is it...?
text: Mike leans on the railing, looking down at the street. For a
dialog: moment, he is somewhere else...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 61.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hey.
text: (Mike doesn't respond. She pushes
dialog: him.)
dialog: Hey...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Let's play a game.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: A game?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What are you, eight?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What are you, seventy-eight? Truth or
dialog: dare...?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You gotta be--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Truth or dare?
text: He looks at her, intrigued.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Truth.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: The first time we met, you made a comment about
dialog: my ass. Why'd you do it?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Because you have a great ass, and I noticed
dialog: it. So, I said it.
dialog: (A beat.)
dialog: Truth or dare?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Dare.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Really...
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 62.
text: A moment of tension.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (Looking at the street.)
text: There's a bald guy about to walk by down
text: there. Spit on his head.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You said dare.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Truth.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Too late.
text: She stares into Mike's eyes, knowing she's being tested. She
text: leans over the railing and spits down toward the street.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Happy?
speaker_heading: MAN (O.C.)
dialog: (From the street)
dialog: Fuck you!
text: Sam laughs. Mike smiles at her carefree laugh. It could be the
dialog: first time we've seen a genuine smile from him.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Truth or dare?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Truth.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You're boring.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Truth.
text: She stares him down.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (Nervous, pretending.)
dialog: Do you want to fool around with me?
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 63.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (Taken aback.)
dialog: Really? Why not?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That's a second question.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It's a second part.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I'd be afraid I couldn't get it up.
text: Impressed with his honesty.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That didn't seem to be a problem for you on
dialog: stage.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Nothing's a problem for me on stage.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I wanna ask another question...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You just asked--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: One more.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Go 'head.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: If you weren't afraid. What would you want
dialog: to do to me?
text: He carefully considers it, then moves his face close to hers.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I would want to pull the eyes out of your
dialog: head...
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: ...That's sweet...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: ...And stick them in my skull, and then
dialog: look out at this street and see it the way
dialog: I saw it when I was your age.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 64.
text: Mike turns and stares out at the street once more. Sam stares
text: at the mystery that is Mike.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: G'night, Mike.
text: She walks away and into the building, never looking back.
speaker_heading: A29 A29
text: Mike stares out into the night. We move to his POV. The street.
text: Night turns to day. Pedestrians begin to walk below.
speaker_heading: B29 B29
text: We crawl down the wall until we arrive at Riggan's dressing
text: room window. We push in to find...
scene_heading: 30 INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - DAY 30
text: ...Riggan siting with his feet on the window frame, staring at
text: a manila envelope in his hands that reads... "R, MALIBU
text: REFINANCE DOCS. SIGN AND SEND ASAP. J." Riggan sighs and props
text: the letter up against the mirror.
text: With a soft knock, Laura enters. She stands in the doorway with
text: an odd expression on her face.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: What now?
text: Laura lays the Arts section of the New York Times down in front
dialog: of Riggan.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Don't kill the messenger.
text: Riggan picks up the paper. His expression immediately changes.
text: Laura watches him sympathetically.
speaker_heading: LAURA (CONT'D)
dialog: He's an asshole.
text: Now we see the cover of the Arts section. There is a picture
text: of Mike lounging on a black sofa, his bare feet on a table as
text: he sips a glass of wine. The Title of the article reads...
text: "CARVING OUT HIS PLACE IN THEATER HISTORY. Shiner says Raymond
dialog: Carver is the reason he became an actor." Riggan involuntarily
text: squeezes the paper as he reads on, filling with rage.
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (V.O.)
dialog: He's fooling you.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 65.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (Confused.)
dialog: I didn't say anything.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Fuck. This is it?
text: (He passes a few pages.)
dialog: This can't be it.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Page twelve.
text: Riggan searches desperately for page twelve. When he gets
text: there, he finds a huge ad of the new Toyota Camry that almost
text: fills the entire page, and down in the left corner a tiny
dialog: press release with the title:
text: "From Birdman to Carver: An aging Action Hero Grasps for His
dialog: Youth."
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (Reading.)
dialog: "Riggan Thompson, better known as the face of
text: the Birdman films, tries not to lay an egg on
dialog: Broadway..."
dialog: (Flipping pages.)
dialog: Where's the rest of it?
speaker_heading: LAURA
text: There is no rest of it.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: They didn't use the photo I sent them.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: What photo?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: The one you liked. The one you said
dialog: I look like a young Jack Nicholson.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (She lights a candle.)
dialog: Don't worry about it. Someone'll be using
dialog: that to pick up dog shit tomorrow.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: How can you be so calm about this?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: What are my other choices?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 66.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Aren't you scared at all?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
text: About being humiliated out there.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: It won't be the first time I've been
text: humiliated.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I bet it won't.
text: Laura looks at him with fire in her eyes.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: You're an asshole.
text: She charges to the door and is about to leave when she turns
dialog: back to Riggan...
speaker_heading: LAURA (CONT'D)
dialog: By the way... I'm not pregnant. So there's
dialog: one thing you don't have to worry about.
text: She leaves, slamming the door behind her.
text: Riggan remains still. Mike seems to be smirking at him right
text: through the cover of the Arts section...
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (V.O.)
dialog: That pretentious, little, theater fuck is
dialog: stealing your thunder.
text: Riggan charges out of the room and into...
scene_heading: 31 INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 31
text: ...the hallway. He walks to Mike's dressing room, finds the
text: door half opened and enters...
scene_heading: 32 INT. MIKE'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 32
text: ...discovering Mike lying in a sun bed. His arm is sticking
text: out of it, holding on to a copy of Borges's 'Labyrinths'.
text: Riggan yanks the sun bed open. Mike is asleep, wearing tiny
text: sun goggles. Riggan slams the lid down on him.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 67.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What the fuck is going on!
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Get up!
speaker_heading: MIKE
text: Back away.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Get up.
text: Riggan slaps Mike on the arm.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Ow, fuck that hurts!
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: So, Carver is the reason you became an
dialog: actor?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: This is my play! I did the work. I raised the
dialog: money. I arrange the press.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: They called me for an interview. I said-- I
dialog: don't know, I said the first thing that
dialog: came to mind. Jesus, we got the cover of
dialog: the Arts section!
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: You said the first-- Fuck the Arts section.
dialog: The first thing that came to mind? Right.
dialog: Cause that's you. Mr. Natural. Mr. Fuck the
text: scene, just stare at my massive hard-on.
dialog: Because that's the truth of the moment.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You think it looked massive?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Shut up. Shut the fuck up. You don't get
dialog: hard on my stage unless I tell you to.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Your stage? This stage belonged to a lot of
dialog: great actor's, pal. But you are not one of
dialog: them.
text: Mike storms out of the room. Riggan follows him into...
dialog: 10/29/14 / 68.
scene_heading: 33 INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 33
text: ...the hallway. He slaps Mike on his sun burned back.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: So, you wrote your own lines?
text: He slaps him again.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Ow. Fuck. Yes I did.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: You changed a few words, and mumbled a
dialog: little, you self absorbed prick.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Look who's talking...
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Let me tell you something, you spiteful
dialog: nobody piece of shit.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Nobody? My hard-on has already fifty
dialog: thousand views on youtube.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
text: Fifty thousand views? A cat playing with
text: a dildo has more than that.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I don't care.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Yes you do.
dialog: (Beat.)
dialog: Everybody says: "Mike is so honest". (Smacks
dialog: him.) "So truthful". (Smacks him again.)
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (Like a child.)
dialog: Ouch. Fuuuuuck. Cut the shit!
text: Riggan corners Mike against the wall.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: You said in the interview that your father
dialog: was a drunk, like Carver. Is that true
dialog: Mike? Is it really true?
text: Riggan stares intensely into Mike's eyes. Mike looks away.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 69.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Because my father was. My father was a mean
dialog: fucking drunk. Beat the shit out of us. But
dialog: we were okay with the beatings. You know
dialog: why? Because at least when he was beating
dialog: us, he wasn't thinking about taking us out
dialog: to his tool shed...
text: Mike's expression changes.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: That sonofabitch would smile and say, "Do
dialog: you want to kneel down and unbuckle my
dialog: belt? Or do you want me to take it off and
dialog: use it?" I learned how to make myself numb.
dialog: But my sister-- (Holding back tears.) My
dialog: little sister...
text: Riggan can't go on. Mike is horrified.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Jesus, Riggan. I'm really sorry. I
dialog: didn't-- That's fucking horrible...
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (Crazy smile.)
dialog: Yeah. It's also not true. See? (Cracking
dialog: up.) I can pretend too, you little dick!
text: Riggan shoves Mike violently.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't fuck with me, Mike.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You're crazy...
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: You have no idea what I'm capable of. You
dialog: understand me?
text: Riggan pulls the paper out of his back pocket.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Working with Riggan Thomson is like
dialog: waltzing with a monkey?
text: He smacks Mike in the head with the paper and begins to jump in
text: front of him, ready to fight.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's go. Put your hands up.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 70.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (Tauntingly.)
dialog: Don't you want to go put on your tights and
dialog: your--
text: Riggan punches him on the face. Mike needs a few seconds to
text: understand what has just happened. Then they begin to wrestle
text: in the hallway. Mike breaks free from the headlock.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you gonna do? You gonna get rid of
dialog: me? Huh? What do you think my friend
dialog: Tabitha is going to write in the Times
dialog: after you get rid of me?
text: Riggan stares at Mike, paralyzed by the truth. Finally, he
text: turns and marches to his dressing room, and we follow him...
scene_heading: 34 INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 34
text: ...Riggan slams the door shut and paces in a rage. He glares at
text: a make-up box on the table and, points his finger at it, and
text: sends it flying across the room.
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (V.O.)
dialog: You are lame, Riggan. Rolling around
dialog: with that third rate actor in an 800
dialog: seat shithole like this.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (Whispering.)
text: Breathing in, I feel my rage. Breathing
text: out, I embrace my mental formations.
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (V.O.)
dialog: You're going to let that poncey theater
dialog: fuck threaten you?
text: Riggan continues breathing deeply with his eyes tightly closed.
text: He smiles a tiny artificial smile.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (Whispering.)
text: Breathing in, I am calm. Breathing out,
dialog: I ignore my mental formations. This is a
dialog: mental formation. This is a mental form--
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (V.O.)
dialog: Stop that shit. I am not a mental
dialog: formation. I am "you", asshole.

speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (Whispering.)
dialog: Leave me alone.
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (V.O.)
dialog: You were a movie star, remember?
dialog: Pretentious, but happy...
text: Riggan opens his eyes, slowly. A sad expression on his face.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I was not happy.
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN
dialog: ...Ignorant but charming. Now you are a
text: tiny bitter cocksucker.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Shut up! Stop whining! I was miserable!
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (V.O.)
dialog: Yeah. But fake miserable. Hollywood
dialog: miserable.
text: Riggan points his fingers at a lamp and sends it flying.
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (V.O.)
dialog: What are you trying to prove? Huh? That
dialog: you're an artist? You're not.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Fuck you!
text: Riggan points his fingers at a chair and sends it flying.
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (V.O.)
dialog: Fuck you, coward! And fuck those critics
dialog: that made you quit. Our franchise
dialog: grossed billions worldwi--
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: And billions of flies eat shit everyday!
dialog: So what? Does that make it good? (Beat.)
dialog: And I don't know if you've noticed, but
dialog: that was 1992! Look at me! (He takes off
dialog: his shirt.) This is what's left!
text: (Grabbing his neck.) This! (Grabbing his
dialog: chest.) This! (Totally exploding.) I'm
dialog: fucking disappearing! I'm the answer to a
dialog: fucking trivial pursuit question.
text: Riggan sits down, exhausted.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 72.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: What part of that don't you get? You're
dialog: fucking dead.
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (V.O.)
dialog: We are not dead. We're--
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Stop saying 'we'! There is no 'we'. I am
dialog: not you. I'm Riggan fucking Thomson.
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (V.O.)
dialog: No. You're Birdman. Because without me, all
dialog: that's left is "you". A sad, selfish,
dialog: mediocre actor, grasping--
text: Riggan points his finger and sends the poster flying, spearing
text: it on a coat rack, piercing Birdman right through the heart.
text: Finally, silence. Until...
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (V.O.)
dialog: What the hell did you do that for? I liked
dialog: that poster.
text: A confused Riggan looks over to the wall, where the lamp on the
text: floor is creating a shadow of his figure. Only in the shadow, it
text: appears as if Riggan is wearing the Birdman costume. Stunned,
text: Riggan slowly lifts one arm and in the shadow we see a wing.
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (V.O.)
dialog: It's always 'we' brother.
text: The television turns on by itself, playing an episode of the
text: original Birdman cartoon. Riggan points his fingers at the tv
text: and sends it hurling at the shadow. Then he proceeds to
text: destroy everything in his room with his telekinetic powers.
text: We slowly pan to see that, behind Riggan, Jake stands on the
text: other side of the half-opened door. We push in on Jake,
text: watching in shock. The camera turns and becomes Jake's POV...
scene_heading: 35 INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 35
text: ...and now, from his view, we see Riggan yelling at the shadow.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Fuck you! Fuck you!
text: He picks up a chair and throws it down. He then picks up the
text: newspaper from the floor and tossing it all around. And now we
text: understand that he is not using telepathy. He has been using
text: only his hands. Completely mad. As Riggan turns to pick up
text: something else, he spots Jake on the other side of the door. He
text: immediately calms himself and walks over.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 73.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: What's up?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Um... Well. Two hours to curtain. Why don't
dialog: you rest a little bit?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Yeah. Sure.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Last preview, buddy. We're almost there.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: How ya doin?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Good. Great.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Good. That's good.
dialog: (A beat.)
dialog: The, uh, money came through. I just have to
dialog: transfer it to the account.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Oh, that's terrific...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Okay. Well, I'm gonna do that.
text: (He stares at Riggan who
text: seems about to collapse.)
dialog: You know I'm proud of you, right? This took
dialog: balls. And you did it.
text: Riggan nods. An exhausted sadness in his eyes.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I can't do this anymore, Jake.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I think I'm gonna cancel the
dialog: preview. I'm exhausted.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: It's a joke, right? (He forces a
dialog: laugh.) Good one, Riggan.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 74.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I'm starting to believe that this is not
dialog: for me. The applause is... lukewarm. I
dialog: think they're laughing at me.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What are you--? Listen. There's a three
dialog: block line of people waiting to see you.
text: We are sold out. It's a full house.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yes. And the French embassador is
dialog: coming. And the prince of Saudi Arabia,
dialog: with one of his wives. And... I wasn't
dialog: going to tell you this, but-- Martin
dialog: Scorsese. He's casting for his new
dialog: film. But don't tell anyone, okay? This
dialog: is between you and me.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Okay. I'll be ready.
text: Riggan smiles. He has forgotten about his existential doubts.
text: A worried Jake closes the door. He walks a few steps and
text: finds Laura and Lesley. They've been listening to his
text: conversation with Riggan.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: How is he?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: He'll be okay.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Poor creature.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Is it true? Scorsese?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yes. And the new Pope too.
dialog: (Beat.)
text: They both understand.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: You're an asshole, Jake.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I'm the one keeping this boat afloat.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 75.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: So there is no line of people out there?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I don't know. Now go and get ready.
dialog: That's your job.
text: (He begins to walk.)
dialog: I'll better invest in a taco truck, or
text: a strip joint near the airport.
text: Laura leaves. We follow Lesley up to Riggan's dressing room.
text: She knocks on the door. Nothing. Silence. She half-opens the
text: door and, from behind her, we see Riggan examining his right
text: hand. He has blood falling from the palm to the wrist.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (Smiles.)
dialog: Yeah, I-- This is nothing. Shaving.
text: He cleans his hand against his trousers.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: I just want to say I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: I knew what Mike was capable of,
dialog: and I brought him in, anyway.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: You did good.
text: Lesley nods. A beat.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Tomorrow's my first opening night
dialog: on Broadway.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Mine too.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: And I want you to know that,
dialog: whatever happens, I'll always be
dialog: grateful to you for that.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Me too. It's going to be great. Full
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 76.
text: She looks at him with tender eyes. Then we follow her along
text: the corridor until she passes by Mike's dressing room. Mike
text: half-opens the door and sees Lesley walking by. He has a
text: black eye. He waits for Lesley to be completely gone, and
text: then he comes out of his dressing room and we follow him up
dialog: the stairs to...
scene_heading: 38 EXT. ROOFTOP - THEATER - DUSK 38
text: ...the rooftop. He finds Sam standing on the cornice, looking
text: at the street.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: For fuck's sake, just jump already.
text: Sam stares out, a smile creeping over her face.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: How did you know I'd be up here?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I didn't. I was just hoping.
text: Silence. Mike walks up next to her and stares out as well.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Where's Lesley?
speaker_heading: MIKE
text: Moving on.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Smart girl...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I appreciate that.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Ready for the last preview?
dialog: (Noticing his black eye.)
dialog: Who did that to you?
text: Mike smiles. No answer.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Could have been anybody, I guess.
dialog: (After a beat.)
dialog: I'm sort of hoping it was Lesley.
text: He barely says no, smiling, and lights a cigarette. She
dialog: understands.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 77.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, don't tell me...
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What's the worst thing he ever did to
dialog: you?
text: Sam is surprised by the question. She thinks for a moment.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He was never around, so...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That was--?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No. That was-- Who gives a shit. It
dialog: was the way he tried to make up for
dialog: it by constantly trying to convince
dialog: me I was special. (A beat.) What
dialog: about you?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: My dad?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: He pretended I was his son.
text: She stares him down. Silence.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: So, what happens now?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I have no idea...
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah...
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: He was right, though.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: About your being special. You're hanging
dialog: around here trying to make yourself
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 78.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: invisible behind that fragile little fuck
dialog: up routine. But you can't. You're
dialog: anything but invisible. You're big. And
dialog: you're sort of this really great mess, a
text: candle burning at both ends, and no
dialog: amount of booze or pills is gonna hide
dialog: that.
text: Sam tosses Mike's cigarette over the balcony, and kisses him.
text: He leans into the kiss.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: (From below.)
dialog: Jesus Fuck!
text: She suddenly pulls away.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It's a good thing you're an actor and not a
dialog: writer cause that little speech was just
dialog: like, Oprah... Hallmark... R. Kelly bad.
text: She kisses him lightly one more time and then walks away. When
text: she gets to the door she stops and leans on the frame.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Truth or dare?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Truth.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Truth.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No. Truth or dare?
text: The slightest smile as she exits through the door, and after a
text: short pause, Mike follows...
scene_heading: 39 INT. HALLWAYS - THEATRE - CONTINUOUS 39
text: ...along a darkened hallway. They reach a tiny wooden door and
text: Sam leads the way through it.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Do you have any idea where you're going?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Absolutely not.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 79.
text: She continues on until she gets to...
scene_heading: 40 INT. ABOVE STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 40
text: ...the "grid" above stage where the lights are located. We can
text: see, below us, the empty seats of the auditorium and the
text: kitchen set.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What now...?
text: Mike reaches up to kiss her. She stops him.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: How do you do it?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: How do you go out there and pretend to be
dialog: someone else in front of all those people?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I don't pretend. Not out there. Just about
dialog: every place else, but never out there.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Good to know.
text: They stare at one another...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What are we doing here?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I mean, what are we doing here?
text: She moves in.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Adrenaline...
text: They kiss. The camera begins to drift down toward the stage...
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (O.S.)
dialog: Fucking teenager.
text: As the camera continues down from the grid, we discover an
text: auditorium full of people staring at the actors on stage.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 80.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (O.S) (CONT'D)
dialog: By the time I got to the hospital, the
text: kid was dead. He was off in a corner
text: laid out on a gurney. We took the old
dialog: couple up to the O.R.. They were a
dialog: mess. We worked like hell on them for
dialog: most of the night...
text: We pan along the auditorium back to the stage to find Riggan,
text: Mike, Lesley and Laura in the kitchen.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: When we were done, we wrapped them in
dialog: full body casts. The husband was
dialog: depressed. Even when I told him his
dialog: wife was gonna pull through, he was
dialog: still depressed. So, I got up to his
dialog: mouth hole and asked him, and he told
dialog: me it was because he couldn't see her
dialog: through the eye holes. Can you imagine?
dialog: I'm telling you, the man's heart was
dialog: breaking because he couldn't turn his
dialog: goddamn head and see his goddamn wife.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: (In genuine tears.)
dialog: That's terrible. (Beat.) Perfect.
dialog: And terrible.
text: She is crushed. Laura holds Lesley, trying to control her own
dialog: emotion.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (Taking this in.)
dialog: Yeah. So I guess what we have to
dialog: ask ourselves is... What do we talk
dialog: about when we talk about love?
text: The lights go to a blackout and the audience applauds as some
text: scene change music plays. As we follow Riggan off stage, the
text: lights are turned on again, but now they have an orange mood.
text: Lesley is the only one on stage, doing a monologue.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Mel and I have been together five
dialog: years, been married for four. But
dialog: it was Ed who taught me something
dialog: no one else could... He taught me
dialog: what it felt like to really feel
dialog: loved. And the terrible thing is
dialog: that if something happened to Mel
dialog: or myself, if something happened to
dialog: either one of us tomorrow, I think
dialog: the other one would grieve for a
dialog: while, you know, but then would go
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 81.
speaker_heading: LESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: out and love again, have someone
dialog: else soon enough. All this-- All of
dialog: this love we're talking about... it
dialog: would just be a memory. Maybe not
dialog: even a memory. Am I wrong? I mean,
dialog: I don't know anything. And I'm the
dialog: first one to admit it.
text: A Dresser waits in the wings to help Riggan with his change.
speaker_heading: DRESSER
dialog: That was amazing!
text: Riggan looks proud. Things are finally going well. He undresses
text: to his underwear and puts on a robe and his moccasins, as the
text: stage begins to revolve. Laura, in costume, walks up beside
text: him. Over the following dialogue, the kitchen gives way to the
dialog: extravagant garden set we saw before.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (A bit distant.)
dialog: It's actually going well.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Yeah. (A beat.) Hey. I think we have to
dialog: talk.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (Sad smile.)
dialog: No. We don't.
text: Riggan nods.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Right. (Beat.) We will eventually,
dialog: though, `cause that's the only way I get
dialog: to say I'm sorry. I really am.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: We could've made good parents.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Horrible. We would've been just--
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Awful. Would have raised, like...
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: ...a serial killer...
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: ...or Justin Bieber.
text: (She smiles at him.)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 82.
speaker_heading: LAURA (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm not really the housewife type anyway. I
dialog: thought I could be a mom. My body seems to
dialog: disagree.
text: The lights come up and Laura walks onto the stage.
speaker_heading: LAURA (CONT'D)
dialog: (Back to him.)
dialog: You were right. This was fun.
text: Riggan watches her go, but something else grabs his attention.
text: We pan across the stage to see Sam and Mike on the other side.
text: They talk and laugh. Sam kisses Mike softly. Mike playfully
text: grabs her ass.
text: We pan back to Riggan. His expression morphs from broken-
text: hearted to rage. He marches over to a stage hand.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: You have a cigarette?
text: The stage hand holds out a pack, Riggan takes one.
speaker_heading: STAGE HAND
dialog: You need a light?
text: Riggan snatches the lighter and storms out through the hallway,
text: and out the back door of the theater to...
scene_heading: 41 EXT. AN ALLEY WAY - OUTSIDE THE THEATER - CONTINUOUS 41
text: ...the alley. Down at the end, we can see the tourists making
text: their way about the streets. Riggan lights the cigarette and
text: leans back against the stage door trying to calm himself.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
text: Breathing in, I calm myself. Breathing out,
dialog: I ease myself.
text: But this is New York City. A fluorescent light buzzes above his
text: head. Taxis honk their horns. The sound of pedestrians yelling
text: at one another. All fueling his agitation.
text: Riggan checks his watch. He pulls one last drag from the
text: cigarette before he tosses it, and turns to head back in, only
text: to realize the door has locked. He tries to pull it open to no
text: avail. He begins to knock loudly on the door. There is no
text: response. He knocks louder. Nothing.
text: He is turning to walk away when he realizes that his robe is
text: caught in the door. He checks his watch again and now is
text: beginning to panic. He tries to tear at the robe but the terry
text: cloth is too strong for him to rip. Frantically, he looks around
text: for an answer. No answer. No time. He pulls the robe off of him
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 83.
text: and, wearing only his underwear and moccasins, he charges down
dialog: the alley way toward...
scene_heading: 42 EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS 42
text: ...the street. Now, rushing down the block in his underwear. A
text: tourist spots him.
speaker_heading: TOURIST
dialog: Hey, aren't you...?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I'm sorry. I can't really--
speaker_heading: TOURIST
dialog: Riggan Thompson! Holy Shit! Let me get an
dialog: autograph.
text: Riggan marches on as a few more people begin to notice. The
text: Tourist runs in front of him, forcing him to stop.
speaker_heading: TOURIST (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, man. Don't be a dick. Let me have
text: an autograph.
text: The man produces a pen and a magazine from his pocket. More
text: people begin to gather...
scene_heading: MAN ON STREET
dialog: Birdman!
text: Seeing no other way out, Riggan signs the autograph.
speaker_heading: TOURIST
dialog: Dude! You fuckin' rock!
text: Directly in front of him stand a lady and her two kids.
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: Can we take one picture?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Are you kidding me?
speaker_heading: KID #1
dialog: Why is he naked?
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: One picture...
speaker_heading: KID #2
text: I can see his weenie.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 84.
text: Riggan tries to get past them, but a crowd has formed. A swarm
text: of cell phones begin to glow like fireflies.
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: (To her kids.)
dialog: Get next to him!
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Give me a fucking break, lady.
text: The kids run up next to him. Even more people crowding around.
text: Riggan puts up his middle finger, just as the Lady takes the
text: shot. He shoves the kids aside and moves on.
speaker_heading: WOMAN ON STREET
text: He looks so old in person.
scene_heading: MAN ON STREET
dialog: (From across the street.)
dialog: You suck!
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Fuck you!
text: Riggan pushes through the crowd to get to the lobby. The people
text: begin to chant. Dozens of cell phones recording him.
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: Bird-man! Bird-man! Bird-man!
text: Riggan pushes his way through to the lobby doors...
scene_heading: 43 INT. LOBBY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 43
text: ...to be stopped by the vision of Ralph in a wheelchair. His
text: head wrapped in a bandage. A man in a suit next to him.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Jesus Christ! What're you doing here?
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Waiting for Jake. This is Mr. Roth, my
dialog: attorney.
text: Riggan continues walking toward the auditorium. Ralph and Mr.
text: Roth follow him.
speaker_heading: MR. ROTH
dialog: We're pursuing financial remuneration for the
dialog: injuries Mr. Pinkus suffered while rehearsing
dialog: your--
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I have a play to do.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 85.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: I'm going to ruin you!
text: Riggan storms toward the auditorium, but is stopped by an old
dialog: Usher.
speaker_heading: OLD USHER
dialog: I'm sorry sir, you're going to have--
text: Riggan shoves the old lady aside and enters...
scene_heading: 44 INT. AUDITORIUM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 44
text: ...the theater. Riggan stands in the back among the audience.
text: He sees the "rain" falling on the stage. The "Motel" sign is
text: lit. Mike and Lesley are in bed, for the motel scene, waiting
text: for the knock on the door. With nothing else to do, Riggan
text: yells his line from the back of the auditorium...
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Knock knock knock! Terri! Terri!
text: The audience turns to see Riggan standing in his underwear.
text: They begin to murmur and laugh and point at him.
text: Riggan marches down the aisle. He looks haggard and covered
text: with perspiration.
text: Lesley and Mike, confused, come out of bed.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Ed! What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Why? I need you to tell me why. I lived for
dialog: you-- I worshipped you...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Listen Ed, I know this is hard but--
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Fuck you. Shut up. Fuck you.
text: Giggles from the audience. Riggan turns threateningly and points
text: to an audience member on the aisle who is giggling at him.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Shut up!
text: The guy stops smiling. The audience goes silent. Riggan arrives
text: at the apron of the stage. Annie from the wings slides the gun
text: towards him. Riggan grabs it and points it at Mike.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 86.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Eddie! Please!
text: Riggan climbs onto the stage. Exhausted. He goes to Mike and,
text: with a last effort, pushes him lamely.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: What's wrong with me? Why do I end
dialog: up having to beg people to love me?
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Ed. Eddie. Please... Give me the gun.
text: We pan to the wings where Jake is staring in disbelief. His
text: cellphone begins to vibrate, and he answers.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yeah. (A beat.) What?... No no no no no no
dialog: no. Wait there. I'm coming out in--
text: He walks toward the hallway and we follow him...
scene_heading: 45 INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 45
text: ...through the corridor.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: No. Wait. Wait for me. I'll be there in a
dialog: second. (Beat.) What is that, a threat?
dialog: (Beat.) What wheelchair? (Beat.) Wait.
dialog: Don't hang up. Mr. Roth, we can discuss--
dialog: Hello?... Hello?...
text: He goes out one of the exits and we are left with the silence of
text: the empty hallway. After a few seconds, the sound of the gunshot
text: from the scene echoes through the theater. The audience
text: applauds. The camera starts to move forward. A few seconds later
text: Riggan takes over the POV with his bloody long wig and the fake
dialog: gun. We follow up to...
scene_heading: 46 INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 46
text: ...his dressing room. He puts on a robe. He walks to his
text: refrigerator without acknowledging Sam who is sitting on the
text: couch, scribbling her dashes on the toilet paper once again.
text: Riggan takes out a plastic container of bologna and a jar of
text: mustard. He sits in front of his dressing table, peels open the
text: bologna and opens the jar of mustard. Slice by slice, he dips
text: the bologna in the mustard and shoves it into his mouth.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Dad...?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 87.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN

dialog: Hey. How ya doin'?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't know. You seem--
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (Eating.)
dialog: I'm good. This is good.
dialog: (Holding out a piece.)
dialog: You want some?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm good.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Great. Great.
text: He continues to eat. She tries to fill the odd silence.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: So. Opening night, tomorrow.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That's exciting, huh?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Yeah. Well... I don't know. The previews
dialog: have been a train wreck. We haven't been
dialog: able to get through a performance
text: without a raging fire... or a raging
dialog: hard-on. I'm not really sleeping, you
dialog: know, at all. And I'm pretty much broke.
dialog: Oh, and also, this play feels like a
dialog: miniature, deformed version of myself
dialog: that keeps following me around, hitting
text: me in the balls with a tiny hammer.
dialog: (Beat.)
dialog: Sorry, what was your question?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (Looking through phone.)
dialog: Never mind... Tonight wasn't bad. It was
dialog: weird. But that's sort of cool. People
dialog: seemed to like it.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 88.
text: Silence. Riggan notices the toilet paper.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: What are you doing? Some homework?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No. I don't-- When I was in rehab, they
dialog: made us do this.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Really...
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah. These dashes, represent the six
dialog: billion years the planet has existed.
dialog: Each dash represents 100 years.
text: She unravels the roll and we see that there are thousands of
text: black marks running along the toilet paper. She takes the last
text: two panels and tears them off.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: And this... (Hands them to him.) ...is
dialog: supposed to represent the entire time us
dialog: humans have been here. One hundred and
dialog: fifty thousand years. That's it.
dialog: (Beat.)
dialog: I guess they were trying to remind us
dialog: that that's what all our egos and self-
dialog: obsession are worth.
text: Riggan stares at the paper, and then at Sam.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (Casually.)
dialog: I was a shitty father, wasn't I?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No. You were a-- (She stops herself.)
dialog: You were fine.
text: He stops chewing and stares out.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Fine... You're right. I am just
dialog: "fine". Adorably mediocre.
text: He smiles to her sadly, and then he wipes the mustard from his
text: face with the piece of toilet paper.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Dad!
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 89.
text: Sam looks at the ruined toilet paper in his hands.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh... Shit. I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (Smiling.)
dialog: It's okay. You just destroyed the entire
dialog: human race in one blow.
text: Riggan looks at her with the saddest of expressions.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Dad. (She hesitates.) Do you know
dialog: you're becoming a trending topic?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Really? What does that mean?
text: Sam searches for something on her iPhone and then hands it to
text: Riggan. Riggan looks at the phone and sees a hand-held video of
text: himself in the streets in his underwear.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: 350,000 views in less than an hour.
dialog: Believe it or not, this is power.
text: Riggan looks at more footage, seemingly confused. After a
text: moment, the phone vibrates and the video is interrupted by a
text: text message, which reads "Truth or Dare?"
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: It's for you.
text: She grabs the phone and looks at the screen. Then at her
text: father. Riggan is staring at her. She looks down.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Go ahead...
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (Hesitant.)
dialog: Are you...?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Go.
text: A sympathetic smile. An understanding. Sam exits.
text: Riggan stares into the mirror absently. His eyes locked on
text: his reflection trying to find himself in the image. Then he
text: spots a vase with dying roses, the same roses he flung to the
dialog: ground previously.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 90.
text: He gets up and goes into the bathroom. He pulls off the long
text: wig and the mustache. He washes his face. Then he opens a
text: small bottle and uses the liquid to scrub his goatee. The
text: dark dye begins to run out, leaving only white hair. For the
text: first time we see that Riggan has a white beard.
text: He puts on new clothes and comes out of the bathroom. He grabs
text: a beige raincoat and heads out of the dressing room and
dialog: into...
scene_heading: 47 INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 47
text: ...the hallway. As he passes by Mike's door he can hear Sam and
text: Mike. They're trying to be as quiet as possible, but we can hear
text: them flirting and laughing.
text: He pauses for a moment but continues on. After a few seconds,
text: his phone vibrates. He looks at it. A text from Jake reads:
text: "Have you seen this??? Awesome!!!" He clicks the attachment and
text: sees the, now infamous, video of his underwear escapade in the
text: street. We zoom in until the image fills the screen, when we
text: finally pull away, we discover that...
scene_heading: 48 INT. RUM HOUSE - LATER 48
text: ...Riggan's video is being played now in a television in the
text: bar. We see the MTV logo on the bottom of the screen and a video
text: caption that reads: "Birdman goes viral, 930.000 views and
text: counting". The camera pans to find Riggan sitting at the bar,
text: drunk. He is one of the few customers. He polishes off his
dialog: drink.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Let me have another one.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: You got it.
text: The bartender pours another whiskey for Riggan. A waiter steps
text: up to the bar. The bartender points to a martini.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER (CONT'D)
dialog: (To the waiter.)
dialog: That's going over to Ms. Dickinson.
text: Riggan's head tilts at the mention of the name. He looks over to
text: see Tabitha sitting at a table, scratching in her notebook.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (Hands the waiter a bill.)
dialog: I got it. She's a friend of mine.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 91.
text: The waiter pockets the money and gives Riggan the drink. He
text: walks it over to Tabitha and places it down in front of her. Not
text: looking up, she pulls the drink closer and takes a sip.
text: Riggan sits down across from her. She looks up and immediately
text: recognizes him. He takes out the Carver cocktail napkin and
text: pushes it in front of her. She looks at him, and then down to
text: the napkin. She reads it in silence.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (Re: The napkin.)
dialog: That was twenty years before I put on that
dialog: damned costume.
text: A pause. Then she pushes the napkin back toward him.
speaker_heading: TABITHA
dialog: I don't care.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I'm just saying, when you come tomorrow
dialog: night, I want you--
speaker_heading: TABITHA
dialog: It doesn't matter.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: What are you--
speaker_heading: TABITHA
dialog: I'm going to destroy your play.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: You haven't even seen it. I don't-- Did I
dialog: do something to offend you?
speaker_heading: TABITHA
dialog: As a matter of fact you did. You took up
dialog: space in a theater which otherwise might
dialog: have been used on something worthwhile.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: But you don't even know if it's--
speaker_heading: TABITHA
dialog: That's true. I haven't read a word of it,
dialog: or even seen a preview, but after the
dialog: opening tomorrow I'm going to turn in the
dialog: worst review anybody has ever read. And I'm
dialog: going to close your play. Would you like to
dialog: know why? Because I hate you. And everyone
dialog: you represent. Entitled. Spoiled. Selfish.
text: Children. Blissfully untrained, unversed
text: and unprepared to even attempt real art.
text: Handing each other awards for cartoons and
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 92.
speaker_heading: TABITHA (CONT'D)
dialog: pornography. Measuring your worth in
dialog: weekends. Well, this is the theater, and
dialog: you don't get to come in here and pretend
dialog: you can write, direct and act in your own
dialog: propaganda piece without going through me
dialog: first. So, break a leg.
text: Tabitha goes back to her writing. Riggan sits for a moment.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: What has to happen in someone's life,
dialog: for them to end up becoming a critic?
text: She looks up at him.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Whatcha writin'? You reviewin' a play? Was
dialog: it good? Bad? Did you even see it? Lemme
dialog: read.
text: He snatches the notebook from her.
speaker_heading: TABITHA
dialog: I will call the police.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: No you won't. Let's read your review!
text: (He scans the notebook.)
text: "Callow". A label. "Lackluster". Label.
dialog: "Marginalia". Sounds like you need
dialog: penicillin to clear that up. None the
dialog: less... label.
dialog: (Looks to Tabitha.)
dialog: All labels. You're a lazy fucker
dialog: aren't you?
dialog: (Looks one last time at
dialog: the notebook.)
dialog: Epistemological vertigo?
text: Tabitha wants to reach for the notebook, but her pride won't
text: let her. Riggan takes a flower from a vase at the center of the
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You know what this is? You don't, do
dialog: you? You can't even see it if you don't
dialog: label it. You mistake those sounds in
dialog: your head for true knowledge.
speaker_heading: TABITHA
dialog: Are you finished?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (Wrinkling one of the pages.)
dialog: Nothin' about intention, structure,
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 93.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: technique. Just crappy opinions backed
dialog: up by crappy comparisons. You're
dialog: incapable of writing more than a couple
dialog: of paragraphs, and you risk nothing of
dialog: yourself.
text: (He tears out the page and tosses
dialog: the notebook.)
dialog: Well, I'm an actor and this play has
dialog: cost me everything. So you can take
dialog: your cowardly, malicious, shittily
dialog: written reviews and shove them up
dialog: your... (Showing her the wrinkled
text: page.) ...wrinkly, tight ass.
text: Riggan wears a proud smile. And suddenly, Tabitha begins to
text: smile with him.
speaker_heading: TABITHA
dialog: You think you're an actor?
dialog: (Calls to the waiter.)
dialog: Eddie!
text: Eddie the waiter approaches the table.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Yeah, Mrs. Dickinson?
speaker_heading: TABITHA
dialog: Give us some Shakespeare.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: No problem. Got anything in mind?
text: Tabitha looks over at Riggan picking the perfect verse.
speaker_heading: TABITHA
dialog: The Scottish Play. Act five...
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,
dialog: Creeps in this petty pace from day to
dialog: day, To the last syllable of recorded
dialog: time; And all our yesterdays have lighted
dialog: fools. The way to dusty death...
text: He is brilliant. The monologue is perfectly played and powerful.
text: Riggan being mercilessly reminded of his mediocrity... by Eddie
dialog: the waiter.
speaker_heading: WAITER (CONT'D)
dialog: ...Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a
dialog: walking shadow, a poor player, That
text: struts and frets his hour upon the
text: stage, And then is heard no more. It is
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 94.
speaker_heading: WAITER (CONT'D)
text: a tale told by an idiot, full of sound
dialog: and fury... Signifying nothing.
text: A few drunks clap at the beautiful performance. Then, a powerful
text: silence rings out for a moment, until...
speaker_heading: TABITHA
dialog: Thank you, Eddie.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: You got it.
speaker_heading: TABITHA
dialog: (To Riggan. A derisive laugh.)
dialog: You're no actor. You're a celebrity.
dialog: Let's be clear on that.
text: Tabitha rises from her seat and grabs her things.
speaker_heading: TABITHA (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm going to kill your play.
text: She walks away. Riggan sits numb. After a moment, he reaches
text: over and gulps down Tabitha's entire martini, gin pouring out
text: the sides of his mouth. Unaware, he slams the empty martini
text: glass on top of the Carver napkin and gets up. We follow him
dialog: out onto...
scene_heading: 49 EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS 49
text: ...the street, where he walks through the theater district.
text: Tired. Drunk. Empty. Neon lights all around him. A crazy, old
text: homeless man passes by in the opposite direction shouting
text: furiously. Riggan keeps walking until he arrives at a bench,
text: with a tree behind. Everything is quiet. Riggan sits on the
text: bench, lost. We begin to tilt up, slowly, toward a tall tree.
text: We move closer into the branches and the green leaves.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: A49 A49
text: Night turns into day. The sounds of the city disappear and
text: birds begin to sing. The branches now caressed by golden shafts
text: of morning sun. Finally, we tilt down slowly and find...
scene_heading: 50 EXT. STREET - DAY. 50
text: ...Riggan still sleeping on the bench. He looks like a bum. His
text: raincoat is dirty and wet.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 95.
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (V.O.)
dialog: God. You look like shit, brother. You
dialog: get that mongoloid look when you're hung
dialog: over, don't you?
text: Riggan opens an eye. He scratches his hair.
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (V.O.)
dialog: Let's go. Get up. It's a beautiful day.
text: Riggan sits up slowly. He is really hung over.
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (V.O.)
dialog: Stand up! Forget about the times. Everyone
dialog: else has. So you're not a great actor...
dialog: Who cares?!! You're much more than that.
dialog: Fuck! You tower over all these theater
dialog: douchebags. You're a movie star! A Global
dialog: force! Don't you get it?
text: Riggan stands up and begins to stumble forward. We pan around
text: to find Birdman (a stronger Riggan wearing a cool Birdman
text: outfit), following behind him.
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN
dialog: You spent your whole life building a
dialog: reputation and a bank account, and now
dialog: they're both blown. So what? Fuck it. We
dialog: make a come back. Something huge. Take what
dialog: belongs to us. Take back the spotlight.
dialog: Magazine covers and billboards. Happy meals
dialog: with Birdman dolls. Remember that? That's
dialog: who you are. That's who we are!
text: Riggan just marches on. People and cars pass by, but nobody
text: notices Birdman. Riggan tries to ignore him.
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: C'mon, buddy. Tell me we're going back
dialog: to the big leagues. Let's do this.
dialog: Shave off that pathetic goatee, and put
dialog: the mask back on! Batman my balls.
dialog: We'll start a new franchise. Birdman:
dialog: Phoenix Rising. Trust me! A billion
dialog: world wide. Swear to God.
speaker_heading: A50 A50
text: Riggan keeps walking. Birdman, insistent, chases, until
text: suddenly he begins to flutter off the ground.
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN
dialog: Do you hear me? You can do anything! You're
dialog: an icon!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 96.
text: Desperate, Birdman flies a bit higher around him.
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You're bigger than life. You save people
dialog: from their boring, miserable lives...
text: The camera pans to the street in front of them. People carry
text: out their everyday routines. There is a deli, a souvenir shop,
dialog: a small bank...
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: ...You make them jump, laugh, cry,
dialog: shit their pants... All you have to do
dialog: is snap your fingers and...
speaker_heading: B50 B50
text: Riggan snaps his fingers, once, twice, and the bank suddenly
text: explodes. The sound is so loud that it seems to belong to
text: another movie. The earth shakes. People run. Dust all over.
text: Fire. An unsteady camera pans back to Birdman.
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN
dialog: (Excited.)
dialog: That's what I'm talking about! That is
dialog: cool! Explosive! Big, fast, loud!
text: (He turns directly to the camera
dialog: and talks about the audience.)
dialog: Look at them. They love that shit!
dialog: They starve for blood and action,
dialog: not this artsy-fartsy-philosophical
dialog: bullshit!
speaker_heading: C50 C50
text: We hear a loud roar, and the camera pans to discover a huge
text: alien about to crash a cab against the asphalt. Birdman uses his
text: powerful blow to send the alien flying away.
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN
dialog: And when you shout "whooaa!"...
dialog: (Riggan shouts "Whooaa!")
text: ...it explodes in the eardrum of
dialog: millions. Your power is unlimited.
text: Riggan slows down his pace, as he starts to listen.
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You glimmered on 3000 screens, over 5
dialog: continents, in 47 countries at the
dialog: same time. You are ubiquitous. You're
dialog: a God! You can do it again. You can
text: soar above all of them.
dialog: 10/29/14 / 97.
speaker_heading: D50 D50
text: Riggan suddenly begins to levitate.
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN
dialog: There you go, you mother fucker! See?
dialog: Gravity doesn't even apply to you.
text: The camera flies up with Riggan as he floats above the street.
text: There is something magical in his ascension, gently impelled by
text: the breeze. A beautiful backlight makes his body glow. Birdman
text: flutters around him.
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen to me. We gotta go back! We have to
dialog: do this. We have to end it on our terms.
text: With a grand gesture.
text: A strange light suddenly palpitates in Riggan's eyes. Something
text: makes sense in what Birdman is telling him.
text: The camera becomes Riggan's POV. He looks down to see the
text: people on the street, watching him in awe.
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: We'll go back. We'll show them how much
dialog: they're going to miss us. Flames. Icarus.
dialog: Sacrifice...
text: We tilt up again to Riggan's face. He has a plan.
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's go back one more time and show them
dialog: what we're capable of. You can do it.
dialog: You're Birdman. Do you hear me? You're...
speaker_heading: A GUY'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Birdman!
speaker_heading: E50 E50
text: And as the camera pulls away, we discover Birdman is gone and
text: Riggan is standing on the ledge of a tall building. The camera
text: tilts down and we see that more people have gathered around,
text: and more cars has stopped, and they all point at Riggan,
dialog: worried about the situation.
text: A guy wearing shorts, a Bob Marley t-shirt and a robe opens his
text: window, one floor below Riggan, and looks up at him.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Dude, what are you doing?
text: Riggan looks down at the people on the street far below.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 98.
speaker_heading: GUY (CONT'D)
dialog: You okay, buddy? Do you want me to
dialog: call someone?
text: We pan to a lady on her balcony filming Riggan with her phone.
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: Is this for real, or you're shooting a
dialog: film?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
text: A film.
text: The lady looks around but sees nothing.
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: Oh, you people are full of shit.
text: She goes into her apartment.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: I'm calling 911.
text: The guy goes inside his apartment.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: One more time...
text: Now, from the door of the rooftop, a good neighbor calmly
text: approaches Riggan.
speaker_heading: GOOD NEIGHBOR
dialog: Hi, sir. Can I help you? You should be
dialog: careful.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Sorry. Can't talk. I'm late.
dialog: (Murmuring.)
dialog: Music.
text: Some underscoring music begins to sound. The neighbor is now
text: close to him and helps Riggan step down from the edge on to the
text: floor of the rooftop.
speaker_heading: GOOD NEIGHBOR
dialog: Are you alright? Do you want me to
dialog: call someone? Do you know where to go?
text: Riggan closes his eyes for a moment as the camera moves slowly
text: toward him. He opens his eyes. The music begins to swell. Riggan
text: stands up straight and proud, and in a voice that sounds like
dialog: Birdman...
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Yes. I know where to go.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 99.
text: He turns and begins to run on the rooftop. The music is rousing.
text: As he runs, he holds out his arms, spreading them wide. The
text: camera runs behind him, until suddenly...
speaker_heading: F50 F50
text: Riggan jumps, and the camera jumps after him. He rapidly
text: falls toward the street, toward the asphalt. But in his face
text: there is no fear. No. He spreads his arms again and...
speaker_heading: G50 G50
text: He takes flight, soaring high over Manhattan. The music becomes
dialog: epic. There is something beautiful about this broken man flying
text: like a superhero. We fly next to him, and we can see below the
dialog: spectacular sight that is Manhattan, until...
scene_heading: 51 EXT. THEATER - CONTINUOUS 51
text: ...he finally lands on 45th street and calmly approaches the
text: theater. An Usher acknowledges him with a look of surprise.
speaker_heading: USHER
dialog: Mr. Thomson. I think you forgot to--
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Stop the music.
text: The music stops.
speaker_heading: USHER
dialog: I beg your pardon?
text: Riggan enters the theater.
text: The confused Usher watches him go by, as he points to the
text: street. We pan to see a taxi driver coming out of his car,
text: running like a mad man toward us.
text: We stay with the Usher and the taxi driver as they argue. They
text: take it inside the lobby, but we remain out front.
speaker_heading: A51 A51
text: Day turns to night, igniting the lights of the marquee, which
text: reflect off of the lobby doors. We hear wild applause coming
text: from inside the theater. Seconds later, the doors of the
text: theater open and the audience files out for intermission.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 100.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (Tweeting on his phone.)
dialog: It's really good.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I know. I can't believe it...
text: We begin to move up, outside the theater. We see the marquee of
text: the play that reads, "What We Talk When We Talk About Love".
text: Above the title, in smaller print, "Riggan Thomson and Mike
text: Shiner". Below on a banner, "Opening Night".
text: We keep climbing until we arrive at Riggan's dressing room
text: window. We push in to find...
scene_heading: 52 INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - EVENING 52
text: ... that the room is full of roses and cards. Riggan lies on
text: the sofa, hugging a cushion. He is wearing the long wig and
text: mustache for the motel scene.
text: Sylvia appears in the doorway.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Wow, that is just NASCAR hot.
text: He smiles at her.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA (CONT'D)
dialog: I just wanted to come say hello. It's going
dialog: great out there. You're so good. I mean it.
dialog: You're-- I really mean it.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Come here. Sit next to me.
scene_heading: ANNIE ON SPEAKERS
dialog: This is your five minutes.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Do you need to--?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I'm fine. Sit.
dialog: She does.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Look at all these roses.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA (CONT'D) RIGGAN
dialog: You hate roses... I hate roses...
text: She laughs. He watches her, something odd in his expression.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 101.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you okay? You seem-- I don't know, you
text: seem abnormally calm.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I am calm. I'm great. I spent most of
dialog: the day observing how beautifully this
text: pile of dirty clothes was lit by the
text: warm afternoon sun. (A tiny smile.) So
dialog: beautiful.
text: Sylvia, teasing him, closes her eyes and imitates Riggan's
dialog: meditation posture.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: (Mocking him.)
dialog: Oh yes. God is those purplish light
text: dots I see between my eyes and my
dialog: eyelids.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: You know? I have this voice that talks to
dialog: me and tells me the truth. It's comforting,
dialog: and scary.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: I'm going to pretend I didn't hear you say
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: (Changing the subject.)
dialog: You wouldn't believe the crowd outside.
dialog: They said, some people paid up to 500
dialog: dollars a ticket.
text: He sits down.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: You wanna hear something funny?
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Do you remember our last anniversary party?
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Seriously? You're going to ruin a nice
dialog: moment with that?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 102.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Do you remember the party?
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: The party where you fucked Janet Rossbach
dialog: in our bed? Yeah, it rings a bell.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Yeah, well. Let's skip over that part
text: for a minute.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
text: Gladly.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: After you threw the guests out of the
text: house, and the furniture out of the
dialog: window. You locked yourself in the
dialog: bathroom.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: I remember. Why are we--
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I drove down to Malibu. I sat on the beach
text: for a while. Just... staring out at the
dialog: ocean.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Riggan...
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Until I walked straight into the water
dialog: and tried to drown myself.
text: Silence. Sylvia stares at Riggan, surprised.

dialog: I was in up to my chest when I felt the
dialog: first one. On my back, like somebody was
text: holding a frying pan against me. And then
text: my chest, and my legs. The water was full
dialog: of jellyfish. I fought my way out of the
dialog: water, and I started rolling around the
text: sand like a maniac... crying.
text: Sylvia doesn't know how to react.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: You said it was a sunburn.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (Smiling.)
dialog: And you believed me.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 103.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: To be honest, I didn't give a shit.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I love you. And I love Sam.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: I know.
text: Silence. They stare at each other.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I never should have video taped Sam's
dialog: birth. First of all because you and Sam
dialog: both look like shit in that video. But
dialog: mostly because I missed the moment. I
dialog: should have just been there with the two
dialog: of you. Present in my own life. So I'd
dialog: have it. But, I don't. I don't have any of
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: You have Sam.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: No, I don't.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Listen, she's just--
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: No, I understand. She needed a father
dialog: and she got one shamefully successful
dialog: youtube video. Pretty pathetic.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: (Putting a finger on
text: Riggan's lips.)
dialog: Shhh... There are more pathetic things
dialog: than that. That mustache, for example.
text: She kisses him.
scene_heading: ANNIE ON SPEAKERS
dialog: Places for act two. Places.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Riggan...
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: You should get back to your seat. You
dialog: don't want to miss what's next.
text: Sylvia lingers for a moment, and not knowing what to say, she
text: exits. Riggan opens a drawer and takes out a black case. He
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 104.
text: gently opens the lid. Inside a revolver. He takes some bullets
text: out of a box and one by one loads them into the chamber as he
text: does his vocal exercises into the mirror.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (CONT'D)
text: Twenty little leopards laughed at two
text: lofty lions. Twenty little leopards
text: laughed at two lofty lions. Twenty
dialog: little leopards... laughed.
text: He stares at the dressing room door, and with his telekinetic
text: powers he opens it. He snaps the cylinder into the gun and
text: exits out into...
scene_heading: 53 INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 53
text: ...the hallway. He paces deliberately, gun in hand.
text: A technician goes by in the opposite direction.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: Break a leg, Mr. Thomson.
text: Riggan ignores him and continues through to the...
scene_heading: 54 INT. BACKSTAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 54
text: ...backstage area. Annie immediately hustles over to him holding
text: up the brain mechanism. He walks right by her.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (Brushing her off.)
dialog: I don't need it.
text: Annie doesn't seem to understand. She stays there, holding the
text: device. Riggan takes his place outside the motel door. We pan
text: toward the audience. The auditorium is full. The audience in
text: complete silence.
text: Riggan knocks firmly on the door. Silence again. Then...
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Terri! Terri!
dialog: (Beat.)
dialog: I know you're in there!
text: He barges through the door and onto...
dialog: 10/29/14 / 105.
scene_heading: 55 INT. STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 55
text: ...the stage. The motel room as we saw it before. Mike and
text: Lesley jump out of the bed.
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Ed! What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (Almost whispering.)
dialog: Why? I need you to tell me why. I lived for
dialog: you-- I worshipped you...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Listen Ed, I know this is hard but--
text: Riggan raises one hand to silence Mike. Mike looks at him,
text: confused. His eyes narrow on the gun. There is no red plug.
text: Dead silence. An eerie electricity in the theater.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: What's wrong with me? Why do I end
dialog: up having to beg people to love me?
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: Ed. Eddie. Please... Give me the gun.
text: She begins to cry.
speaker_heading: LESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Just look at me. I was drowning. I
dialog: was not capable of-- You deserve to
dialog: be loved. You do.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I just wanted to be what you wanted.
dialog: (Beat.)
dialog: Now I spend every fucking minute
dialog: praying to be someone else. Someone
dialog: I'm not. Anyone...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Put down the gun, Ed. She just doesn't love
dialog: you anymore.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: (To Lesley.)
dialog: You don't, do you?
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: (With sympathy.)
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 106.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: And you never will...
speaker_heading: LESLEY
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: For the first time, Riggan turns to face the audience. He
text: smiles the most beautiful insane smile.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I don't exist. I'm not even here. I don't
dialog: exist. None of this matters.
text: Then he raises a trembling arm, and with his eyes full of
text: tears, he aims the gun at Mike.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Pum.
text: But he doesn't shoot. Then he turns and aims at Tabitha
text: Dickinson who is sitting on the second row.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Pum.
text: Again, no shot. Slowly, Riggan raises the gun toward his own
text: head, suddenly a frightening explosion. Blood sprays. Riggan
text: falls. We stay with the shell-shocked audience. A moment of
dialog: tension, of uncertainty, until...
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Bravo!
text: The audience, one by one, jump to their feet, applauding
text: wildly. The sole exception is Tabitha, who remains seated, a
text: dazed expression on her face. We stay with the audience a few
dialog: seconds longer.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
text: The sounds slowly vanish. After a moment of silence...
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (V.O.)
dialog: You won't be hearing from him
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: MAN (V.O.)
dialog: Is he...?
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN (V.O)
text: He's gone.
dialog: 10/29/14 / 107.
scene_heading: INT. WAITING ROOM - HOSPITAL - DAWN
text: One of the old Birdman films is playing on a small television
text: screen that hangs on a corner. The scene ends and a Morning
text: Show host appears. Behind him a picture of Riggan and a
text: caption that reads: "Nation in shock." A shot of a candle
text: vigil in Central park.
speaker_heading: HOST
dialog: What do we talk about when we talk
dialog: about Riggan Thomson? When we come
dialog: back, more on the actor who two
dialog: nights ago shot himself during the
dialog: opening performance of his new
dialog: Broadway play...
text: We pan away from the TV to see that the waiting room is
text: filled with newsmen waiting for something to happen. There is
text: almost no room to breath.
text: We pan to see Jake emerging from an elevator, carrying a
text: newspaper under his arm. He walks through the dense mass of
text: newsmen with a serious expression on his face. We follow him
dialog: into...
scene_heading: INT. ROOM - HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS
text: ...a room. Jake peers in. Riggan lies on a bed, the bandages
text: on his nose cover most of his face. Sylvia is looking out the
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Is he...?
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
text: He's awake.
text: Jake enters the room.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (Serious.)
dialog: I thought I lost you, buddy. Thank
dialog: god you're a horrible shot! What
dialog: the hell happened? I was watching
dialog: you up on that stage, and all of a
dialog: sudden you get that goofy look in
dialog: your eye, and you were just like--
text: He starts to laugh.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: What the hell are you laughing
dialog: about? He tried to-- What is wrong
dialog: with you?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 108.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I'm happy, okay? He's alive. My
dialog: best friend is alive. And he is the
dialog: man of the hour!
text: Jake holds the New York Times up in the air.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You did it.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: (Coming to them.)
dialog: You have to be shitting me... She
dialog: wrote a review?
text: Jake unfolds the newspaper and we see the headline of the
text: review: "The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance".
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (To Sylvia.)
dialog: Read it.
text: He hands her the newspaper. She begins to read to herself.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: I don't believe this...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Read it out loud!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: "Thompson has unwittingly given
text: birth to a new form that can only
dialog: be described as supra-realism.
dialog: Blood was spilled both literally
text: and metaphorically by artist and
dialog: audience alike. Red blood. The
dialog: blood that has been sorely missing
dialog: from the veins of the American
dialog: theatre..."
dialog: (Beat. To a smiling Jake.)
dialog: You're happy about this?
text: She hands it to Riggan.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Happy? I'm fucking euphoric. This
dialog: is the-- This is the kind of review
dialog: that turns someone into a living
dialog: legend.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 109.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
text: He tried to-- He shot the nose off
dialog: his face!
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: He's got a new nose! And if he
dialog: doesn't like that one, we'll get
dialog: him another one. We can use Meg
dialog: Ryan's guy. Who gives a shit? Turn
text: on the tv. There are people praying
dialog: for him all over the country.
dialog: They're lighting candles in Central
dialog: Park. He did it. (To Riggan) You
dialog: did it! The play's gonna run
dialog: forever. It's gonna open in London,
dialog: in Paris... The studios will call
dialog: us again. We'll get book offers.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: How do you know all that? You can
dialog: see the future?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (Euphoric.)
dialog: Yes.
text: She slaps him in the face.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Did you see that coming? You're so
dialog: full of shit, Jake.
text: Jake needs a few seconds to recover. Then he looks at Riggan
text: who just sits there, in silence.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Why aren't you saying anything?
dialog: This is what you wanted wasn't it?
text: (Riggan gazes at the
dialog: review.)
dialog: Riggan, this is what you wanted.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: It's what I wanted.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Okay, listen. You're gonna get hit
text: with a "brandishing a weapon"
dialog: charge. If anybody talks to you, it
dialog: was an accident and we're doing an
dialog: internal invest--
text: A newsman comes into the room and takes a quick picture.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 110.
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: (Chasing him out.)
dialog: This is a hospital you motherfucker!
text: Jake rushes to the door, shoving the newsman and a few other
text: paparazzi out the door. Security guards. Chaos. Finally
text: silence. Sylvia steps up and looks Riggan in the eye.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Is that what it was? An accident?
text: Riggan just stares at her. His calm, sad eyes peeking through
text: the bandages. After a moment his gaze moves over her
text: shoulder. Sylvia turns and we discover Sam standing in the
text: doorway holding a bouquet of flowers. A bit of awkward
text: silence, and Sylvia decides to leave them alone.
text: She kisses Sam on the head and exits. Sam walks the flowers
text: to Riggan at the bed. She lays them on his chest.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Alchemillas.
text: The hint of a smile on Riggan's face.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you actually smiling?
dialog: (She smiles.)
dialog: What's so funny?
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I can't smell them.
text: A moment until the smiles turn to gentle laughter. She takes
text: out her cell phone and snaps a picture of him.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm posting this picture on your
dialog: Twitter page.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Very funny...
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Set it up today.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: You're joking.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm not.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10/29/14 / 111.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Let me see the picture.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Absolutely not. You look hideous.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Thanks a lot.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm just kidding. No, I'm not. You
dialog: look hideous.
dialog: (Working on phone.)
dialog: You already have 80 thousand
dialog: followers. In less than a day. And
dialog: I'm about to scare the shit out of
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: Let me see.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No. Done.
text: A moment between them. Sam picks up the flowers and kisses
text: him tenderly on the head. Riggan is pleasantly surprised by
dialog: that kiss.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, I'm going to find something to
dialog: put these flowers in.
text: She heads out of the room. Riggan lies there for a moment,
text: tranquil. After a moment he reaches up and touches his
text: bandages. Finally, he climbs out of the bed. We follow him
dialog: into...
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - ROOM - HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS
text: ...the bathroom. He stands before the mirror. He stares at
text: his reflection for a few seconds, and slowly begins to remove
text: the bandages. We can see that Riggan's nose has been
text: reconstructed. It is a crooked, incomplete nose, like the one
dialog: Javier Bardem has.
speaker_heading: RIGGAN
dialog: I do look hideous.
text: In the reflection, Riggan sees Birdman sitting on the toilet.
text: They look at each other, but say nothing. Riggan puts the
text: bandages back on and we follow him out to...
dialog: 10/29/14 / 112.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM - HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS
text: ...the room. He looks around, but Sam is gone. He ambles over
text: to the window, his ass hanging out of the back of his
text: hospital robe. He opens the window and feels the sun and the
text: breeze on his swollen face. We just hear the sounds of the
text: people standing down in the parking lot. Media trucks. Fans.
text: We stay with Riggan, who seems to be thinking about
text: something. He sees a flock of birds dancing in the sky. Then
text: he grabs the side of the window with one hand and begins to
text: step up onto the sill.
text: The camera pans away from him to a table that has some photos
text: propped on it: One of he and Sam when she was a child. One
text: with Sylvia and Sam. A copy of Carver's "What we talk About
dialog: When We Talk About Love" laying on the surface.
text: The camera continues to pan until it comes to the door. Sam
text: enters with a small vase. She looks around...
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Dad?
text: She goes to the bathroom and peers in... nothing.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Dad...?
text: She spots the opened window and registers the sounds from
text: outside. Tentatively she walks toward the window. She gets
text: there, summons her courage and looks down. Nothing. Slowly,
text: confused, she tilts her head up and looks up into the sky. A
text: smile, filled with pride, begin to wash over her face.
