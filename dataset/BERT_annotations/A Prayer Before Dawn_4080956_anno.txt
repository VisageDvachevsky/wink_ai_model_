scene_heading: 1 INT. SHACK (THAILAND) - NIGHT - ON A MAN'S HANDS 1
text: strong...raw skin, callused, with hard scar tissue build-up.
text: Knuckles raised and damaged...They unfold a scrap of aluminum
text: foil with a red pill inside it: `YABA'...Southeast Asia's
dialog: crack cocaine.
text: Zippo sparks beneath the foil -- Huge inhale, fumes rise and
text: steam a glass Pyrex pipe.
text: The Man chokes back, tries to hold the toke. He burps, smoke
text: spurting from his nostrils.
text: Meet BILLY MOORE...mid-20's, rugged, handsome, intense.
text: We HEAR THAI VOICES O.C., sharp tones. Billy moves to a wall
text: of rotted wood planks that divides the shack into two
text: "rooms." He peers through a crack, SEES --
text: BILLY'S POV: a larger MUAY THAI BOXER in his 30's (ECKACHAI).
text: Barrel chest, crude. A TRAINER holds mitts as Eckachai snaps
text: HARD/LOUD COMBOS of knees/fists. It's intimidating as hell.
text: Billy stares through the cracks...Suddenly, a distant CROWD
text: ROARS. A thousand voices firing at once, and we --
speaker_heading: SMASH TO:
scene_heading: 2 INT. RING: SLUM GYM - NIGHT - TWO MUAY THAI BOXERS 2
text: -- both twelve years old, are fighting in a ring surrounded
text: by GAMBLERS. It's loud, primal...A Thai promoter, PAPA (50's)
text: commentates rapid-fire on a mic, his voice echoing over bad
text: speakers as his wife, MAMA, shouts from the crowd...
text: In the ring, the smaller child boxer, NINDAM, is on the attack
text: -- Bodies twisting, grappling, their tiny fists, knees and
text: shins crashing, as--
scene_heading: 3 INT. SHACK - BILLY 3
text: gets ready. Shirt off, his ripped build, battle scarred...He
text: POUNDS a cement post with his bare fist. One blow after another,
text: fists then forearms...Slow, dense thuds, tempering his nerves
dialog: NOT to feel, as--
scene_heading: 4 INT. RING: SLUM GYM - NINDAM + OPPONENT 4
text: are fighting, jack-rabbit fast. Ringside gamblers shove and
text: shout. Bets exchange, hand signals flashing, odds rising, the

scene_heading: 5 INT. SHACK - BILLY 5
text: stands, legs apart and brutally slams a 4x4 BOARD against each

dialog: again and again, and--
scene_heading: 6 INT. RING: SLUM GYM - NINDAM 6
text: jabs Opponent, who reels and drops his guard. Nindam fires a
text: kick to the jaw...
text: ...and Opponent drops cold. Crowd roars. TRAINERS swarm in.
text: The REFEREE lifts Nindam's arm in victory. He smiles.
text: As Nindam exits the ring, two ADULT THAI FIGHTERS climb in...
text: Papa intros each, new odds soar. That fast, while --
scene_heading: 7 INT. SHACK - BILLY 7
text: paces the room, anxiety rising, a caged beast...He pauses...
text: drops his shorts and cup guard, then grips his knees and
text: takes several fast, deep breaths....
text: Billy...sopping sweat...yanks up his guard/shorts...His hands
text: are shaking as he wraps them in KNOTTED ROPE...
text: We HEAR the SOUND of Eckachai leaving. Billy peeks outside
text: the shack, sees Eckachai and his Trainer walking away...
text: Billy smokes more Yaba. Breathes it deep in his lungs.
text: AND THE DOOR BANGS OPEN. Nindam enters -- Billy spins, quick
text: hides his pipe and foil in a gym bag, just in time;
text: Nindam says something in Thai, grabs a pair of BOXING GLOVES
text: and helps Billy put them on.
text: There's a feeling of urgency, that Billy is late.
text: As Nindam ties and tapes the gloves, Billy is too high/amped
text: and avoids Nindam's gaze.
text: After, both nod, bump fists.
scene_heading: 8 EXT. SHACK - NIGHT - FOLLOW BILLY 8
text: with Nindam, hurrying together beneath a ROARING OVERPASS...
text: they cross a TRASH STREWN ALLEY lined with other shacks, slum
text: tenants drinking and smoking.
text: A MAN sits on a bucket holding a chain with a TINY MONKEY on

text: rise...They enter the slum gym...
text: Papa joins them...
scene_heading: 9 INT. RING: SLUM GYM - AS BILLY STEPS THROUGH THE ROPES 9
text: with Nindam and Papa. Adrenaline charged...methamphetamine
text: spiked POV, he darts a look to the crowd: Gamblers trading
text: fistfuls of cash. Mama rallies loudly in Thai...A wired Billy
text: turns to Eckachai in the opposite corner with his Trainer...
text: The crowd getting louder...LOUDER...
text: Nindam and Papa, and Trainer exit the ring.
text: A COW-BELL rings for ROUND ONE.
speaker_heading: BILLY + ECKACHAI

text: Through BILLY'S HEIGHTENED SENSES, we FEEL the visceral rage--
text: Mid-round, Billy sees an opening and SMASHES a hook to
text: Eckachai's jaw -- He hits the canvas hard -- Crowd ROARS --
text: Eckachai gets up -- Billy charges, a wild boar -- two fisted,
text: savage attack to the head and body....Eckachai survives.
speaker_heading: THE BELL.
scene_heading: 10 INT. RING: BILLY'S CORNER - BETWEEN ROUNDS - BILLY 10
text: sits. Papa and Nindam, as cornermen, go to work...but Billy's
text: HEART IS RACING, PULSE POUNDING, TOO FAST -- the drugs have
text: zapped his energy. As Billy inhales several sharp breaths, a
text: strange RINGING fades in OVER the following...
text: -- GAMBLERS' hands signals, the odds rising;
dialog: -- MAMA watching, concerned;
text: -- PAPA and NINDAM shouting instructions to Billy, but he/we
dialog: can't hear them, only this shrill RINGING...

scene_heading: HEAVILY, THUNDERING HAYMAKERS THAT MISS and MISS --
text: Nindam, screaming encouragement in Thai as --
text: Eckachai AVOIDS, then SLAMS an elbow into Billy's eye, jarring
text: and concussive -- Billy staggers, blinking, dazed...
text: Eckachai unleashes a ROUNDHOUSE KICK and Billy's out on
dialog: impact.
text: BILLY'S HEAD bounces off the canvas -- eyes flash -- brain
text: stem shocked. SENSES CONTORT...He tries to get up as the Ref
text: counts over him. Takes seconds, feels like hours. AS HIS
text: SENSES RECONNECT ...Billy climbs to his feet -- but the Ref
dialog: counts "Sip!" (ten)
text: The fight's over.
text: The crowd goes crazy, IMPOSSIBLE TO HEAR, as --
text: Billy protests to the Ref, who affirms in Thai. Billy doesn't
dialog: understand.
text: CORNERMEN pour in. Ref and Billy keep arguing. Nindam gets
text: between them -- Ref violently SHOVES Nindam away, and --
text: Billy reacts -- hair trigger fast -- HEADBUTTS Ref full in
text: the face. Ref goes down. A nasty cut opens above Billy's eye
text: as he KICKS/STOMPS the Ref with MANIC, UNCONTROLLABLE RAGE --
text: BOUNCERS/OTHERS swarm over Billy, forcibly restraining him
dialog: from killing the Ref -- He tries fighting them too --
text: NOW PAPA FORCES IN -- grabs Billy hard around the neck, yanks
text: him close, sees the drugs in his eyes...And Billy knows it.
text: Billy's POV, SEES: Nindam is crying. SEES: the Ref writhing on
text: the floor, blood oozing through cupped fingers. SEES: the crowd
text: roaring. All of it, a disaster.
text: HOLD TIGHT ON BILLY'S FACE
text: as the RAGE...becomes REMORSE...becomes SELF-HATRED...and PAIN.
speaker_heading: SMASH TO:
scene_heading: 12 EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - NIGHT - MOVING WITH BILLY 12
text: as he walks the crowded streets. Face bruised, blood dried
text: through a bandage above his eye...
dialog: 6.
text: From Billy's DRUGGED POV, IMAGES are kinetic and abstract, a
scene_heading: nightmarish KALEIDOSCOPE:
text: Flashing lights. Psychoactive. Multicolored.
text: Shadows pass/undulate. Stray dogs everywhere...
text: SOUNDS are discordant, reverberating: Car horns. Motorbikes.
text: People talking, laughing, shouting...
text: Billy moves through it, focus jumping, blurring. Everything
text: pulsing, pounding, claustrophobic.
scene_heading: 13 INT. GO-GO CLUB: RED LIGHT DISTRICT - NIGHT 13
text: Music assaults us. Bass so heavy, it jars our teeth. We're in
text: a seedy sex playground, under harsh neon lights. Strippers on
text: stage, on poles, in cages...Most of them high on drugs, empty
text: eyes, bored. "Coyote Girls" in string bikinis, servicing
text: tourists, all sweating like fiends...
scene_heading: 14 AT THE BAR - BILLY 14
text: slams a double-shot of whiskey.
text: He turns and scans the crowd till he spots a young Thai
text: girl...NINA, 20's, bikini clad...giving a lap dance to a mid-
text: 60's CUSTOMER.
text: To Billy, Nina is impossibly beautiful, an angel, a rose. His
text: anger builds, as the Customer paws Nina's breasts and legs.
text: Nina looks up from her Customer, and sees Billy watching her.
text: Eyes meet...Billy forces a smile...Nina nods to a booth where
text: two YOUNG AUSTRALIAN MEN (20's) nervously wait.
text: Billy slams another whiskey, then--
scene_heading: 15 INT. STALL: CLUB BATHROOM - BILLY + AUSTRALIAN #1 + #2 15
text: are in a stall. The Australians stare at Billy's bruises and
text: bloodied bandage...as he counts out two packets of 100 Yaba,
text: wrapped in cling film.
text: Australians hand Billy cash. Billy counts, pockets it. Gives
dialog: them the pills.
text: Then Australians #1/#2 watch as Billy cooks up a hit of Yaba.
dialog: Foil -- lighter -- smoke -- suck...

scene_heading: 16 SMASH TO: LATER - BILLY 16

text: ...and the SEQUENCE BUILDS, Billy hustling deals...Yaba for
dialog: cash, deal after deal. Getting HIGHER with customers. Getting

text: The music gets LOUDER. The action HEAVIER. More NARCOTIC...
scene_heading: 17 BATHROOM. LATER 17
text: A very intoxicated Billy throws water on his face. He shadow-
text: boxes a few punches in front of a filthy mirror...then stares
text: at his reflection, morosely.
scene_heading: 18 INT. MAIN FLOOR: GO-GO CLUB - NIGHT - BILLY 18
text: looks around for Nina. He finds her in a corner chatting with
text: other girls. THE MUSIC DEAFENING NOW -- We cannot hear what's
dialog: being said as...
text: Billy heads over. Nina sees his condition and stands up.
text: Billy tries to talk to her. Nina rejects him.
text: Billy takes her by the arm and pulls her close.
text: Nina catches the desperate pain in Billy's eyes, and looks at
text: him, gravely.
text: Billy lets Nina go. She hurries off --
scene_heading: 19 LATER. BILLY 19
text: is obliterated, sweating profusely as he walks through the
text: club...Only the hardest sex/drug addicts remain. Billy's legs
text: buckle; he uses a wall for support, sparks a JOINT to slow his
dialog: heart.
text: His distorted POV.....A Stripper slides a cigar from her vagina
text: and pumps out smoke rings. Men applaud, hurl cash on stage.
text: Billy blinks, unsure if he's hallucinating.
scene_heading: 20 DANCE FLOOR. LATER 20
text: Billy dances, alone, trancelike. Releasing himself from himself.
text: Everything rising to a fever pitch. Then, without warning...
text: SOUND CUTS OUT...and Billy starts to weep.
scene_heading: OVER THIS LONG, VERY LONELY SILENCE;
text: A STRANGE THUMPING begins, quietly, that carries us into....

scene_heading: 21 INT. BILLY'S APARTMENT - PRE DAWN - BILLY 21
text: sits in a chair, nude, his back to us.
text: Billy is, by now, paralytic. Mouth open, head tilted back,
text: like a corpse...The strange and dull THUMPING builds, like a
dialog: muted heart beat...
dialog: boom...
dialog: boom...
dialog: boom...
text: Billy mumbles, incoherent. Eyes rolled back, the drugs
text: cocooning him in a blissful isolation from all else. The
text: thumping, louder now...
dialog: Boom...
dialog: Boom...
dialog: Boom...
text: Billy's eyes start to flutter. Tries to open them: can't.
text: Suddenly, loud/startling...
text: BOOM!! BOOM!! BOOM!! BOOM!! BOOM!!
text: Billy snaps alert -- turns to the door. Someone's BANGING on
dialog: it from the other side;
text: THEN, LOUD VOICES BEGIN SHOUTING IN THAI...
text: Billy peers through the peep-hole: SEES 4 THAI COPS, guns out.
text: He spins, looks at his table --
text: It's full of EIGHT YABA PACKETS, burned matches, a pipe.
text: He looks at his desk -- it's covered with WEAPONS: a Colt .45,
text: machete, a stun gun, knuckle duster, a pile of cell phones/sim
text: cards, and a Samurai sword.
dialog: Fuck.
scene_heading: POLICE BANG AWAY AT THE DOOR --
text: Billy quickly grabs a few yaba packets and forces them up his
dialog: ass -- painfully as --
scene_heading: POLICE KEEP SHOUTING/KNOCKING VIOLENTLY --
text: BILLY STARTS TO EAT THE OTHER YABA PACKETS: SIX OF THEM.
text: THE COPS KICK THE DOOR. THE SLIDE LOCK HOLDS IT SHUT; BARELY.
text: BILLY CHOKES DOWN THE LAST PACKET DRY. HACKS, SWALLOWS --
text: ANOTHER KICK. THE LOCK IS ABOUT TO GIVE.
text: While pulling on clothes, Billy takes a fall, gets up, as --

scene_heading: DOOR BREAKS OPEN -- NEARLY OFF IT'S HINGES. COPS STAMPEDE IN
text: AND ROUGHLY THROW BILLY TO THE GROUND --
text: THEY CUFF HIM, SEARCH HIM. GUNS AT HIS HEAD, A FOOT ON HIS
text: NECK, ALL SHOUTING IN THAI --
text: COPS #1 + #2 inspect Billy's arsenal, chattering fast, as COPS
text: #3 + #4 find TWIN SYRINGES in a pie tin on the stove. They
text: immediately search for drugs: ripping open cabinets, rifling
text: drawers, kicking out panels, trashing everything they touch...
text: ON BILLY, terrified, sweating.

scene_heading: 23 EXT. CITY STREET - PRE DAWN 23
text: ...a waiting POLICE PICKUP TRUCK. Billy is shoved in the back

text: first streaks of dawn light the horizon over Bangkok...
scene_heading: 24 I/E. POLICE PICKUP (TRAVELING) - PRE DAWN - BILLY 24
text: in back. A POLICE MOTORBIKE follows, headlight glaring bright.

text: Cops to vanish down a hall.
dialog: THEN...
text: ...Billy turns around and VOMITS.
text: Yaba packets hit the floor, plastic burned by intestinal
text: acid. Billy drops to his knees, anxiously digs through chunks
dialog: and fluid to find the Yaba pills.
text: A few others in the cell take notice: ADDICTS, sweating,
text: scratching...They hungrily move toward him...
text: Billy quickly starts to eat the pills.
text: He looks up, sees the Addicts standing over him. Threatening

text: He gazes around, swallowed by the prison.
scene_heading: 29 INT. RECEIVING BLOCK - DAY - BILLY + PRISONERS 29
text: are herded in. It's dim, narrow. Guards unlock the shackles;
text: chains drop, rattling to the floor...Guards bark orders in
text: Thai and the prisoners shed their clothes, lining up for
text: cursory exams -- mouth, ears, feet, balls, armpits, ass...
text: Billy watches, repulsed, as a SKINNY GUARD wearing a latex
text: glove, uses the same finger for each exam, without sterilizing.
text: Suddenly a muffled THAI RING-TONE plays from somewhere. It
text: RINGS, RINGS and RINGS...
text: Guards look around. Prisoners/Billy are still. NO ONE MOVES.
text: The ring-tone keep playing.
text: Then, Skinny Guard looks at a naked Thai (NOK, 20) and orders
text: him to step forward. He squats, coughs...and a CELL PHONE
text: drops out.
text: The name of the incoming caller: "Mom" (in Thai)
text: Cued by Skinny Guard's look, a BULL GUARD lashes out, BATON

speaker_heading: BILLY

dialog: off.
text: Tiffany shrugs, buttons her shorts. Then, she slides out a
dialog: pack of cigarettes.
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: You like smokey?
text: Billy hesitates, then snatches the cigarette. Tiffany smiles,
text: lights it for him.
text: Billy takes a long, deep drag...An awkward beat:
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Thanks...You speak good English.
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: I speak nit-noy. I speak a little
dialog: bit.
text: A naked Indian Prisoner with an orange turban runs past,
text: screaming: "I HAVE GOD POWER! I HAVE GOD POWER!"
speaker_heading: BILLY

dialog: So what happened to him?

text: And a loud WHISTLE BLOWS.
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: Sleep now, no more talk...
text: Billy lies back, staring miserably up at the lights that will
text: stay on all night...He then sees a SECURITY CAMERA pan/zoom
text: onto him...Ceiling fans RATTLE and WHIR. Thousands of insects
text: BUZZ in the air...Louder, LOUDER, VIOLENT CRESCENDO, THEN --
text: Billy shuts his eyes.
text: CUT TO BLACK, HOLD, THEN:
scene_heading: 39 CUT HARD TO: 39
text: GUARDS loudly dragging their batons along the bars of each
dialog: cell, one cell after the next...
text: Billy bolts awake, looks around, disoriented.
dialog: It's morning;
scene_heading: 40 INT. NEWCOMER CELL - MORNING - BILLY 40
text: and prisoners sit in rows for head count. Each shout a number
text: in Thai, Neung, Song, Sam, etc...It STOPS on Billy;
text: Guard #1 looks up from his clipboard, SHOUTS THAI at Billy.
text: Billy doesn't understand. All eyes on him.
speaker_heading: GUARD #1
dialog: (angrier)
dialog: Farang, number you!

dialog: Hok!!
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Hok!!
text: Count resumes: others shout. Guard #1 writes it down.
text: Billy watches as two TRUSTEES enter to remove the corpse, now
text: black with rigor mortis. Billy quickly snatches the corpse's
text: blanket, as they carry him away.
text: Prisoners roll up their blankets. Billy does the same.
text: 41 TIMECUT. Water begins pumping from a black pipe and fills up 41
text: a plastic barrel. Billy watches as other PRISONERS quickly
text: grab large, plastic lemonade bottles from a pile in the
text: corner and fill them up with water.
text: Billy, still sitting there, hears someone giggle...He looks
text: over to see a mentally retarded Thai inmate, filthy, in moldy
text: flip-flops, (NOI, 19) watching him...Laughing. Noi is the
text: only other prisoner not trying to get water.
text: Now, Billy gets up and hurries in to get water. It's rowdy,
text: chaotic: NUMEROUS PRISONERS all yelling in Thai, forcing
text: their way in to fill up their bottles.
text: Billy gestures/talks. No one understands him.
text: Billy finally manages to fill up three bottles for himself.
scene_heading: 42 EXT. TROUGHS - MORNING - BILLY 42
text: in line among prisoners. Billy struggles to hold/carry his
text: bottles of water. One is leaking. He tries to cover the hole.
text: Two THAI PRISONERS in their underwear, leaving the troughs,
text: bump into Billy...and he drops all his water.
dialog: 20.
text: Billy holds in his frustration...barely.
scene_heading: 43 INT. CANTEEN - MORNING - BILLY 43
text: and prisoners are fed breakfast. Rice and soup (fish skeleton
text: with only the head attached). Billy forces it down.
scene_heading: 44 EXT. OPEN-AIR TOILET AREA - MORNING, AFTER - BILLY 44
text: in line, looking nauseous. He waits, and waits...It's finally
text: his turn. He runs into the stall and vomits.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 45 EXT. CORRIDOR - DAY, LATER - BILLY 45
text: walks down this long corridor alone, then heads out a door...
scene_heading: 46 EXT. THE COURTYARD - WIDE - WITH BILLY 46
text: ...into the chaos and cacophony of the MAIN YARD, a strange
text: world overflowing with bodies: all selling, eating, thieving,
text: drugging, betting, fighting and fucking.
text: MAKESHIFT SHOPS and STANDS throughout: Thai massages, a
text: barber, laundry, food, crafts, flavored water on ice for sale.
text: STATIC, THAI MUSIC drones over speakers...
text: PRISONERS IN SHACKLES play tackle FOOTBALL, argue and fight.
text: Some are in groups (North and South Thai gangs), gambling and
text: hawking wares. Lady Boys on the prowl. A human piranha tank.
text: Above it all, GUARDS watch from the two-story cell block and
text: surrounding towers.
text: ON BILLY -- taking it in...
scene_heading: UNSHAVEN LADY BOY
dialog: Yoo-hoo, farang!
dialog: (off Billy's look)
dialog: You want fuck arse me?
text: The Unshaven Lady-Boy lifts up her top to show giant, fake
text: breasts. Billy ignores.
text: Billy notices a few Westerners together: Australian and Arab.
text: They look at Billy...Billy stares them down.
dialog: Then;
text: BILLY'S POV -- across the yard...Amidst it all, he spots who
dialog: he's been looking for: Elyias.
dialog: 21.
text: As Billy approaches...he sees Elyias with TRUSTEES #1 + #2 in
text: a heated argument with THREE MUSLIMS. It's loud, threatening,
text: lots of shoving, shouting in Thai.
text: Billy stands back, watches. The Muslims storm away.
text: Elyias turns...sees Billy, who discreetly gestures with his
dialog: hands what he needs...
scene_heading: 47 E/I. PRISON LOCKER AREA - DAY - BILLY 47
text: follows Elyias through a gate, into the hangar-like structure.
text: It's dim, red bulbs hang, row upon row of lockers. Elyias
text: signals Billy to wait, then disappears into the shadows.
scene_heading: HOLD ON BILLY
text: alone. Nervous. Above him, Guards loom on balconies. They eye
text: Billy, then move on...Billy waits and waits...It's intense
text: and unnerving. Feels like forever.
text: He decides to leave -- when Elyias suddenly returns with
text: Trustees #1 + #2. Billy looks at them, ill at ease.
text: Then, Elyias slips Billy a lighter, gum foil, and YABA PILL.
text: As Trustees #1 + #2 stand watch, Billy lights up, cooks the
text: drug. Thick smoke rises...Billy hard INHALES, and --
speaker_heading: SMASH TO:
scene_heading: 48 EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAY, AFTER - PRISONERS 48
text: A FIST-FIGHT breaks out among prisoners. Then ANOTHER.
text: Someone gets STOMPED. Other prisoners crowd around and gamble
dialog: on who will win.
speaker_heading: BILLY
text: is alone, motionless and drugged. WE SEE what/how HE SEES...
text: The nude INDIAN PRISONER in the turban runs past, yelling, "I
dialog: HAVE GOD POWER! I HAVE GOD POWER!..."
text: A BLIND PRISONER with a stick...An OLD MAN in a broken
text: wheelchair...Another prisoner with NO LEGS on a wooden board
text: with tiny wheels pulls himself along...A few PRISONERS being
text: publicly punished, jogging in chains in the scorching heat...
text: The Indian scurries onto a low divider laced with BARBED
text: WIRE. GUARDS shout at him to get down. The Indian keeps
text: moving/yelling "I HAVE GOD POWER," then jumps for the main
text: wall -- hits the ELECTRIC FENCE -- instantly fried.
dialog: "God Power" gone.
dialog: 22.
text: The Guards cut the Indian down.
text: Billy just stares, over-fucking-whelmed.
text: Then, a strange calm washes over him...as if feeling the
dialog: Indian is now free.
scene_heading: 49 INT. NEWCOMER CELL - PRE DAWN - BILLY 49
text: lies awake, depressed. Fluorescents blaze, humidity hangs.
text: He looks around at the other prisoners, inches apart.
text: BILLY'S POV: Some are asleep. Most in bad health: open sores,
text: diseases. Tiffany snores beside him. One prisoner mumbles to
text: himself, incoherent. Another cries quietly, his foot badly
text: infected with gangrene. A third prisoner makes a crude weapon
text: out of a SPOON. An OLDER PRISONER sits on the toilet steps,
text: whistle around his neck, on suicide watch. He just stares at
dialog: Billy, saying nothing...
scene_heading: ON BILLY. ALONE.
text: In the distance, faintly rising, we hear atonal CHANTING. The
text: Islamic call to prayer. It drones, hypnotic, a hundred voices
text: bypassing the prison walls...
dialog: "Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akba, Ash-hadu anla ilaha illah Allah,"
dialog: on and on.
text: Billy rises, drapes a wet rag over his head, then moves to
text: the bars and listens...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 50 INT. NEWCOMER CELL - DAYS LATER - PRISONERS 50
dialog: do morning head-count for Guard #2. When the count reaches

scene_heading: 51 INT. NEWCOMER CELL - DAY - BILLY 51
text: sits on his blanket. Sweating, nauseous. Leg bouncing rapid.
dialog: The itch to get high...Tries to fight it.
text: He looks at the nail on his thumb. Starts to bite it.
text: He begins to tear it off with his teeth.
text: He rips it completely off and spits it on the floor.
text: His thumb is torn and bleeding.
text: Billy just stares at it.
dialog: 23.
text: He hears someone laughing. Billy looks over to see Noi, the
text: mentally retarded inmate...laughing at him again.
text: Then, Billy bursts out the door.
scene_heading: 52 INT. PRISON LOCKER AREA - DAY - AS A LIGHTER 52
text: sparks, a yaba pill boils...and Billy inhales full blast.
dialog: Trustee's #1 + #2 keep watch.
dialog: Then, Elyias:
speaker_heading: ELYIAS
dialog: Yaba...Tiger. Horse. More you use,
dialog: more you need...
text: Billy, in some otherworldy place.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: The fuck are you on about?
speaker_heading: ELYIAS
dialog: Now time, you pay me.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (slow, high)
dialog: ...I'll pay when I can.
speaker_heading: ELYIAS
dialog: Must pay now. No money, you pay
dialog: other way...
text: AS BILLY AND ELYIAS MOVE OUT TO THE YARD
text: they/we see a distant GROUP OF MUSLIMS...CHANTING in Muslim
dialog: prayer, using newspapers for prayer mats: "Allahu Akbar,
dialog: Allahu, Aakbar..."
speaker_heading: ELYIAS
dialog: Muslims. Bad for business...
dialog: You, boxer-- Boom boom them.
text: Elyias pounds a fist into his hand.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I don't do that. Fuck off.
speaker_heading: ELYIAS
dialog: Then me sell your debt to supplier:
dialog: "the Samurai."
text: Billy follows his gaze to a gang of SIX THAI in a nearby
text: section of the yard. Predatory, junkie-thin, full tattooed.
text: The leader, KENG, face tattooed, holds court.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: ELYIAS
dialog: HIV, AIDS, all them...
dialog: (off Billy's look)
text: Syringes are swords. Buy drugs and
dialog: you no pay? Give AIDS to you...
text: Hidden by the rest, A YOUNG SAMURAI sits in the dirt...a full
text: skeletal structure tattooed on his hands. He uses a strange,
text: CROOKED KNIFE to deeply carve/scar his own arms.
text: He looks at Billy. Eyes meet. Billy looks away.
speaker_heading: ELYIAS
dialog: Choice yours.
text: As Billy stands there, on the edge of a precipice....
scene_heading: 53 INT. PRISON KITCHEN: BUILDING SIX - LATE DAY - THREE MUSLIMS 53
text: busily work the stoves. Steam and flames rise in the dark as
text: they cook. Malaysian music plays low on a RADIO. They talk in
text: good spirits (AD LIB). THE OLDEST MUSLIM fills a large bowl
text: with food and leaves to feed the others.
dialog: MUSLIMS #1 + #2 talk/cook. One makes a joke, the other
text: laughs...Then, SOMEONE (O.C.) turns the radio up, LOUD. The
dialog: Muslims stop, turn...
speaker_heading: BILLY
text: stands there. STARK STILL. A pain in his eyes: self hatred,
text: remorse. Then, his rapid breathing induces a RAGE, RISING...
text: The Muslims furrow their brows.
text: A split-second heartbeat...just one;
text: AND BILLY ATTACKS. MANIACAL VIOLENCE. So fast, so shockingly
text: brutal it's hard to watch. Malaysian music blares, drowning
text: out the Muslims' screams. Billy destroys them both...till the
text: Muslims lie there, barely breathing, bloody, crippled pulps.
scene_heading: 54 MOMENTS AFTER - BILLY'S HANDS 54
text: are blood covered. He runs water in a sink, fills up a
text: bucket, and sinks his hands into it. The water turns red.
text: Billy stares at it. Silent and tense.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 55 INT. NEWCOMER CELL - PRE DAWN - BILLY 55
text: lies awake, under a white sheet. Empty, sick, defeated.
text: Nowhere to turn. Nothing to hope for.
dialog: 25.
text: One Prisoner on watch; everyone else asleep.
text: HOLD ON BILLY....staring up at the security camera, his sheet
text: pulled to his chin. He glances at Tiffany, asleep nearby.
text: It's VERY TENSE, VERY QUIET...
text: Prisoner on watch looks around.
text: Then, Billy makes the tiniest flinch. And we see something
text: dark -- moving... A SPOT OF BLOOD FORMS ON THE SHEET. THEN
text: ANOTHER...AND ANOTHER...ALL THEM POOLING OUT UNTIL THE SHEET
text: IS SOAKED WITH BLOOD.
text: Under the sheet: BILLY IS CUTTING HIMSELF WITH THE CRUDE
text: SPOON WE SAW EARLIER. CUTTING DEEP. CUTTING EVERYWHERE.
text: FLOODING WITH SELF-HATRED.
text: Billy holds in tears;
text: Suddenly, FEAR sets in. Instant REGRET and PANIC. Billy
text: throws the sheet off...It's an horrific sight...His arms and
text: leg and stomach opened and bleeding.
text: Billy drops the spoon by the inmate he stole it from, waking
text: and startling him. Nearby, Tiffany wakes up too, shocked as --
text: Billy staggers toward the bars...wounds pumping blood, air
dialog: leaving him...
text: Everyone begins chattering, incessant Thai; The prisoner on
text: watch loudly blows his WHISTLE. Again and again.
text: Billy grips the bars...Blood and drool and foam in his mouth,
text: he sputters, no words...
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Hel-- Hel-- I, I need--
text: Billy, scared, lost-- rears up, SCREAMING---
speaker_heading: BILLY
text: HEEEEELLLLLLLLLLPPPPPPP!!!!!
speaker_heading: BLACK.
scene_heading: 56 INT. PRISON INFIRMARY - DAYS LATER - BILLY 56
text: lies still and bandaged in a bed. Other patients in beds:
text: AIDS-ridden, organs failing, runaway sepsis. One can't stop
text: shaking. We're in Death's waiting room.
text: Billy just lies there. Grave emotion. He quietly breaks down,
text: ...then wipes the tears away.
dialog: 26.
scene_heading: 57 EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - LATE DAY - BILLY 57
text: is walked by two Guards past the ENTIRE INMATE POPULATION
text: (500), gathered in the yard for head-count.
text: All eyes on Billy. Humiliated.
text: Officer Pi Sit watches from a distant balcony as the Guards
text: lead Billy toward a tiny cell, built beneath the prison
dialog: staircase -- And that is...
scene_heading: 58 INT. THE ISOLATION CELL 58
text: No bed or sink. Just a bucket for a toilet. Paint peels in
text: scabs off the ceiling, only three-feet high. Porno mag photos
text: are stuck to a wall, among dozens of markings from previous
dialog: prisoners counting down days.
text: Billy grips the bars, on his knees, staring across the yard.
text: THE WHISTLE BLOWS and all prisoners return to their cells.
text: Officer Pi Sit returns to his office.
text: WE HOLD ON BILLY for the longest time...alone with the empty
text: courtyard. Only a large BUDDHA STATUE remains; incense and
text: candles burning, it's solemn face staring at Billy.
text: Billy staring back.
text: And as the sun starts to dip...In the distance, two GUARDS
text: exit a cell, followed by a group of MEN...well built, full
text: tattooed, shackled and chained...GYM BAGS in hand and BOXING
text: GLOVES tied around their shoulders. The Boxers and Guards go
text: past, not looking at Billy...
text: Billy watches them go. Forlorn. Numb.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 59 INT. SECTOR 5: CORRIDOR - DAY - BILLY 59

scene_heading: 60 INT. SECTOR 5 CELL - DAY - BILLY, THAI #1, #2 + #3 60
text: enter this huge, crowded cell, deemed maximum security.
text: Guards slam the bars behind them.
text: It's dark, foul. Wet clothes hang on lines. Bottles of murky
text: fluids. It's a SAMURAI CELL. Wall-to-wall packed w/INMATES,
text: tattooed from head-to-toe, many in shackles. Surveillance
dialog: cameras...The air itself is dangerous.
dialog: 27.
text: Billy and the three Thai Inmates stand before the "cell boss,"
text: we saw in the yard: KENG. He sharply barks the rules in Thai.
text: Billy's quiet, doesn't like the tone. A few Samurai laugh.
text: As Billy looks for a space to sit, one Samurai gets up...KIAW
text: (30, Thai, body and lips tattooed, wearing shackles). He
text: shouts in Thai at a sleeping Samurai, "Bie!" (move!) then
text: kicks him hard in the ribs to make room for Billy.
text: Then Kiaw looks at Billy and smiles...
speaker_heading: KIAW
dialog: Okay, farang. You sleep here.
text: Billy sits.
speaker_heading: KIAW
dialog: I am Kiaw.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Billy.
speaker_heading: KIAW

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Yeah, what'd you hear?
speaker_heading: KIAW
dialog: That you crazy foreigner. Farang,
dialog: ba. I like that. Kiaw friend to
dialog: you...
text: SUDDEN COMMOTION. EVERYONE TALKING. Billy looks up to see the
text: three Thai Inmates he came in with are clutching the cell
text: bars as Samurai take turns kicking them from behind.
speaker_heading: KIAW
dialog: Initiation...not for Westerner.
text: When it's over, the three Thais celebrate. Samurai embrace
text: them. Billy watches, feeling oddly rejected.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 61 EXT. SHOWER AREA - MORNING - BILLY + KIAW 61
text: wait in a long cue of prisoners leading up to the troughs.
dialog: When it's their turn: five cups water, ten seconds soap, four
text: cups water; Next prisoner's turn.
dialog: 28.

speaker_heading: BILLY
text: watches, nervous and horrified as Kiaw builds a "syringe":
text: taking apart a Bic pen, then using a lighter to burn/melt one
text: end of the stem around a needle;
text: As Kiaw breaks open a straw of heroin and mixes it with water
text: in a bottle cap...
text: Kiaw sucks the heroin mix up through the "syringe," then
text: forces the needle into his vein, and blows the heroin in;
text: Billy is shocked.
speaker_heading: KIAW
dialog: Now you.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Fuck that.
speaker_heading: KIAW
dialog: Best high like this.
text: Billy, ill at ease, contemplates, then....
text: ....we HEAR a distant chorus of SOUND, IN THE DISTANCE:
text: rhythmic POUNDING, chains JANGLING, ropes WHIRRING...
text: It gets Billy's attention...he's unsure what it is;
scene_heading: 63 EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - RIGHT AFTER - WITH BILLY 63
text: as he starts thru the yard...He moves through the chaos, not
dialog: saying a word...
text: The SOUNDS get louder as we get closer, Billy following it...
text: drawn to it, now arriving at...
dialog: 29.
scene_heading: 64 A PRISON BOXING GYM 64
text: Billy enters...Its cage enclosed, decrepit, yet full to
text: bursting with MUAY THAI BOXERS at work: SKIPPING ROPES,
text: POUNDING BAGS (Two on each bag alternating kicks), HAMMERING
text: MITTS and PADS, SPARRING and SHADOWBOXING -- a great machine
dialog: of perpetual violence.
text: A DESK GUARD sits, reading a newspaper.
text: BILLY'S FACE as he edges forward, transfixed. Everything
dialog: that's happened writ deep in his eyes. Everything he did
text: wrong. All he'll never become. Wounded and frightened by the
dialog: abundance of strength around him...
text: The Boxers are aware of him now. They stop training.
text: And Billy freezes.
text: The Boxers staring at him. Every one of them, dangerous.
text: Billy staring back. SCARY SILENCE. And just like that....
text: AN ANGRY THAI MAN SPRINGS INTO FRAME, STARTLING US -- SHOVING
scene_heading: BILLY BACK AND SHOUTING AGGRESSIVELY IN THAI --
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (stumbling backwards)
dialog: --I'm sorry...sorry, I didn't--

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Wait, I'm a fighter! I'M A

text: A LIGHTENING FAST SHOVE and Billy's balance goes -- He falls
text: completely out of the gym, lands on his back, on cement.
text: Nan yanks the gate SHUT. Locks it with a SNAP.
text: Billy looks at him, dumbstruck.
text: Nan stares through the gate, smoking a cigarette. Then turns,

text: OFF BILLY. Mad. Stung. Confused. Roaring sounds of the gym
dialog: resume, and we CUT TO--
scene_heading: 65 EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - ANOTHER DAY - BILLY 65

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (to Trustees)
dialog: GET OFF! GET FUCKIN' OFF ME!
text: Billy breaks loose and sinks his TEETH into #4's throat.
text: Blood spurts, #4 howls. Billy bites down even harder. Even by
dialog: his own brutal standards, it's shocking.
text: Trustee #5 chops away at Billy's head, who takes the pain.
text: Trustee #4 collapses. Billy hurls Trustee #5 to the floor.
text: A WHISTLE blows in the distance. Blood is everywhere: On

speaker_heading: TRUSTEE #6
dialog: Hey, farang. You no good boxer.
dialog: Fight very bad.
dialog: 33.
text: Billy, ADRENALINE SURGE at the insult -- SCREAMS and breaks
text: loose again, charging Trustee #6. The other Trustees knock
text: Billy down with their batons and bury him.
scene_heading: 67 EXT. CONTROL SECTION - AFTER - ON THE DOOR 67
text: it slams open. Two TRUSTEES throw Billy on his face, like a
text: sack of raw meat. Trustees go back inside...
text: Billy rolls to his back, leaving a blood mask on the ground.
text: Billy lies there...bloody and swollen. Eyes, purple slits.
text: The sun beating down on him, flies nipping at him, barely
dialog: able to breathe...
text: Then, a YOUNG WOMAN approaches, blocking out the sun. Early
text: 20's. A paige-boy hair cut. We see her in SILHOUETTE...
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (barely a whisper)
dialog: ...help me...
text: The Woman gently dabs Billy's wounds with a wet rag, cleaning
text: the blood. When she leans closer, her FACE comes into light.
dialog: Her name is JOM.
text: And she's a man...in bright red lipstick.
speaker_heading: JOM
dialog: You okay?
dialog: Billy isn't.
speaker_heading: JOM
dialog: Face look very bad.
text: Billy blinks.
speaker_heading: JOM
dialog: No worry now. Me name Jom. I help
dialog: you.
text: Jom sits Billy up, continuing to nurse him. After a moment,
text: she helps Billy get to his feet.
text: Billy holds onto Jom for support...step-by-painful-step,
text: slowly making their way toward a looming ADMIN. BUILDING in
text: the center of this fenced-in compound.
text: Suddenly GUARDS #1 and #2 arrive, and shout at Jom in Thai.
text: Jom shouts back. Arguing ensues. She's protecting Billy.
dialog: 34.
text: Guards roughly grab Jom and throw her aside.
text: Billy collapses again.
scene_heading: 68 INT. ADMIN BUILDING: CHAIN ROOM - DAY, LATER - AS A HAMMER 68
speaker_heading: SWINGS DOWN
text: onto an iron cuff, around Billy's ankle. WIDEN. And Billy's
text: leg is set on an anvil. A BLACKSMITH hammers a bolt through
text: the clasp.
text: Officer Pi Sit stands by with the Guards.
text: Blacksmith hammers ANOTHER CUFF around Billy's ankle, then
text: runs two ENORMOUS 6 KG CHAINS between shackles...
text: Billy stands, bound, shackled...his swollen eyes, defiant.
text: Officer Pi Sit signals to the Guards and Blacksmith to leave.
text: Then, Officer Pi Sit exhales heavily, glares at Billy...
speaker_heading: OFFICER PI SIT
dialog: Why are you so fucked up?
text: Billy says nothing, inwardly tense.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PI SIT
dialog: Disappoint me, William Moore. Fight
dialog: like mad dog, no good. Must be same-
dialog: same like Buddha.
text: Billy is silent. Officer Pi Sit slowly circles him...
speaker_heading: OFFICER PI SIT
dialog: You say you are "boxer."
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (defiant)
dialog: Are you sayin' I'm not?
speaker_heading: OFFICER PI SIT
dialog: Why you need drugs?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Who said I "need" it?
text: Pi Sit stops. Stares. Cold.
text: Billy stands there. All his failures, like shrapnel, moving
dialog: through his heart...
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (concedes, honest)
dialog: -- I've got a lot of bad shit in me
dialog: head...I don't want to think about.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: When I use, I don't hear it.
text: Pi Sit looks at Billy: sees the hard miles in his eyes. The
text: pain in his voice.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PI SIT
dialog: If you want fight, you should fight
dialog: in the ring. But you must deserve
dialog: it.
dialog: Billy is silent;
speaker_heading: OFFICER PI SIT
dialog: Behave, William Moore. Chi yeng
dialog: yeng...and maybe real fighters can
dialog: teach you something.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: ...I can't box with chains on...
speaker_heading: OFFICER PI SIT
dialog: For three months, get used to it.
scene_heading: 69 EXT. CONTROL SECTION - HOURS LATER - BILLY 69
text: waits alone, chained and shackled, seated against a wall. In
text: the b.g., two LADY-BOYS (MAY and CHAR) give massages to a
text: pair of Guards on a shaded veranda of the Admin. buiding.
text: Now, Jom approaches Billy...
speaker_heading: JOM
dialog: So you like fight?
text: Billy is quiet, morose.
speaker_heading: JOM
dialog: -- Officer Pi Sit, good man. He
dialog: protect us.
dialog: (leans in close to Billy)
dialog: And now, he try and protect you...
text: Billy is silent. He touches his lip: it still bleeds.
speaker_heading: JOM
dialog: Here, I feel safe. I go outside
dialog: compound,-- danger!
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: JOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Four thousand man want boom boom
dialog: me...'cause I have pussy. Am real
dialog: girl...
text: A BEAT.
text: Billy just stares at her, unsure what to say.
speaker_heading: JOM
dialog: I spend next thirty-five years of
dialog: my life here...very much afraid.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I had boyfriend, say he love me.
dialog: Then he lie and cheat, and I slit
dialog: his throat when he beat me.
text: Billy is silent.
speaker_heading: JOM
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Do you have girlfriend in prison?
text: Just then, two Trustees arrive to escort Billy from the
text: compound. He struggles to rise, chains rattling...glancing
text: back once at Jom as he leaves...
scene_heading: 70 EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAY, LATER - BILLY 70
text: walks with great difficulty through the yard, flanked by
text: Trustees. The iron cuffs cutting into Billy's ankles...step
dialog: by step...
text: A few Samurai hang around...Billy keeps walking.
scene_heading: 71 INT. SECTOR 5 CELL - LATE NIGHT - BILLY + KIAW 71
text: face to face, both high, smoking heroin, lying under blankets
dialog: to avoid being seen by Guards.
text: The effects of the drug hit Billy hard. He crawls out of the
text: blanket amidst a plume of SMOKE. Slumps back against a wall,
text: sweating, heart pounding, eyes/lungs burning...
text: Thru Billy's haze he/we see/hear...a Thai pop-music video
text: playing on a small tv, sealed to the wall...Fans whirring...
text: Kiaw's lighter sparking under a blanket...Smoke and heat
dialog: rising...
text: Then, cell boss, Keng, sits up and signals to other Samurai.
text: One by one, three then four then five get up, and quietly
text: scale over other prisoners sleeping...making their way toward
dialog: the Young Thai inmate (we saw initiated earlier).
dialog: 37.
text: Billy stares, unsure what's happening.
text: Suddenly, Keng and five Samurai throw themselves onto the
text: Young Thai, cover his mouth and rape him.
text: Billy tries to move. Can't. The attack's silent. Terrifying,
text: AIDS infecting. The Thai pop-song keeps playing...
scene_heading: 72 EXT. OUTDOOR KITCHEN: PRISON COURTYARD - MORNING - COOKS 72
text: crack eggs, scramble, pour, flip and fold them. The stoves
text: are electric. PRISONERS wait in line for omelets, then move
text: to a gallery of lawn chairs and eat.
speaker_heading: BILLY + KIAW
text: sit on buckets, using toothbrushes to scrub their ankles
text: beneath their shackles. Their eyes are hollow, black circles
text: from weeks of abuse. Track marks visible.
text: Billy scrubs roughly...His ankle starts to bleed. He keeps
dialog: scrubbing.
text: Suddenly the sound of HUNDREDS OF PRISONERS WHISTLING, making
text: CAT-CALLS in Thai. Billy and Kiaw look up --
text: Jom -- in a long wig and makeup -- is being escorted through
text: the yard by TRUSTEES. She swings her hips with exaggerated
text: sexiness, like a peacock flaunting it's feathers.
text: Billy is surprised at how attractive she looks.
text: Jom sees Billy, waves and calls out to him:
speaker_heading: JOM
dialog: Hey, farang ba! You think me
dialog: beautiful?
text: Billy just watches. No words.
text: Jom enters a shop with an encaged window for protection. The
dialog: Trustees lock her in. Ready for business...
scene_heading: 73 EXT. PRISON SHOP AREA: COURTYARD - DAY - BILLY 73
text: is trying to find cigarettes from one of the shops and stands.
text: It's loud, unruly: DOZENS OF PRISONERS all bargaining,
text: arguing, shoving at once.
text: Billy gestures over the noise. Every SHOP OWNER refuses him.
speaker_heading: ANGLE, JOM
text: behind the counter of a CAGED-IN SHOP. She's selling
dialog: cigarettes, toiletries, coffee, homemade Valentine cards, etc,
dialog: along with May and Char.
dialog: 38.
text: Deep in the crowd, Jom sees Billy -- frustrated, vulnerable.
text: Billy notices Jom watching, and works his way toward her.
speaker_heading: JOM
dialog: (smiles, flirtatious)
dialog: Hello. How I can help you?
text: Billy, getting bumped on all sides, tries to hold ground.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: ...cigarettes...
speaker_heading: JOM
dialog: Five dollar.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (pause, low)
dialog: Can I buy `em on credit?
text: Jom looks at him.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (lying)
dialog: -- I'm expecting some cash from me
dialog: mum.
text: Jom regards him, then opens her ACCOUNT BOOK.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: William Moore.
speaker_heading: JOM
dialog: I know...
text: She writes down Billy's name with a baht amount.
speaker_heading: JOM
dialog: I give you fifty dollar credit. Pay
dialog: me back when you can?
text: Billy nods, embarrassed.
text: Jom slides him a CARTON OF CIGARETTES.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (pause, then)
dialog: -- I never thanked you for fixin'
dialog: me head. So...
dialog: Billy nods "thanks."
speaker_heading: JOM
dialog: You want, I can be your sexy
dialog: girlfriend...
dialog: 39.
text: Billy's uncomfortable. VERY uncomfortable. So Jom just smiles
text: and then he leaves. Jom watches him go.
scene_heading: 74 EXT. SECTOR 5 CELL - NIGHT - BILLY 74
text: and a THIN SAMURAI trade cigarettes for straws of heroin.
scene_heading: 75 LATER - BILLY 75
text: is hunched under a blanket. He cuts two lines of heroin on a
text: bucket. Billy SNORTS one line, quickly switches nostrils,
text: SNIFFS the other, both barrels.
text: Billy's eyes press shut, to ESCAPE, for a moment. SILENCE...
dialog: precious silence...
text: Billy lifts an edge of the blanket, peers out: Thin Samurai
text: sits there, smoking a cigarette, watching him.
scene_heading: AMBIENT SOUND/REALITY...SELF-HATRED comes back;
text: Thin Samurai smiles, puts the cigarette out on his tongue.
text: Then he eats it.
text: Billy just looks at him. Then --
text: REVEAL NOW, across the cell...the YOUNG SAMURAI w/tattooed
text: hands. His head is bowed as Keng uses the CROOKED KNIFE we
text: saw earlier to shave Young Samurai's scalp...Slowly,
text: methodically...hair falls in bits, revealing Young Samurai's
text: scalp is full tattooed with the image of a DRAGON.
text: Billy watches this ritual, nightmarish and surreal --
scene_heading: 76 I/E. SECTOR 5 CELL - DAWN - BILLY 76
text: is alone at the bars. Arms slung over the crossbars, smoking
text: a cigarette. Quiet, sullen.
text: It's DAWN - faint Buddhist and Muslim CHANTING O.C.
text: Kiaw hides a handful of heroin straws in a SHAMPOO BOTTLE.
text: Billy notices. Kiaw looks at him, smiles.
text: Billy picks up the carton of cigarettes. Only one pack left.
text: When he opens it, he finds a small NOTE tucked inside between
text: cigarettes. Billy mumbles low, as he reads --
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: "Hi Billy.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: You missing me, yes or no?...I want
dialog: you be a good man for me, Billy. I
dialog: can be a good person for you
dialog: too...Can't say love now, but when
dialog: everything okay, you will be the
dialog: one, my boyfriend."
text: At the bottom of the note, a lipstick mark. Signed: "Jom"
text: Billy's jaw tenses. Silent. Disturbed.
text: Then, we hear the sound of MEN RUNNING. A lot of men. Billy
text: looks up: THE MUAY THAI BOXING TEAM is doing wind sprints in
text: the yard. Back and forth, powerful as horses, no one out
dialog: there but them.
text: Billy watches. One man coaching, looks up: NAN, smoking a
text: cigarette. Eyes meet.
text: And as the team keeps running...
text: The chanting grows louder... Louder... Fearful... CUT TO:
speaker_heading: BLACK.
text: A LOUD SIREN SCREAMS ACROSS THE PRISON GROUNDS......
scene_heading: 77 INT. SECTOR FIVE CELL - LATE NIGHT - BILLY 77
text: and all his cellmates bolt up. Billy looks at Kiaw:
speaker_heading: KIAW
dialog: Someone killed...
speaker_heading: SMASH TO:
scene_heading: 78 EXT. PRISON WALKWAY - LATE NIGHT - MOVING SHOT: ELYIAS 78
text: lies mortally wounded -- the CROOKED SAMURAI KNIFE plunged
text: into his chest, as Trustees quickly push him on a cart to--
scene_heading: 79 THE COURTYARD 79
text: where Officer Pi Sit + Guards have also found the corpses of
text: Trustees #1 + #2, blood sodden, knife wounds bleeding out.
text: Guards HEAVE the corpses onto PUSHCARTS. An ENRAGED Officer
dialog: Pi Sit shouts in Thai at Guards and Trustees, and we--
speaker_heading: SMASH TO:

speaker_heading: GUARDS
dialog: 41.
text: in riot gear -- move FAST and LOUD, charging into cells with
text: batons, flashlights and DOGS -- shouting rapid-fire Thai as --
speaker_heading: PRISONERS
text: are violently grabbed, yanked out -- Their cells are
text: ransacked -- bedding and pillows ripped apart -- bins dumped
text: over -- false bottoms kicked out...sifting, searching...
scene_heading: 81 INT. SECTOR 5 CELL - THAT MOMENT - BILLY 81
text: peers through the bars to get a glimpse of what's happening.
text: We HEAR distant mayhem. Batons hitting flesh. Men screaming
text: insanely.
text: Billy turns to see all of the Samurai sitting in silence.
text: Cross-legged, waiting. Only Keng looks at Billy...and
text: gestures for him to stay quiet.
text: The sound of beatings/screaming intensifies as the raid gets
text: closer to their cell.
text: Billy tries to swallow his fear, but it's impossible.
text: We begin hearing FOOTSTEPS somewhere. Lots of them. Coming
text: hard and fast. HEAVY KEYS jangling.
text: Billy steps back.
text: He blinks.
text: CUT TO BLACK/THEN ABRUPT TO:
scene_heading: 82 THAT MOMENT - GUARDS 82
text: crash in. So fast, so frightening, giving us only glimpses --
speaker_heading: BILLY + KIAW
text: and other Samurai are roughly grabbed and thrown in line.
text: A few Samurai protest/spit back -- Dogs bark and bite them --
text: Guards kick and punch them -- smashing batons across Samurai
text: bare backs with relentless force.
text: Billy sees another Samurai being dragged out by the hair.
text: Contraband hits the floor: cell phones, chargers, pocket
text: knives, spikes, shivs, drug paraphernalia, porn mags;
text: Guards keep shouting -- Terrified prisoners are marched along
text: landings -- down stairs -- Billy and Kiaw among them....
dialog: 42.
text: Chaos everywhere, impossibly violent. Then;
scene_heading: 83 EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - PRE DAWN - BILLY + KIAW + 83
text: the ENTIRE PRISONER POPULATION stand in rows, nude, their
text: clothes on the ground. For Billy, and those in shackles,
text: their shorts/underwear are pulled to their ankles.
text: SILENCE IS DEAFENING. BRIGHT LIGHTS FLOOD THE YARD.
text: GUARDS body-search the prisoners one by one, then search
dialog: their clothes. The dead bodies of Elyias, Trustees #1 + #2
text: displayed for all to see.
text: Billy sees Nan and the Boxing Team amongst prisoners, also
text: nude. Nan doesn't notice Billy.
text: Then, TRUSTEES push Jom, May and Char to a distant corner,
text: wearing bras and panties. For the first time, we see Jom
dialog: without any makeup on.
text: She looks at Billy, his pale, naked body amongst tattooed
text: Samurai. Jom stares...Billy looks away...it's awkward.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PI SIT
text: walks the line, tapping his baton against his leg, scanning
text: prisoners' faces, a cold anger in his eyes...
text: A paranoid Kiaw VERY SUBTLY kicks his shirt on the ground in
text: front of Billy...but Billy doesn't notice.
text: The Guards are getting closer, roughly searching prisoners
dialog: and their clothes.
text: THEN Bull Guard arrives/searches Billy: mouth, ears, feet,
text: balls, armpits, ass.
text: Bull Guard grabs Kiaw's shirt off the ground (thinking they
dialog: are Billy's). Billy SEES they aren't his...
text: Bull Guard folds back the seam of Kiaw's shirt: REVEALING A
text: HIDDEN POCKET stitched inside.
text: Billy glances at Kiaw in disbelief...Kiaw just stares ahead.
text: Bull Guard rips the pocket out, finds: STRAWS OF HEROIN --
text: then shouts in Thai to Officer Pi Sit.
text: Officer Pi Sit walks over. Takes the heroin. Bites open one
text: straw, tastes the powder.
text: Officer Pi Sit glares at Billy.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Those aren't mine.
text: Kiaw says something in Thai. Bull Guard shouts angrily back.
text: Kiaw talks/gestures to Billy -- says the heroin is his;
text: Billy shakes his head "no," frantic, terror stricken. Officer
text: Pi Sit just keeps staring at him.
text: As Bull Guard shouts in Thai, Billy snatches the shirt from
text: his hands and tries to put it on.
text: Too small. Doesn't fit. A SLEEVE rips, then hangs off.
text: Bull Guard goes silent. Officer Pi Sit looks at Billy and
text: Kiaw. A VERY SCARY, VERY INTENSE MOMENT.....
text: Officer Pi Sit turns, signals sharply to the Trustees.
text: IN A FLASH, the Trustees grab Kiaw and fiercely hurry him out
dialog: of the yard.
text: Kiaw protests, frantic-- as Billy watches, shackled, still.
text: Trustees wrestle Kiaw to an upstairs office and shut the door.
text: There's a sudden SQUALL OF FEEDBACK over the LOUD SPEAKERS,
text: followed by SOUNDS of footsteps scuffling -- A door being
text: slammed -- A chair being dragged -- Kiaw being interrogated --
text: IT GOES ON AND ON FOR A FEW SECONDS, THEN JUST STOPS.
speaker_heading: SILENCE.
text: Then the SCREAMING begins.
text: Billy and the prisoners are frozen, listening to the SOUND OF
text: KIAW'S BLOOD-CHILLING SCREAMS as TRUSTEES SAVAGELY BEAT HIM
text: WITH BATONS.
scene_heading: 84 I/E. - VARIOUS P.A. SPEAKERS + PRISON LOCATIONS - THAT MOMENT 84
text: The beating/screams/sobs broadcast across the entire prison.
scene_heading: 85 EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - BILLY + PRISONERS 85
text: all staring at the speakers: NOBODY MOVES, NOBODY SPEAKS.
text: HOLD ON BILLY, this just awful moment.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 44.
scene_heading: 86 INT. LARGE ANTECHAMBER - DAY 86
text: A rather dark room, or lobby, filled with inmates lounging
text: and smoking cigarettes. Billy is high, among them.
text: The antechamber is connected to a small cell. And behind
text: those bars: a dressed up Jom is singing Karaoke. May and Char
text: sing back-up, lyrics roll on a shitty tv, as Jom sings into a
text: microphone. It's a slow, very seductive Thai BALLAD...
speaker_heading: BILLY
text: his eyes glazed, watching Jom through the smoke...as do all
text: the other inmates. The room pulses slowly. Billy is totally
text: captivated by Jom's singing and stares without blinking.
text: Jom looks right at Billy, as if singing just for him. With
text: the effects of the drugs -- DREAMLIKE, SURREAL -- Jom becomes
text: emotional as she sings, appearing like a star...an angel...
dialog: For Billy, forgetting the prison surroundings for just this
text: moment, he's trancelike...mesmerized...as if he and Jom are
text: alone. Even the cell bars disappear;
text: When the song ends, Billy continues watching Jom and everyone
text: else loudly APPLAUDS.
scene_heading: 87 EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAYS LATER, MORNING - WIDE 87
text: The usual chaos and activity. We hear a TRUSTEE'S VOICE over
dialog: the loudspeaker:
speaker_heading: TRUSTEE'S VOICE
dialog: William Moore, yat yeim...William
dialog: Moore, yat yeim
text: No sign of Billy. Instead, he --
scene_heading: 88 INT. SECTOR 5 CELL - MORNING - BILLY 88
text: lies inert on his blanket, alone in the cell. A shirt covers
text: his face. Kiaw's shampoo bottle is open, empty, next to him.
speaker_heading: BULL GUARD
text: stands over, puts a boot on Billy's chest. No response. He
text: yanks the shirt off Billy's face.
text: Billy's mouth is wide, eyes rolled back. Looks like a corpse.
text: Bull Guard lifts Billy's head, shakes it. Then harder. Billy
text: is totally limp.
text: Bull Guard gives him a VIOLENT KICK to the ribs. Billy's eyes
text: snap back in place. He wakes up, as if from a coma.
dialog: 45.
text: Bull Guard shouts something in Thai.
text: Billy doesn't get up, zombie-like.
text: Bull Guard yanks him to his feet, throws a sky-blue uniform
text: shirt on him, and drags him out of the cell.
scene_heading: 89 INT. VISITING AREA - MORNING - BILLY 89
text: is dragged in by Bull Guard, chains jangling. He's dumped
text: onto a stool before a STEEL MESH PARTITION.
text: Billy almost falls over. Bull Guard sits him up straight.
text: Billy is badly disheveled, bloodshot eyes, grey skin,
text: unshaven, beyond high. To his left and right, PRISONERS shout
text: back and forth to VISITORS on the opposite side -- ten feet
text: apart -- divided by bars/mesh. A BABY cries. It's madness.
text: Like talking across a freeway.
text: BILLY'S POV swims for a moment to an OUT OF FOCUS VISITOR
text: seated on the other side of the mesh...
text: As Billy blinks, strains to see, the Visitor comes INTO FOCUS
text: revealing: NINDAM (the young boy from the opening scene.)
text: He stares at Billy in shock. Shock of his decay. Shock of time
dialog: gone by.
text: Billy looking back, his bloodshot eyes moving down to:
text: BILLY'S POV -- NINDAM'S HANDS, holding a small TROPHY. He
text: grips it nervously, speaking slow and distinct; unsure if
dialog: Billy understands:
speaker_heading: NINDAM
dialog: ...Billy...you hear me?
text: Billy's mouth moves: no words come out.
speaker_heading: NINDAM
dialog: I win tournament. In Bangkok. Muay
dialog: Thai, number one.
text: Billy tries to respond. Strains to focus...Can't.
text: Then, Nindam sadly sets an OLD GYM BAG on the divider:
text: Billy's gym bag.
speaker_heading: NINDAM
text: This from gym locker. We wait long
dialog: time. Can no more keep for you...
dialog: (upset)
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: 46.
text: Billy clenches his jaw-- a flood of emotion roils inside him.
text: Nindam FEELS it too, trying to be brave...
speaker_heading: NINDAM
dialog: Next time I fight...when you leave
dialog: here, me want you walk me to ring.
text: Billy tries to smile. It falls quickly;
speaker_heading: NINDAM
dialog: (low, tears welling now)
dialog: ...bye, Billy...
text: Billy nods -- fighting back tears. Nindam, staring at him.
text: Then quietly, as if whispering a prayer...
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: bye.
text: As Billy stands, Bull Guard searches him, checks his chains.
text: Nindam watches desperately.
text: After a moment, Billy turns back to look at Nindam...
dialog: ...He's gone.
dialog: Billy, seeing it...feeling every fucking bit of it...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 90 INT. SECTOR 5 CELL - MORNING, WEEKS LATER - BILLY 90
text: Time has passed. He sits alone, clean shaven, writing a
text: letter in pencil.
text: We see GLIMPSES of his crude, childlike handwriting:
dialog: "...I know how difficult this is...""...I made a mistake..."
dialog: "...no one to blame but myself..."
scene_heading: 91 INT. CHAIN ROOM - DAY - BILLY 91
text: is having his chains removed by the Blacksmith. Officer Pi
text: Sit stands nearby with Bull Guard;
text: After the shackles are pried off, Billy stretches his legs.
text: The lack of weight is relieving.
text: Bull Guard signals Billy to sit on the floor.
dialog: He does, then;
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (to Officer Pi Sit)
dialog: I want to fight.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PI SIT
dialog: You already did that.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I mean with the team. I need to
dialog: fight...
text: Officer Pi Sit stares.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You understand me.
speaker_heading: BEAT.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PI SIT
dialog: It's you who no understand.
dialog: (off Billy's look)
dialog: Boxing come with good behavior,
dialog: long time. We have prison
dialog: tournament each year, government
dialog: allowed. A chance for boxers at
dialog: life, privilege...and honor.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You've earned nothing, William
dialog: Moore.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: So let me fight. I need it to
dialog: change. That's something...
speaker_heading: OFFICER PI SIT
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BEAT;
text: Billy reaches into his pocket, pulls out a folded addressed
dialog: envelope.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Will you mail this?
text: Pi Sit doesn't move.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: It's for me mum.
text: Pi Sit takes the envelope. Then he pulls out a SWITCHBLADE
text: and swiftly cuts the envelope open.
dialog: 48.
text: Billy watches, uncomfortable, as Pi Sit reads the letter
text: inside. After a silence, he nods to Billy that he'll mail it.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 92 EXT. SHOP AREA - ANOTHER DAY - JOM 92
text: is working, selling. She wears a tight t-shirt that says,
text: "GUILTY" across the front. Muscular Trustee stands sentry.
speaker_heading: BILLY
text: without his chains, approaches the shop and Jom smiles, bats
text: her eyelashes.
speaker_heading: JOM
dialog: Hi, Billy! Missed you!
dialog: (off Billy's look--)
dialog: Long time, I thought you got
dialog: released...
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I, uh...I need cigarettes. A lot of
dialog: `em.
speaker_heading: JOM
dialog: You need for drugs?
text: Billy looks at Muscular Trustee.
speaker_heading: JOM
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Relax. He no speak English.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: -- No, it's not for that. Not this
dialog: time.
text: Billy's hand is on the counter. Jom watches his expression as
text: she reaches through the bars, slowly...and lays her hand on
text: his. The tips of her fingers brush Billy's scarred knuckles,
text: lightly back and forth.
text: He's uncomfortable, and slides his hand back.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I can pay you back. I mean, I will.
text: They look at each other for a moment, then...
speaker_heading: JOM
dialog: I believe you.
text: She gives him a CARTON OF CIGARETTES, then discreetly hands
text: him another LOVE NOTE. Billy pockets it.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: JOM
dialog: (then, re: the cigarettes)
dialog: What they for?
scene_heading: 93 EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - RIGHT AFTER - MOVING WITH BILLY 93
text: through the heat and congested yard. He grips the cigarette
text: carton in one hand, his old gym bag in the other.
text: He pulls Jom's note from his pocket, throws it away without

text: Then Billy looks, walks with steely determination toward --
scene_heading: 94 E/I. THE PRISON BOXING GYM 94
text: -- and reaches for the gate. From inside, a BAMBOO STICK
text: comes down hard. Billy yanks his hand back...It's Nan.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You speak English?
speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: (stares; then)
dialog: ...Some.
text: Billy holds up the carton of cigarettes. Says intensely:
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Let me train, and they're yours.
scene_heading: BEAT. HOLD. THEN:
text: Nan draws back the gate. Takes the cigarettes. Billy enters.
scene_heading: 95 INSIDE THE GYM - MOMENTS AFTER - TWENTY BOXERS 95
text: work out. It's very loud. Desk Guard in the corner.
speaker_heading: BILLY
text: stands ringside, and wraps his own hands. Nan lights a
text: cigarette and watches as Billy pulls a small jar of Vaseline
text: from his gym bag and greases up his face, then inserts his
text: old mouthpiece and bites down. Last, he pulls out his old
text: boxing gloves (worn in, blood-stained).
text: Billy puts them on, looks to Nan to lace them.
text: As Nan laces Billy's gloves, he sees the SCARS on Billy's arm
text: and looks at him. Billy says nothing. Nan finishes tying the
dialog: gloves.
text: Billy climbs into the ring, THROUGH the ropes...and waits.
dialog: 50.
text: Nan looks around the gym at all the BOXERS training. He
text: gestures to one: LEK (20's) -- lean, tattooed, much smaller
dialog: than Billy -- to get in the ring.
text: Billy, dead staring, watches as Lek steps OVER the ropes and
text: moves to a corner...
text: There's a moment. A LONG one.
speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: Chok!(fight)
text: Billy charges out fast. Lek feels his aggression and starts
dialog: to circle.
text: Billy attacks and Lek nails him with a front kick to the
text: chest. Billy takes it, then fires a punch. Blocked. A leg
text: kick. Blocked. Lek snaps Billy's head back with a jab. Then
dialog: again. And again.
text: Then a HUGE KICK to the jaw -- THAT HITS WITH THE IMPACT OF A
text: TRUCK -- Billy goes down in a heap.
text: He shakes it off, clears his head. Other Boxers stop what
text: they're doing and watch as Billy picks himself up, fire in
text: his eyes...and goes after Lek with a vengeance --
text: Within moments, Lek is throwing and battering Billy like a
text: rag doll. Pounding him at will, with solid PUNCHES and KICKS
text: that knock Billy to the canvas over and over.
text: Billy keeps getting up...But the harder he retaliates, the
text: harder he gets hurt.
text: Nan, ringside, stoically smokes cigarettes, as --
text: Finally, Lek grabs the back of Billy's head, hauls it down
text: and launches knee after knee after knee into Billy's ribs.
text: Billy goes down hard. He slowly gets up. Balance wavers. Then
text: he turns and VOMITS over the top rope;
dialog: Humiliated.
text: Nan nods to Lek, who then exits the ring.
text: Billy looks up at all the Boxers talking in Thai, joking and
dialog: laughing about Billy.
text: He exits the ring...Nan removes the gloves, saying nothing.
text: An assistant trainer, TANE (45) approaches with a MOP and
text: BUCKET on wheels. He points to Billy's puke with disdain.
dialog: 51.
text: Billy mops the floor.
text: The Boxers resume training.
text: When Billy finishes, he shoves the gate back, and leaves.

text: wrapped in a towel against his face. His head is throbbing,
text: ribs and legs hideously bruised and swollen...
text: He takes the ice pack off, revealing bad facial damage: Black
text: eyes, forehead knotted with welts. Dried blood in his nose.
text: He runs a finger inside his mouth, spits blood on the ground.
text: Billy sets the ice-pack on the back of his neck, and hangs
text: his head. A portrait of abject loneliness.

dialog: Billy doesn't understand;
text: Bull Guard then shouts at Keng and a few others in Thai ("Who
dialog: fucked this guy up?! He looks like shit, who did this?!")
dialog: The Samurai all deny it.

dialog: sparring, getting massages, etc.
text: They all ignore him;
text: Lek is pounding a heavy bag. He stops and looks at Billy.
text: Lek smiles, nods...Billy nods back. There's a mutual respect
dialog: in this exchange.
text: Nan sits on the steps of the ring and lights a cigarette.
scene_heading: 103 TIMECUTS - BILLY 103
text: stretches alone...the bruises and welts make it difficult.
text: Billy jumps rope. His legs are sore. Feet get tangled.
text: Billy's slow on the heavy bag. Sweats profusely, breathing
dialog: hard. Skills/body gone dormant from drugs.
text: Billy does sit-ups hanging off a bench. Grimaces thru a set.
text: No one holds his legs.
text: Billy shadowboxes before a large mirror. He watches the other
text: boxers, and tries to emulate their movements...
text: ...then, Billy sees his own reflection: the face/body of a
dialog: drug addict. Inward/outward decay.
text: Billy can't look at himself.
text: As Nan finishes his last cigarette, CUT TO:

dialog: All except Pon.
text: Billy, bewildered by it all, dives into the team. All of them

dialog: from his Mum quietly to himself;
text: Deep emotion fills Billy's face. He wipes his eyes.
speaker_heading: SMASH TO:
scene_heading: 129 E/I. SPORT TEAMS' CELL - PRE DAWN - GUARDS 129

text: A Guard gives them a head count.
scene_heading: 130 EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAWN - WIDE: 130
text: The yard is very still, very quiet.
text: As the sun dips low, the boxing team, in silhouette, jogs
text: laps around the courtyard.
text: Billy runs among the them...He sees a rapist Samurai, naked,
text: hands tied behind his back, being forced to roll in the yard,
text: while getting kicked and humiliated by Guards.
text: Billy looks up at the Sector 5 Cell, sees the rest of the
text: Samurai behind bars, watching. Billy keeps jogging...

scene_heading: 131 INT. SPORT TEAMS' CELL - NIGHT - BILLY 131
text: lies on his stomach in the dark, amidst a circle of Boxers,
text: conducting a sacred Sak Yant tattoo ritual.
text: It's EXTREMELY HOT, EXTREMELY INTENSE. Lek and two Boxers
text: hold Billy down, as another: TIGER uses a 40cm long needle
text: (the "Mai Sak") to apply the ink onto Billy's back with fast,
text: repeated jabs....the image of a LEAPING TIGER beginning...
text: Billy fights the pain, holding it in;
text: The boxers invoke a deep, hypnotic mantra (the "Kata"), some
text: clutching amulet fragments, the chanting becomes ONE VOICE...
text: CU's. Billy's pores, needle scraping ink made of snake venom,
text: and jabbing. Lek wipes blood off Billy's back, revealing the
text: Leaping Tiger and SAK YANT tattoos forming.
text: Billy's eyes roll back, the mantra inducing a trance state.
text: As Nan blows into the tattoo, the Boxers become shadows,
text: silhouettes...The cell walls fading. All we see is Billy. All
dialog: we hear is chanting...
scene_heading: 132 EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAY - BILLY 132
text: walks alone, thinking. Time has passed. His bandage is gone.
text: Billy watches the swirl of activity from a distance.
text: Prisoners eating in the outdoor kitchen. And Jom, in her

text: Billy stares for a moment...then keeps walking.
dialog: 67.
scene_heading: 133 EXT. PRISON GYM: CANTEEN - DAY - BILLY, NAN + BOXING TEAM 133

speaker_heading: BILLY

speaker_heading: THAI BOXER

speaker_heading: BILLY

text: The Team laughs. Billy can't help but smile.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: How `bout you?
speaker_heading: THAI BOXER
dialog: No, I no do drugs...I just kill.

text: Nan stands at the ropes, instructing.

text: Billy pounds the canvas with his fist, in frustration.

speaker_heading: LEK
dialog: Do you have father?

speaker_heading: LEK

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: ...no...we don't talk anymore.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 138 INT. LOCKER AREA - DAY - BILLY 138

text: It's Kiaw. Cold stare at Billy.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Kiaw...When'd they let you out?
speaker_heading: KIAW
dialog: When I heal.
text: Billy sees new scars on Kiaw's face. They're unnerving.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I haven't got time for this.
speaker_heading: KIAW
dialog: Your hair look good...
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: --What?
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: KIAW
dialog: You take my shampoo bottle-- smoke

text: Billy's silent. Then:
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: So? You was gonna throw me to the

speaker_heading: KIAW
dialog: That heroin belong to Samurai. Cost
dialog: much money!
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: That's your problem...
text: Kiaw persists, getting angry:
speaker_heading: KIAW
dialog: You pay now.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (in disbelief--)
dialog: I don't owe you nothin'.
text: SOMEONE WHISTLES from above...A GUARD on the balcony. He
text: sharply gestures to Billy and Kiaw to move on.
text: Billy walks away. Kiaw steps in his path:
speaker_heading: KIAW
dialog: You know I have AIDS. You pay my
dialog: debt to Samurai or I inject you
dialog: with my blood.
text: Kiaw holds Billy's stare: it's murderous. Then, he leaves.
scene_heading: 139 INT. PRISON INFIRMARY - AFTERNOON - BILLY 139
text: and a few other BOXERS sit on a bench, having their training
text: injuries treated by DOCTORS: cut knuckles, cut lips and

text: Billy, still angry, is having his bruised ribs taped.
text: A GERMAN INMATE in his 60's -- pale, fat, sweaty -- sits on
text: another bench, waiting, eating a plate of food.
text: Near the medical hatch, Jom is talking to a MUSCULAR TRUSTEE,
text: fanning herself with a Chinese fan and flirting.
text: She notices Billy-- glancing over, then ignores him and
text: struts toward the other Boxers, as if an audience:
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: JOM
dialog: ...You good fighters, not bad. My
dialog: father want me to be Muay Thai,
dialog: like him.
text: The Boxers all look at her, in disbelief. Jom smiles;
speaker_heading: JOM
dialog: But his dream not mine. I start
dialog: taking hormones when I was fifteen.
dialog: Father say I bring great shame, and
dialog: he disown me.
text: (she looks deliberately at
dialog: Billy--)
dialog: But now I am who I want to be.
dialog: Happy with myself.
text: Billy, simmering, as Jom turns back to Muscular Trustee and
dialog: smiles;
speaker_heading: JOM
dialog: My only regret is I should have had
dialog: kids before I cut my dick off.
text: Muscular Trustee smiles back. Billy hides his jealousy, but
text: can't keep from watching Jom deliberately feign affection for
dialog: Muscular Trustee.
speaker_heading: GERMAN INMATE
dialog: Well me, I like to fuck `em
dialog: younger. Much younger...Dick or no
dialog: dick, it don't matter.
text: The German grins. Jom looks at him, uncomfortable.
text: For Billy, the tension rises to a boiling point.
speaker_heading: GERMAN INMATE
dialog: (to Jom)
dialog: How many cigarettes to suck me off?
speaker_heading: JOM
dialog: You, Westerner-- what your
dialog: problem?!
speaker_heading: GERMAN INMATE
dialog: -- I haven't got a problem, I've
dialog: got cigarettes. Are you going to
dialog: blow me or not--?!
text: THE SIREN BEGINS TO WAIL: time to go back to the cells.
text: They keep arguing; back and forth. Jom becomes livid,
dialog: shouting in Thai and --
dialog: 71.
text: Billy reacts -- He charges across and yanks the German Inmate
text: up by the neck -- grabs the FORK from his plate --
text: German Inmate SCREAMS, terrified -- as an enraged Billy puts
text: the fork to his throat.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: -- Shut your mouth, or I'll bash
dialog: your fuckin' skull in, nob head!
text: Jom is frozen. Surprised. But also flattered.
speaker_heading: GERMAN INMATE
dialog: (pulls away; then to
dialog: Billy--)
dialog: Fuck off, faggot!
text: A crazed Billy overpowers the German Inmate -- fiercely,
text: intensely -- pushing the fork toward the German's EYE --
dialog: He can't hold Billy off --
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Open your eyes...
text: He doesn't.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I SAID, OPEN YOUR FUCKIN' EYES!!!
text: He does, then shuts them immediately.
text: The fork's within centimeters -- about to force in --
speaker_heading: JOM
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: BILLY, NO! CALM DOWN! LET HIM GO!
dialog: Billy reacts;
text: Now, Muscular Trustee shoves Billy off -- as the Boxers
text: forcibly restrain Billy from killing the German Inmate.
text: Jom moves away, well protected by Muscular Trustee.
text: THE SIREN KEEPS WAILING;
speaker_heading: JOM
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: You scare me, farang...very crazy!
dialog: Can no control yourself!
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: -- You, you're just a whore!
dialog: 72.
text: Jom's eyes go wide with shock. Anger.
speaker_heading: JOM
dialog: -- You make everything bad! You
dialog: fucking junkie! Will never change!
dialog: You think too much!
dialog: (then)
dialog: Mi dong kit mak! (You think too
dialog: much!)
text: Billy, held by Boxers, looks at her -- His rage replaced by
dialog: shame.
speaker_heading: JOM
dialog: I no want see you, farang ba!
dialog: (crazy foreigner) Don't ever come
dialog: around me!
text: Jom leaves down a hall w/Muscular Trustee, who comforts her.
text: Billy is led toward the exit by the Boxers, but he keeps
text: staring after Jom. He feels rejected.
scene_heading: THE SIREN STILL WAILING, AS --
scene_heading: 140 INT. RING: PRISON BOXING GYM - DAY - BILLY 140
text: unleashing a hailstorm of violent Thai kicks, pounding the

scene_heading: 141 INT. RING: PRISON BOXING GYM - LATER - LEK + ANOTHER BOXER 141
text: are in the ring, demonstrating the Ram Muay ritual dance.
dialog: They each wear a "mongkhon" (headband) and "pra jiad"
text: (armbands). Wai Khru music plays on an old radio.
text: Billy and Nan, also in the ring, stand near the ropes.
speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: Ram Muay...before each fight, we
dialog: pledge respect to spirits.
text: Nan points/bows/prays AROUND the ring: the ropes, the canvas,
dialog: the gloves, the fighters themselves...
speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: --Bless...spirit...bless...spirit,
dialog: bless...
text: Billy watches Lek and the boxer gracefully move through a
text: series of rhythmic gestures and postures.
dialog: 73.
text: Billy is deep in a stew of his own confusion, trying to hide
text: his state of mind from the others.
speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: (re: the Ram Muay)
dialog: Now you.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I'm no dancer.
speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: Can no compete tournament without.
text: Billy doesn't move. Nan shoots him an angry look.
speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: Muay Thai more than just "fight."
dialog: Disrespect spirits or no believe,
dialog: you never understand Muay Thai!
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I "believe."
speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: No--!
dialog: (off Billy's look)
dialog: When you at peace, can control

scene_heading: 142 INT. SPORT TEAMS' CELL - EVENING - BILLY 142
text: among the entire Boxing Team, and Football Team, as they

text: His thoughts elsewhere.
speaker_heading: SMASH TO:
scene_heading: 143 INT. RING: PRISON GYM - DAY - BILLY 143
text: is nailed with a punch in this sparring session. A combo of
text: THREE MORE HARD SHOTS from Lek hit Billy clean, and he
text: bounces off the ropes.
text: Lek looks over at Nan, who is standing on the ring apron,
text: watching: Billy is NOT throwing back.
speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: Hands up!
dialog: 74.
text: Billy takes a kick to the chest. Then another. Lek gives an
text: imploring look, then fires a series of PUNCHES; Billy just
text: takes it, refusing to cover.
text: Lek knees his ribs, and Billy slumps forward into a clinch.
text: Lek shoves Billy off, paws with a jab...concerned. Suddenly,
text: Billy dips and CRASHES A HOOK ON LEK'S JAW -- stunning him.
text: As Lek staggers, Billy unleashes FOUR DEVASTATING PUNCHES AND
text: LEK IS BADLY HURT.
speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: Billy! Hya Suk! (that's enough!)
text: Other Boxers stop training now, looking over, as--
text: BILLY KEEPS ATTACKING -- A BARRAGE OF HOOKS, BOTH LEFTS AND
text: RIGHTS -- LEK IS OUT ON HIS FEET.
text: DESK GUARD, ALARMED, SHOUTS SOMETHING IN THAI;
scene_heading: NAN JUMPS IN THE RING, GOES TO JUMP IN-BETWEEN AS --
text: BILLY LANDS A HUGE UPPERCUT AND LEK FALLS, HIS NECK BOUNCING
text: OFF THE BOTTOM ROPE, WHERE HE LAYS, UNCONSCIOUS.
text: SILENCE falls over the gym.
text: Billy is shocked at what he's done. So is Nan, as he quickly
text: goes to Lek's aid.
text: Billy storms out of the ring, rips off his gloves with his
text: teeth, then slams them in a trash bin and leaves...
text: Desk Guard hurries after him.
text: The rest of the Boxers, confused, watch Billy go.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 144 INT. PUNISHMENT CELL - NEXT DAY - BILLY 144
text: is walked in by Desk Guard, holding his belongings. He's been
text: transferred to another cell: 12 square feet. Only five Thai
text: inmates inside.
text: As the Desk Guard shuts the bars, Billy hears someone giggle.
text: He turns to see Noi -- the mentally retarded inmate from
dialog: earlier.
text: No one else says a word.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 75.
scene_heading: 145 INT. PUNISHMENT CELL - DAYS/NIGHTS - BILLY 145
dialog: condemned in here for a week. No talking. Very little light.
dialog: In the days/nights that follow....
text: Billy pounds the wall with his fist. Slow, heavy thuds, that
dialog: come one after another.
text: Billy pumps out sit-ups.
text: Billy does furious push-ups.
text: Noi watches Billy, giggling. Billy stops and looks at him.
text: Billy does push-ups with Noi on his back.
text: Guards enter, drop off food, then lock the bars again.
text: Billy and Noi sit/eat together. Noi smiles. Billy smiles back.
text: Prisoners' clothes hang on a wire. Billy rips it down and
text: uses it as a jump rope.
text: As he does, Billy's eyes glaze over, somewhere else.
text: Billy/Cellmates sleep, inches apart. Noi right next to Billy.
text: Guards enter again. Drop off food. Shut the bars.
text: In back of the cell/shower, Billy helps Noi bathe. Then dries
text: him off with a towel.
text: Later, Billy stands with a DULL RAZOR and starts to shave his
text: own head. Intense expression on his face;
text: All the prisoners watch in ominous silence.
text: A few drops of blood stream down the back of Billy's scalp
dialog: and neck.
text: His head now shaved, he now shaves off his eyebrows...leaving
text: the skin underneath beaded in blood.
text: Guards bring in food; shut the bars.
text: Billy starts shadowboxing. FIRING COMBOS that get faster and
dialog: harder -- More and more violent...
text: The other prisoners move back, nervous, afraid -- Except Noi.
text: Billy keeps punching, pivoting, attacking...dripping with
text: sweat. The combos coming with blazing force and speed --
dialog: 76.
text: Billy finally stops, drops to his knees. Noi applauds, his
text: eyebrows shaved as well.
text: Noi gives Billy water, smiles.
text: And for the first time, Billy SPEAKS in THAI:
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Pom chuu Billy khrap? (My name is
dialog: Billy) Khoun chuu aray? (What's
dialog: your name).

text: with bruises.
text: There's a sound of the door opening and a figure walks in:
text: It's Billy...released from punishment. Brought in by Desk
dialog: Guard.
text: Everyone stares. Billy tries to gather courage as he walks up
dialog: to Nan.
text: There's a long moment before he speaks:
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I fucked up. I know it, Nan.
dialog: Honest.
dialog: Nan says nothing...
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I just lost it, is all. I lost me
dialog: self,-- everything you taught me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: If I could, I'd rip me own heart
dialog: out and show it to you...
dialog: (beat, then)
dialog: I didn't come this far to quit.
text: Nan stares. Silent. Billy tries not to break down.
dialog: 77.
text: Then, Nan hands Billy a pair of BOXING SHORTS. Billy looks
text: down, sees the name written on them:
scene_heading: "CRAZY FARANG"
speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: Tournament very soon. Must train
dialog: twice as hard now. Don't disappoint
dialog: me.
text: Billy nods, quietly comes alive.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (realizes)
dialog: I forgot cigarettes.
speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: I no more smoke. Bad for health.
text: Billy's back on the team. He walks to Lek and sits down next
text: to him. There's a moment...Then, Lek holds out a fist...Billy
text: bumps it, both smile.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 148 INT. PRISON GYM - DAY - BILLY 148

text: lifts it up and down, strengthening his neck.
scene_heading: 149 EXT. COURTYARD: SHOP AREA - ANOTHER DAY - BILLY 149
text: walks in the strangely almost empty courtyard. Like an
text: uncomfortable dream. Suddenly he SEES in the distance...
speaker_heading: NOI
text: sitting alone, on the ground. He's sad, dejected, for once
text: not smiling.
text: Billy walks over. Noi sees Billy and his mood changes
text: immediately. He runs to him with his moldy FLIP-FLOPS split
dialog: down the middle;
speaker_heading: NOI
dialog: BILLY!!!
text: Noi hugs Billy tight.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You need new shoes...
text: Noi doesn't respond.
dialog: 78.
dialog: Billy speaks in Thai:
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Rong tow, see lao. (Your shoes are
dialog: not good)
text: Noi looks up, grunts.
speaker_heading: NOI
dialog: Roo lao! (I know!)
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Pom Ja sue longtow mai hai khun na.
dialog: (I'll buy you new ones.)
text: Noi, a huge smile...He removes his flip-flops, gives them
text: kiss, then HURLS them over the prison wall. He then marches
text: quickly away, singing a Thai song loudly and out of tune.
scene_heading: 150 EXT. SHOP AREA - LATER - BILLY + NOI 150
text: are at a stand, rummaging through items for sale. The shop
text: owner is a VERY OLD THAI PRISONER.
text: Billy inspects items: coffee, shaving cream, soup cans...They
dialog: agree on the flip=flops that Noi likes.
text: As Noi tries them on, Billy then moves to a row of feminine
text: items: lipstick, eye shadow, a woman's headband with a
text: plastic flower attached.
text: He looks up at the Old Man watching him.
text: Billy picks up the flower headband;
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (to the Old Man)
dialog: ...it's not for me...
text: The Old Man SMILES.
text: Noi looks at Billy, concerned. Hopes it's not for him. Shakes
dialog: his head, "no."
text: Billy is amused.
text: Both laugh.
scene_heading: 151 INT. ANTECHAMBER - ANOTHER DAY - BILLY 151
text: is alone in the empty chamber, practicing the Ram Muay dance.
text: The music plays on a bad radio...His movements are stiff,
text: uncomfortable. He's clearly frustrated.
dialog: 79.
text: There's a sound. Billy turns;
speaker_heading: REVEAL: JOM
text: is standing outside the chamber. She wears the hair band with
text: the plastic flower. Two TRUSTEES stand sentry as Jom enters
text: the chamber and walks to Billy.
text: Billy stares at her in silence. Emotion roiling through him.
text: They look at each for a long, unspoken moment.
text: Then Jom steps back and begins to perform the Ram Muay dance.
text: Billy watches, transfixed as she teaches. It's strange and
text: spiritual. Her movements graceful, yet surprisingly powerful.
text: Now, Billy tries, following Jom's lead. Back and forth...She
text: guides him along, together...both moving like water.
text: Both smile. Forgiving.
scene_heading: 152 INT. RING: PRISON BOXING GYM - EVENING (TWO WEEKS LATER - 152

speaker_heading: BILLY + PON
text: engage, grapple, then fight out. It's intense, but more for
text: technique, ironing out Billy's flaws.
text: Mid-round, Pon CRASHES a shin into Billy's kidney. Billy
text: takes it. Covers and assaults, aggressively going after Pon.
text: THE BUZZER ends the round...Billy and Pon bump gloves.
text: IN THE CORNER: Nan gives Billy water, then notices that Billy
text: is sweating profusely.
speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: Faster! Let hands and feet go!
text: Billy takes a labored breath, nods.
speaker_heading: THE BUZZER
text: Billy circles, on the defensive. Pon cuts down the ring and
text: tries to nail him, but Billy avoids and clinches. He's having
dialog: trouble breathing...
text: Pon wrestles Billy to the ropes. Billy hacks and splutters...
text: a few FLECKS OF BLOOD spray onto Pon's shoulder. Only Billy
dialog: notices...
dialog: Something is wrong;
dialog: 80.
text: They break apart and Billy fends off more blows from Pon.
text: THE BUZZER ENDS THE ROUND.
scene_heading: 153 INT. PRISON GYM: BATHROOM - RIGHT AFTER - BILLY 153

scene_heading: 154 EXT. PRISON GYM + COURTYARD - MINUTES LATER - BILLY 154

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (he isn't)
dialog: ...yeah...
speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: Fear is good for fight. Like fire,
