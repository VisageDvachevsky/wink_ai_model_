dialog: (beat)
dialog: This thing's going to trial, with or
dialog: without J. That's a given. What we
dialog: want is to win it. What I liked about
dialog: the committal hearing - despite the
dialog: fact that we've been ordered to stand
dialog: trial, of course - but what I liked
dialog: about the committal was that, for the
dialog: most part, their case looked pretty
dialog: flimsy to me, largely dependent on
dialog: testimony that shouldn't be too hard
dialog: to discredit I wouldn't have thought.
dialog: And if the committal was any
dialog: indicator, J here's their little star.
dialog: If he's not there, they'll need to
dialog: strengthen their brief with something
dialog: else, which they will do. And they'll
dialog: have the time to do it. And I'd
dialog: personally rather tackle the evidence
dialog: I saw at the committal than whatever
dialog: rejigged brief they come up with
dialog: should J suddenly decide to leave. You
dialog: know what I mean?
dialog: (to J)
dialog: So now we should just make proper use
dialog: of the time we have. We'll need to go
dialog: over a bunch of things here. Like, for
dialog: instance, this whole business of the
dialog: car you claim you stole and that you
dialog: claim you saw on the TV. It was just a
dialog: white car wasn't it? Millions of white
dialog: cars in the world. Why was that one so
