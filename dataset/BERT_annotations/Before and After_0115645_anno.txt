dialog: Oh, thanks, Marge.
text: Marge eats a few as she passes them around. JACK,
text: mid-thirties, slim, nice-looking, just beginning to
text: bald, is more interested in the very young redhead
text: beside him than in the game -- and she in him. On
text: Jack's other side, VICKY, Jack's wife, quite overweight,
