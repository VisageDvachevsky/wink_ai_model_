scene_heading: EXT. ALASKAN COAST - DUSK - PRE-TITLES 1
text: TITLE: TWO DAYS AGO. Snowstorm. A single man in a rowboat --
text: the STRANGER -- forges through the icy waters toward the
dialog: coast. It’s hard to say how old he is -- 20s, 40s? -- because
text: he’s so filthy and red-eyed and yet so fiercely driven.
text: In shadows behind him stands the eerie, forbidding SHIP which
text: brought him this far. Hitting the edge of the ice, the
text: Stranger clambers out of his boat and trudges inland, smiling
text: thinly as he sees the boat drift away, no use to him anymore --
text: TITLES ROLL as we follow the Stranger through the wide, eerie
text: twilight of the Alaskan wilderness -- blasted by the wind yet
text: persevering, too yearning and wild-eyed to slow down --
text: As he crests a small ridge of ice, we see a clutch of lights
text: shimmering in the distance: BARROW, ALASKA. An Arctic outpost
text: of a town, an oil and mining outpost ringed with derricks and
text: tundra. The Stranger grins as he sees Barrow twinkling
text: through the snowstorm, and presses onward AS TITLES END --
scene_heading: EXT. SLOPE - SUNDOWN 2
text: TITLE: TONIGHT. A MAN stands, back to the setting sun, his
text: face cloaked in shadows -- until he turns thoughtfully, the
text: light gradually revealing a weathered and soulful gaze. He is
scene_heading: SHERIFF EBEN OLESON, early 30s --
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: Strange.
text: He faces BILLY KITKA, earnest, 40s, wearing a deputy’s badge
text: and shining a flashlight into a snowbank west of Barrow --
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Ain’t it? Who’d do a thing like this?
text: THEIR POV: a smoldering, eerie hole in the snow -- filled with
scene_heading: BURNED CELL AND SATELLITE PHONES --
text: Eben kneels down to examine the firepit, baffled --
speaker_heading: BILLY (cont'd)
dialog: Someone got a little upset about
dialog: roaming charges?
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: Stealing satellite phones’d make
dialog: sense, you could hock them, maybe run
dialog: up charges on someone’s account. But
dialog: burning them?

speaker_heading: 3A
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Kids? Pulling some prank?
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: There’d be a message. “Fuck you” to
dialog: their parents or the world or whoever.
text: Eben walks up toward the summit, thoughtfully --
speaker_heading: EBEN (cont'd)
dialog: Best place to solve this is the Diner,
dialog: Billy. Get people talking, they’1l
dialog: gossip and figure it out for us.
text: Billy watches as Eben keeps hiking toward the crest --
scene_heading: EXT. SUMMIT - SUNDOWN 3
text: The last golden arc of the sun gleams, silhouetting Eben, as
text: Billy comes to join him.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I remember I brought Peggy here on our
dialog: first date.
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: We all did. Not Peggy, I mean, just --
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (light chuckle)
dialog: I gotcha. C’mon, let’s do the sign --
dialog: (studying his friend)
dialog: You okay?
text: Eben stares out at the sun quietly, wistfully --
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: Yeah, I only --
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Last sunset for a month, some years
dialog: it’s easier to take, y’know?
text: Eben turns, not ready to say more, and Billy knows better than
text: to ask. Shoving his feelings down deep, Eben hikes back
text: toward the 4x4 waiting at the bottom of the slope --
speaker_heading: OMITTED 3A
scene_heading: EXT. BARROW CITY LIMITS - DUSK 4
text: The sun’s down, but light filters through approaching night.
text: The 4x4 comes to a stop beside a bright, good-natured sign
dialog: from a Tourism Bureau with a sense of humor:
speaker_heading: 5A
scene_heading: “WELCOME TO BARROW, ALASKA -- TOP OF THE WORLD! POPULATION
scene_heading: 563 -- WARNING! DANGER! POLAR BEARS!”
text: Billy jumps from the 4x4 to the “WELCOME TO BARROW” sign,
text: pulling out some metal tags. Eben calls from the car --
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: Nobody’s gonna see that sign for the
dialog: next thirty days --
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: It’s a tradition!
text: Billy hangs the tags “152” over the “563,” changing the
text: population for the winter. OVER THIS, THE SOUND OF DOGS
scene_heading: BARKING FIERCELY --
scene_heading: EXT. RIIS HOME - DUSK 5
text: Elongating shadows from the fleeting amber daylight. The
text: residential side of Barrow. Homes are built on stilts to
text: avoid the stresses of ice and critters in their foundations.
text: All the homes have crawlspaces underneath, of varying sizes.
text: FOUR HUSKIES ARE BARKING from behind the fence of the RIIS
text: residence -- sled dogs deeply unhappy about something --
text: A SHADOW passes across the screen -- the dogs follow the
text: shadow angrily -- until suddenly there is a GLEAMING FLASH AND
text: HISS OF A BLADE -- the SICKENING SLICE OF A KNIFE INTO FLESH,
text: and the barks are replaced by horrifying WHINES OF PAIN.
scene_heading: EXT. BARROW CITY LIMITS/EBEN’S 4X4 - DUSK 5A
text: At the edge of town, Eben and Billy pull over beside a HUGE
text: SNOWPLOW swerved crookedly onto the shoulder. The back is
text: covered with a tarp; a stream of oil drips from the truckbed.
text: Working under the open hood is BEAU BROWER, late 50s, thick-
text: bearded, an ox of a man with the social skills to match.
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: Little problem?
speaker_heading: BEAU
dialog: (not a glance up)
dialog: Nothin’ I can’t handle my own fuckin’
dialog: self.
text: Eben gets out of his 4x4, circles the vehicle, pulls a leaking
text: GAS CAN from under the tarp.
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: This for generators?
speaker_heading: BEAU
dialog: Mostly.
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: I can’t have it leaking all over the
dialog: roads, Beau. I’1l have to cite you
dialog: for that.
text: He pulls out a citation book, scribbles away as Beau rants --
speaker_heading: BEAU
dialog: You don’t HAVETA cite me. You don’t
dialog: HAVETA do anything. That’s why we
dialog: live up here, innit? So we gotta
dialog: little freedom? Why don’t you run
text: Billy on home so he can cuddle with
dialog: that cute wifey of his? One of us
dialog: oughta get laid tonight, at least --
text: Eben rips a ticket blithely, tucks it in Beau’s parka --
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: Happy motoring.
speaker_heading: BEAU
dialog: I’ll add this to my collection.
text: Eben climbs back in the 4x4 and starts the engine --
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Beau’s not so bad. Why do you bother
dialog: writing him up?
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: He lives all by himself in that cabin
dialog: on the south ridge, y'know? A little
dialog: citation now and then reminds Beau
dialog: he’s part of this town.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: He’s right, though --
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You should drop me at home. The wife
dialog: always likes the first night of the
dialog: Dark --
text: Eben gently smirks as the WALKIE-TALKIE BLARES with the VOICE
dialog: of his elderly dispatcher, HELEN --
speaker_heading: 6A
speaker_heading: HELEN (0.S.)
dialog: Eben, come in, Eben --
speaker_heading: EBEN

dialog: See you in the light, baby -- I’1l be
dialog: good while you’re gone, I promise --
text: TRUCK PAST Tom and his girlfriend through the town’s main
text: drag, still warm in the ebbing light of magic hour. Simple
text: white lights, all the town can afford, spark to life, giving
text: Barrow a naive romance. TOWNSFOLK mill about, celebrating
text: like it’s New Year's Eve. HONKING horns, hugging and kissing.
text: DOUG HERTZ, late 30s, brawny and well fed, kisses HIS WIFE --

scene_heading: EXT./INT. BARROW CITY LIMITS/STELLA’S 4X4 - DUSK 6C
text: Stella's driving, hellbent for the airport. Coming from the
text: left at a desolate intersection is a large DITCH DRILLER -- an
text: enormous RUMBLING truck with treads instead of tires, and a
text: maneuverable ROARING CHAINSAW mounted on its nose. The ditch
text: driller SHOULD stop at a STOP SIGN --
text: But to Stella’s shock, the ditch driller DOESN’T stop,

text: Stella doesn’t have time for Malekai’s sputtering guilt; she

dialog: Who’s gonna run me to the airport?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Wouldn’t Eben -- ?
dialog: Stella sighs deeply; of course Eben would, but --

dialog: to talk, we can do it on the drive --
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS/EBEN’S 4X4 -— DUSK -— RESUME 7B
text: Maybe Eben doesn’t want to talk if this is how she’s gonna be.
text: He covers the cellphone, checks his watch. Opening his door,
text: he YELLS DOWN THE STREET to the departing Billy --
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: HEY, BILLY! Stella’s at Ransom and
dialog: 355, can you get her to a plane?
text: Billy signals thumbs up, hikes off quickly, as Eben calmly
text: gets back on the cell --

speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: I would too -- but then Lucy’d have to

dialog: What ARE they?
text: Wilson Bulosan, in a booth with his father ISAAC, 70s, shakes

speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: We don’t know.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: (dazed, from Alzheimer’s)
dialog: Wilson -- I want to go home --
text: Wilson pats his father soothingly as Doug OVERLAPS in frenzy --
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You shoot ‘em and they keep coming!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: How’s that possible?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I, I don’t, maybe they’re coked up on
dialog: PCP, something so they don’t feel
dialog: bullets? I only got away because they
dialog: found Kay Lopez, I couldn’t save her!
dialog: They killed every sled dog in town --

speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: They took Aaron and Gabe; they’re

speaker_heading: EBEN

text: looks around, does a tactical assessment of the diner --
speaker_heading: EBEN (cont'd)
dialog: Has anyone seen Billy -- ?
dialog: (off the group’s silence)
dialog: You can’t stay here. All the windows,
dialog: the open space --
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Who the hell are these people, Eben?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (over; hitting hysteria)
dialog: What do they want?!!
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: We’ll figure that out after we get all
dialog: of you someplace safe. Maybe the high
dialog: school, or the clinic --
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: They already hit the church; they’1l
dialog: scope out any public place.
text: Eben shoots a quick look at Stella, surprised to be
text: contradicted even as he knows she’s right --
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: There’s a generator at the Utilidor --
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: (considers)
dialog: If we’d headed there when this all
dialog: started, we might’ve made it. But
text: it’s way out on the edge of town; a
dialog: group this size, we'd be spotted
dialog: before we got there. We need
text: someplace close to hide. Now.
text: They rack their brains. Doug watches them anxiously, sweating
dialog: in hope that somebody has an answer --
speaker_heading: DENISE
text: Charlie Kelso’s attic. There’s a pull-
dialog: down ladder, you can’t tell it’s
dialog: there, it’d be tight but we could fit.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: He would’ve boarded up his home before
dialog: he left.
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: (this time HE’S right)
dialog: Which is why it’s a good idea. We can
text: pull down a board to get in, then tack
dialog: it back --
text: Eben searches the room -- who’s the most stable, who does he
text: trust most right now? He settles on his friend Carter --
speaker_heading: EBEN (cont'd)
dialog: Carter, lead people close to the
dialog: buildings, roll under crawlspaces if
dialog: you hear anything. Go straight to
dialog: Charlie’s attic till I get there.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Where’1l you be?
speaker_heading: EBEN
text: Loading up with all the flares and
text: beartraps a 4x4 can carry.
dialog: SOMETHING’s gotta slow ‘em down.
text: Stella follows him toward the door -- their talk now private --

speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Too fast -- no sudden moves --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I’m cold --
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You’1l be colder dead.
text: AN ICICLE -- FORMED OF FROZEN BLOOD -- suddenly falls from the

text: losing a day of life. Then they press on --
scene_heading: EXT. IKOS DINER - NIGHT 45
text: Snowfall. Eben and Stella recon, then hustle into their 4x4 --
scene_heading: INT. EBEN’S 4X4 - NIGHT 46
text: Snowfall. Stella reaches for the keys -- a moment of
text: hesitation as they realize that sound may be their enemy as
text: well. THE ENGINE’s unsettlingly loud as Stella pulls away --
scene_heading: INT. EBEN’S 4X4 - NIGHT 47
text: Snowfall. They turn a corner and drive down Ransom Street --
text: when suddenly they’re JERKED FORWARD against the steering
text: wheel -- the vehicle’s come to a dead halt.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: We’re not moving --
text: It’s true. Warily they look behind them --
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS/EBEN’S 4X4 - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 48
text: SNOWFALL. MARLOW, IRIS AND OTHER CREATURES HOLD ONTO THE BACK
text: OF THE JEEP, LIFTING UP THE REAR TIRES --
text: Stella FLOORS IT -- but she only spins the front wheels in the
text: road, while the rear wheels are lifted higher and higher.
dialog: 49
dialog: 35.
text: The creatures finally up-end the 4x4, turn it on its grille.
text: Falling into the dash, Eben and Stella reach for firearms --
text: One of the creatures rips Stella’s door open -- she FIRES A
text: SHOT THAT CLIPS THE CREATURE ON THE SIDE OF THE HEAD. But
dialog: while anyone else would be reeling, this creature’s only
text: stunned by the shot -- its jaws are still open, slavering --
text: Marlow and Iris finish tipping the 4x4 over -- Eben and Stella
text: are jolted and knocked off-balance --
text: The creatures SMASH Eben’s window -- safety glass blinds him
text: as his gun is grabbed and hurled away into the snow --
speaker_heading: STELLA
scene_heading: EBENNNNNN -- !!!
text: He looks over to see Marlow and Iris dragging Stella from her
text: side of the 4x4, as A GRITTY ROAR RISES FROM NOWHERE --
text: Eben lunges for her desperately, but he’s being pulled out his
text: own side of the 4x4. Their eyes lock: they’re about to die --
text: Until the GRITTY ROAR CLIMAXES: a SNOWPLOW careens out of
text: nowhere, SLAMS Stella's attackers into a brick wall --
text: Beau Brower is behind the wheel. He reaches out, hauls Stella
text: in. She stretches for her dropped gun, but there’s no time --
speaker_heading: BEAU
dialog: Quick, goddamn it!
text: Eben’s attackers turn toward the snowplow -- Eben scrambles
text: and grabs onto the passenger side as Beau FLOORS IT --
text: Eben and Stella are both still clambering inside the cab as
text: Beau’s driving off, he can’t linger an extra second for them.
text: As they land beside Beau, Eben and Stella instinctively look
text: at each other, eyes wide -- they’ve just seen each other
dialog: nearly killed, and it’s hit them each where they live --
text: As the other creatures scramble from the snow, one of Eben’s
text: attackers has latched onto the rear bumper and starts to climb
text: toward the front of the snowplow as Beau ROARS AWAY --
scene_heading: EXT./INT. ROGERS AVENUE/SNOWPLOW - NIGHT 49
text: Snowfall. Beau turns a corner as Eben slams his door shut at

speaker_heading: BEAU
dialog: Who’s gonna write me tickets if you
dialog: get fragged?
text: Eben nods, a little too distracted to acknowledge the point
text: any more than that, as Beau checks the sideview mirrors -- all
text: clear. Then he checks his rearview --
text: THE IMAGE OF THE CREATURE’S EYES AND FANGS FILLS THE REARVIEW!
text: Beau freaks for a moment -- then WHIPS the snowplow under a
text: LOW-HANGING CANOPY, SHEARING OFF THE CREATURE as he rounds
text: another corner, not sure he’s believing what he’s just done --
scene_heading: INT. SNOWPLOW - NIGHT 50
text: Snowfall. Eben WHEEZES, fighting for breath, but with the
text: ROAR of the snowplow, Beau doesn’t notice --
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: We’ve gotta ditch this thing, it just
dialog: calls them!
speaker_heading: BEAU
dialog: And go where?
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: We know a place. Stop here -- !

scene_heading: IN A CRAWLSPACE UNDERNEATH A HOME --
text: CONTINUE TRAVELING for an overview of the whole town -- the
text: majority of the buildings dark with only the occasional
text: generator offering light here and there. The streets are
text: littered with overturned cars on fire, dead bodies lie broken

text: for creatures, while Stella and Beau press up against the side
dialog: of a building --
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: On three.
text: He counts off one finger, two, then they run for it. As they
text: carom through the snow, the Kelso house looks sooo far away --
text: Stella gets there first, uses her car key to pry loose the
text: board over the front door. As it swings loose, Eben and Beau
text: move warily through the front door --
scene_heading: INT. KELSO HOME - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 53
text: Eben and Beau burst inside, breathless, as Stella pulls the
text: board shut. They stand silently by the door, listening for
text: any trace of pursuers. Eben WHISPERS --
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: We can’t try the attic just yet.
dialog: We’ve gotta make sure we weren’t seen,
dialog: we didn’t lead them here.
text: They wait uneasily for a moment --
speaker_heading: EBEN (cont'd)
dialog: Quietly go through the house, see what
dialog: we find --

speaker_heading: BEAU

text: Eben joins Beau in the hall, carrying canned goods, as Stella
text: arrives an armful of candles and a propane heater --
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: And from the master bedroom --
text: She produces a PISTOL. Eben holsters it doubtfully -- knowing
dialog: it won’t help, but it couldn’t hurt, when --
text: THHHHUMMMPP -- a sudden sound from OUTSIDE. The three freeze,
dialog: look to each other --
dialog: 58
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: STELLA (cont'd)
dialog: (tentatively)
text: Snow falling off the roof --
text: They wait, wait -- no further sound. Eben sets down his loot,
text: inspects the hallway ceiling --
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: It’s hidden well --
text: He pulls at a moulding -- a ladder lowers into place. Cocking
text: the pistol, he places a foot on the rungs --
text: Carter’s face slowly edges into view -- shuddering with relief
text: as he sees it’s Eben down below --
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC - NIGHT 58
text: Warm with the amber glow from the propane heater, Stella and
text: Eben huddle with the survivors reeling with shock -- Denise,
text: Doug, Beau, Carter, Lucy, Jake, Wilson and Isaac.
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: How did you know about this attic,
dialog: Denise?
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Does it matter?
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: I need the odds someone else could
dialog: know about it, too.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Um. Charlie hid me here once. When
dialog: his wife came home early from work.
text: The others nod, unwilling to judge. Jake frowns, a little
text: confused. Stella finally settles the matter --
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Glad he did.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (off the canisters)
dialog: How long will these things last?
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: Maybe a week. Maybe a little longer.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Then what?
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: Then we find more.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: And maybe those people give up and go
dialog: elsewhere.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Where are they going to go, exactly?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (as that sinks in)
dialog: I don’t think they ARE people.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (agreeing)
dialog: I saw them -- feed on Helen. They
dialog: wanted her blood. They’re like
dialog: vampires, y'know?
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Vampires are made up, Jake.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Some of them had, like, fangs.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Maybe they think they’re vampires.
dialog: Maybe they filed their teeth down and
dialog: they’re some sort of cult.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (fighting hysteria)
dialog: They don’t fall when you shoot them!
speaker_heading: BEAU
dialog: Hell, neither do I.
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: (agreeing)
dialog: Just because they’re as stubborn as
dialog: Beau doesn’t make them supernatural.
dialog: Look, I don’t care what they are. I
dialog: just care what we do about them.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: There won’t be any help for a month.
speaker_heading: DOUG

dialog: Ohhhhh God --

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: We can’t last that long -- !!
text: Eben rises, determined to put down the growing panic --
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: Look. We need rest. We’1ll sleep in
dialog: shifts. Measure out food. Then
dialog: figure out the next step.
dialog: (a breath)
dialog: We have two advantages. We know
dialog: Barrow. Everything, where to hide,
dialog: where to attack, where to find
dialog: resources. And: we know cold --
text: The others look to Eben, wary but hopeful because they need
dialog: hope so much, and Eben finds a bit more of his stride --
speaker_heading: EBEN (cont'd)
dialog: -- we're Alaskans. We build towns
dialog: where there’s nothing but ice. We
dialog: live here for a reason. Because
dialog: nobody else can.
text: OFF Stella, struck by how Eben rises to the moment --
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS - NIGHT 59
text: TITLE: DAY 3. The snowfall has ended; a half moon lights the
text: streets along with an incongruously glorious array of stars.
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC - NIGHT 60
text: Denise punches buttons on her cellphone again and again; the
text: screen keeps reading “SEARCHING SYSTEM” -- until finally the
text: screen message changes to: “BATTERY EMPTY -- SHUTTING DOWN.”
text: Sighing as another hope slips away, she looks to Carter --
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Does anybody in town have, like, a ham
dialog: radio or something?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Larry Cooper had one, but he moved to
dialog: Dillingham. Even if we could radio
dialog: somebody, they can’t get to us --
text: Eben tears a peephole in a window they’ve covered in tarpaper,
text: Stella takes a look outside. Nothing. Eben looks out
text: himself, thinking for a moment to himself, his thoughts voiced
dialog: before he realizes it --
dialog: 61
dialog: 62
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: If we had kids, this’d be worse.
text: Stella stares at him quietly -- frustrated not as much by the
text: comment, as by why they fight at all. Before she can answer,
text: she’s interrupted by elderly Isaac, sitting up in confusion:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Where’s Catherine? Catherine?
text: Eben watches in concern as Wilson kneels beside Isaac.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Mom died from lung cancer, Dad --
dialog: sixteen years back.
text: Isaac frowns, baffled -- when a SUDDEN CRASH OUTSIDE KILLS THE
text: BREATH IN EVERYONE. Stella joins Eben to peer out --
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT - STELLA’S POV 61
text: The door to a home is lying in the street -- two of Marlow’s
text: creatures are visibly tearing through the place.
speaker_heading: STELLA (0.S.)
dialog: They’re ransacking the Clarks’ place --
dialog: tearing through everyone’s home --
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC - NIGHT - RESUME 62
text: The group absorbs the news with dread, mentally calculating --
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: All right. It’1ll take them a few days
dialog: to get through all the houses --
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (panics, in Eben’s face)
dialog: Then they'll start ripping through the
dialog: boarded-up places -- we have to move!
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: When do you suggest we do that? When
dialog: won’t they be out there hunting?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: We can wait here till they find us and
dialog: kill us all, or we can run like hell!
dialog: Some of us won’t make it, but that’s
dialog: better’n all of us dying -- !
dialog: 63
dialog: 64
dialog: 65
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Then you might want to wait a few more
dialog: days, lose a little weight so you
dialog: won't be bringing up the rear -- !
text: Doug SLAPS Jake hard -- which makes Eben automatically,
text: brutally grab Doug by the neck and stare him down --
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: Start a fight, the noise’ll get us
dialog: killed a lot faster. You want that?
text: Doug hears, sulking. Eben’s gaze sears the point home -- then
text: he drops Doug, takes a deep breath, looks to the others --
speaker_heading: EBEN (cont'd)
dialog: The Utilidor’s the strongest building
text: in town. Its generator’s underground,
dialog: it won’t make any noise. We get
dialog: there, we can last the month. But
dialog: it’s so far, we can’t head there till

scene_heading: INT. ATTIC - NIGHT 64

speaker_heading: EBEN (cont'd)
dialog: They could take her anytime they
dialog: wanted. They’re hoping she’1ll lure
dialog: someone out.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: So we can’t do anything?
text: Doug questions Eben silently. Carter picks up Doug’s gaze;
text: his own glance to Eben carries the implicit challenge -- with
dialog: guys like Doug around, you can’t be helpless while the town is
text: at stake. Eben heeds Carter’s advice, decides --
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: I’m heading out.
speaker_heading: STELLA

dialog: (aside to Stella, private)
dialog: Stella, these folks need hope, you’re
dialog: better at that --

speaker_heading: BEAU
dialog: So let’s go, Eben --
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: I don’t want company.
speaker_heading: BEAU

dialog: We need the bigger weapon here with
dialog: us, Beau. We need you here.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I shot one of them to hell, he just
dialog: shrugged it off. Weapons won’t help.
speaker_heading: BEAU
dialog: (pugnacious)
dialog: Maybe YOURS won't.

text: leans into Stella as he leaves, whispers to her --
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: Told you you’re better with people --
dialog: 45.
text: Stella looks back evenly, not giving him any ground. Holding

speaker_heading: STELLA

speaker_heading: DOUG

text: Eben charges through Riis’s backyard -- but one snowdrift is
text: deeper than he expects, and he loses his balance, reaching out
text: to the chains on a child’s swingset to right himself --
text: Riis lunges for Eben, the two tangled in the chains, unable to
text: escape each other. Reese’s jaws strain to reach Eben --
text: Eben pulls out his pistol, but Riis pries it from Eben’s
text: grasp, dropping it so it disappears in the snow --
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: What the hell happened to you -- ?
text: Riis blinks his eyes; he truly doesn’t know what happened to
text: him. Eben searches about in panic, his BREATH GROWING RASPIER
text: AND RASPIER, finally seeing --
text: A PILE OF FIREWOOD ON THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE -- AND AN AXE.
text: Eben strains the chains of the swing -- it’1ll mean letting go
text: of Riis for a moment, but he dives to reach the axe --
text: Riis, free now, yearns toward Eben, jaws salivating, about to
text: clamp his teeth down on Eben’s neck --
text: Eben swings the axe hard, CATCHING Riis in the shoulder --

scene_heading: EBENNNNNNNN -- !!
text: Black blood flows from Riis’s wound as Eben wriggles loose,

text: on Eben’s pain as he’s forced to do what must be done --
text: Finally he staggers back against the woodpile, groping for his
text: inhaler, GIVING HIMSELF A BLAST. But it’s the last blast --
text: Eben tosses the now-useless inhaler into the snow. He’s not
dialog: sure how he’1ll make it without the inhaler, but for now he has
text: no choice. PAN from Eben toward the swingset, where a
text: headless corpse hangs, caught up in the chains of the swings.

text: Marlow looks to the sky -- behind the black smoke, it looks
text: just a shade brighter.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDER PARKED CAR - NIGHT 208
text: Stella carves a peephole in the snow -- and through it RUSHES
text: OILY BLACK SMOKE. She and Gail start to choke --
scene_heading: INT. MUFFIN MONSTER - NIGHT 209
text: A pallid Eben, his voice now DEATHLY HOARSE, looks up to Jake,
dialog: Gail, Lucy and Denise --
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: I can smell your blood.
text: He rises, struggling with temptation, warning them away with
dialog: his eyes --
text: As he heads for the corridor that leads to the outside --
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: You can’t beat them all, Eben -- *
text: Eben knows it. Jake reads Eben’s plan in his eyes -- *
speaker_heading: JAKE *
dialog: *
text: He’s just holding them till Stella and
dialog: Gail can make it inside -- *
dialog: 210
dialog: 211
dialog: 212
dialog: 213
dialog: 94,
speaker_heading: EBEN *
dialog: (a beat; grimly) *
dialog: If I can. *
scene_heading: EXT. UTILIDOR - NIGHT 210
text: Smoke floods the air -- down the road, the town is in full
text: blaze. Suddenly the door KICKS OPEN -- and Eben emerges,
text: fighting for balance, unaccustomed to his new senses,
text: squinting through the smoke, face torn with pain and mission --
text: Like the vampires, Eben’s breath does not billow in the cold,
text: but he’s wrapped up in winter gear so that no one notices --
text: Eben works for his bearings -- then trudges directly toward
text: Marlow, the CRUNCH of his steps in the ice making Marlow turn. *
text: Marlow recognizes Eben, HISSING vindictively -- *
speaker_heading: MARLOW
dialog: The one who fights.
text: Eben nods -- the angry bond between himself and Marlow clear.
text: He keeps walking steadily toward Marlow. The other vampires
text: circle, but Marlow cautions them back with a wave of his arm --
text: he doesn’t need, doesn’t want any help for dealing with Eben.
dialog: No, this will be a pleasure.
text: Eben lurches toward the other vampires for a moment -- they
dialog: watch, uncertain what the hell he has in mind --
text: Then he resumes trudging toward Marlow, as Marlow shakes his
text: head, nearly pitying how far gone Eben appears to be --
scene_heading: INT. PUMP HOUSE, UTILIDOR - NIGHT 211
scene_heading: JAKE FIRES UP THE WALKIE-TALKIE --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Stella, it’s Jake -- get out of there
dialog: now, run, run -- !
scene_heading: EXT. UNDER PARKED CAR - NIGHT 212
text: Stella and Gail don’t need to be told twice -- they push their
text: way through their smoky coffin toward the outside --
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 213
text: -- seeing the oily miasma pouring toward them, Stella and Gail
text: stumble out, yearning for safety, legs shaky from a day's
dialog: worth of cold and inaction --
dialog: 214
dialog: 215
dialog: 216
dialog: 95.
scene_heading: EXT. UTILIDOR - NIGHT 214
text: Eben pushes forward, knowing any moment might be his last --
text: Finally he’s nearly two yards away from Marlow -- and suddenly
text: he reaches for Marlow, trying to grab at him with surprising
text: speed. But Marlow BACKHANDS HIM INTO THE ICE --
text: Eben struggles to his feet, throws a fist at Marlow -- who
text: catches the fist and throws Eben back --
text: Eben lunges again for Marlow, knocking him down for a moment --
text: Then Marlow, SNARLING, HURLS HIMSELF at Eben, ripping at him
text: again and again, tearing his parka loose, battering his face
dialog: and body mercilessly --
text: Eben desperately crawls, trying to get his feet under him --
text: Until Marlow pulls him by his hair and WHIPS him bitterly,
dialog: face up, against the ice --
text: Eben GASPS for breath, fighting to suck in some strength --
text: his mouth is bloody, and the blood makes the ice slicker as
dialog: they fight --
text: Zurial and the other vampires watch intently -- impressed by
dialog: Eben’s ability to survive against Marlow even this long --
text: STELLA -- stops with Gail, seeing through the smoke that in
text: the crowd ahead, her husband is fighting for all their lives --
scene_heading: MARLOW -- REACHES DOWN AND ENCIRCLES EBEN’S LEFT HAND IN HIS
scene_heading: CLAWLIKE FINGERS -- HE SQUEEZES AND SQUEEZES, RELENTLESSLY,
text: UNTIL WE HEAR THE SNAPPING OF BONES --
text: Eben fights not to feel the pain, but HIS VISION IS BLURRING,
dialog: it’s hard to see how much longer he can last --
text: He glances to the night sky above --
scene_heading: EXT. SKIES - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 215
text: IS IT A FEW DEGREES LIGHTER THAN IT SEEMED A MOMENT AGO?
scene_heading: EXT. UTILIDOR - NIGHT 216
text: Zurial and the other vampires look to the sky warily, tensing
text: at the knowledge that the night is almost gone -- realizing
dialog: they face a decision --
text: Marlow circles Eben, gloating in triumph --
dialog: 96.
text: Eben summons up his strength and butts his head into Marlow,
text: knocking him onto the ice --
text: Insulted, Marlow SPITS FERALLY and regains his haunches, like
dialog: a wolf who will not give up his prey --
text: Eben wobbles for a moment on the ice, but determines to keep
text: the momentum on his side. With brutal drive he bolts toward
text: Marlow, his left arm hanging limply with its fingers now
text: broken, ready to strike another blow --
text: AT THE PUMP HOUSE DOOR -- Jake, Denise and Lucy watch in
dialog: dread, helpless if Eben fails --
text: ON THE ICE -- the permafrost CRACKS as Marlow dodges Eben and
text: WHACKS him into the unforgiving ground again and again. It’s
text: a savage onslaught that makes Eben’s very skull seem to SHAKE
dialog: from the impact --
text: Eben knows he needs a moment to recoup -- he tries to crawl
dialog: away to gain a breather --
text: But Marlow drags him back mercilessly as the smoke whirls
text: around them, Eben’s face lacerating against the ice --
text: Then he grabs Eben’s throat with one hand, lifting him up from
text: the frozen ground with a sadistic smile --
text: Marlow hurls Eben to the ground -- KICKS HIS FACE VICIOUSLY,
text: and then towers over Eben --
text: FROM THE TOWN -- a handful of tattered, drained survivors,
text: driven north by the smoke and fire, emerge to watch in awe,
text: struggling to understand what is happening -- the gaunt
dialog: veterans of thirty days of night, mute witnesses to this
text: battle that will decide their fates, JOINING A TRANSFIXED
scene_heading: STELLA AND GAIL --
text: ON THE ICE -- Eben struggles to remain conscious, searching
dialog: about until he sees --
text: STELLA -- her heart breaking, her eyes filled with both HOPE
dialog: AND GRIEF. He takes it all in --
text: Marlow follows Eben’s gaze, seeing Stella as well. Witha
text: cruel smile, he drops Eben, stalking toward Stella, ready to
text: rob Eben of his companion even as Eben ruined Marlow’s toy --
text: Eben, seeing Marlow heading for Stella, WRENCHES HIMSELF OFF
text: THE ICE and hurls himself at Marlow --
text: They tumble together, a small chaos of fury and bloodlust --
text: as Marlow emerges on top, ready to finish Eben off --
dialog: 97.
text: Marlow bares his fangs -- this last kill will be so very
dialog: satisfying --
text: Eben’s eyes are nearly swollen shut -- his face is a mass of
dialog: welts and agony --
text: BUT THEN EBEN FORCES HIS EYES WIDE, STARING UP AT HIS ENEMY -——
scene_heading: AND HIS DEATH-BLACK PUPILS MATCH THOSE OF MARLOW --
text: Marlow hesitates for a nanosecond, confused --
text: Eben, facing his last, does the thing he didn’t think he could
dialog: 
text: do -- he reaches into his depths and pulls up the ferocity and
dialog: strength of a wildcat --
text: Reaching up, he takes hold of Marlow’s jaw with his wounded
text: hand, and in a berserker rage, SLAMS HIS GOOD HAND ALL THE WAY
scene_heading: INTO MARLOW’S MOUTH --—
text: The vampires gape in AWE AT THE SOUND OF RIPPING FLESH --
text: And MARLOW’S HEAD lands on the ice in a rush of red pain and
text: shock, still not realizing he’s lost. His eyes close -- he is
dialog: gone.
text: Eben stares, blinking, astonished by it all, unable to
text: comprehend for a moment that he’s won. Slowly he pulls
dialog: himself to his knees --
text: Zurial looks grimly to the sky -- two other vampires take a
text: step back, retreating as their night runs out --
text: The survivors at the pump house BREATHE IN DEEPLY, unable to
dialog: contain their swelling hope --
dialog: STELLA -- however, sees there’s something far worse to learn
text: yet -- she runs to Eben, kneeling beside him on the ice --
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: -- what did you do to yourself?
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: (a solemn beat)
dialog: What I had to.
text: She embraces him desperately -- overwhelmed by his sacrifice.
text: He fights his way to his feet, looking at Marlow’s blood on
dialog: his hands. He needs it -- the blood would taste so very good.
dialog: But he can’t bring himself to go there --
text: Clenching his jaw, he looks around -- THE VAMPIRES ARE
scene_heading: ENTIRELY GONE --
dialog: 217
dialog: 218
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: EBEN (cont'd)
dialog: Should I go after them?
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: They won’t come back.
text: Gail looks about, lost and overwhelmed --
text: Seeing Gail, Eben looks to Stella in silent, sacred agreement.
text: Stella takes Eben’s meaning and nods, kneeling to Gail --
speaker_heading: STELLA (cont'd)
dialog: Come here, sweetheart --
text: Stella folds a grateful Gail in her arms, then reaches out to
dialog: include Jake as well -- her new family.
speaker_heading: JAKE
text: It’s almost dawn. We made it.
text: Stella looks up to the skies, apprehensive --
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Eben -- the dawn --
scene_heading: EXT. SKIES - NEAR DAWN - CONTINUOUS 217
text: ABOVE THE SMOKE, THE HEAVENS ARE NO LONGER BLACK. THE SKY IS
scene_heading: NOW RICH BLUE, THE COLOR OF ONCOMING DAY --
scene_heading: EXT. UTILIDOR - NEAR DAWN - CONTINUOUS 218
text: Eben nods; he understands full well what’s coming with the
text: dawn. Stella holds onto Gail and Jake for balance, weak as
text: she realizes the full extent of Eben’s transformation --
dialog: Denise turns to the survivors --
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: The firehouse -- let’s start the
dialog: hydrants, see what we can save --
text: Lucy and Jake join the other Barrowites, moving to recapture
text: their town. Stella rises from Gail’s side to caress Eben’s
text: cheek, her face wet with tears --
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: You could hide -- we could find blood
dialog: for you --
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: (honestly, no self-pity)
dialog: Stella.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 219
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: EBEN (cont'd)
dialog: It’s getting hard to fight -- I’m
text: forgetting everything but the pain.
dialog: There’s just one place for me to go --
text: He turns, wishing to spare Stella what is to come --
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: I’m coming -- I won’t run again --
text: OFF Eben, heartened by knowing Stella’s standing by him --
scene_heading: EXT. SUMMIT - DAWN 219
text: In the distance, the smoke curls up slowly now from Barrow --
text: the flames have subsided. Much of the town is charred, but
text: there is still a town worth reclaiming.
text: Eben and Stella sit together as the sun edges over the distant
text: icy horizon. Eben, his skin a landscape of agony, shivers
text: while Stella grasps his hands with both hands --
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: -- I sent Billy to take you to the
dialog: airport -- knew he wouldn’t make it --
dialog: wanted you to stay --
text: A grateful nod from Stella; she always suspected it. She
text: works to contain her fears as he winces, not sure he can
dialog: endure the pain any longer --
speaker_heading: EBEN (cont'd)
dialog: Baby --
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: I’m here. I’m here with you.
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: Listen -- listen to me --
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: (time slipping away)
dialog: Yes -- I’m here, I’m listening --
speaker_heading: EBEN
dialog: I could live forever -- but I don’t
dialog: want to breathe another second -- if I
dialog: can’t remember what it feels like to
dialog: love you --
dialog: Fighting back tears because they can’t risk missing a moment
text: together, their eyes lock. Everything they’ve ever said to
dialog: each other, everything they’ve never said and should have, it
dialog: all passes between them --
dialog: 100.
text: THE SUN STARES DOWN AT THEM, BEAUTIFUL AND DEADLY, SEARING
text: THEM WITH LETHAL RADIANCE. CAMERA CIRCLES AROUND THEM, as
text: Eben winces, gasps in pain --
text: Stella throws her arms around him for dear life --
text: Eben’s skin finishes CHARRING TO BLACK as Stella holds him --
text: within moments he is dead.
text: CLOSE ON STELLA, THE SUN REFLECTED IN HER EYES AS HER HEART
text: BREAKS FOR EBEN AND HIS SACRIFICE. PULL CLOSER AND CLOSER ON
speaker_heading: STELLA UNTIL --
text: CUT TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: THE END
