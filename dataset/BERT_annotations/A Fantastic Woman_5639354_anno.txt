speaker_heading: ADRIANA
dialog: So you cared for each other.
dialog: It wasn’t just sexual.
text: Marina begins to feel irritated.
speaker_heading: MARINA
dialog: It was a consensual relationship

text: As the soap falls over the windshield, Marina looks back
text: through the rearview mirror: ORLANDO IS SITTING IN THE

speaker_heading: MARINA
dialog: For the way in which things

speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: Look, I was 38 years old when I
dialog: married Orlando. We were together
dialog: for 9. We were a completely normal
dialog: couple. We had a normal life...
dialog: (recalling, painfully)
dialog: So when he came and explained to

speaker_heading: SONIA (CONT’D)
dialog: Please... Let us live this mourning
dialog: as a family. As it’s supposed to

speaker_heading: MARINA
dialog: What do you need?
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: The thing is, since you

speaker_heading: MARINA
dialog: But you never told me--
speaker_heading: ADRIANA
dialog: Look. I went to check on you

speaker_heading: MARINA
dialog: Again, I apologize for not calling

speaker_heading: ADRIANA
dialog: Then there shouldn’t be a problem.

speaker_heading: MARINA
dialog: What? Why are you doing this to me?
speaker_heading: ADRIANA
dialog: Because it's what corresponds. It’s

dialog: observation.
speaker_heading: MARINA

speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: What did she do?
speaker_heading: ADRIANA
