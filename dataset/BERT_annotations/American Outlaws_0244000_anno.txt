dialog: American Outlaws script by Roderick Taylor and John Rogers
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS
text: The Rangers plunge into thick woods. Branches slap at them,
text: but the sound of gunfire keeps them going. Captain Malcolm
text: is still in the lead, flanked by two young men who are
text: obviously brothers. The big, handsome one is COLE YOUNGER;
text: the skinny one with the lopsided hair is BOB YOUNGER.
scene_heading: EXT. WOOD'S EDGE
text: They break through the other side of the woods, emerging
text: behind a rickety set of fence-post fortifications. Instantly
text: GUNFIRE tears apart the trees around them. The Captain's
text: horse goes down, and the Younger brothers dive and roll to
text: hide beneath the palisade.
text: The Captain, still alive, has fallen beyond the wooden
text: shield. Cole scrambles through the savage rifle fire, grabs
text: Captain Malcolm, and hauls him behind the fortification.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MALCOLM
dialog: (bellowing)
dialog: Fall back into the woods! Out of
dialog: your saddles before you're shot out
dialog: of 'em!
text: The Rangers leap from their saddles as a new sound starts
text: -- a dull roar that grows and approaches and BBRRRRAPPPPP
text: as, unbelievably, trees EXPLODE INTO SPLINTERS and horses
dialog: and men go down in a heap!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Dammit, this stopped being fun
dialog: about two years ago!
text: Some men are crawling to the fortifications, others are
text: staying in the woods. The Captain pokes his head up to take
dialog: a look. With him WE SEE
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER HILLSIDE
text: At the top of which, about a hundred fifty yards off, is a
text: three man Gatling crew. Squads of Union soldiers are
text: beginning to make their way down the hillside. And just to
text: their right is an EIGHT INCH CANNON with a burning fuse --
scene_heading: EXT. FORTIFICATIONS
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MALCOLM
speaker_heading: DOWN!
text: BOOM! And with a whistle the cannonball TEARS THROUGH the
text: forest and EXPLODES just behind the Rangers. Some of the men
text: are screaming from injury and panic.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MALCOLM (CONT'D)
dialog: Cole! Bob! You boys okay?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Hell, take more than a cannon to
dialog: kill the Younger brothers, sir!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I think the cannon's doing a pretty
dialog: good job, Cole.
text: A full-blooded Indian, COMANCHE TOM, crawls up next to them.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Some Indian tracker you turned out
dialog: to be, Tom.
speaker_heading: COMANCHE TOM
dialog: You pay me to find you Bluecoats.
dialog: There they are.
text: ANOTHER ROUND from the Gatling chews up the trees and
text: fencing, driving their heads down.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MALCOLM
dialog: They're using the Gatling and the
dialog: cannon to cover their advance. We're
dialog: pinned unless we take them out!
text: Cole peers through the rails.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Those gunners are too far away...
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MALCOLM
dialog: Get me the James boy.
speaker_heading: COMANCHE TOM
dialog: You want Jesse?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MALCOLM
text: Not Jesse, the one who can shoot.
text: Comanche Tom rolls back to the edge of the woods.
speaker_heading: COMANCHE TOM
speaker_heading: FRANK!
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - A FEW YARDS BACK
text: Among the squatting men a single one STANDS UP. FRANK JAMES
text: is tall with a dark, thoughtful face. He looks sadder than
text: his 23 years should allow. His hand is wrapped around a
dialog: longbarrel Enfield 30.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Jesse.
text: The long rider behind him turns around. He's JESSE JAMES,
dialog: 20. He's too damn good-looking and he's got your best
text: friend's eyes. There's a coiled energy to him, and right now
text: he seems more angry than afraid. Next to him is WEB MIMMS,
text: 15, who is terrified and trying not to show it.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Watch Web.
speaker_heading: WEB
dialog: I don't need watchin'!
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Web, I bring you back dead and your
dialog: sister'll kill me. Now shut up and
dialog: lie there.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Careful, Frank. And make sure Bob
dialog: and Cole are okay.
scene_heading: EXT. FORTIFICATIONS
text: Loose shots spitting up dirt and wood chips everywhere.
text: Frank crawls up, nods to the Youngers, peers through the
text: stacked wood. Another EXPLOSION from the cannon.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Cannon or Gatling?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Both would be nice.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Soon as I hit one, the other'll
dialog: know and beat us up.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MALCOLM
dialog: Cannon.
text: Frank raises his head just high enough to poke the Enfield
text: over the stacked fenceposts. Everyone else is flinching from
text: the suppressing fire. Frank is perfectly still. Squinting,
text: aiming, perfectly centered ... BANG.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CANNON STATION
text: As the Captain of the six man crew SNAPS BACK and hits the
text: ground dead. Before the others can react, two more grab
text: their throats and drop. The remaining soldiers bolt from the
dialog: cannon.
text: But the Gatling crew swings the gun around and the barrels
speaker_heading: BLAZE.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. FORTIFICATIONS
text: Frank and the others hit the dirt as the Gatling shreds the
text: fenceposts, fells trees, churns the ground, stitching a path
text: of destruction across the bulwarks and into the woods where
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS
text: The Gatling rounds are everywhere. Rangers jerk as the
text: Gatling tears them apart. Jesse grabs Web to his chest and
text: swings around, shielding the boy with his own body. When the
text: fire pauses for a moment. Jesse looks down -- he's covered
text: in blood. He lets Web fall away. Blood bubbles up from where
text: the boy's chest used to be.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Hell no...
text: Jesse's trying to stop the blood with his bare hands.
speaker_heading: WEB
dialog: Aw, Jesse.
dialog: (crying)
dialog: I never even got to be with a girl.
text: Web dies.
text: Jesse sighs. He's seen too much death to cry anymore. He
text: stands up, pivots, and strides for the fencepost barrier.
text: Rifle fire is zipping through the air all around him, but he
text: keeps walking.
scene_heading: EXT. FORTIFICATIONS
text: Frank, the Younger brothers, Comanche Tom and the Captain
text: are all still there. Captain Malcolm peers through the wall.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MALCOLM
text: They're getting closer.
text: Jesse arrives, slaps Cole's shoulder. Cole grins grimly.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: 'Bout time you got here, buddy.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Every time I put my head up to hit
text: that Gatling, they try to shoot it
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: So we got a plan?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: My plan of lying here pissing
dialog: myself seems to be working mighty
dialog: fine, thank you.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I can hit those boys from here. We
dialog: just need a distraction.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: A distraction? Well, why the hell
dialog: didn't you just say so?
text: Jesse sprints back into the woods. Cole, Bob, and Frank
dialog: exchange looks.
speaker_heading: BOB
text: He's smiling.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Never a good thing.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: This ought to be interesting.
text: ANOTHER ROAR from the Gatling pushes their heads down, but
text: as that sound fades, another blends in, growing louder and
text: louder, the SOUND OF HOOFBEATS
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: The men at the fortification, turning to face the woods,
text: their faces stunned as JESSE JAMES ON HORSEBACK AT FULL
text: GALLOP EXPLODES from the woods, heading straight at his own
text: men and at the last second LEAPS OVER THE BARRIER, and as he
text: does Jesse leans back in the saddle to let the wind strip
text: off his longrider coat, revealing for the first time his
text: GUNS -- two Colts at the hip, a crossed bandolier on his
text: chest with two cross-holstered Colts at the shoulders, and
text: two Colts in the small of his back.
text: And for that one second as Jesse and the horse are in
text: mid-air and the longrider coat trails behind him like
text: leather wings and his guns gleam blue in the sunlight, Jesse
dialog: James is the Angel of Death.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLSIDE
text: The horse hits the ground running. The Union troops are in
text: shock as Jesse draws both his hip Colts and starts firing.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Come on, ya Yankee bastards!
text: His GUNS BLAZING, Jesse rides straight at the Bluecoats.
text: Five, six are down before they can even react. They start
text: firing back, but they can't draw a bead. Two more are down.
text: Jesse's making every bullet count.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: The Gatling gun as the crew swings it around and FIRES,
text: hundred of rounds tearing straight at Jesse
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: Jesse who incredibly cuts the horse hard left using just
text: his knees, still shooting as the Gatling volley goes wide,
text: actually killing two of the Union soldiers behind Jesse.
text: But then the arc of fire takes Jesse's horse in the rump.
text: The horse falls, but Jesse dives off, still firing, killing
text: another two soldiers. Then he hits the ground, rolls, and is
text: up and running, dropping the spent Colts and drawing the two
text: shoulder guns in one smooth motion, never interrupting his
dialog: shooting.
scene_heading: EXT. FORTIFICATIONS
text: Frank sees the Gatling swing away from him. He stands and --
scene_heading: EXT. HILLSIDE
text: -- BANG as the Gatling triggerman drops, BANG as the
text: ammo-feeder goes down, and BANG as the third man falls
text: before the echo of the first shot clears.
scene_heading: EXT. FORTIFICATIONS
text: Cole is the first one on his feet.
speaker_heading: COLE
text: WAAAHHHHOOOO!! We're coming Jesse!
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MALCOLM
dialog: Charge!
text: With a ragged cheer the RANGERS ERUPT FROM THE FOREST, some
text: actually on horseback, firing at the exposed Union troops.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLSIDE
text: Soldiers are swarming Jesse, but he's moving, turning, an
text: untouchable blur in the chaos. As he drops two more empty
text: Colts and reaches for the last two at his back, a SOLDIER
text: just an arm's length away BRINGS UP A RIFLE.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Oh, you do not!
text: Jesse grabs the rifle barrel and drives the butt straight
text: back into the soldier's nose. The Union boy falls, releasing
text: the gun. Jesse swings the rifle in a smooth arc, bashing
text: another soldier in the jaw, and then spins it effortlessly
text: into his opposite hand and FIRES it point blank into another
dialog: Union soldier.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: The Rangers PLOWING INTO the Union soldiers. Rattled, the
text: Union troops are beginning to break and fall back.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: Jesse as another nearby soldier draws a revolver. Jesse
text: snags his hand, twists it, wrapping the man's arm backward
text: around Jesse's waist. With the other man still gripping the
text: weapon, Jesse FANS THE HAMMER as he turns, shooting six more
text: Union soldiers as they try to rush him. With a final yank,
text: Jesse pulls the Colt from the man and crashes it down on his
dialog: skull.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: the Union soldiers in full retreat.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GATLING STATION
text: The few remaining Bluecoats break and run as Jesse reaches
text: the Gatling. Suddenly a FIGURE LEAPS UP from behind the
text: Gatling and FIRES his rifle. A bloody streak tears Jesse's
text: cheek and he stumbles onto his back. With a cry, the figure
text: jumps forward and buries his bayonet in Jesse's chest!
text: Jesse gasps, then, puzzled, looks down. The bayonet has
text: lodged right in the "X" of the ammo belts on his chest,
text: stopped by the bullets and leather. Jesse kicks. As the
text: Union soldier is knocked back, Jesse smoothly snap-kicks to
text: his feet and draws both remaining Colts. He pulls up short.
text: It's a fifteen year old boy, Web Mimms in a blue uniform.
text: There's a deadly pause.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You ain't even been with a girl,
dialog: have you?
text: The boy shakes his head. Jesse waves him off with the guns.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Git.
text: The boy scurries off. Jesse turns and lopes down the hill.
text: Instantly he's surrounded by cheering Missouri Rangers.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLSIDE
text: The Rangers move past Jesse. Jesse suddenly realizes Frank
text: is there. They fall into step together.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Distracting enough for you?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: So you're saying I could have done
dialog: more to attract their attention.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Mm-hmm.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Such as?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You could have worn one of those
text: big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday
dialog: hats.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: That would have made an impression.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I figure.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: See, that's your problem, Frank. By
dialog: the time you finish figuring out
dialog: stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No, Jesse, your problem is you're
dialog: always doing stuff before I'm
text: finished figuring it out.
text: Cole, Bob, and Comanche Tom RIDE UP on their recovered
text: horses. Cole jumps down and picks up Jesse in a bear hug.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Wait'll we get back to Missouri,
dialog: start telling those gals about how
dialog: little Jesse James charged the whole
dialog: Union Army by himself!
speaker_heading: COMANCHE TOM
dialog: You ride like a Comanche.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You can ride like that?
speaker_heading: COMANCHE TOM
dialog: I said like a Comanche, not this
dialog: Comanche.
text: Cole mounts up, reaches down a hand to Jesse.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Ride with me, cousin?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I could use the walk.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Suit yourself. We'll have some
dialog: horses waiting for you at the road.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Let's ride, Rangers!
text: Cole slaps leather and the Rangers canter off. As they
dialog: disappear we hear:
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (low)
dialog: Now, I would just sound stupid
dialog: saying something like that...
text: Jesse and Frank watch them go, then start walking again.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (finally)
dialog: Web's dead.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I reckoned.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Hell of a war.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'm sure it seemed like a good idea
dialog: at the time.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - DUSK
text: The James brothers, the Youngers, and the other Rangers
text: ride down a dirt road toward a ragtag column of Confederate
text: soldiers. The grey uniforms are ghostlike in the twilight.
text: The men are obviously broken, dispirited. The column
text: stretches down the road and around a bend as far as the eye
dialog: can see.
text: Jesse and the other Rangers ride into the midst of the
text: Confederates who part and flow around the horsemen like a
text: slow-moving river.
text: For a moment, nobody speaks while the whole eerie
text: procession glides past.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Where you boys going?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: There's Yankees back there. Lot's
dialog: of 'em.
text: One grizzled Confederate VETERAN, his arm in a bloody
text: sling, looks up at Jesse.
speaker_heading: VETERAN
dialog: War's over, son. General Lee
dialog: surrendered yesterday at Appomattox.
text: The soldiers move on. The Rangers stare into the middle
text: distance of despair. Cole rubs his hands across his face.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yesterday.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well, somebody better go tell THE
text: DAMN YANKEES!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: What do we do now?
text: Jesse seems to be the only one with a clear head.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Home. We go home. We ride like hell
dialog: to get there, and we kill anything
dialog: or anyone that comes between us and
dialog: our homes. And when we get there we
dialog: stay there and God help any fool who
dialog: tries to get me to leave my farm
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Best damn plan I heard all war.
text: Jesse jerks his reins, and the last remaining survivors of
text: the Missouri Rangers trot off into the sunset.
speaker_heading: MONTAGE
text: -- Jesse, Frank, the Youngers and Comanche Tom riding hard
text: down country roads, past burned out farms.
speaker_heading: THE RIDERS
text: Are struggling through a downpour in a pitch black night,
text: one of the horses slipping, going down.
speaker_heading: BLAZING SUN
text: On a dusty road, the Youngers sharing a horse now,
text: everybody just trying to keep moving.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - DAY
text: Jesse, Frank, Cole, Bob, and Comanche Tom are looking down
text: on the frontier town of Liberty, Missouri.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hello, Liberty Missoura!
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: All this time in the saddle... We
dialog: get to the farm, I'm going to shoot
dialog: this damn horse just on principle.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Never thought that pissant town
dialog: would look so pretty.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is
dialog: pretty.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Home, boys. Back to our farms.
speaker_heading: COLE
text: Planting corn. Harvesting corn.
dialog: Year after year.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Corn gonna shoot at me?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Then I love it.
text: They start to ride down into town.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Tom, why don't you stop at our
dialog: spread before you head on out to the
dialog: reservation? Figure we might have
dialog: some work for you, if you want.
speaker_heading: COMANCHE TOM
dialog: Hmm. Go back to the reservation and
dialog: get drunk in a dirt shack, or work
dialog: for you...
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: COMANCHE TOM
dialog: I'm thinking...
text: Cole throws a playful punch at Comanche Tom.
scene_heading: EXT. LIBERTY STREET - DAY
text: The gang is riding into the main stretch of town. They're
text: grinning, happy to be home, until --
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: We got problems.
text: DOZENS OF UNION SOLDIERS are walking along the boardwalk,
text: lingering near the saloon, all suddenly staring at the
dialog: riders.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: What the --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Must be a garrison in town. We're
text: in occupied territory, boys.
text: Cole is returning stares.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Hands off your hip, Cole.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You're not scared, are you?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Pick your fights, cousin. You
dialog: taught me that.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: It gets worse.
text: There in the center of town, is a brand new scaffold. Three
text: bodies, fresh ones, are hanging from the nooses.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Jesus mercy, that's Charlie
dialog: Higgins, Dave Laller ...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: ... Will Perry ...
speaker_heading: COLE
text: They rode with Quantrill's Rangers.
text: The riders stop at the scaffold, take off their hats.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the
dialog: only casualty this town's got.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We better go to Doc's, see what's
dialog: going on here.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I'm cutting them down.
text: Cole starts to dismount. Jesse grabs his arm. The Union
text: Soldiers have started to form a crowd
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Not now.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: What is wrong with you?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (low)
dialog: In case we have to kill these
dialog: sonofabitches, I don't want them to
dialog: see us coming.
text: Cole thinks, nods. They ride away from the scaffold.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Cole, I want to get to the farm,
dialog: make sure Little Jim and the girls
dialog: are okay.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Stop by our spread after that, tell
dialog: our Ma we're all right. We'll go to
dialog: Doc Mimms.
text: The Youngers and Comanche Tom split off, start to trot away.
speaker_heading: COMANCHE TOM
dialog: I think I may just go on to the
dialog: reservation.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Tom, I'm this close to coming with
dialog: you...
scene_heading: EXT. MIMMS HOME - DAY
text: Jesse and Frank ride toward a handsome white two-story
text: frame house that stands in a grove of elm trees.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: They dismount and walk up to the porch. A FARM HAND in a
text: cowboy hat is nailing a rail onto the porch.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Scuse me, we're here for the Doctor.
text: The farm hand turns and pulls off his hat -- her hat. She's
text: a chestnut-haired beauty in her late teens, ZERELDA MIMMS.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: Jesse! Frank!
text: She hugs both of them enthusiastically. Jesse is obviously,
text: immediately smitten.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: You were little Jesse James when
dialog: you left.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: But you got big!
text: Zee arches an eyebrow.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, you aged --
text: Zee arches both eyebrows.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, I mean, in a good way you
dialog: got big and older.
text: Zee tilts her head. Jesse's mouth moves, but nothing comes
dialog: out, until
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Frank, don't you have something to
dialog: say?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You're doing just fine.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (pulling it together)
dialog: Zee, we got to talk to you and your
dialog: father.
text: DOC MIMMS, a grey-haired man wearing rimless spectacles,
text: steps out of the doorway.
speaker_heading: DOC MIMMS
dialog: Frank, Jesse.
dialog: (looking)
dialog: Where's Web?
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: A LONG SHOT of the Mimms house. We can see, but not hear,
text: Jesse talking. A beat, then we hear Zee CRY OUT. Doc Mimms
text: staggers, SLUMPS DOWN in the door frame. Jesse and Frank
text: rush to help him.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. PARLOR - A WHILE LATER
text: The room is comfortable and elegant in a simple way. Doc
text: Mimms is slumped in a big chair. Zee, her eyes red, is
text: pushing a glass of sherry into his hands. Jesse and Frank
text: sit across from him.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: -- rode right into them, screaming
text: like a banshee.
speaker_heading: DOC MIMMS
dialog: My little Web did that?
speaker_heading: JESSE
text: Pff. He jumped his horse clear over
dialog: our heads, killed a dozen Union
dialog: soldiers before they knew what hit
dialog: them.
text: Jesse looks at Frank, urging him on.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling
text: gun and the cannon all by himself.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Saved all our lives, Doc. None of
dialog: the Liberty boys would have come
dialog: home if not for Web Mimms, Doc.
dialog: God's honest truth.
text: Doc is fighting back tears, but proud.
speaker_heading: DOC MIMMS
dialog: Web died fighting?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Died a hero.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: But still died.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: If there's anything we can do for
dialog: you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
speaker_heading: DOC MIMMS
dialog: Start thinking about yourselves.
dialog: You, the Youngers, Clell Miller, all
dialog: of you. Don't end up like Charlie.
dialog: They found out Charlie rode with
text: Quantrill's Raiders. They arrested
dialog: him, tried him by military tribunal
dialog: and hanged him this morning.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I thought there was general amnesty.
speaker_heading: DOC MIMMS
dialog: For soldiers, yes. But if you rode
text: in one of the partisan bands,
dialog: they'll hang you for treason. And
dialog: you boys are in more danger, because
dialog: you've got a farm.
text: Jesse and Frank don't understand.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: Daddy, don't start with this again.
speaker_heading: DOC MIMMS
dialog: Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The
text: railroad men come through, offering
dialog: to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then
text: they start hanging men who own farms
dialog: for treason?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You're saying the railroad's got
dialog: the Army doing it's dirty work?
speaker_heading: DOC MIMMS
dialog: Rich men in Washington, don't
dialog: matter if they wear a tie or a
dialog: uniform, they're all the same.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: All we thought about was coming
dialog: home. I swore I'd kill anybody who
dialog: tried to get me off my farm again.
dialog: If I have to go to war with the
dialog: railroad to stay, fine by me.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Think about this. If we just come
dialog: up with a story and stick to it, we
dialog: should be all right.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What kind of story are they going
dialog: to believe?
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: Hmm. You were in the Confederate
dialog: Army with General Hood's Texas Army
dialog: until... say Sharpsburg, then you
dialog: were reassigned to General Jeb
dialog: Stuart's cavalry until you
dialog: surrendered in Tennessee.
text: Pause. The men stare at Zee. Up goes the eyebrow again.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: That just might work.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Maybe, maybe...
speaker_heading: DOC MIMMS
dialog: Now go on to see your Ma. She'll be
text: glad to see her sons alive.
dialog: (choking)
dialog: And for her sake, stay that way.
scene_heading: EXT. MIMMS HOME - MINUTES LATER
text: We see Frank and Jesse mount up. Zee is at the door seeing
dialog: them off.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We'll be back on Saturday with Cole
dialog: and Bob, give you a hand with the
dialog: repairs.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: Thank you. For everything.
dialog: Especially that story you told my
dialog: father.
text: Jesse is about to object, but Zee raises a hand.
speaker_heading: ZEE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm going to go cry now, so I don't
dialog: have time for your lies. But I'll
dialog: see you Saturday.
text: Zee kisses her fingertips and extends them to the boys,
text: then disappears into the house.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON:
text: Frank shaking his head as they ride away.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That Zerelda turned into a hell of
dialog: a woman, eh --
text: WIDEN TO REVEAL Jesse's not next to him. Frank turns.
text: Jesse's still staring at the door. Frank rides back, takes
text: Jesse's horse by the reins. As Frank turns Jesse's horse
text: and leads it away, Jesse's head keeps pivoting, fixed on the
text: door. After a moment, Jesse turns to look forward, taking
dialog: his reins.
text: The brothers ride away slowly.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: "Big and older"?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You can shut up now.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You are a charmer.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I swear I'll shoot you in your
dialog: sleep.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Next time try "fat and haggard."
text: Jesse pulls down his hat and groans into it.
scene_heading: EXT. JAMES FARM - DAY
text: Jesse and Frank ride up. Out of the farmhouse bursts MA
text: JAMES, a big, rugged frontier woman who is absolutely
text: hysterical.
speaker_heading: MA
dialog: My boys! My boys!
text: She hauls Jesse and Frank clean out of their saddles.
speaker_heading: MA (CONT'D)
dialog: My boys are alive!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (strangling)
dialog: Not if you don't ease up a bit,
dialog: Ma...
text: She looks at both at arm's length.
speaker_heading: MA
dialog: Did you kill Yankees?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: A fair number, Ma.
speaker_heading: MA
dialog: Say your prayers?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Every night, Ma.
speaker_heading: MA
dialog: Good. Now get inside and wash up
dialog: for dinner.
scene_heading: INT. JAMES HOME
text: Jesse and Frank enter, surprised to find Cole, Bob,
text: Comanche Tom, and a gawky 15 year old JIM YOUNGER all eating
text: at their kitchen table.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Well look at Jimmy Younger. You're
dialog: all grown up.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (mouth full)
scene_heading: Mmmph-hmpph.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (sheepishly)
dialog: Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until
dialog: we ate something.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: That was two hours ago.
speaker_heading: MA
dialog: I don't see clean plates.
text: The men dutifully return to the meal. Jesse nods his head
dialog: at Comanche Tom.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice
dialog: to our Injun friend.
speaker_heading: MA
dialog: He's a good Christian and he killed
dialog: Yankees. Jesus told me that made him
dialog: an all right boy.
text: Ma WALKS OFF.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: She's still talking to Jesus.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What worries me is that Jesus is
text: talking back.
scene_heading: EXT. JAMES FARM
text: We can hear the laughter from inside the lit house. Night
dialog: falls and
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. JAMES FARM - DAY - A FEW WEEKS LATER
text: Like a time-lapse film we see the surrounding trees have
text: filled out, the stone fence is repaired, the shabby paint
text: redone in sparkling white. Jesse and Cole, shirtless, are
text: driving a post into a hole. Frank STEPS OUT of the house and
text: joins them.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: She got two of them.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I think one of 'em's glass.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Which one, right or left?
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: The brown one.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (to Cole)
dialog: You talk big for a man who screwed
text: another man back in Atlanta.
text: Frank laughs as Cole raises the shovel to strike Jesse.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at
dialog: Bunty's...
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Sadie was not a man!
speaker_heading: JESSE
text: She had a moustache.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: She was European!
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: All right, calm down. I'll agree
dialog: Sadie was a woman --
text: Jesse and Frank swallow their laughs.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: -- if you stop saying things about
dialog: my Zee.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Your Zee? Hmm.
dialog: (quoting)
dialog: "From women's eyes this doctrine I
dialog: derive: they sparkle still the right
dialog: Promethean fire; They are the books,
dialog: the arts, the academes, that show,
dialog: contain, and nourish all the world."
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I have no idea what you just said,
dialog: but it sounded real nice.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Shakespeare.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: He's European.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Ah.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You want to write that down for me
dialog: so I can say it to Zee?
text: The post finally drops straight into the hole. Jesse and
text: Cole shrug into shirts and grab a pitcher of lemonade.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks for the help.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: After all you did on our farm?
dialog: (sips, then)
dialog: You miss it, don't you Jesse?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: The war? What, are you crazy?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: There are things I miss about it.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: It was exciting.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: But it was a whole lot of killing.
dialog: Why should we miss that?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Because we were good at it? Hell,
dialog: we were great at it. Jesse, don't
dialog: tell anyone I said this, because
dialog: everybody knows I'm the toughest man
dialog: in this town, but you are one
dialog: terrifying sonofabitch with those
dialog: guns.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (regretful, but not)
dialog: Yeah.
text: Frank looks at Jesse thoughtfully. Then all three notice
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: A BUGGY that stops at the edge of the property. Ma STEPS
text: OUT onto the porch next to Frank to meet:
text: A man in a suit, ROLLIN PARKER, and three riders who
text: dismount and flank Parker: two DETECTIVES and a big Scot
text: with a beard and no moustache, ALAN PINKERTON. Pinkerton is
text: wearing a suit and a gun in a high waistband. All four
text: advance to the house.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Howdy, folks. How are you this
dialog: afternoon?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: "Howdy"?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Easterners.
speaker_heading: MA
dialog: We're just fine, thank you, sir.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: I am Rollin H. Parker, personal
text: emissary of Mr. Thaddeus Rains,
dialog: president of the Rock Island and
dialog: Pacific Railroad. These two
dialog: gentlemen are Pinkerton detectives,
dialog: working for Mr. Thaddeus Rains,
dialog: president of the Rock Island and
dialog: Pacific Railroad, and this gentleman
dialog: here is the famous Alan Pinkerton,
dialog: founder of the Secret Service and
dialog: now working under contract to Mr.
dialog: Thaddeus Rains.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Would that be Thaddeus Rains,
dialog: president of the Rock Island and
dialog: Pacific Railroad?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You know him?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Heard of him.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: (trying to regain
dialog: control)
dialog: As you have no doubt heard from
dialog: your neighbors, our railroad is
text: moving west.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: That makes sense, as east would put
dialog: you underwater.
text: Pinkerton coughs a laugh. Parker glares at him and
dialog: continues.
speaker_heading: PARKER
text: ... moving west, opening the
dialog: frontier for folks such as yourself.
dialog: Your acreage here is on the proposed
dialog: right of way.
text: Parker produces a piece of paper. Ma takes it.
speaker_heading: PARKER (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm here for your signature on this
dialog: land sales contract. I'm authorized
dialog: to pay you two dollars an acre.
speaker_heading: MA
dialog: Two dollars?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: That's right. That's the price
dialog: authorized by the railroad's board,
dialog: and approved by the Department of
dialog: the Interior of the Government of
dialog: the United States of America.
speaker_heading: MA
dialog: This land ain't for sale.
text: Pinkerton steps forward.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: Ma'am, I can understand how you
dialog: might feel that way -- you've made a
dialog: lovely home here. But it's really
dialog: not up to me or you. Are you
dialog: familiar with the legal concept of
dialog: the Right of Eminent Domain?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah, I am. What about it?
text: Parker is surprised. Pinkerton has become interested in
dialog: these farmers.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: Well, this land is about to be
dialog: condemned.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: I'm doing you folks a favor --
speaker_heading: COLE
text: Said the skinner to the mule.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: -- with a price of two dollars an
dialog: acre for this one time only offer.
dialog: After today the price goes down. So
dialog: if I were you, I'd just sign the
dialog: contract, and I'll be on my way.
text: Frank takes the contract from Ma and hands it back to
dialog: Parker.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Good day, Mr. Parker You can tell
dialog: Mr. Thaddeus Rains to put this where
dialog: the sun don't shine.
dialog: (to the boys)
dialog: Shakespeare.
speaker_heading: JESSE/COLE
dialog: Ah.
text: Parker flushes with anger. Pinkerton and his men rest their
text: hands on their guns.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: I don't think you understand. You
dialog: don't have a choice.
text: CLICK CLICK and we see Jesse's drawn and cocked two Colts
text: from out of thin air. Frank has pulled his rifle from the
text: doorway. Parker and the detectives are furious, but
text: Pinkerton seems no more than curious.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: (to Ma)
dialog: Ma'am. You have to look in your
dialog: heart and do what you know is right
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: MA
dialog: Let me ask the Lord.
text: Ma bows her head for a moment. She then nods and looks up.
speaker_heading: MA (CONT'D)
dialog: The Lord says we can bury 'em out
dialog: back in the orchard, nobody'll ever
dialog: find them.
speaker_heading: JESSE
text: Somebody's in a vengeful smiting
dialog: mood today.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Why don't we just let them go for
dialog: today, Ma. We'll bury them out back
dialog: next time.
speaker_heading: MA
dialog: Oh all right.
text: Parker, and the detectives are stepping backward to the
text: buggy.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: You people are making a serious
dialog: mistake!
text: Pinkerton himself has lingered, taking in the group.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Nicely played.
text: Parker, Pinkerton and the detectives RIDE OFF. The group at
text: the James house watches them go, then Cole turns to Jesse.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Where the hell did you get those
dialog: guns?
scene_heading: OFF JESSE'S SHRUG WE
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Dozens of men and a few women are packed into the one room
text: school house. Among them are Frank and Jesse. Doc Mimms is
text: leading the meeting.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I went up to the courthouse and
text: looked at the right of way documents
dialog: for the rail bed. The railroad
dialog: doesn't even need our land, they're
text: just taking the land on both sides
dialog: for as far as they can.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Damn. All that reading paid off.
speaker_heading: DOC MIMMS
text: Floor recognizes Clell Miller.
text: CLELL MILLER, tall and blond, steps forward.
speaker_heading: CLELL
dialog: They're saying we don't sell, we
dialog: might end up with nothing!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That's only if we don't stick
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: DOC MIMMS
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Loni Packwood.
text: LONI PACKWOOD, a sad, scruffy man stands up.
speaker_heading: LONI
dialog: I say this is the last straw. I
dialog: came back from the war, I found my
dialog: house burned down. My cows was dead.
dialog: Now my wife's run off with my
dialog: cousin, Jeb, that sonofabitch.
dialog: (tearing up)
dialog: Took my dog--
speaker_heading: DOC MIMMS
dialog: Ah, Loni, about the railroad.
speaker_heading: LONI
dialog: I forget.
dialog: (almost weeping)
dialog: Took my dog...
text: Another FARMER steps up.
speaker_heading: FARMER
dialog: I signed.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Harlan, you can't.
speaker_heading: FARMER
dialog: I'm tired of fighting. I'm just
dialog: gonna take my family and move west.
speaker_heading: CLELL
dialog: Maybe we should hire a lawyer.
speaker_heading: FARMER 2
dialog: That's a good idea!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It would be, if the courts were on
dialog: the up and up.
speaker_heading: CLELL
dialog: So what do we do?
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: the school house door as it BANGS open and Bob Younger
text: STUMBLES IN, bleeding from a cut on his forehead, being
text: supported by Zee.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: They got Cole.
text: He collapses into a seat. The crowd surrounds him.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: He came to our house, Daddy. I
dialog: figured you'd all want to hear this.
text: Jesse and Frank are next to Bob. Zee puts a hand on Jesse's
text: shoulder. He notices.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: They came up, made the same offer
dialog: they made you folks. Our little
dialog: brother Jim tried to chase 'em off,
text: one of those detectives hit him in
text: the head, knocked him out. Cole lost
dialog: his temper.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (rubbing his
dialog: forehead)
dialog: Oh no...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: He just lost his temper a little.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: How many of them did he kill?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Two.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Damn!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: They said because the detectives
dialog: were working for the Department of
dialog: the Interior --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: The Army can hang him.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Tomorrow.
speaker_heading: CLELL
dialog: What do we do?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Nothing.
text: The crowd stares at Jesse.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: You folks are going to do nothing.
dialog: You're all going to go home right
dialog: now. So you're going to be able to
dialog: swear on a Bible that you don't know
dialog: anything about what's going to
dialog: happen tomorrow.
text: Jesse's gaze is at once noble and terrifying. The crowd
text: quietly begins to disperse.
speaker_heading: DOC MIMMS
dialog: Boys...
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Go home, Doc.
dialog: (softly)
dialog: They ain't gonna hang no more
dialog: Liberty boys.
text: Doc Mimms nods, EXITS.
text: Jesse walks to the other end of the school house. Bob,
text: Frank, Clell and Loni fall in behind him. The door SWINGS
text: OPEN again and Comanche Tom enters with Jim Younger sporting
text: six-guns way too big for him.
speaker_heading: COMANCHE TOM
dialog: I couldn't lose him.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Jim Younger, I told you--
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: It's my fault they're gonna hang
dialog: Cole. I want in.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Jim, it was just a matter of time
dialog: before they tried to hang somebody
text: else to scare off the other farmers.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: And you're too young.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (to Jesse)
dialog: I'm the same age you were when you
dialog: went off to war.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: And the same age Web was. No.
speaker_heading: ZEE (O.S.) (O.S.)
dialog: You're wasting time.
text: Zee joins them.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Zee, go home.
text: Zee's eyebrows go up.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: Who else was there when they hanged
dialog: the others?
text: The men look at each other. Nothing.
speaker_heading: ZEE (CONT'D)
dialog: You need to know how they do it.
dialog: Which way they walk up. What order
dialog: they do things in. And if you mess
dialog: up rescuing Cole because you won't
dialog: listen to a woman, then God damn you
dialog: all.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: All right. Seven of us against a
dialog: Union regiment and Pinkerton
text: detectives in broad daylight in the
text: middle of Main Street.
text: Jesse smiles.
speaker_heading: BOB
text: He's smiling.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Is that bad?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Very.
scene_heading: EXT. LIBERTY CITY GALLOWS - THE NEXT DAY
text: Soldiers flank the gallows, which stand at the bottom of
text: the stairs to City Hall. A small drum corps beats a stark
dialog: rhythm.
text: Parker is watching this like a sideshow. Pinkerton is next
text: to him, scanning the crowd of locals which is getting larger
text: and surlier by the minute.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Relax, Alan. The Army has this all
dialog: in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will
dialog: be very pleased with this news.
dialog: Nothing like a hanging to motivate
dialog: the populace to relocate.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: It's not my job to relax. I've put
text: men facing out both ways down Main
dialog: Street, so nobody can ride in
dialog: shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up
text: on the water tower just in case.
text: Pinkerton WAVES to a FIGURE in a suit atop the water tower.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WATER TOWER
text: We see it is FRANK JAMES in the suit, who WAVES BACK and
text: then kneels and sights down his long rifle. Tucked away
text: behind him, out of sight from the street, is a
text: bound-and-gagged PINKERTON SNIPER in his underwear.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GALLOWS
text: Cole, his face swollen from a beating, is marched up the
text: stairs of the gallows toward the waiting hangman.
speaker_heading: LONG SHOT
text: of the gallows, detectives and soldiers down the street on
text: both sides, guns ready. The position is completely
text: unassailable. Cole is at the platform. His hands are tied in
text: front of him. The noose is placed on his neck.
speaker_heading: BACK TO
text: The gallows. Parker leans forward in anticipation. A UNION
text: LIEUTENANT approaches with the black hood. Cole spits in his
text: face. The CROWD ROARS. The Lieutenant angrily motions to the
text: HANGMAN, who grabs the lever --
dialog: The drums STOP --
text: But the drumming doesn't.
text: The drum corps look at each other, confused. The Army men
text: and the Pinkertons squint in concentration. There's
text: definitely some sort of rhythmic DRUMMING, coming closer...
text: The CROWD, sensing something, easing back from the
dialog: gallows...
text: The drumming gets LOUDER ...
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: REVEAL Fifty-odd CATTLE suddenly STAMPEDING from down the
text: street, their hooves creating the drumming!
text: REACTION SHOTS as the Pinkertons and Army men start to
text: scatter, the cattle surging around them --
scene_heading: EXT. VIEWING STAND
text: ANGLE ON Parker and Alan Pinkerton running for cover,
text: Pinkerton half-turned to watch the action.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: Brilliant...
text: Pinkerton suddenly spots something confusing. We FOLLOW his
dialog: stare to see --
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: a HORSE in the middle of the cattle, cutting through the
text: steer, towards the gallows.
text: THE HANGMAN REACHES FOR THE LEVER AGAIN, BUT JUST AS HE
speaker_heading: DOES -
text: Jesse -- masked -- appears from the side of the horse,
text: where he's been hanging on Indian-style. He gets a leg up on
text: the horse's back and LEAPS --
text: SLAMMING into the Hangman, bringing him down!
text: The cattle pass the gallows, revealing that the tight ranks
text: of the Army and Pinkertons are now spread out --
scene_heading: EXT. GENERAL STORE
text: SMASH! From the nearby GENERAL STORE, the other masked
text: rescuers CRASH through the big front window on horseback and
text: ride into the Army men, FIRING AWAY.
text: TOTAL CHAOS! The Army men and Pinkertons fight towards the
text: gallows. As Jesse untangles himself from the Hangman, the
text: Union Lieutenant reaches for the lever but BANG drops as
text: Frank opens fire.
text: Frank starts picking off soldiers. The detectives and
text: remaining soldiers are completely disoriented.
scene_heading: EXT. GALLOWS
text: Jesse flashes a knife and the noose drops away from Cole's
text: neck. Facing Cole, he cuts the rope on Cole's wrists --
text: Cole instantly draws Jesse's guns from his waist holster,
text: spin-reverses them and SHOOTS two Union soldiers climbing
text: the stairs behind Jesse's back. Jesse and Cole exchange a
text: look, then Jesse steps away --
text: As Bob rides by he TOSSES JESSE'S GUNBELT into the air.
text: Jesse draws both guns from the belt as it flies by, spins
text: and starts shooting.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET
text: The soldiers have totally broken ranks. One riderless horse
text: led by Comanche Tom pulls up by the scaffold. Jesse LEAPS ON
text: and Cole jumps on behind him. Jesse puts the spurs to it and
text: the horse SURGES into a gap in the crowd.
text: Allen Pinkerton steps past the panicking troops, squarely
text: in the path of the charging horse. He draws his gun and
text: FIRES. The bullet PLOWS into Jesse just as the terrified
text: horse lurches forward, TRAMPLING Pinkerton.
text: Cole holds Jesse up and the riders take off down the
text: street. We see Frank has disappeared from the water tower.
text: The soldiers fire at the fleeing liberators. One of the
text: detectives runs over to the injured Alan Pinkerton.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: Sir, are you all right?
dialog: (shout)
dialog: Somebody get a doctor!
scene_heading: EXT. MIMMS HOME - NIGHT
text: WE SEE one window upstairs with a light on.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM
text: Doc Mimms has just finished bandaging Jesse, who lies
text: unconscious beneath the sheets. Zee is holding an oil lamp.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
speaker_heading: DOC MIMMS
text: The bullet came out clean, but he
text: lost a whole lot of blood. Praying
dialog: wouldn't hurt.
text: The SOUND OF HOOFBEATS APPROACHES from outside.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
text: Doc Mimms opens the door. A UNION OFFICER and a squad of
text: soldiers push in.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Good evening, sir, we're looking
dialog: for a fugitive.
speaker_heading: DOC MIMMS
dialog: A fugitive? Who?
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: We don't know, but he was very
dialog: badly wounded. We're checking all
text: the houses in the area.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM
text: Zee hears her father protesting, then FOOTSTEPS on the
text: stairs. Quickly she undresses, grabs a quilt from a chest
text: and jumps into bed with Jesse. She pulls the quilt up to her
text: neck, completely hiding him.
text: At that moment, the Officer barges in. Zee lets out a
text: little gasp as if startled awake. She covers herself with
text: the quilt.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: Sir! Who are you?
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Oh. Sorry ma'am.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: I should hope so.
text: The Officer EXITS. Zee watches the door for a moment, then
text: looks down fondly at Jesse.
speaker_heading: ZEE (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesse, are you awake?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (groggy)
dialog: Mmmm.
text: Zee gently pushes his hair off his face. Then her
dialog: expression changes.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: Jesse, is that your hand?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Nuh-huh ...
text: Jesse smiles in his sleep. Zee jumps out of the bed and
text: wraps a dressing gown around herself. Doc Mimms enters.
speaker_heading: DOC MIMMS
dialog: They're gone. What are you --
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: I fooled them into thinking I was
dialog: alone.
speaker_heading: DOC MIMMS
dialog: Well, I hope the boy pulls through.
dialog: We should know in the morning.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: (with a little smile)
text: I think he's already feeling better.
text: A puzzled Doc Mimms follows her out.
scene_heading: EXT. LIBERTY MAIN STREET - AFTERNOON - TWO WEEKS LATER
text: A lavishly appointed carriage rolls up to the front of the
text: nicest hotel in town. Rollin Parker and his retinue of
text: Pinkerton detectives scurry to the door.
text: The DOOR OPENS. Out steps THADDEUS RAINS, wearing an
text: elegant suit he bought in London last year and a scowl he
text: picked up in Boston three decades ago. The scowl fits him
dialog: better.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a
dialog: pleasure to have you join us in the
dialog: field.
speaker_heading: RAINS
dialog: And it is my pleasure to be here.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Really!
speaker_heading: RAINS
dialog: NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have
dialog: to leave my board room to come to
dialog: this godforsaken piece of dirt to
dialog: discover why in the name of all that
dialog: is holy you cannot seem to evict a
dialog: few simple farmers from their
text: PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I
dialog: may build the GREATEST railroad that
dialog: this country has ever seen!
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: I can completely understand your
dialog: distress, sir.
text: Rains sighs. As he speaks, he checks a heavy, gold, ornate
text: and ever-present POCKETWATCH on a GOLD CHAIN.
speaker_heading: RAINS
dialog: Parker, tell me what's going on so
dialog: I can return as quickly as possible
dialog: to Boston and my whores and cigars,
dialog: not necessarily in that order.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Two weeks ago, we managed to
dialog: arrange to have the Army hang one of
dialog: the local farmers.
speaker_heading: RAINS
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of
text: local thugs managed to rescue him
dialog: from the gallows. Not only has this
dialog: inspired resistance from the other
dialog: farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan
dialog: Pinkerton was seriously injured
dialog: during the incident.
speaker_heading: RAINS
dialog: Leaving you in charge of operations
text: until he recovers.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: (puffing with pride)
dialog: Yes sir.
speaker_heading: RAINS
dialog: Just perfect.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: A further impediment is that the
dialog: Army garrison has been ordered to
dialog: move on from Liberty. We will no
dialog: longer have that particular stick
dialog: with which to threaten the farmers.
speaker_heading: RAINS
dialog: You see the Army leaving and you
text: see the loss of a tool. I see a
dialog: power void to be filled. As we have
dialog: the most power, we may move with
dialog: impunity.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: I see. I'll get together four
dialog: patrols of our detectives for action
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: RAINS
dialog: I'll teach these podunks what
dialog: happens when they challenge the
dialog: righteousness of progress.
scene_heading: EXT. MIMMS HOME - AFTERNOON - THAT SAME DAY
text: Zee is on the porch. Jesse COMES THROUGH the door, moving
text: gingerly. Zee immediately moves to support him.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: You shouldn't be up.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I've been on my back two weeks. I'm
dialog: sick of it.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: You're sick of my company?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No! I mean, of course not. No.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: Teasing you is completely unfair.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What you do to me is unfair. The
dialog: teasing, I mean.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: I shouldn't tease a hero.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: Everybody in the county knows it
dialog: was you who rescued Cole. We're all
dialog: so proud of you, Jesse. And not a
dialog: single farm's been sold to the
dialog: railroad since. You're everybody's
dialog: hero.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I wasn't the only one risking my
dialog: neck that day.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: So you're saying I should leave you
dialog: alone and go spend time with Jimmy
dialog: Younger?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Unfair. You are completely unfair.
text: They look at each other warmly. Frank DRIVES UP in a
dialog: carriage.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You ready to stop loafing around
dialog: with this young lady and get back to
dialog: farming?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Would you get in the carriage?
dialog: Until Ma has you home so she can
dialog: fuss over you herself, she's gonna
dialog: make me miserable.
text: Doc Mimms COMES OUT onto the porch.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What do you say, sir?
speaker_heading: DOC MIMMS
dialog: Go on. You're pretty much all
dialog: healed up.
text: Jesse and Zee exchange glances. Zee withdraws demurely into
text: the house. Jesse straightens up and hops easily into the
dialog: carriage.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You're looking a bit more spry now
dialog: that somebody --
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (to Frank)
dialog: Shut up.
dialog: (to Doc Mimms)
dialog: Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh,
dialog: this evening, I could come by?
speaker_heading: DOC MIMMS
dialog: You know you're welcome any time!
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (unusually awkward)
dialog: Yesss, but I was thinking, I could
text: come by, and then take Zee out. Some
text: place near. With other folk. Near.
dialog: Here.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But out.
speaker_heading: DOC MIMMS
dialog: (bemused)
dialog: It's fine by me, Jesse.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Don't worry, sir, I'll make sure
dialog: they're always properly chaperoned.
text: Jesse slooooowly turns to glare at Frank.
speaker_heading: DOC MIMMS
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: Why, that hadn't even occurred to
dialog: me, Frank. I am deeply in your debt.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Army's leaving town, so Cole can
dialog: stop hiding up in the woods and come
dialog: back to his farm. Everybody's
dialog: getting together at the Younger
dialog: place for a to-do.
text: Frank tips his hat, and the carriage MOVES OFF.
scene_heading: EXT. BARNYARD - NIGHT
text: Dozens of people are milling about happily in the lantern
text: light of a Western party. Some are dancing to the small
text: banjo-led band. A small knot of men are comparing war
text: stories. Cole Younger is wandering among them, people
text: clapping his shoulder, shaking his hand.
text: Jesse -- formally accompanying Zee -- and Frank arrive at
text: the edge of the light. Immediately the entire group bursts
text: into applause and crowds Jesse. Cole cuts through and bear
text: hugs Jesse, making him wince.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Here's Liberty's favorite son!
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I'll never forget what you did,
dialog: cousin.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Zee, I'm pleased you came.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: Why thank you, Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'm especially pleased you came
dialog: with Jesse.
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: Seeing as right now there's a
text: gaggle of girls hoping to dance with
dialog: Jesse who are just going to have to
dialog: settle for the many charms of Bob
dialog: Younger.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: A group of obviously disappointed, beautiful young women.
text: Bob runs a hand through his hair.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You have no shame.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Not yet. But I'm hoping.
text: The party starts up again, and everyone is caught up in the
dialog: good times.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: Jesse SWINGING Zee into a group of dancers. They join in
text: the Two-Step, and Jesse's as smooth as silk.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLSIDE - NIGHT - A WHILE LATER
text: Jesse, carrying a lantern, and Zee are walking. We can hear
text: the party still going just a little ways away. They reach a
text: tree at the hilltop with a beautiful view of the stars and
text: the river. They sit down, their backs against the tree.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I used to come to this tree when I
dialog: was a kid and imagine what my life
dialog: would be like when I got older.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: You didn't want to farm?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I was thinking more along the lines
dialog: of being a river pirate.
speaker_heading: ZEE
text: A river pirate.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: Thank God you grew out of that.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You did grow out of that, didn't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Mostly. It would be an all right
dialog: life, for a bachelor.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: You planning on being a bachelor
dialog: your whole life, Jesse James?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Not if I find the right girl.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: And what's this right girl like?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes
dialog: me think she's two steps ahead of
dialog: me. And big buck teeth.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: Where will you find such a girl?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Honestly, you'd do if only you had
text: the buck teeth.
text: Zee fakes a monstrous overbite.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: (dreamy)
dialog: Finally.
text: The two move a little closer. Eye contact.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No,
dialog: ah... "From women's eyes this
dialog: doctrine I derive, they sparkle
dialog: still like ... shiny... sparkling
dialog: rocks..."
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: Sparkling rocks?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Little ones.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare
dialog: poems you're trying to quote?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: Were you planning on kissing me
dialog: when you finished quoting?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I've been planning on kissin' you
dialog: for a very long time.
text: They kiss. It's everything it should be.
speaker_heading: BOOM!
text: Jesse and Zee are startled by a flash of light and sound.
text: They turn to look back --
scene_heading: EXT. YOUNGER BARN
text: The partygoers are RUNNING from the YARD to the BARN, which
text: is ON FIRE in several different places. As the Younger
text: brothers and Frank get close, they see a squad of masked
text: riders disappearing down the road. Some of the men SHOOT at
text: the riders, but the distance is too great.
text: Jim makes a run for the BARN, but Bob grabs him.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: BASTARDS! Come back here and face
dialog: me!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Get buckets!
text: Some of the crowd starts to form a bucket line to the well.
text: Jesse and Zee RUN UP. Frank turns to him.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Ma.
text: Frank and Jesse bolt for their horses, swing into the
text: saddles and GALLOP OFF.
scene_heading: EXT. JAMES HOUSE
text: From a bit down the road, looking just fine. Jesse and
text: Frank reign in as relief rushes across their faces --
text: AN EXPLOSION tears the house apart like a pile of
text: matchsticks! Jesse and Frank urge their horses into a full
text: gallop.
scene_heading: EXT. YARD
text: Jesse and Frank leap from their mounts, trying to get close
text: to the house. The flames are too strong.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Ma! Ma!
text: Jesse's ventured so close his coat catches fire. Frank
text: tears it from him and stamps it out. Jesse ignores him,
text: still pacing back and forth in front of the inferno.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ma! Please!
speaker_heading: MA (O.S.) (O.S.)
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: Boys?
text: The brothers turn and nearly drop from shock. Ma is
text: stumbling toward them, half her hair singed off, brutally
speaker_heading: BURNED.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Jesus mercy --
text: They reach her just as she collapses. Jesse is cradling
text: her, Frank with his arms around both of them.
speaker_heading: MA
dialog: Riders --
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: We know, Ma. Now we got to get you
dialog: to Doc Mimms.
speaker_heading: MA
dialog: Take care of each other, boys. You
dialog: say your prayers.
text: Jesse is openly crying. Frank has tears silently streaming
text: down his face.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Doc Mimms will --
speaker_heading: MA
dialog: Shush.
text: Ma's eyes turn up, and she half-smiles.
speaker_heading: MA (CONT'D)
dialog: Well look at that. The Good Lord's
dialog: a bit shorter than I reckoned.
text: Ma gently stops breathing.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: The boys holding Ma, framed by the roaring flames of their
text: home. Jesse leans his head back and lets out a HOWL OF RAGE
text: AND PAIN AND HATE that goes on and on and on...
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. JAMES FARM - MORNING
text: Frank and Jesse are staring at the smoking ruins of their

speaker_heading: FRANK

dialog: a decent life someplace else.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Don't care.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Didn't think you would.
dialog: (turning away)
dialog: I'm going to go make the coffin.
speaker_heading: JESSE

speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I say we ride into town and kill us

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I like that.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No.
text: They stare at him.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: This isn't a feud, this is war.
dialog: They've got more men than we do. We
dialog: kill detectives, they can replace
dialog: 'em in a day.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (snapping)
dialog: So what do we do, General Lee?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Just like in the war. Harass their
dialog: supply lines. We kill the railroad's
dialog: men, they won't care.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: But if we take their money and
dialog: supplies...
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: That's a great plan, Jesse!
text: Cole nods grudgingly.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'll get us a few more men, and
dialog: Comanche Tom'll ride with us.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Where do we hit first, Jesse?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I'll pick the first job! I mean...
dialog: I know a girl down at the bank. See
dialog: if she can't get a list of towns
dialog: where the railroad keeps its money.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Perfect, Cole.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Let's ride.
text: The Youngers mount up. Jesse walks to the ruined house,
text: pulls a big iron trunk from the wreckage. He KICKS it open,
text: reaches in, and pulls out his gun belts. Zee appears behind
text: him in what remains of the doorway.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: I am so sorry, Jesse.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Frank and me have to go away for a
dialog: while.
text: Zee considers this, puts her head in close to Jesse's.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: You and I, we've started...
dialog: something, you know?
dialog: (Jesse nods)
dialog: I don't know what'll happen if you
dialog: do this.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Me neither.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: Let the law --
speaker_heading: JESSE

speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: Whose justice? Yours or God's?
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: When will you stop?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: When my name makes them cry in
dialog: their sleep. When I've brought them
dialog: to ashes.

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen,

speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: What are you talking about? The

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Hold on there, sir. Bank's closed

speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Wha?
speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: WOMAN

speaker_heading: DEPUTY

speaker_heading: JESSE

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: See, Frank's being smart about this.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Just because he reads all those

speaker_heading: COLE

dialog: (to Jesse)
dialog: Who put you in charge of this gang,

dialog: leading us during the War.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: And I planned getting you off the
dialog: hangman's deck --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: And that's why you both lead the

dialog: together, right?
text: Jesse and Cole nod, still watching each other.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: So we're waiting to hear what you

speaker_heading: COLE (CONT'D)

dialog: and this idea of me and Jesse's will
dialog: help give us more places to hide out
dialog: without worrying about some farmer
text: with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in
dialog: our sleep. We've got to think --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Strategically.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: -- Exactly. Because this is a war.
speaker_heading: CLELL
dialog: This ain't no war.

speaker_heading: CLELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Nobody paid me no thousand dollars

scene_heading: INT. SALOON - DAY

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: It's better. It's a construction

dialog: and some ammo and explosives for us
dialog: to take. That way we can take on a

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: And it's guarded by Pinkerton

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins
dialog: and currency. And the delay from the

speaker_heading: RAINS
dialog: I'll kill them for blowing up my

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: To be precise, they didn't blow up

speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: By burning down their homes?
speaker_heading: RAINS
dialog: You wouldn't have done that?
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: Oh no, I would have done that. But
dialog: I would have made sure I killed

speaker_heading: RAINS

speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: Would a jury around here convict

dialog: "A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad

speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: It is a nice piece of writing.
speaker_heading: RAINS
dialog: "The gang made off with thirty-five
dialog: thousand dollars and also destroyed
dialog: the Thaxton Switch construction,
dialog: meaning that for a few months honest
dialog: farmers will be able to sleep

text: (he slams the paper
dialog: into Parker's chest)
dialog: Who wrote this!? I'll see him
dialog: hanged every Tuesday for a month!
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: Oh, that's the best part.

speaker_heading: RAINS
dialog: "The foregoing article was sent to

speaker_heading: RAINS
dialog: Pinkerton, why can't you get these

speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: It's early in the game yet, Mr.

speaker_heading: RAINS
dialog: I'm losing millions of dollars and

speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: Hardly farmers. I've done some

dialog: These men know sabotage, tactics,
dialog: and have four years of bloody

text: They are disciplined, well-trained
dialog: and have a charismatic leader. If I
dialog: were to design the perfect outlaw

speaker_heading: COLE

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No, Jimmy has a point. The

dialog: confusing.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Say we bust into a bank. We yell
dialog: "We're the Younger-James Gang!"
dialog: People are gonna be thinking, "The
dialog: younger James Gang? Is there an
dialog: older James Gang? How come we never
dialog: heard of the older James gang?" So
dialog: people are trying to figure that out

speaker_heading: JESSE

text: Cole rolls his eyes.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I think you boys are missing the

dialog: How about "James-Younger" for the

speaker_heading: COMANCHE TOM

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: What about your detectives? They
dialog: haven't --
text: Pinkerton suddenly CLOSES on Rains and Parker. Rains
text: doesn't back down, but we are acutely aware of the fact that

text: his voice here, but then again -- he doesn't have to.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: (to Parker)
dialog: First of all: you, shut up.
dialog: (to Rains)
dialog: Now, you've given me a thousand
dialog: miles of railroad to cover. Every
dialog: time the James Gang strikes, we
dialog: shift a hundred detectives to that
dialog: area. But there's just too much open
dialog: land, too many riverbeds to ride,
text: caves to hide in. This gang operates
dialog: across four states, often riding a
text: hundred miles between jobs.
speaker_heading: RAINS
dialog: I can't believe this.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: And there are some towns in
dialog: Missouri where James and his men can
text: walk openly, as heroes.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: How can that be?
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: They donate money to farmers, to
dialog: churches. Rumor has it they gave the
dialog: sharecroppers of Maddox so much
dialog: money they were able to build a
dialog: school.
speaker_heading: RAINS
dialog: With my money!
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: We should go burn that school to

speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: (dryly)
dialog: Yes, that's the way to win the

speaker_heading: RAINS
dialog: I demand action.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON

speaker_heading: JESSE

speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: If you'd read about it first, you'd

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What are you saying?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I've robbed just as many banks as

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You're forgetting who's in charge --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (calming him)
dialog: Jesse.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Oh, you're in charge? We ain't

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Cole, he didn't mean that.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You taking sides against me, now,
dialog: Frank?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No, I --
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: So being with me is being against
dialog: you? Well, we don't want to do that!
dialog: None of us poor idiots want to go up

speaker_heading: COMANCHE TOM

speaker_heading: COMANCHE TOM

dialog: I'm the better soldier, Jesse.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: And I'm the better outlaw.
text: Jim steps up.
speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What about that Rock Island bastard?
speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: JESSE
text: Still smells fishy.
speaker_heading: COLE

text: Jesse FIRES from between his legs as he rolls across the
text: desk. The assassins start to drop.
text: Jesse completes his roll at a railing separating the

text: The gunmen are crossing into each other's line of fire,
text: Jesse's movement confusing them. Jesse's killed another

speaker_heading: JESSE

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Jim was old enough...
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (snorts)
dialog: He was a boy riding with the most

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You're a piss-poor liar for the
dialog: smartest man I know.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: A war against the railroad. What
dialog: the hell were we thinking?
speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: BACK TO

speaker_heading: ANGLE ON

speaker_heading: JESSE

speaker_heading: BOB

text: Frank nods. He's leaving too.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Go ahead. Ride on. But don't come

speaker_heading: JESSE

speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JESSE

text: Jesse chases Zee out into the surf. They splash around
text: until the water gets shoulder-deep, then both submerge. They
text: reappear, locked in a kiss. CLOSE ON Zee's face as they
text: break the kiss and embrace. She's in heaven. She opens her
text: eyes, facing the beach. Something passes over her face.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: the beach, where fifty Pinkerton detectives with rifles are
text: lined up like a firing squad.
speaker_heading: BACK TO
text: Zee's face. She squeezes Jesse tighter.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: Don't turn around.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: If you don't see it, it's not
dialog: real...
text: Jesse turns around to see --
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH
text: A familiar figure walking along the sand. When the figure
text: reaches the center of the line of detectives, he turns to
dialog: the couple and --
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: Jesse James, you are under arrest!
text: Jesse takes one longing gaze at the open ocean. He heads
dialog: for shore.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. SALOON
text: Cole and the Gang are killing time. Bob runs in.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: They arrested Jesse!
text: He throws the paper to the other Gang members, but walks
text: straight to Cole. The two brothers stare at each other.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: How'd they --
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What have you done?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I ain't done --
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
text: Bob draws on Cole. Cole is shattered.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Bob. I didn't...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Swear.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I swear --
speaker_heading: BOB
text: Swear on Jimmy's grave.
text: Cole hesitates. Bob thumbs back the hammer. Comanche Tom's
text: hand closes over Bob's gun.
speaker_heading: COMANCHE TOM
dialog: Bob. You know Cole would never do
dialog: such a thing. He and Jesse are best
dialog: friends. They are cousins, blood
dialog: brothers.
text: Bob considers it, lowers the gun.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'm sorry, Cole.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You're just upset about Jesse. We
dialog: all are.
text: Bob walks off. Comanche Tom speaks, but keeps his eyes on
dialog: Bob.
speaker_heading: COMANCHE TOM
dialog: My people know that when a brother
text: kills a brother, a great curse comes
text: down on that man, and when he dies
text: he walks the desert as a dark
dialog: spirit. I like Bob too much to let
dialog: that happen.
dialog: (looking at Cole)
dialog: If I find out you turned in Jesse,
dialog: I'll kill you myself.
text: Comanche Tom moves off. Cole's thoughts are his own.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. FORT JEFFERSON - NIGHT
text: An establishing shot of the Florida fort being lashed by
dialog: rain.
scene_heading: INT. CELL
text: A dank, black cell far in the bowels of Fort Jefferson. WE
text: HEAR CLANKING.
text: WIDEN TO REVEAL Jesse doing push-ups. They come easily,
text: despite Jesse being chained up like the Frankenstein monster.
text: The DOOR OPENS. Jesse looks up in mid-push-up. Alan
text: Pinkerton is looking down at him.
text: Jesse moves to the bed. Pinkerton, flanked by two guards,
text: ENTERS. He sits on a stool provided by one of the guards.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: We're moving you tomorrow.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: But I like the presidential suite.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: Oh, it's a similar room. But the
dialog: hotel is in Washington D.C. You're
dialog: not going to get a fair trial down
text: here, in front of a jury of Jesse
text: James sympathizers.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: So I'll get a fair trial in front
dialog: of a jury bought off by Thaddeus
dialog: Rains?
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: That's the idea.
text: Pinkerton produces two cigars, presenting one to Jesse.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Did you order our houses burned
dialog: down?
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: Not that day. I am guilty of many
dialog: things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus
dialog: Rains and Parker, that day.
text: Jesse takes the cigar, and Pinkerton lights both. They puff
text: for a moment.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON (CONT'D)
dialog: (tapping bad leg)
dialog: Was this you, by the way?
text: Jesse exposes his scar.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You almost ended my career before
dialog: it began.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: Pity.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON (CONT'D)
dialog: How did you spot the ambush in
dialog: Torrell?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Last February?
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: Mmm.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You had all those cattle there, so
dialog: I'd think the extra men were in town
dialog: from the cattle drive?
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: The cows had a brand from a farm
text: just five miles out of town.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: Damn.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Almost got me in Billings. I saw
dialog: you there, shooting at me.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: I went myself to oversee the
dialog: operation. Didn't help much.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No, that one was close. A couple
dialog: fellas quit after that one.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: Oh. That's nice to know.
dialog: (then)
dialog: We're going to hang you, you know.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I figured.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: Was it worth it?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Should have just killed Thaddeus
text: Rains and been done with it.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: That's what I would have done.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I'm not hanged yet.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: You cocky little bastard.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Ahh, you'll miss me.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: No, I'll hang you.
dialog: (then)
dialog: But I may miss you just a bit.
text: As Jesse and Pinkerton smoke and discuss the past year...
scene_heading: EXT. TRAINYARD
text: Two guards are leading Jesse, who is in heavy arm irons,
text: toward a prison car at the end of a waiting train.
text: Pinkerton, Thaddeus Rains, and Parker walk up.
speaker_heading: RAINS
dialog: This is him.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: I remember you.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You're Parker. I remember you, too.
dialog: You killed my Ma.
text: Parker is set back by Jesse's voice. To cover his fear --
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: How did you know?
speaker_heading: RAINS
dialog: Not such a menace now, is he,
dialog: Pinkerton?
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: If you feel that way, I could
dialog: always take off the irons.
text: Rains glares at Pinkerton, then turns back to Jesse.
speaker_heading: RAINS
dialog: You stole thousands. You cost me
dialog: tens of millions of dollars, months
dialog: of lost construction. I wish I could
dialog: hang you every single morning for a
dialog: century.
text: Rains checks his Pocketwatch, spots Jesse eyeing it.
speaker_heading: RAINS (CONT'D)
dialog: You like that? Solid gold, my
dialog: father had it made when he started
dialog: this railroad. He gave it to me when
dialog: I took over, I'll give it to my son
dialog: when he runs this company, and he'll
dialog: give it to his son -- The right type
dialog: of men will always run this country,
dialog: Jesse James, and little men like you
dialog: will always suffer. You have stopped
dialog: nothing.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Made you think twice about burning
dialog: folks' homes down now, didn't I?
text: Jesse winks.
text: With that Parker reaches back and SUCKER PUNCHES Jesse.
text: Rains gloats as Jesse gets his breath back.
speaker_heading: RAINS
dialog: We'll speak again in Washington,
dialog: you insect.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You're coming on the same train?
text: Rains involuntarily looks behind Jesse. Jesse cranes his
text: head and spots a CLUB CAR at the front of the train, several
text: cars away from his prison car. The other cars are packed
text: with Pinkerton detectives.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, tell you what. I'm going to
dialog: have to pay you a visit.
speaker_heading: RAINS
dialog: Big words.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: It's a promise.
text: Everyone is a little shaken by the steel in Jesse's voice.
text: The guards DRAG JESSE OFF.
scene_heading: INT. PRISON CAR
text: The guards turn Jesse over to a BURLY DETECTIVE. Pinkerton
text: enters just behind him. There are ten detectives in total in
dialog: the car.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: Hook him up.
text: The Burly Detective brings Jesse's arms above his head. He
text: loops Jesse's chain over a rail that runs the length of the
text: car. Two other detectives walk Jesse down the car, Jesse's
text: hands suspended over his head. Jesse can just barely sit
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON (CONT'D)
text: Now the guns.
scene_heading: BURLY DETECTIVE
dialog: I don't like it. We can handle him.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: In the ten seconds we have been in
dialog: this car, I have seen you get close
dialog: enough for Jesse James to grab your
dialog: guns at least three times. And I
dialog: assure you, if he gets his hands on
dialog: one of your guns, you are all, and I
dialog: mean all dead men.
scene_heading: BURLY DETECTIVE
text: He's chained up.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: I'll put that on your tombstone.
dialog: The guns.
text: Grumbling, the detectives deposit their pistols in a box
text: near the front of the car. Pinkerton walks out.
text: The Burly Detective slides a Colt into his waistband.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: Jesse, alone, surrounded by ten Pinkerton guards. The train
text: LURCHES, and they're off.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
text: The prison train highballs through the wooded, rolling
text: hills. We see the engine, the coal car, a detective car,
text: then the private salon car, two more cars of guards, and
text: then the prison car.
scene_heading: INT. PRISON CAR
text: Five guards are playing poker. Five others are standing
text: along the length of the car. Jesse looks at the gun box
text: waaay down the other end of the car.
text: Things shift, and we (and Jesse) realize the train is going
dialog: downhill.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Hey, fatty.
text: The Burly Detective looks up.
scene_heading: BURLY DETECTIVE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here
dialog: piggy piggy!
text: The detectives close on Jesse. Jesse stands as the Burly
text: Detective moves right up on him.
scene_heading: BURLY DETECTIVE
dialog: What you sayin' boy?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I think I recognize you.
scene_heading: BURLY DETECTIVE
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I think I saw you leavin' by the
dialog: front door just as I was coming in
dialog: the back.
text: The other detectives try to hide grins.
scene_heading: BURLY DETECTIVE
dialog: You shut up now, boy.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No, really. You're wife said she
dialog: needed some help, seeing as you were
dialog: so fat you couldn't find your --
text: Burly Detectives BACKHANDS Jesse. Jesse spits blood and
dialog: grins.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, she said you did that to her
dialog: too.
text: Burly draws, points the gun right at Jesse's face. The
text: other detectives GASP. Jesse stares down the barrel, then
text: raises his eyes and speaks in a voice that is low and
dialog: terrifying.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Y'know, I could do this without the
dialog: gun, but it just makes things easier.
text: SLAM as Jesse KICKS Burly in the crotch! The gun FIRES,
text: missing Jesse's head only because he jerks it like a
dialog: mongoose.
text: Jesse BACKHANDS the detective with the heavy chain! The gun
text: drops right into Jesse's hands --
text: The guards are running for the gun box --
text: Jesse flips the chain TIGHT, TUCKS UP and KICKS OFF from
text: the back wall and SLIDES THE LENGTH OF THE RAIL over the
text: detectives' heads! As he reaches the end he FIRES the gun,
text: blowing open the gun box. Jesse then SHOOTS the rail's
text: ceiling strut, and then KICKS at the roof.
text: The rail WRENCHES FREE, dropping Jesse to the floor. In a
text: blur he's up, reaching into the gun box. He tosses one gun
text: INTO THE AIR, then FANS THE HAMMER of another.
text: Half the guards drop, but the other half are right on top
dialog: of him and nobody's that fast --
text: Jesse drops the spent gun, CATCHES the other gun in the
text: opposite hand and FANS THAT HAMMER all in a single breath!
text: As the smoke clears, the last of the detectives falls with
text: a THUD.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN
text: Jesse pops open the door to his car. He's improvised a
text: gunbelt like his old one, holding six Colts. He's still
text: holding the chain from his restraints. Now that they're no
text: longer wrapped around Jesse, we see they're at least a few
text: yards long.
scene_heading: INT. THIRD TROOP CAR
text: Some Pinkertons LOOK UP as a BANG sounds from on top of the
dialog: car.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN
text: And Jesse JUMPS OFF THE ROOF and --
text: CLANK as the chains -- fastened to the roof -- go taut and
text: Jesse is at window level and he's FIRING AND FIRING into the
dialog: car!
scene_heading: INT. THIRD TROOP CAR
text: Pinkertons falling, drawing their guns, not able to get a
dialog: bead on Jesse because --
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN
text: Jesse is running along the side of the car, supported by
text: the chain! Still shooting, he reaches the end, KICKS UP and
text: is on the roof again.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: one Detective, barely alive, stumbling through the door,
text: opening the door to the next
scene_heading: INT. SECOND TROOP CAR
text: The detectives inside start as the wounded man falls into
text: the doorway.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN
text: Jesse looks down and sees heavily armed Pinkertons coming
text: out of the doorway.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Shit.
text: But there's no turning back and he jumps to the top of the
scene_heading: EXT. SECOND TROOP CAR
text: Jesse's running and the Pinkertons start SHOOTING THROUGH
text: the roof. Jesse miraculously is untouched, almost to the
speaker_heading: CLUB CAR...
scene_heading: INT. CLUB CAR
text: Pinkerton is already moving as Parker and Thaddeus Rains
dialog: look around.
speaker_heading: RAINS
dialog: What the hell is that sound?
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: Vengeance.
scene_heading: INT. FIRST TROOP CAR
text: Pinkerton bursts in. The men snap to.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: Outside! Get up on top! Go GO!
scene_heading: EXT. CLUB CAR
text: Jesse JUMPS onto the club car, but pulls up short as
text: detectives appear ahead of him. He turns to see other
text: detectives climbing up behind him. He's trapped.
text: BUT WE HEAR A LOW WHISTLE AND
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN ENGINE
text: The engine EXPLODES! Sparks fly as the twisted engine
text: GRINDS onto the tracks!
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN
text: The momentum carries everyone off their feet! Some
text: detectives are torn from the train. Jesse slides across the
dialog: roof of the Club Car --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN TRACK
text: CLOSE ON a smoking CANNON sitting on the tracks. WIDEN TO
text: REVEAL Frank and Cole on horseback shading their eyes. Zee
text: is daintily blowing out a fuse lighter.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Nice shot.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: Thank you. Now go get my husband.
text: The two men start to gallop toward the train.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN
text: Jesse, Pinkerton, and the detectives look down the track
dialog: and see...
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN TRACK
text: Frank and Cole riding toward them. From the woods ride
text: Comanche Tom and Bob Younger, folding into perfect
text: formation. The four THUNDER toward the train.
scene_heading: INT. CLUB CAR
text: Pinkerton rushes back in. Parker and Rains are looking out
text: the window.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: There's only four of them...
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: Move you fools!
text: He grabs the two businessmen and heads them to the rear of
dialog: the train.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN TRACK
text: Frank draws a gun and FIRES.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS
text: TWO DOZEN RIDERS pour out of the woods, all firing at the
text: Pinkerton! The Pinkertons return fire, taking shelter in the
text: train cars as the riders strafe the train.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN
text: Jesse swings over the edge of the train, looks through the
text: window. Rains is gone. He turns and starts running back
text: along the top of the train.
scene_heading: EXT. PRISON CAR
text: Pinkerton, Rains and Parker tumble out of the door and run
dialog: for the woods.
text: Jesse LEAPS DOWN from the top of the train onto Pinkerton!
text: They wrestle, separate. Pinkerton stands, reaching for his
text: gunbelt.
text: Empty.
text: With almost a resigned sigh, he looks up. Jesse's pointing
text: the gun at Pinkerton's head.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: Do it.
dialog: Jesse FIRES.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: Pinkerton, stunned to realize he's still alive. He turns to
text: see Parker, fall to the ground, his own gun half-drawn,
text: Jesse turns the gun on Rains.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: That was for my Ma. Now this is for
dialog: everybody else.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: He's too important, James. They'll
dialog: set the army on you. You and your
dialog: wife.
text: Jesse stares at Rains, Rains stares back, the tension
text: building...Jesse's about to shoot...and says:
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: That is a nice watch you got there.
text: Rains looks down at the fob, back up. The tension isn't
dialog: broken.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: I tell you what, I'll buy that
dialog: watch from you, for the fair market
dialog: price approved by the Department of
dialog: the Interior: one dollar.
text: Rains hesitates. Jesse thumbs the hammer back
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: If I were you, I'd sell. After
dialog: this, the price goes...down.
text: Rains tosses the Watch to Jesse as Jesse simultaneously
text: FLIPS Rains a dollar coin with his free hand. Jesse holds up
dialog: the Watch.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Now every time you go to look at
dialog: this watch and it's not there,
dialog: you'll remember: You can be stopped.
dialog: Pass that down to your son, instead.
text: Jesse thumbs the hammer forwards, lowers the gun. Rains
text: falls to his knees, numb from the tension.
text: Frank rides up. Jesse empties Pinkerton's gun and hands it
text: to him. Pinkerton holds him for a second.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: (low)
dialog: Tennessee.
text: Jesse doesn't understand.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON (CONT'D)
dialog: The railroad has no business in
dialog: Tennessee. Therefore I have no
dialog: interest in the state of Tennessee.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: PINKERTON
dialog: I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse
dialog: James. But chasing you takes up too
dialog: much of my time.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Fair enough.
text: Zee RIDES UP. Jesse SWINGS UP onto her horse, and then they
text: RIDE OFF with Frank.
text: We PULL UP AND AWAY, centering on Pinkerton, Rains, and
text: revealing the smoking, burning wreckage of the train.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLSIDE FIELDS - DAY
text: Most of the Gang is mounted. Frank, Cole and Bob are
text: standing there, watching.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: Jesse and Zee riding up on one horse.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: You get arrested again, I'll kill
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yes ma'am.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: I can't believe I had to blow up a
dialog: train for you.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You are a hell of a woman.
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: Don't swear.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yes ma'am.
text: They reach the Gang. Jesse SWINGS OFF his horse, gets one
text: of Cole's BEAR HUGS.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Missed you, cousin.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Missed you too, cousin.
text: Jesse notices Cole is oddly emotional, but can't quite
dialog: figure out what's going on.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You know, you gettin' caught, right
dialog: after leaving us, some people
dialog: thought --
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Pff. All we been through, the
dialog: thought never crossed my mind.
text: The two clasp hands.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Things changed when you quit the
dialog: gang. For example, I'm now the one
dialog: who says "Let's ride."
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: He's not bad at it.
speaker_heading: BOB
text: It's tougher than it looks.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Where'd you get all these riders?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out
dialog: your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: So what's the plan?
text: Jesse looks at Zerelda and Frank.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I think my wife and I might go down
dialog: Tennessee way, buy a farm.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Goodbye, boys.
text: The Youngers smile sadly, but NOD. As the Younger brothers
text: SADDLE UP, Comanche Tom leans down from the saddle and
text: shakes Jesse's hand.
speaker_heading: COMANCHE TOM
dialog: You stay out of trouble, Jesse.
dialog: Nobody has as much luck as you used
dialog: up today.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: Jesse getting back on his horse with Zee. Frank stands
text: there and watches them.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'll meet you down there in a few
dialog: weeks.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate
text: the distraction back there.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hell, they hardly even noticed us.
text: Jesse and Frank grin.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Let's ride!
text: Jesse flips the reins and he and Zee RIDE OFF, the GANG
text: with the Youngers RIDES OFF in the opposite direction.
text: Frank watches them ride away. WE HEAR faintly:
speaker_heading: ZEE
dialog: Tennessee?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I'll explain on the way.
text: Then it's Frank alone on the hill. WE CIRCLE around behind
dialog: him, come around, see he's AGED a little, CIRCLE AGAIN and
text: now he's AGED MORE, we come around one more time and...
scene_heading: EXT. HILLSIDE NEAR LIBERTY - DAY - TWENTY YEARS LATER
text: ...we COMPLETE THE CIRCLE and see young Frank James is now
text: an older FRANK JAMES. Still lean, a few wrinkles, a little
text: grey in the hair, dressed in expensive turn-of-the-century
text: western clothes. A young man who looks remarkably like
text: Jesse, JIMMY JAMES, 16 years old, is waiting patiently. The
text: two are looking down on the town of Liberty, Missouri, which
text: is now swollen five sizes larger. The Wild West is
text: disappearing under roads and telegraph wire.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Y'know, Uncle Frank...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah, Jimmy?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (genially chiding)
dialog: ...every time you tell that story,
dialog: you stop there. That's not how it
dialog: ended. I was five when my dad got
dialog: shot.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I know. But that's how it should
dialog: have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding
text: off into a new life, growing old
text: together, happy.
text: They start to walk back to the edge of town.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Allow a man his version of the
dialog: past. When you get to be my age,
dialog: you've got enough painful memories,
dialog: you're allowed to soften a few of
text: the edges up.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: That he was.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: They're making him a hero now.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Saved a lot of folk from the
dialog: railroad.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: But he killed a lot of men, too.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Can't argue that.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: So what was he?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I think... he was just a real
dialog: interestin' fella to have around.
text: Frank chuckles again at the memories, claps his hand on
text: Jimmy's shoulder.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, your Ma's probably holding
dialog: dinner for us. Once saw the woman
dialog: blow up a train, don't want to tick
dialog: her off...
text: Jimmy grins and the pair walk down the hill. We stay ON
text: THEIR BACKS as they continue talking.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.S.) (O.S.)
dialog: Uncle Frank?
speaker_heading: FRANK (O.S.) (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah Jimmy?
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.S.) (O.S.)
dialog: How much of that story is true?
speaker_heading: FRANK (O.S.) (O.S.)
dialog: Everything but the boring parts.
