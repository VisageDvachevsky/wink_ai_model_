scene_heading: INT. DANCE CLUBS- QUICK SHOTS - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PALACE - NIGHT
text: The CAMERA MOVES THROUGH a crowded dance floor -- and
text: SETTLES ON the rhythmically swaying backs of...
speaker_heading: STEVE & DOUG BUTABI
text: Our heroes. In their minds, Steve is tall, dark and handsome and DOUG is a little genius. Neither is correct
dialog: -- except for the tall and little part.
text: They simultaneously turn and scope the room. In unison,
text: their heads bop to the MUSIC. Doug steps out from the
dialog: bar.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (to O.S. female)
dialog: Hey! You want to dance? No?
dialog: Yes? Alright, don't worry about
dialog: it.
text: Doug, rejected, steps back as Steve steps out.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (to O.S. female)
dialog: Do you want to dance? You do?
dialog: You don't? Not a problem.
text: They are no strangers to rejection, so neither is fazed.
text: Doug enthusiastically steps towards two attractive girls.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hey, you wanna...?
text: Two attractive girls turn their backs to Doug.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (remaining positive)
dialog: No? Maybe I'll see you later.
text: Doug steps back. Steve spots GIRL AT end of BAR and
text: dances over to her.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Hey, do you want to dance?
speaker_heading: GIRL AT BAR
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (cheerfully)
dialog: Alright, you know where I'll be.
text: Steve steps back. Doug sees a pretty woman on a balcony,
text: waving to someone.
speaker_heading: DOUG/STEVE
dialog: (pointing to each other)
dialog: You want him? Me? Him? Me?
text: Pretty woman waves them off, frustrated, and dissapears.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: ... Oh, you're okay?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Alright then.
text: They turn around to the bar, bartender is standing in
text: front of them.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Bartender, can I get a beer?
text: The bartender pays no attention and walks away. Second
text: bartender comes from the opposite direction.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Barkeep, what do you have on tap?
text: The second bartender ignores them, walks away. The
text: bartenders keep crossing past the, paying no attention.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Big guy, could I get a...
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: My man, how 'bout a...
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: S'cuse me, partner...
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yo, buddy, I was wondering... you
dialog: know what? Don't worry about it.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah, we're good.
text: They turn back to the dance floor and bop. Suddenly, a
text: HOT GIRL dances in front of them.
text: Doug dances up behind her and frantically gyrates. She
text: turns away -- only to find...
text: Steve gyrating behind her. The guys close in on her
text: trapping her in the middle.
speaker_heading: HOT GIRL
dialog: Get off me!
text: She runs off, furious. The guys, unaware that she's
text: upset, celebrate.
speaker_heading: STEVE/DOUG
dialog: Score!
text: They high five. The doorman comes over with the upset
text: Girl and pulls the guys out.
speaker_heading: STEVE/DOUG
dialog: What? What's goin' on? What's
dialog: your problem?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SUNSET BLVD. - NIGHT
text: The road flies by as we PAN UP the front grill of a red
text: BMW to reveal Doug and Steve. The car stops next to two
text: girls in a white Porshe.
scene_heading: INT. BMW - NIGHT
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: We got some sweetness on the left.
text: Doug Turns UP the STEREO really loud so the car is
dialog: pounding.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (to the girls)
dialog: What's up?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (to the girls)
dialog: How you ladies doin' tonight?
speaker_heading: INTERCUT GIRLS' POV
text: The guys moving their mouths -- but the girls can't hear
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: GIRL #1
dialog: Turn your music down!
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah! Just follow us!
speaker_heading: GIRL #2
dialog: You're a big stupid ass!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: No. You have beautiful eyes!
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I like you too!
speaker_heading: GIRL #1
dialog: Go home, jerkoff!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Okay, we'll meet you there.
text: The light turns green. Girls drive off.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROXBURY CLUB - NIGHT
text: A neon sign reads "ROXBURY."
scene_heading: ROXBURY CLUB FRONT DOOR
text: A huge muscular BOUNCER, wearing a headset, guards the
text: roped off area. Doug and Steve confidently strut past
dialog: the crowd.
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: Stop!
speaker_heading: DOUG/STEVE
dialog: What's up?
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: Guys, this is the Roxbury. No one
dialog: gets in unless you're on the list.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: We're on the list.
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: Names?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Doug Butabi.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Steve Butabi.
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: You're brothers?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: No...
text: They slowly turn to each other and bust.
speaker_heading: DOUG/STEVE
dialog: ... Yes!
text: They high five, laughing.
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: Quite a joke.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Doug is hilarious.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah, I know.
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: Yeah, you ever hear this one?
dialog: You're not on the list.
text: Behind Steve and Doug, a '98 yellow FERRARI SCREECHES up
text: to the valet. Car door opens and...
speaker_heading: RICHARD GRIECO
text: gets out. Looking great, in an Armani suit, beautiful
text: supermodel accompanies him.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (beside himself)
dialog: Is that...?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: It is. The King of '21 Jump
dialog: Street.' Richard Grieco.
text: Grieco quickly steps past Steve and Doug.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (aside to Doug)
dialog: Check the wheels.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Check the hottie.
text: The Bouncer jumps aside, letting them enter. Richard
text: inadvertently rubs his nose as he enters.
speaker_heading: DOUG & STEVE
text: Watching. They both imitate his nose rub and try to
text: follow him in. The Bouncer steps in front of them.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (yelling at Grieco
dialog: like they know him)
dialog: Alright, we'll see you later then!
dialog: (to Bouncer)
dialog: You know what? We're gonna take
dialog: off now.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Maybe we'll hang out later.
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: There's no chance of that
dialog: happening.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Sounds good.
text: The guys exit.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BMW - NIGHT
text: The guys are driving.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You know what was wrong with that
dialog: place.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: It's hard to say, since we didn't
dialog: get in.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: It's just a poorly run operation.
dialog: They can't properly evaluate the
text: incoming clientele.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I thought we just didn't look cool
dialog: enough.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: C'mon. You? You're a beautiful
dialog: man. I tell you what I'd do if it
dialog: were my club. I would treat all
dialog: the outside wannabes just as well
dialog: as any legendary former television
dialog: star.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: That's pretty Roosevelt of you.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: It's just what I believe in.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SUNSET BLVD - LATER
text: A police car drives behind them, turns on the SIREN.
dialog: INT. BMW
text: The sound of the SIREN mixes with their MUSIC.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Must be the new dance mix version.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER (O.S.)
dialog: (loud speaker)
text: Pull over to the side of the road!
text: A female POLICE OFFICER signals them to pull over.
speaker_heading: DRIVER'S WINDOW
text: The officer steps up to their car.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: You know you were doing fifty?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (yelling over radio)
dialog: What?
text: She reaches in, shuts OFF RADIO -- starts filling out
dialog: ticket.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: This is a twenty-five mile an hour
dialog: zone.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hottie cop likes you.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You serious?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You think she pulls over anybody?
dialog: Mave a move.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (turning to her)
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Not much, I'm just giving you an
dialog: eighty dollar ticket.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: She is so into you.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Can I see your license and
dialog: registration?
text: Steve pulls the documents off the sun visor, hands them
dialog: over.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (seductively)
dialog: I think I got what you're looking
dialog: for.
text: She takes it, walks back to police car. Doug adjusts the
text: rearview mirror.
speaker_heading: POLICE CAR
text: She's on the radio.
speaker_heading: DOUG
text: She's calling her friends.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Seriously?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Here she comes.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: How's my hair?
text: She hands Steve the papers and a ticket.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: I want you to do me a favor.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Whatever you say, TJ Hooker.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Please obey any and all posted
dialog: speed limit signs. Have a good
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: It's already good, now that you've
dialog: served and protected me.
text: She laughs it off, walks away. Doug takes the ticket.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Way to go, my friend. You got her
dialog: badge number plus a month from now
dialog: you have a date to meet her at the
dialog: Municipal State Court. Up top!
speaker_heading: DOUG/STEVE
dialog: Score!
text: They high five and PEEL OUT.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. FLORENTINE GARDENS DANCE CLUB - NIGHT
text: This is a very downscale crowd, crappy cars, surrounding a dilapidated building.
scene_heading: INT. FLORENTINE GARDENS CLUB - NIGHT
text: Completely packed. People are physically wedged up
dialog: against one another.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: This is what it's all about.
text: A big SECURITY GUY plows through the area.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUY
dialog: Folks, we got to keep this area
dialog: clear!
text: The crowd moves, sweeping the guys along. Doug and Steve
text: settle in a different spot.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: There's a good feeling in here.
scene_heading: ANOTHER SECURITY GUY
dialog: People, there's no lingering by
dialog: the exits!
text: As it moves, Doug is engulfed in the crowd and
dialog: disappears.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Doug?... Hey, Doug!... Whoa!
text: Steve is shoved away as the crowd moves again.
speaker_heading: DOUG
text: jumps up and pops his head above the crowd.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Steve!
speaker_heading: STEVE
text: is wedged into a corner.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Doug!
speaker_heading: DOUG
text: pops up near the entrance to the men's room.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Steve!
speaker_heading: DANCE FLOOR
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Doug!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MEN'S BATHROOM
text: Doug's face is wedged up against a mirror. He struggles
text: to pull a cellular phone put of his pocket and dial.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
speaker_heading: DANCE FLOOR
text: Steve is wedged against a blinking light. We hear a
text: cellular PHONE RING. Steve reaches in his pocket and
text: pulls out his phone.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Steve, it's Doug.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Oh, hey, Doug. So, what's going on?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Not much. Where are you?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I don't know. Where are you?
text: Doug gets pushed up against a urinal.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: There's a lot of guys pulling down
dialog: their pants, so it's either the
dialog: bathroom or the V.I.P room. Meet
dialog: me back at the bar. If I don't
dialog: make it, I'll see you tommorow at
dialog: home.
text: DOUG hangs up. O.S. we hear someone UNZIP.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (panicked)
dialog: Hey, just hold on a second.
text: Doug moves away.
scene_heading: INT. DANCE FLOOR - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Two very bored club girls are standing up against a wall.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: So, anyway, I'm standing there
dialog: waiting to use the pay phone...
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah, he was. Seriously.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: And this guy who's on the phone
text: turns around and tips his hat like
dialog: this.
text: DOUG does a "tip your hat" motion.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: And who do you think the guy was?
text: Girls still stone-faced.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Emilio Estevez.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: The Mighty Duckman. Swear to God.
dialog: I was there.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (teasing)
dialog: Of course, you were. You're the
dialog: one who yelled the breakfast
dialog: clubber's name.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I was like -- 'Emilioooo!'
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: So, anyway... you guys want to
dialog: make out or what?
text: The girls stare at them.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. AM/PM MIN-MART GAS STATION - NIGHT
text: The guys pull up. Doug gets out and starts to pump gas.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Score some chippage. I'll meet
dialog: you in there.
text: Steve exits into the AM/PM. Doug notices a woman puttng
text: gas into her car. She feins a smile, looks away.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hey!
text: Doug starts pulling the pump in and out of the gas
text: tank -- simulating copulation. She's repulsed.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. AM/PM -- CONTINOUS ACTION
text: Steve looking at a bag of Pork Rinds. Doug comes up from
dialog: behind.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hey, she's totally looking at you.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Who?
text: Doug motions toward the CASHIER. She snaps her gum and
dialog: is reading People magazine.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Ask her where the chips are.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: But, I know where they are.
text: DOUG pushes him. Steve walks over to the Cashier.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Excuse me, I'm looking for the
dialog: potato chips. You know, chips
dialog: made out of potato.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: They're right behind you.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Wow, you really know what's going
dialog: on, don't you?
text: He turns away and pretends to look at the chips. Doug
text: gives him a thumbs up.
text: Richard Grieco enters the store and walks up to the
text: Cashier. She lights up, recognizing Grieco.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Steve, look.
text: Doug and Steve walk up to Grieco.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (trying to be cool)
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: RICHARD GRIECO
dialog: ... Hey.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Remember us? We were at the
dialog: Roxbury.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (to Grieco)
dialog: We were outside?
text: Grieco turns to Cashier.
speaker_heading: RICHARD GRIECO
dialog: Could I get a pack of Marlboro
dialog: Lights and that 12-pack of
dialog: Trojans. Thanks.
text: Cashier rings it up, hands it to him.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: (obviously enamored)
dialog: Thanks.
text: Grieco exits, they all watch. Steve approaches Cashier.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah, I think I'm gonna need a 12-
text: pack of Trojans over there.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: You know, they expire in two
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT
text: Doug and Steve watch Grieco's Ferrari drive off as they
text: sit on the car and eat Pork Rinds.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: That nabob has got it going on.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (sadly envious)
dialog: Kickin' it at the Roxbury, rollin'
text: a banana Ferrari.
speaker_heading: DOUG
text: Tasty geisha by his side.
speaker_heading: STEVE
text: The man is a bag of chips.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (correcting him)
text: All that and a bag of chips.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Right. Well, we're doing okay. I
dialog: got a number tonight.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (thrilled)
dialog: Let me see it!
text: Steve hands him a cocktail napkin. Doug reads it.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: 555...? Steve, this isn't real.
dialog: It's one of those fake T.V.
dialog: numbers.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Is not.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Is, too. I get this number all
dialog: the time.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: At least she respected me enough
dialog: to write a fake number. We'll get
dialog: a real one one of these days.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: One of these days? Steve, don't
dialog: you get it? These are our days.
dialog: Now! Today! Ahora!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Ah whatta?
text: Doug jumps off the car, starts pacing.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Steve, we're young. We're
dialog: supposed to purge ourselves of the
dialog: party virus or we'll just get so
dialog: clogged up that when we're like
dialog: forty we'll just explode.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah, like one of those individual
dialog: plastic butters you get in the
dialog: diner. You know, like when you
dialog: squish it, just bursts out all
text: over the place.
text: Steve makes explosion sound.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Forget the butter, Steve. I'm
dialog: trying to explain --
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Or like when you put an egg in a
dialog: microwave and all the yellow stuff
text: flies out.
text: He mimes exploding egg.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: That's an exceptional way to
dialog: visualize it but listen to me.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Oh! Remember in camp when we put
dialog: that can of beans in the fire?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: And it exploded. Yes. Steve! If
dialog: we're ever going to live up to our
dialog: full potential, we've got to get
dialog: this partying out of our systems
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Let's do it.
text: They both get in the car.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BMW - NIGHT
speaker_heading: DOUG/STEVE
dialog: Alright, let's do it! Do it!
dialog: Woo!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: ... Do what? Everything's closed.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Then let's go home.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Let's go home! Wooo!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BUTABI HOUSE - MORNING
text: The house is a bad '80s combination of classical styles.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
dialog: We PAN AROUND to see semi-juvenile furniture -- which is
text: overwhelmed by a huge stereo system.
text: Doug sleeps, mouth open. A piece of red licorice reaches
text: INTO FRAME and starts darting in and out of Doug's mouth.
text: He coughs and waves it away. The licorice starts going
text: up his nostril. Doug wakes up.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hey! Knock it off!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Twizzled you, my friend.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah, you totally got me.
text: STEVE laughs at this, starts eating the licorice.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: That was in my nose.
text: Steve stops eating.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN -- DAY
text: Two giant Great Danes plow through, knocking over plates.
dialog: We meet their dad, KAMEHL BUTABI, fifties, Eugene Levi-

speaker_heading: MR. BUTABI
dialog: Captain! Tenille! Stop that!
text: Steve and Doug, in silk bathrobes, hair completely
text: disheveled, enter.
speaker_heading: MR. BUTABI
dialog: Look at this. Barbara, look who's
dialog: honoring us with their presence.
text: We meet their mom, BARBARA BUTABI, well kept trophy wife.
text: She tries to straighten out their hair.
speaker_heading: DOUG/STEVE
dialog: Ma!... come on.
speaker_heading: MRS. BUTABI
dialog: (handing Doug orange
dialog: juice)
dialog: Here...
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (rejecting juice)
dialog: Mom, I'm trying to get my body to
dialog: enter the zone, so I can optimize
dialog: my fat-burning potential, and
dialog: orange juice does not help!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Doug, according to 'Fit for Life'
dialog: the idea of a balanced breakfast
dialog: is a fallacy. Your body is only
dialog: prepared to accept one form of
dialog: food in the A.M. -- fruit.
text: Steve grabs the glass.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You can putrefy your insides if
dialog: you want to. But, I'm having a
dialog: cup of cooked oatmeal, one
dialog: tablespoon protein power...
text: As Doug continues, Mr. Butabi gets more and more annoyed.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: ... and four soy sausage links.
dialog: (to Steve)
dialog: That's how you hit your peak.
speaker_heading: MR. BUTABI
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Quick, Barbara, look at Doug. He
dialog: is hitting his peak. You don't
dialog: want to miss this.
speaker_heading: MRS. BUTABI
dialog: Honey, if you're going to hit your
dialog: peak, do it in your room.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: All I want for breakfast is some
text: sliced mangos and persimmons.
speaker_heading: MR. BUTABI
dialog: That's enough, you two. Your
dialog: mother is not the maid.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: No, can you tell the maid I want
dialog: some sliced mangos and persimmons?
speaker_heading: MR. BUTABI
dialog: I want you both at work in half an
dialog: hour. And, Steve wear something
dialog: nice. Emily's back from school.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Excuse me, Dad, but I think you're
dialog: confusing Steve for someone who
text: gives a flying rat's ass.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Wow, a flying rat's ass. That
dialog: would be wild to see.
speaker_heading: MRS. BUTABI
dialog: Kamehl, they'll be there. Just
dialog: let them have their breakfast.
speaker_heading: MR. BUTABI
dialog: Sure. Eat. They need their
dialog: strength so they can stay out all
dialog: night for their dancing and their
dialog: orgies.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: For your information, Dad, Doug
dialog: and I were not able to find an
dialog: orgy last night.
speaker_heading: MR. BUTABI
dialog: Barbara, explain something to me.
dialog: They graduate from high school and what
dialog: do they do? Nothing. Do they go
dialog: to college? No. Do they take any
dialog: intrest in my business? No. Do
dialog: they think about the future? No.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Dad, if you know all the answers,
dialog: why do you keep asking the questions?
speaker_heading: MR. BUTABI
dialog: Half an hour. I want to see your
text: dance club asses at the store.
dialog: Mr. Butabi exists.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RODEO DRIVE - SIDEWALK- AFTERNOON
text: "Staying Alive" by the BEE GEES. Set of shoes walking, a

text: We WIDEN to another set of shoes -- PAN UP to reveal Doug
text: and Steve, strutting down the street like John Travolta.
text: Each holds a silk plant.
scene_heading: INT. STORE WINDOW - CELL PHONE
text: We see the guys pass. They stop and hold up their cell
dialog: phone to the one in the window -- same way Travolta did
dialog: with the shoe.
text: A beautiful WOMAN walks by. They turn to look at her
text: ass. They run back and stand in front of her. She
text: pushes them aside.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Jerks.
text: She exits. They continue. They pass a cappucino
dialog: cart.
speaker_heading: CAPPUCINO SALESMAN
dialog: Single or double?
text: They look at each other to confirm their choice.
speaker_heading: STEVE/DOUG
dialog: Double.
text: They walk with their iced cappucinos in bubble top cups
text: with straws. MUSIC FADES.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SILK PLANT STORE - LATER
text: Steve and Doug enter holding silk plants. Mr. Butabi
text: walks up to them, takes the plants. Doug is wearing a
dialog: Walkman.
speaker_heading: MR. BUTABI
dialog: Good. Steve, you have a customer.
dialog: Doug, go ring that man up.
text: They both nod agreeably. Steve exists. Doug doesn't
text: move, still listening to the Walkman. Mr. Butabi pulls
text: his walkman off and points at the register. Doug exists.
speaker_heading: CASH REGISTER COUNTER
text: Doug steps behind the counter, helping a COUPLE with several silk floral arrangements.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: How will you be paying for this?
dialog: Cash, check or charge?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (pulling it out)
dialog: Charge.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (looking at it)
dialog: Visa, Mastercard, or Discover?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Move your thumb.
dialog: Doug moves it.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Oh... Visa. Good one.
text: Doug makes a "you got me" motion. He slides the card

speaker_heading: SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR

speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: CUSTOMER #1
dialog: Are these supposed to be ferns?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: That's what people will say. But
dialog: guess what?
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER #1
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (whispers in ear)
dialog: ... it's not real. It's silk.
dialog: (acting in shock)
dialog: Oh, be careful!
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER #1
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You've accidentally wandered into
dialog: the Enchanted Forest. Allow me to
dialog: be your guide.
text: Steve ducks behind the four or five silk trees that make
text: up the "forest" and sticks his head out from between two
text: trees -- now wearing a safari hat. He picks up a watering pot, tips it on a plant -- nothing comes out.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You know what I just did?
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER #3
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I just watered your plant for a

speaker_heading: DOUG

text: Mr. Butabi enters.
speaker_heading: MR. BUTABI
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Doug pulls the diorama away.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Not much.
speaker_heading: MR. BUTABI
dialog: You don't spend enough time in

speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: This club had a jungle theme.
speaker_heading: MR. BUTABI

speaker_heading: EMILY (O.S.)

speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Hi, Steve. Hey, Doug.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Hey, Emily.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (turning away)
dialog: Whatever.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: So, I guess you're back from

speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Yeah, I missed you.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Pardon me. I got to talk to my

text: Doug pulls Steve aside.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: What, do you like her or something?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Then why are you talking to her?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: She's talking to me.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Steve, look at me. It is your
dialog: destiny to be with a variety of lady
dialog: girls. Not just one lamp store
dialog: troll. And quite frankly, your level
dialog: of looks is way above her level of
dialog: looks. So for her own good, just
dialog: walk away.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You are so smart.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: That's why I'm here.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: So, Steve, you gonna ask me out
dialog: 'cause I think we could have a really

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah, that sounds good.
text: Doug annoyed, steps between them.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Back off, chicklet!
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What's your problem. Doug?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Emily, I don't know if you know
dialog: this, but my brother and I? We
dialog: live life in the fast lane. That
dialog: means no stop signs, no red
text: lights, and no pulling over to
dialog: take pictures. Now you see this
dialog: man over here?
text: Doug motions to Steve.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: What's up?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: He's my co-pilot on this magic
dialog: carpet ride. It's a two-man
dialog: operation. One -- two --

speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Shut up, Doug.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Sh! I just don't want you to get
dialog: hurt.

speaker_heading: EMILY

speaker_heading: MR. BUTABI

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Dad, come on!
text: Doug, frustrated, walks away. FRED ANDERSON, Emily's

text: and TINKLING, puts his arm around Emily.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: (gregarious)
dialog: Mr. Butabi, is Steve asking Emily
dialog: to marry him again? Ha, ha.
speaker_heading: MR. BUTABI
dialog: Ha, ha, with the way they carry on, I
dialog: think they're already planning their
dialog: honeymoon, Mr. Anderson.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Ha. Ha. Did I tell you? I've
dialog: already booked a wedding band.
speaker_heading: MR. BUTABI
dialog: Ha. Ha. Yes, and if they have
dialog: enough grandchildren we won't have to
dialog: hire salesmen anymore. Ha, ha, ha...
text: Doug stands behind them and mocks laughing along with
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Kamehl, you kill me.
speaker_heading: MR. BUTABI
dialog: No, you kill me. You murder me.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: (as he walks away)
dialog: ... salesmen. That's great.
text: Emily waves good-bye to Steve.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Dad, can you just leave Steve alone?
speaker_heading: MR. BUTABI
dialog: What? Your brother likes the girl.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: No, he doesn't.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: No, I don't.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Dad, nothing personal, but Emily's
text: like a pigwoman from a planet of pig
dialog: people. And she's trying to take
text: Steve on her porky little spaceship
dialog: so she can take him back to the
dialog: Planet Pig!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Hey, Doug, you know what they eat on
dialog: the Pig Planet? Bacon and sausage.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Nice call.
dialog: They high five.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Every once in a while I'll hit pay
dialog: dirt.
speaker_heading: MR. BUTABI
dialog: This is all too bad, because that
dialog: girl is going to be his wife.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: No, she's not.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (to Doug)
dialog: You know, they could also eat ham.
speaker_heading: MR. BUTABI
dialog: Enough of pig talk. Doug, do you
dialog: see this wall? When they marry,
dialog: we can knock it down. Then
dialog: combine stores and have the first
dialog: plant/lamp store. And Steve and
dialog: Emily can run it and it's up to
dialog: them if they want to keep you
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Are you seeing planes? Is your
dialog: name Tatu? Because I think you're
dialog: living on Fantasy Island.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: God, that was a sweet show.
speaker_heading: MR. BUTABI
dialog: Yes, I have a fantasy. That I
dialog: have two capable sons who listen
dialog: to me. Look how you load the
dialog: truck. You've done enough damage
dialog: for one day. Get out of here.
dialog: I'm sick of both of you!
text: Their father slams the van closed and exits into the
dialog: store.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: So, we're on a break?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I guess.
speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Excuse me, can the rest of us use

speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Sure, Let me check my watch.

dialog: advantage.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I... think it's... quarter three.
text: Doug stays unnaturally in that position till the girls

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (holding it up)
dialog: No, we got a Muscle Triplicator
dialog: Bar.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Okay, but let me know if you need

dialog: 'carbolicious' in the back. But
dialog: supplements aside, can I get some
dialog: quality time with you fellas?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: We're in between sets. Lay it on.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: How long we been friends?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: All seven years of high school.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: That's right. That's why I got to be
dialog: real with you now. And I'm not gonna
dialog: sugar coat it. As a professional
dialog: trainer, I'm a little worried about
dialog: your pecs. You guys don't go all the
dialog: way down. It's called full
dialog: extension. And I'm not seeing it.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Craig, you're right. We actually had
dialog: a long talk about that the other
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I just don't want you to cheat

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: We're good-looking?
speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: STEVE
text: Dad, Doug is like a fax machine.
dialog: You just keep putting things in,
dialog: face down, and you need to have a
dialog: cover page, because if you don't
dialog: -- people don't know where it's
dialog: coming from and sometimes you
dialog: don't get through on the first
dialog: call. That's why you got a redial
dialog: button and a memory button

speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Steve, how's my hair?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Looks good.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Roxbury good?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You know it. How do I look?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Robust and attractive. I gotta
dialog: tell you -- tonight, I can taste
dialog: it.
text: Steve doesn't respond and suddenly SLAMS the BRAKES.
text: Doug gets thrown forward.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (completely losing
dialog: it)
dialog: I can't taste it, Doug! I can't!
dialog: I'm so scared right now I don't
dialog: know what to do!
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (calming him down)
dialog: Bro, you're mad cowing on me.
dialog: Relax.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I'm nervous, man. We've put all
dialog: this pressure on ourselves to get
dialog: into the Roxbury, and I don't know
dialog: if we can deliver!
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You gotta take control of yourself.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: No, you gotta take control! I am
dialog: barely hanging on here!... You...
text: Steve starts crying. Doug cradles him.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Whoa... settle down... relax...
dialog: think puppies and candy canes...
dialog: easy...
text: Doug notices two girls walking by the van.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: What's up?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (completely
dialog: recovered)
dialog: How you doing, little lady?
text: From O.S., a beer BOTTLE flies INTO FRAME at them and
text: SMASHES on the van.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Alright. Maybe later then.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Doug, I see your Roxbury balloon, and
dialog: I hate to be the one to burst it. I
dialog: just don't think our names are on
dialog: that list.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Steve, get real. The bouncer isn't
dialog: checking a list. He's checking us.
dialog: Man, I can't believe all this time,
dialog: that's what you thought.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: So, why didn't we ever get in before?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: We were kids. We were completely
dialog: immature.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: But that was last night. And now we
dialog: don't even have our car.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Perfect. Rites of passage. Like
dialog: that Africa show on P.B.S. When it's
dialog: time for a boy to become a man, they
dialog: send him to the jungle with nothing
dialog: but a spear to hunt the lion
dialog: The van is our spear and the Roxbury is
dialog: our lion. And when the hunt is over,
dialog: we shall be men.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Does the bouncer know about this?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Look, Steve, what really matters
dialog: is that at the end of the night --
dialog: when all is said and done and all
dialog: hotties have been hit upon -- if
dialog: either of us has just one girl's
dialog: number, just one, then we'll know,
dialog: for the first time in our lives,
dialog: we're really worth something.

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: BOUNCER

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: DOUG

dialog: Okay, it's time to play a little
dialog: softball.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hello, my good man. How's it going
dialog: tonight?
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: Good. You're still not getting in.
speaker_heading: DOUG

text: Doug drops a five dollar bill on the Bouncer's clipboard.
text: The Bouncer doesn't move.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You don't know him?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: How 'bout his two friends? George
dialog: Washington and... George
dialog: Washington?
text: Steve drops two one-dollar bills. The Bouncer doesn't
dialog: move.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Let's not forget the other boy in
dialog: the band, Mr. Hamilton. He's a
dialog: little lonely, wants to join his
dialog: buddies.
text: DOUG holds out a ten. He waves it up and down, sideways,
text: drops it, but the Bouncer still doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Wait up, look what we got here...
text: Steve reaches into his pocket, pulls out some change,
text: starts dropping coins.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Mr. Jefferson, Jefferson,
dialog: Lincoln...
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: ...Roosevelt, Roosevelt,
dialog: Roosevelt, Roosevelt, and a
dialog: commemorative coin -- '84

dialog: No, this car is illegal. All I

speaker_heading: BLONDE

speaker_heading: RICHARD GRIECO

speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: RICHARD GRIECO

speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: RICHARD GRIECO

speaker_heading: RICHARD GRIECO

speaker_heading: DOUG/STEVE

text: Grieco goes back to his car.
speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: RICHARD GRIECO

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: He's the man who pulls the

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: RICHARD GRIECO

dialog: So, is Johnny Depp meeting you

speaker_heading: RICHARD GRIECO
dialog: No. So you guys look like you
dialog: really know how to party.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Oh, yeah, we never stop.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: We're pretty much out of control.
text: Mr. Zadir returns, shouting behind him.
speaker_heading: MR. ZADIR
dialog: (to Bob O.S.)
dialog: I get it, Bob, the club is
dialog: crowded, so it's a 'Full House'
dialog: like your show.
dialog: (to Richard)
dialog: He's too much.
text: Grieco and his date start to get up.
speaker_heading: RICHARD GRIECO
dialog: Benny, we'll see you at the party.

speaker_heading: DOUG/STEVE
dialog: See ya. Richard Grieco!
speaker_heading: RICHARD GRIECO
dialog: (To Blonde)
dialog: Their necks looked alright, right?
text: Grieco and Blonde exit. A waiter puts a bottle of
text: champagne on the table and Zadir begins to pour glasses
dialog: -- he's obviously had a few.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Sir, I just want to say, and I mean
dialog: this with the utmost sincerity, it is
dialog: an honor to shoot the shit with the
dialog: owner of the club of all clubs.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah, and we're proficient club
dialog: hoppers -- so we know what we're
dialog: talking about.
speaker_heading: MR. ZADIR
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I mean, we usually go this place
dialog: called 'The Palace' and that place is
text: rank. The music is ancient.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah, no celeb citings and the women
dialog: are oinkers.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: And they let any asswad in the
dialog: door. It's the worst.
speaker_heading: MR. ZADIR
dialog: I own that place also.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah, but it's a really good
dialog: location.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: And the drinks are reasonably
dialog: priced.
speaker_heading: MR. ZADIR
dialog: No, no. You are right. That's
dialog: what's wrong with this club
dialog: business. One day you are hot
dialog: next day you are not. People get
dialog: bored easily.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Well, you know I had this great
dialog: idea. You should make this place
text: like a tropical jungle.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah, lots of silk plants and
dialog: vines.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah, but they're not real vines.
dialog: They're bungee cords and people
dialog: could like swing from one end to
dialog: the other so if you left your
dialog: friends at the bar, you could get
text: back to them.
text: Mr. Zadir is half listening to them as he drinks.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah, and the barmaids could wear
dialog: loincloths -- but tasteful. Like
dialog: the ones they wear in strip clubs.
speaker_heading: MR. ZADIR
dialog: You could not insure bungee cords.
text: People jumping back and forth.
dialog: Too expensive.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Okay. Hit delete on that one.
dialog: Doug, tell him about your street
dialog: idea.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I was just thinking, you know how
text: people get bummed waiting outside
dialog: to get in the club.
text: Zadir nods, listening to this one.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: This is good. You're gonna love
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Well, you make the outside of the
dialog: club look like the inside. You
dialog: know, you put down a rug outside
text: and some couches and pipe out some
dialog: music. People will love it. But,
text: then on the inside.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Oh, this is the good part.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: ... Looks like the street. You
dialog: know, you park some cars inside, a
dialog: mailbox, street signs, and that
dialog: way when they come in, it's like
text: the outside is the inside and
text: inside is the outside.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Doesn't that blow your mind?
speaker_heading: MR. ZADIR
dialog: It hurts my brain to think about
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: VIVICA

dialog: guy.
text: Vivica looks up.
scene_heading: STEVE AND DOUG AND MR. ZADIR

speaker_heading: CAMBI and VIVICA
speaker_heading: CAMBI

dialog: cleaners, that beeper service, and
dialog: Mailboxes, Etc...
speaker_heading: VIVICA
dialog: Who are those guys with him?
text: Cambi reaches into her purse and pulls out Money
dialog: magazine's richest people issue.
speaker_heading: CAMBI
dialog: I can't find them, but if they're

dialog: worth something.
speaker_heading: VIVICA

speaker_heading: GILBERT GOTTFRIED
dialog: You have to say hello to my friend
dialog: at the other table. Not this
text: table. No. No. The other one.
dialog: Looks like this table -- other
dialog: people around it. I have a friends
dialog: and he needs you to say hello to
text: him at the other table.
speaker_heading: MR. ZADIR
dialog: You have a friend?
speaker_heading: GILBERT GOTTFRIED
dialog: Oh my God! You got me! I didn't
dialog: see it coming. No. It was coming
dialog: but I was not able to see it.
speaker_heading: MR. ZADIR
dialog: I better go before he explodes.
text: Gilbert and Zadir walk away.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: Was I too pushy? I was too pushy.
dialog: Did I speak well?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You were totally articulate.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Maybe he didn't like our ideas.
dialog: It's hard to pitch in a night
dialog: club. You ever notice, the music
dialog: is blasting in here. We should
dialog: try to get a meeting.
text: Steve starts looking off at something, mesmerized.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: So, Steve, what if we...
text: Doug sees what Steve is watching. He also becomes
text: mesmerized.
speaker_heading: CAMBI AND VIVICA
text: In SLOW MOTION, like two cars, the girls saunter across
text: the dance floor, toward Steve and Doug.
speaker_heading: STEVE and DOUG
text: even more mesmerized.
speaker_heading: CAMBI AND VIVICA
dialog: even closer.
speaker_heading: STEVE AND DOUG

speaker_heading: STEVE

dialog: Up what's? You want to dance?
speaker_heading: VIVICA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: DOUG

dialog: Hotties want to shake it, come on.
speaker_heading: DANCE FLOOR

speaker_heading: CAMBI
dialog: Hey, guys! Over here.
text: Cambi takes Doug's hand. Vivica grabs Steve's hand.
text: "This is Your Night" by AMBER starts. The following is a
text: perfectly choreographed dance to the music.
text: The girls dance seductively, dancing toward the boys.
text: Doug and Steve, unsure what's going on, look at each
dialog: other.
text: Simultaneously, the girls start to mimic the girls'
dialog: moves.
text: The boys do some hand jive, the girls match them perfectly.
text: They begin a variety of dips, swings and techno style
dialog: dances.
text: They're incredible. The crowd watches them...
text: Doug and Steve start doing some moves together.
text: An impressed JOHN TRAVOLTA comes over to them.
text: John adds his own movements and the guys follow suit.

dialog: Devo had a big hit that year.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah, and 'Joanie loves Chachie'
dialog: started that year.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: That was just a cheap spinoff.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: That was a spinoff?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Of course, those characters
dialog: originated on 'Happy Days.'
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I did not know that.
speaker_heading: CAMBI
dialog: Sure, 'Joanie Loves Chachi.' But,

speaker_heading: MR. ZADIR

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Dom Perignon's good but you know what
dialog: really makes a party -- Redi Whip.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: But not like when you put it on
dialog: stuff. It's when you're half
dialog: pressing on that little white nozzle
dialog: and like before it comes out, you
dialog: suck on it, and it's really fun.
speaker_heading: CAMBI
dialog: You mean like nitrous oxide?

dialog: Hello, Doug.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Guess where we went tonight?
speaker_heading: SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR
dialog: Let me see, the 7-11 on Ventura?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: No, I mean, before this, you sly
dialog: little credit vixen.
speaker_heading: SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR
dialog: Doug!
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: The Roxbury with Richard Grieco
dialog: and Bob Saget. You gotta come out
dialog: sometime.
speaker_heading: SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR
dialog: I would. But then there'd be no
dialog: one to approve all the money you
dialog: spend.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You're always thinking of me.
speaker_heading: SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR

speaker_heading: PATIO DOOR

speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Mr. Zadir, I am very impressed.
dialog: For a guy who owns sleazy night
dialog: clubs, the decor in your house is quite
dialog: tasteful.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Good one.
text: The guys nod to each other, proud of their compliment.
speaker_heading: CAMBI
dialog: Excuse us, we're going to the
dialog: ladies' room.
text: The girls walk off. Mr. Zadir notices something.
speaker_heading: MR. ZADIR
dialog: Anna Nicole! Put something on!
dialog: You are making us sick!
text: Mr. Zadir walks away.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Do you feel it, Steve? We are
dialog: finally experiencing the party
dialog: lifestyle to the fullest degree.
dialog: Let's mingle.
text: They walk over to a Fabio type MODEL GUY.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: How's it hanging? You want to
dialog: mingle?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Cool party, huh?
speaker_heading: MODEL GUY
dialog: (who the hell are
dialog: these guys)
dialog: ... I guess.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah, I'd say it's kicking into
dialog: gear right about...
text: Steve and Doug pause a moment. Model Guy looks at each
dialog: of them.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: ... now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: So, what do you do?
speaker_heading: MODEL GUY
dialog: I'm a model.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Oh, right. So are we.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: It's a hard job.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah, you know, like you got to
dialog: stand still all the time and uh...
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (racking his brain)
text: ... Standing still. Standing
dialog: still is really hard. My foot
dialog: cramps sometimes.
speaker_heading: MODEL GUY
dialog: I know what you mean. What agency
dialog: you with? Elite, Ford?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (to Model)
dialog: So, do you like mingling?
speaker_heading: MODEL GUY
dialog: Excuse me.
text: The Model Guy walks away.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Nice guy.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (off at Model Guy)
dialog: See you on the shoot!
text: As they start eating their pasta primavera again, a NAKED
text: WOMAN emerges from the pool and walks directly towards
text: them. Steve and Doug forget how to chew and stand,
dialog: stunned.
speaker_heading: NAKED WOMAN
dialog: Can you pass me a towel, please?
text: They talk directly to her breasts, trying to be
text: nonchalant, but answering questions she hasn't asked.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Good. How are you?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: ... about eight o'clock, eight
dialog: fifteen.
speaker_heading: NAKED WOMAN

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Vanilla mostly.
text: She shoves by them and exits. Mr. Zadir comes over.
speaker_heading: MR. ZADIR
dialog: Look at this, I have the Spice
text: Girls, yet nobody is dancing.
text: The guys snap out of it.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: With all due party-throwing
dialog: respect, you know what the problem
dialog: is, Mr. Zadir? This pool is
dialog: taking up all the prime dancing
dialog: real estate.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah, you know, if there were a big
dialog: piece of glass you could put over the
dialog: pool, you could use it as a dance
dialog: floor. And it would be really sweet
dialog: because people would feel like they
dialog: were dancing on water.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: And you could put fish in the water
dialog: and it would be like the ocean.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Or, Doug, you know what would be
dialog: another amazing idea? You could have
dialog: a special room for people who want to
dialog: dance naked.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Plus, then you could have a room next
dialog: to that room with a one-way mirror so
dialog: other people could watch them.
speaker_heading: MR. ZADIR
dialog: (calming them down)
dialog: Boys, boys, please let's not talk
dialog: business. We'll schedule a meeting
dialog: for this.
text: Guys silently/joyously high five their meeting. Cambi,

speaker_heading: CAMBI
dialog: There you are.
speaker_heading: VIVICA
dialog: We got scared.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (protective)
dialog: Of who? We'll kick his ass.
speaker_heading: CAMBI
dialog: No, we got scared someone stole
dialog: you away from us.
dialog: Doug and Steve ponder the meaning of this statement for a
dialog: beat, having rarely heard a compliment.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (realizes it's a
dialog: compliment)
dialog: Oh...
dialog: (to Steve)
dialog: Like some other girls would steal
dialog: us away.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Oh, right... Oh!
speaker_heading: CAMBI
dialog: Mr. Zadir, would you mind if we
dialog: borrowed them for a while?
speaker_heading: MR. ZADIR
dialog: Yes...
text: They all look at him.
speaker_heading: MR. ZADIR
dialog: ... No!
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Got you!
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Good one, Mr. Zadir.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: He totally got me.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Mr. Zadir, let me just say that

speaker_heading: MR. ZADIR

text: Doug chews.
speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: DOUG/STEVE

speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Guess who that was?
speaker_heading: VIVICA
dialog: I have no idea.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Well, I was supposed to have a
text: moustache.
speaker_heading: VIVICA
dialog: Sonny and Cher?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Okay, we'll give you another hint.
text: The guys get into their Hall and Oates positions.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (singing)
dialog: She's a rich girl.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (singing)
dialog: And she's going to go far 'cause
dialog: she knows it doesn't matter
dialog: anyway.
text: Cambi stands.
speaker_heading: CAMBI
dialog: (shutting them up)
dialog: Guys, guys! I have an idea. You
dialog: want to have some fun?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Sure, fun is our last name.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Plus, fun spelled backwards is
dialog: 'nuf.' And you can never have
dialog: 'nuf' fun.
speaker_heading: VIVICA
dialog: (takes Steve by the hand)
dialog: Great. Let's go.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Where we going?
speaker_heading: VIVICA

dialog: Doug, you should check out this

speaker_heading: VIVICA
dialog: I think he's busy.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I'm just a big believer in

text: Vivica sensually lies back on the bed, staring at Steve.
text: Steve is uncomfortable, starts walking around.
speaker_heading: VIVICA
dialog: Steve, why don't you come over
dialog: here?
text: Vivica pats the bed a few times, inviting him over.
text: Steve watches. Thinks. Then goes over to the bed and
text: also pats it a few times, turning it into a drum solo.
speaker_heading: VIVICA
dialog: (stopping him)
dialog: Steve!
text: Steve stops, looks at her.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Viv, you know what I heard when I
dialog: first met you?
speaker_heading: VIVICA
dialog: What?
text: Steve starts making a very loud inappropriate shrill
text: ambulance siren sound -- over and over.
speaker_heading: VIVICA
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Steve stops.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: That's an ambulance. Coming to

speaker_heading: DOUG

dialog: something? Do you like
dialog: blueberries or strawberries?
speaker_heading: MR. CAMBI
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I want to know what type of
dialog: pancakes to order you in the
dialog: morning.
text: He looks proud of his line as we begin to hear Steve O.S.

dialog: Steve!
speaker_heading: STEVE (O.S.)
dialog: (stops siren sound)
dialog: ... Sorry!
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I was wondering...
text: Doug starts looking at Cambi's shirt label.
speaker_heading: CAMBI
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Checking your label. Just as I
dialog: thought. Made in heaven.
speaker_heading: CAMBI

speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hey, is that a mirror in your

speaker_heading: CAMBI
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: 'Cause I can see myself in your

dialog: at the pool?
speaker_heading: VIVICA
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: So, I was just remembering back.
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: You know, an open dialogue is an

dialog: I think we have something special

speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Steve, before you talk to a man like

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I didn't know to get ducks.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: That's an expression.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: So, we're going back to the dance

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: We'll have to schedule another

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah. That way we won't look like

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: MR. BUTABI

speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Dad, I'm sensing a note of sarcasm.
speaker_heading: MR. BUTABI
dialog: This is a very nice sign. Except for
dialog: one thing.
dialog: (exploding)
dialog: This is the only register! This is
dialog: why I pay you -- to push a button and

dialog: Is there some problem I don't know

text: pushing finger in a bad cell phone
dialog: accident?
speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: MR. BUTABI

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Did you want me to go the drug
dialog: store to get those pills?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I think we should tell him now.
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Dad, you're gonna love this. We're
dialog: working on this club idea which could
dialog: include many silk plant opportunities
dialog: and guess who we thought could be our
dialog: supplier?
speaker_heading: MR. BUTABI
dialog: Yes, I need you to give me
dialog: opportunities. I feed you, I clothe
dialog: you, I put a roof over your head and
dialog: I pay for your little phones so you
dialog: can call other idiots. I give up on
dialog: you two. I am ashamed to call you my
dialog: sons.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: There you go again, Dad. You always
dialog: tell us to do something with our
dialog: lives and when we finally do, what
dialog: happens? You got to put us down.
dialog: You never support us, you never
dialog: encourage us, and you never care
dialog: about what's important to us. Right,
dialog: Steve?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Do you need a prescription for those
dialog: pills?
speaker_heading: MR. BUTABI
dialog: It's my own fault. I spoil you.
dialog: From now on, you are no longer
dialog: allowed to go out to clubs at
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: DOUG/STEVE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MR. BUTABI

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You mean, 'What's up?'
speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: STEVE

text: Dooey stops and slowly turns around.
speaker_heading: DOOEY

speaker_heading: DOOEY

speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah, and maybe we should just go

dialog: Let's do that, Steve!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: ... Sorry.

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: VIVICA

speaker_heading: VIVICA

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I had a great time, Vivica. In
dialog: fact, I think we've reached the
dialog: point where I can comfortably call
dialog: you 'Viv' and leave out the 'Ica.'
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: So, you guys want to hang out or
dialog: see a movie or do what we did last
dialog: night... or eat or... just do what
dialog: we did last night or hang out, eat
dialog: and then do what we did last night
dialog: or... you know, whatever... and do

speaker_heading: VIVICA
dialog: Sounds good.
text: Cambi gives Doug a kiss. He melts, then quickly tries to

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Viv, I'm glad our relationship is
dialog: strong enough to withstand the
dialog: hard times -- like when were
dialog: just in the bar -- I also think
dialog: we're not just projecting onto one
dialog: another but dealing with the
dialog: reality of who we are. And most
dialog: important, we know how to listen.
speaker_heading: VIVICA

speaker_heading: CAMBI

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Aisle or window seat? I'm sorry,

speaker_heading: VIVICA
dialog: You're not in business with Mr.

speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Especially, if we ever get to see
dialog: him again.

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: CAMBI

speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: VIVICA

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Well, I'm glad you shared that

speaker_heading: CAMBI
dialog: Guys, consider what we did with

dialog: a favor and never talk to us
dialog: again!
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: What did we do wrong? We'll
dialog: change.
speaker_heading: VIVICA
dialog: No, you can't change. You and
dialog: your brother are ugly pathetic
dialog: losers.
dialog: (to Cambi)
dialog: That's the problem with

dialog: just the same as rich schmucks.
text: The girls walk back to the bar. The guys watch them go.
speaker_heading: CAMBI
dialog: (as they walk)
dialog: I can't believe we actually had
