speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Warren Zevon's "I'll Sleep When I'm Dead" BLARES from a radio as
dialog: we begin a CLOSUP MONTAGE:
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - A YOUNG GIRL'S HAND
text: dips a strip of newspaper into a bowl of paper mache mix.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - THE WETTED PAPER
text: is applied to a paper mache surface, and a popsicle stick is
dialog: pressed into place. (We are TOO TIGHT to see the object being
dialog: constructed.)
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - KRISTEN PARKER
text: Kristen (16) is strikingly pretty, despite the dark, tired circles
text: under her eyes. She's exhausted, but desperately trying to stay
text: awake. She wears pajamas and robe.
text: Her head nods, her eyelids close. She snaps herself awake.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - THE RADIO
text: She turns the VOLUME UP EVEN LOUDER.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - THE CLOCK
text: It's 1:20 a.m.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - A JAR OF FOLGER'S COFFEE CRYSTALS
text: She scoops out a spoonful.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - KRISTEN
text: She puts the spoonful of coffee crystals in her mouth and chases
text: it down with a swig of Diet Coke.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - PAPER MACHE
text: Another piece is applied.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - KRISTEN
text: Nodding off again. She rouses herself angrily.
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: The bedroom door opens and her mother enters. ELAINE PARKER, late
text: 30's, is dressed in an expensive evening gown that carefully
text: displays her assets. She snaps the radio off.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Are you crazy? You'll wake the whole
dialog: neighborhood!
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: (bleary-eyed)
dialog: Hi Mom.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Don't "hi Mom" me. What are you still
dialog: doing up? It's past one!
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: I thought I'd wait for you.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (softening)
dialog: Well, I'm home now, so you can go right
dialog: to sleep. C'mon, angel.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: It's okay, I'm not tired. Really.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (turning down the bed)
dialog: Kristen, don't start with me. You know
dialog: what your shrink said...
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: (sullen)
dialog: He's full of shit.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I am not going to let you get me into an
dialog: argument, goddamn it. Not tonight. Now
dialog: get in bed.
text: Kristen does as she's told. Her mother goes to the door and
text: reaches for the light switch.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: (a soft plea)
dialog: Mom? I'm still having these awful dreams.
text: A MAN'S VOICE comes from downstairs:
speaker_heading: MAN (O.S.)
dialog: Elaine? Where do you keep the bourbon?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I'll be right down!
dialog: (to Kristen)
dialog: Look honey, I've got a guest.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: And you don't want to keep him waiting.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: That's right. I don't.
text: The door closes, shutting Kristen into darkness. She lies in bed,
text: blinking back angry tears. She turns on her side, her gaze
dialog: falling on:
scene_heading: THE PAPER MACHE OBJECT
text: It is a miniature house glowing weirdly in th moonlight. A crude,
text: homemade replica of the Elm Street House.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - KRISTEN
text: Staring at the tiny house, hearing her mother's FAINT LAUGHTER
dialog: downstairs.
text: Kristen begins to nod off, though she's fighting it.
text: A breeze starts up, rustling her hair. Leaves fall across her
text: pillow and face. Her mother's LAUGHTER FADES OUT, replaced by teh
text: EERIE GIGGLING of small children. She awakes with a start.
text: CAMERA SLOWLY PULLS BACK, CRANING UP TO REVEAL:
text: Kristen's bed sits in the middle of the dark, deserted street in
text: front of the Elm Street House.
text: Small CHILDREN are playing on the lawn. The boys are dressed in
text: suits, the girls in party dresses. They are jumping rope and
dialog: chanting a singsong:
speaker_heading: CHILDREN
dialog: One, two, Freddy's coming for you,
dialog: three, four, better lock your door,
dialog: five, six, grab your crucifix...
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
text: gets out of bed and approaches the children, transfixed.
text: ...except for one eerily pretty LITTLE GIRL sitting on her red
text: tricycle near the front door, hair billowing in the breezes as she
text: stares at Kristen.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: Hello. What's your name?
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Kristen. What's yours?
text: The Little Girl giggles and smiles shyly, but doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN (cont.)
dialog: What is this place?
text: The wind kicks up, MOANING. We hear the SOUND OF WIND CHIMES.
speaker_heading: THE WIND CHIME
text: Tinkling in the wind. The "chimes" are long razors.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: reacts.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: The front door of the house CREAKS open behind the Little Girl.
dialog: Darkness within.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: I have to go now. Bye.
text: RINGING the bell on the handlebar, she pedals her tricycle through
text: the door and is swallowed by the darkness inside.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Wait! Don't go in there!
text: Too late. Kristen stands alone. Fighting her fear, she
text: approaches the house.
scene_heading: INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Kristen enters. The place is barren, empty. Broken windows,
text: flaking paint, rotted walls. Leaves skitter across teh floor.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Little girl!
speaker_heading: THE CHILDREN
text: They sense her presence and turn their vacant, staring eyes toward
text: her. They scatter, vanishing into the shadows...
text: She hears the JINGLING of the tricycle bell and the GIGGLING of
text: the Little Girl ECHOING FAINTLY from deep inside the house. Then
text: silence again. Kristen tries to follow the sounds.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Kristen comes around a corner just in time to see:
speaker_heading: HER POV
text: A quick glimpse of the Little Girl vanishing around the corner at
text: the far end of a long, twisted corridor. The walls are streaked
dialog: with rust...or perhaps dried blood.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
text: She keeps following. Being led.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Kristen comes around a corner and finds herself facing a heavy
text: steel door that is just closing wiht a SOLID METALLIC CLANG. The
text: riveted metal seems out of place in the rotted wood house.
text: Kristen goes to the door and pulls it slowly open. A stairway
text: leading down into darkness.
speaker_heading: STAIRWAY
text: Kristen carefully makes her way down the metal steps.
scene_heading: INT. BOILER ROOM
text: Kristen fearfully enters Freddy's decrepit lair. Ancient rusted
text: boilers stand cold and silent in the shadows.
text: The SOFT JINGLE of the tricycle draws Kristen's attention.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: The Little Girl pedals out of the darkness and comes to a stop
dialog: before Kristen.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: This is where he takes us.
text: There is a SCREECH OF METAL. Kristen whirls and sees:
speaker_heading: A BOILER
text: The rusted furnace door is swinging open, metal grating on metal.
text: Inside, the charred bones of children lie in heaps of cold ash. A
text: tricycle lies in the carnage, identical to the Little Girl's --
text: only charred.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
text: Horrified. Suddenly, a METAL DOOR SLAMS LOUDLY in the darkness.
text: THUDDING FOOTSTEPS approach, BOOMING CLOSER.
speaker_heading: THE LITTLE GIRL
text: looks up at Kristen with sad eyes.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: (eerily calm)
dialog: Freddy's home.
speaker_heading: THE BOILER FURNACE
text: Now alive with ROARING FLAMES. The tricycle's paint bubbles and
text: scorches in the intense heat.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
text: scoops the Little Girl into her arms and runs in blind terror.
text: She glances back over her shoulder to see:
speaker_heading: FREDDY
text: looming from the row of boilers, an indistinct silhouette in the
text: hellish smoke and flames. His maniacal LAUGHTER ECHOES through
dialog: the chamber.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
text: ducks through a doorway into another room, still carrying the
dialog: Little Girl.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM
text: A hundred teenage bodies hang from teh ceiling, strung up in the
text: darkness like butchered meat.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
text: gazes in horror. She looks down at the Little Girl cradled in her
text: arms -- she is now a horribly charred, brittle corpse. Suddenly,
text: her tiny mouth bursts open, emitting a ghastly, ear-splitting
speaker_heading: SCREAM!
speaker_heading: SHOCK CUT TO:
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - KRISTEN
text: As she sits bolt upright in bed, panting in terror, face bathed in
text: sweat. She looks around, recognizing her own room.
text: She gets out of bed and walks unsteadily to the bathroom.
scene_heading: INT - BATHROOM
text: She clicks on the light and looks at her reflection in the mirror.
text: Still trembling, she runs water in the sink and splashes her face,
text: trying to calm down.
text: The water becomes too hot. Steam rises.
text: She tries to turn the water off, but the pressure increases. More
dialog: Steam.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - KRISTEN
text: She fiddles with the handle, confused.
text: As she turns it, the four-pronged handle suddenly springs to life,
text: grasping her hand.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
text: gasps and looks up. Freddy's face grins out at her from the
text: mirror. She SCREAMS. Steam billows up.
speaker_heading: THE SINK
text: The other faucet handle begins to flex and stretch, turning into
text: Freddy's claw hand. Finger razors grow.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
text: SCREAMING, struggling to break free.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
text: leering from the mirror, laughing. The claw hand rises up into
text: frame, poising to slash Kristen's exposed wrist.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - KRISTEN
text: SCREAMING as the blades slash downward.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - FREDDY
text: Grinning as a spray of blood hits the mirror.
speaker_heading: THE BATHROOM DOOR
text: bursts open, revealing Kristen's mother. She SCREAMS.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE - THE BATHROOM
text: No steam. The mirror and sink are normal...except for the thin
text: streaks of spattered blood.
text: Kristen turns to her mother, slowly waking from her dream. She
text: holds a bloody razor in her hand. Her wrist is slashed.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: (dazed, weak)
dialog: Mommy...?
text: She collapses.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WESTIN HILLS PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
text: Isolated and somewhat gothic, it's an enormous multi-winged
text: structure built by the Catholic Church in the 1920's. A belltower
text: is centerpiece to several rambling wings. Originally an insane
text: asylum, it is now a modernized state-run facility. An iron fence
text: surrounds the sprawling grounds.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - ADOLESCENT WING - DAY
text: DOLLYING with MAX, the burly black Chief Orderly, as he makes his
text: morning rounds. He wheels a rolling cart containing a variety of
text: medications down the hall. A NEWSCASTER'S VOICE comes from the
text: small portable radio dangling from the cart:
speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER
dialog: In local nows, two more teenage deaths
dialog: have occurred -- both suicides. County
dialog: health officials are at a loss to explain
dialog: this alarming trend --
text: Grimacing, Max switches to a music station as DOCTOR NEIL GOLDMAN
text: (early 30's), bright and intense, falls in step.
speaker_heading: NEIL
text: (absorbed in a clipboard
dialog: of patient's charts)
dialog: Nothing like a little cheery news to start
dialog: the day.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Say listen, Doc. I got a new theory about
dialog: all these suicides.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Don't hold back on us, Max. We need all
dialog: the help we can get.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Fucked up chromosomes, man. Think about
dialog: it. Their parents all dropped acid in
dialog: the Sixties.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: It beats Dr. Simm's theory. She thinks
dialog: it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock
dialog: & roll.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Shit, that's what keeps people alive.
text: Max exits frame. Neil continues on. JENNIFER, a girl of 14,
dialog: approaches.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Good morning, Jennifer.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Morning, Doctor Goldman.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: How's your hand?
text: She extends her hand for inspection -- it is scarred with
text: cigarette burns. She points to three different welts.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Menthol, regular, ultra-light.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: They're healing up nicely.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I've been good. When do I get cigarette
dialog: priveleges back?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Don't hold your breath.
text: Jennifer shrugs. It was worth a try. She moves on.
text: TARYN, a 17 year old blonde, approaches. She appears exhausted,
text: dark tired circles under her eyes.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Hi Taryn. You don't look so hot, kid.
dialog: Been getting any sleep?
text: She ignores him. Neil watches her float past, then jots a note on
dialog: his clipboard.
speaker_heading: NEIL (cont.)
dialog: Didn't think so.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Neil comes to the Quiet Room and peers through the small mesh-grid
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: NEIL'S POV - (QUIET ROOM)
text: KINCAID, an enormous and powerful-looking 17 year old with a
text: shaved head is huddled in the corner of the white padded room,
text: gazing at nothing.
speaker_heading: NEIL - (HALLWAY)
text: makes a notation on his clipboard. DOCTOR ELIZABETH SIMMS, the
text: hospital superior, appears at his elbow.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: How is he?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Cooling down.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: If he continues having these outbursts,
dialog: I'll have to have him isolated permanently.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Don't worry, it won't come to that.
text: They exit frome. CAMERA PUSHES UP to teh mesh-grid window of the
dialog: Quiet Room for a shot of Kincaid.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - KINCAID - (QUIET ROOM)
text: He stares into space, singing softly under his breath.
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: I ain't gonna dream no more, no more,
dialog: I ain't gonna dream no more. All night
dialog: long I sing this song, 'cause I ain't
dialog: gonna dream no more...
scene_heading: DOLLYING WITH NEIL AND SIMMS - (HALLWAY)
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: I read the report on our new staff
dialog: member.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: What did you think?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Frankly, I don't understand why some
dialog: grad school superstar is being treated
dialog: like a seasoned pro.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: She's been doing ground-breaking
dialog: research on pattern nightmares.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Elizabeth, we don't need any outside
dialog: help. I know these kids. I don't
dialog: want some hot-shot taking chances
dialog: with them just so she can get published.
text: Simms is about to say more, but is interrupted by:
speaker_heading: P.A. VOICE
dialog: Doctor Goldman to Examination, stat.
text: They hurry down the hall.
speaker_heading: NURSES' STATION
text: Kristen's mother, near hysteria, is loudly berating a NURSE.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Don't give me that shit! She's just
dialog: trying to get attention, that's all!
dialog: I'm not playing her little game any-
dialog: more!
text: Neil and Simms rush past into the examination room.
scene_heading: INT. EXAMINATION ROOM
text: Neil and Simms burst into a chaotic struggle. Kristen is going
text: berserk, fighting the STAFF as they try to restrain her and
text: wrestle her onto a gurney -- the gurney goes crashing into the
text: wall. A frantic NURSE addresses Neil:
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Suicide attempt. They just brought her
dialog: in from County General!
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: What's her name?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Kristen Parker. She was fine until we
text: tried to sedate her.
text: Her face contorted with terror, Kristen kicks and bites and
text: scratches as ORDERLIES try to pin her.
speaker_heading: ORDERLY
dialog: Watch it! She tore her stiches out!
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Kristen, we want to help you!
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Max enters and takes immediate control. he shoves everybody out
text: of the way, spins Kristen effortlessly around, and pins her arms
text: firmly from behind. She tries to struggle, but he's too strong.
text: She weakens.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (compassionate)
dialog: Calm down, baby sister, that's enough
dialog: nonsense for now.
text: Neil takes a hypo from the nurse and approaches Kristen slowly.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Kristen, I'm Doctor Goldman. I'm not
dialog: going to hurt you. I'm just going to
dialog: give you something to help you sleep.
text: KRISTEN goes berserk again and kicks Neil in the stomach. Max is
text: thrown off balance and crashes into a rolling cart -- medical
text: instruments shower to the floor.
text: Kristen grabs a pair of wicked-looking surgical scissors. She
text: slashes at max's hand, drawing blood.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Back off, Max!
text: Kristen huddles into a corner, ready to skewer anybody who gets
text: close. A tense stand-off.
speaker_heading: NEIL (cont.)
dialog: Kristen, put the scissors down! No-
dialog: body's gonna hurt you!
text: But the girl makes no move to drop her guard. She starts rocking
text: back and forth, coming apart at the seams, moaning a little song:
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Five, six, grab your crucifix...
dialog: seven, eight, better stay up late...
dialog: nine, ten, never...never...
text: She can't seem to find the words in her confused mind.
speaker_heading: NANCY (O.S.)
dialog: Never sleep again.
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: Instant silence in the room. All eyes go to NANCY THOMPSON
text: standing in the doorway. She's a young woman now, possessing
text: beauty and great inner strength. her hair still bears the white
text: streak. She speaks as if coming out of a trance:
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Who taught you that rhyme?
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
text: Her eyes are locked with Nancy's.
speaker_heading: NANCY
text: The staff members part before her as she walks to Kristen. She
text: takes the scissors from Kristen's hand. Kristen falls into
text: Nancy's arms, sobbing.
speaker_heading: NEIL
text: stares at Nancy in amazement.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - DAY
text: Neil and Nancy are finishing a late lunch in teh nearly deserted
dialog: cafeteria.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Tell me about the kids.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: You'll get to meet them all tomorrow.
dialog: They're...survivors. In a way. All
text: severely sleep disordered. Insomnia,
dialog: narcolepsy, bedwetting...
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: But nightmares are the common thread?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Right. They seem to share a group
dialog: delusion, a "boogeyman" for lack of
dialog: a better word. They're so traumatized,
dialog: they'll do anything not to sleep.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Anything?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: (playing with his coffee)
dialog: We lost a kid about a month ago to
dialog: Fairview. I don't know where he got
dialog: the razor...but he cut off his own
dialog: eyelids to stay awake.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Oh God.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Ever work with vets?
dialog: (Nancy shakes her head)
dialog: These kids act like they've got
dialog: D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome.
dialog: If I didn't know better, I'd swear
dialog: they'd seen heavy combat.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: What's that supposed to mean?
text: She shrugs, not answering. Neil lets it pass.
speaker_heading: NEIL (cont.)
dialog: (changing the subject)
dialog: By the way, that was great work with
dialog: the new patient. Pretty smooth for an
dialog: intern.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I've had some experience with pattern
dialog: nightmares.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: So I've been told. Practically an
dialog: obsession of your.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Call it a passion.
dialog: (glances at her watch)
dialog: I've got to get going.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Make sure to check in with Max, he'll
dialog: give you the 25 cent tour.
text: She gathers her things. Her purse falls over, scattering its
text: contents. A bottle of pills rolls out. Neil helps gather the
text: items -- he picks up the pills.
scene_heading: INSERT - PILL BOTTLE
text: The label reads: HYPNOCYL 60 mg. 1-2 TABS FOR SLEEP.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: She takes the pills and stuffs them in her purse along with
dialog: everything else.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Thanks. See you in the morning.
text: She is almost out the door when Neil calls to her.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Ms. Thompson.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Call me Nancy.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Only if you call me Neil. What was that
dialog: nursery rhyme all about?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Just something children sing...to keep
text: the boogeyman away.
text: She exits. Neil stares after her thoughtfully.
text: HIS POV - LONG LENS OF THE CROWDED HALLWAY
text: As Nancy turns and vanishes from sight, a NUN is a white habbit is
text: revealed at the far end of the hallway -- she seems to be staring
text: at him. PEOPLE are wiping frame as they criss-cross the hallway,
text: affording mere glimpses of her.
speaker_heading: NEIL
text: A bit slf-conscious. Is the woman really staring at him?
speaker_heading: HIS POV - LONG LENS
text: People keep wiping frame as they bustle in the hallway. The nun
text: is now gone.
speaker_heading: NEIL
text: frowns, puzzled. he dismisses it and downs his last sip of
dialog: coffee.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
text: Max is giving Nancy a tour.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: The whole wing's devoted ot this
dialog: program. That's your office.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: A little basic, but nice.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I'll have a file cabinet in there before
dialog: tomorrow.
dialog: (leading her down a hall)
dialog: The patient's rooms are down here.
text: Nancy pauses at an open door, looking into:
scene_heading: INT. PHILLIP'S ROOM
text: PHILLIP, 16, sits at a work table fashioning the face of a
text: homemade marionette out of clay. Other marionettes hang from the
text: wall. A comical dog, a white knight, a clown, etc.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (from doorway)
dialog: This is Phillip. We call him The Walker.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Why is that?
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: 'Cause I sleepwalk. A perfectly normal
dialog: event that our illustrious staff loves
text: to theorize about endlessly.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Phillip, this is Nancy.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Hi. Welcome to the Snake Pit.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: (admiring marionettes)
dialog: Nice work.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: They really oughtta be carved out of
dialog: wood, but they won't let me have a
dialog: knife. I might, you know...
dialog: (mimes slashing his wrist)
dialog: Fffft!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: That lump over there is Kincaid.
text: Kincaid is lying on a bed, reading a comic book.
speaker_heading: MAX (cont.)
dialog: Take a close look. He gets his ass
dialog: thrown in the Quiet Room so often,
dialog: you probably won't see much of him.
dialog: Right, Cool Breeze?
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: I do it so I don't have to look at your

text: DOLLYING WITH Max and Nancy.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: They're good kids. But don't let 'em

dialog: themselves and each other.
text: They exit frame. PAN TO JOEY, a wan 16 year old watching them
text: from around the corner. He has a tear drop drawn in ink under one
dialog: eye.
text: A SOFT RYTHMIC SQUEAKING draws his attention.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: MARCIE, a cute 19 year old candy-striper, is wheeling a cart to a
dialog: laundry closet.
text: As she begins to load the cart with clean towels, several fall to
text: the floor. Joey hurries over.
speaker_heading: CLOSER ANGLE
text: Joey picks up the towels and holds them out to Marcie. She gives
text: him a bright smile.
speaker_heading: MARCIE
dialog: Why thank you, Joey.
text: Joey grins mutely, obviously smitten. LORENZO, a cocky, handsome
text: young orderly appears.
speaker_heading: LORENZO
dialog: Hey, Marcie. These going to C Ward?
speaker_heading: MARCIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LORENZO
dialog: C'mon, I'll walk you down.

speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different?
dialog: Did you notice anything strange before
dialog: she made the attempt?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Kristen specializes in strangeness. I've
dialog: spent thousands on psychiatirists.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Did she always have nightmares?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: They've gotten worse since I took away

speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I'm serious.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what
dialog: you want from me.
speaker_heading: NANCY

dialog: good kids, smark kids.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the

scene_heading: THE PAPER MACHE ELM STREET HOUSE
text: sitting on Kristen's drafting table.
speaker_heading: NANCY
text: Amazed. Shaken. She reaches out slowly, almost afraid to touch

scene_heading: INT. NEIL'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Neil sits at a computer terminal in his study. He hooks the modem

text: blinking. He punches in a command.
speaker_heading: THE SCREEN
text: A readout appears, ticking down an endless list of drug
dialog: categories.
speaker_heading: NEIL
text: Working the keyboard, searching for something. Finally:
speaker_heading: THE SCREEN
dialog: The glowing green letters read:
speaker_heading: HYPNOCYL

text: Kristen lies in bed, sketching on a newsprint pad with charcoal.
text: A rendering of the Elm Street House.
text: She begins to nod out. her eyes flutter closed. CAMERA DOLLIES
text: IN TIGHT on her face. We hear the DISTANT, GHOSTLY JINGLING of a
text: tricycle bell. Her eyes slowly open.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Kristen watches, terrified, as a tricycle rolls into the room by
text: itself, leaving bloody tire tracks. The same tricycle that
dialog: belonged to the Little Girl.
speaker_heading: THE TRICYCLE
text: comes to a stop...then begins to glow red-hot and melt, warping
text: and sagging as if from an astonishing inner heat.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
text: gets out of bed, edges past the ghastly melting apparition, and
text: backs out of the room.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - KRISTEN
text: As she backs out the door, we see it is the red Elm Street door.
text: She pauses, realizing something is terribly wrong -- suddenly the
text: door SLAMS SHUT INTO CAMERA.
text: CAMERA ZOOMS OUT IN A DIZZYING RUSH to reveal the Elm Street
text: House. Kristen is now trapped inside.
scene_heading: INT. ELM STREET HOUSE
text: Kristen tries to get out, but the door is locked. She turns,
text: looking for another means of escape. We hear a FAINT BUZZING.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM
text: Kristen enters. The BUZZING IS LOUDER.
scene_heading: HER POV - THE DINNER TABLE
text: The table is set for a formal dinner. The grotesque, rotted
text: remains of a roast pig sits on a platter, covered with flies.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
text: is revolted.
speaker_heading: THE PIG
text: leaps up, SQUEALING.
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: Kristen is suddenly pulled down, vanishing beneath the surface of

dialog: gravity.
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER
text: Kristen thrashes wildly in the the pitch-black water. She swims
text: frantically, lungs bursting for air. Impossible to tell which way
dialog: is up.
speaker_heading: HER POV
text: A door hanging in watery limbo a short distance ahead.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: swims for it.
speaker_heading: THE DOOR
text: She clutches the ornate handle and strains to open the door.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM (OTHER SIDE OF TEH DOOR)
text: The door swings open. Kristen emerges from a solid wall of water
text: and steps into the room. She is magically dry.
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: It is the Elm Street living room, foreboding and nearly barren of
dialog: furniture.
text: A large lump forms under the rug at the far end of the room and
text: undulates toward her sinuously. A long tubular shape.
text: Kristen backs away.
text: The shape circles her aimlessly, then slithers up the wall -- a
text: huge, writhing entity traveling within the wall surface.
text: The shape arcs back down toward the carpet and disappears below
dialog: the floorline.
text: Kristen turns about apprehensively, searching for the mysterious
dialog: entity. Beat.
text: Suddenly, the creatures erupts through the floor directly beneath
text: her in a shower of wood splinters, engulfing her legs as it
text: rockets straight up. It slams back down like a whale surfacing,
text: Kristen locked firmly in its jaws.
speaker_heading: THE CREATURE
text: is a gigantic serpent/worm version of Freddy, ribbed and organic,

scene_heading: THE ELM STREET HOUSE MODEL
text: The sound seems to emanate from the strange paper mache dollhouse.
text: CAMERA RUSHES IN TIGHT as its tiny front door swings slowly open.
speaker_heading: NANCY
text: DOLLYING IN TIGHT ON HER FACE as she puts a hand to her head, a

text: slowly wolfing her down, its awful diseased maw inching up past

speaker_heading: KRISTEN
speaker_heading: NANCY!
speaker_heading: NANCY
text: snaps into action. She scoops up a long jagged shard of broken

text: She leaps into the fray, jamming the shard of glass into
text: Freddy/snake's eye -- the eye bursts, spraying rancid ichor.
speaker_heading: FREDDY/SNAKE
text: Regurgitating Kristen, the creature arcs back, ready to strike.
text: his good eye locks on Nancy, recognizing his old enemy.
speaker_heading: FREDDY/SNAKE
dialog: (total rage)
dialog: YOU!
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - FREDDY/SNAKE
text: ROARS as the snake face peels back like old parchment and

speaker_heading: NANCY
text: grabs Kristen and barrel-rolls out of the way. They scramble out

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY (OTHER SIDE OF DOOR)

speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: I -- I think so!
text: The razor-teeth burst through the door, splintering it.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Then get us back out!
text: Kristen tries to concentrate -- the teeth tear a chunk from the

text: Chewing. Tearing.
speaker_heading: NANCY (cont.)

dialog: Can I interject something here? Just
dialog: to save us all some time?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Go ahead, Phillip.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: (to Nancy)
dialog: According to our kind hosts, our dreams
dialog: are a group psychosis. Sort of a mellow
dialog: mass hysteria. The fact that we all
dialog: dreamt about this guy before we ever
dialog: met doesn't seem to impress anybody.
text: The kids murmur in agreement.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP (cont.)
dialog: So we go in circles making minimal

dialog: And you won't make any progress until

dialog: they are.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: And what are they?
speaker_heading: SIMMS

speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: Great. Now it's my dick that's killing

speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Tell them, Nancy. Tell them what's

text: He was wide awake...all the way down.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Then it was suicide. Phillip quit. He
dialog: copped out.
text: Joey shakes his head, getting agitated.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Joey says it wasn't no suicide.
text: Neil lets some of his anger and frustration show through:
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Joey, listen to me! Phillip killed
dialog: himself. And that's a cowardly thing.
text: An empty thing. he let himself down.
dialog: he let all of us down.
text: Joey is blinking back tears.
speaker_heading: TARYN
dialog: It was murder! Can't you understand
dialog: that? That bastard murdered him!
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (spooked)
dialog: You never know when he's going to come.
dialog: Sometimes for days, nothing...then --
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: I've heard quite enough of this. How
dialog: long before you're ready to face your-
dialog: selves? How much longer can you keep
dialog: blaming your dreams for your own
dialog: weaknesses?
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: How much longer you gonna blow smoke up
dialog: our ass?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: That's enough, Kincaid.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: There will be no repeat occurences of
dialog: last night's events. From now on, your
dialog: doors will be locked during sleeping
dialog: hours. We'll begin a policy of evening
dialog: sedation. For everybody.
text: A terrified reaction from the group. Nancy shoots Neil a sharp
text: look, shaking her head.
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: (rising)
dialog: The fuck you will. Anybody tries to
dialog: drug me gets his ass kicked!
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: (rising, angry)
dialog: You just bought yourself a night in the

speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Fuck you! You sit down!
text: Simms presses a button, summoning help. Neil rises, prepared to

speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Easy, Kincaid...
text: Max and another ORDERLY enter. Kincaid starts to freak. he kicks
text: a chair at them, screaming!
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: NOBODY'S GONNA PUT ME TO SLEEP!
text: The orderlies get Kincaid into an armlock and wrestle him,
text: fighting and kicking, out the door.
text: Simms follows the struggle out into the hallway. Neil and Nancy
dialog: join her.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: Simms, flushed and livid, watches Kincaid get dragged away. She
dialog: turns to Neil.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: We'll begin sedation tonight. Starting
dialog: with him.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: You can't! They'll be defenseless against
dialog: their dreams.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: That's precisely what they need. Some
dialog: uninterrupted REM sleep to release all
dialog: this negative energy.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (to Neil, desperate)
dialog: Neil, please --
text: Neil pauses, wavering between nancy and Simms. He finally comes
dialog: to a decision:
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.
dialog: (she gives him a
dialog: blank stare)
dialog: It's a dream suppressant.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: I know what it is. I just can't believe
dialog: what I'm hearing.
dialog: (indicates Nancy)
dialog: What has she talked you into?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Nothing. They're my patients. It's
dialog: my decision. I want the dreams stopped
dialog: until we get some answers.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: I won't allow it.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: I'll go straight to Carver if I have
dialog: to. He'll either back me up or accept
dialog: my resignation.
dialog: Simms pauses, then:
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: If soemthing goes wrong, I'll make sure
dialog: you're held responsible. Fully responsible.
text: Simms exits. Neil watches her go.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: I can't believe I just did that.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in
dialog: by tomorrow?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: We're gonna try.
text: He turns and walks away -- but pauses, looking back.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: I hope you know what you're getting us
dialog: into.

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: TARYN

speaker_heading: TARYN
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: LORENZO
dialog: (twirling keys)
dialog: So...got the keys to heaven, baby.
speaker_heading: TARYN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LORENZO
dialog: The dispensary. I'm talking clean

dialog: meth.
speaker_heading: TARYN
dialog: (steps past him)
dialog: I don't do that shit.
text: He grabs her wrist, exposing her arm -- her skin is scarred with

speaker_heading: LORENZO
dialog: What are these, beauty marks?
speaker_heading: TARYN
dialog: (yanks her arm away)
dialog: Those are ancient history.
speaker_heading: LORENZO
dialog: Oh yeah? Well, if you're ever in the
dialog: mood for a history lesson, I'm your
dialog: teacher, understand?
speaker_heading: TARYN
dialog: Stay out of my face or I'll go straight
dialog: to Max.
speaker_heading: LORENZO

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. TV ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Watching TV.
speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Research.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Oh, right. You're gonna be a TV star.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Wait and see.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: If Simms catches you in here after lights

speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (pleading)
dialog: I gotta stay up, Max.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Jennifer --
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Just tonight, please? I can't handle

text: Max hesitates...then relents against his better judgement.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: If you get caught, I never saw you.
dialog: Deal?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: Deal. Thanks.
text: Max exits, shaking his head. Jennifer turns back to the TV -- the
text: Late Show drones on. She shakes herself, still fighting to stay
dialog: awake.
text: She digs a hidden pack of cigarettes from under the chair cushion
text: and lights up. She takes a deep drag -- then, wincing with pain,

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KRISTEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: You like gymnastics?
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: (nods)
dialog: I was on the team at school.

speaker_heading: NANCY

speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Yeah, but I was really not good.
text: They laugh softly.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Yeah, but I was really not good.
text: They laugh softly.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN (cont.)
dialog: I'm glad you're here.
text: Nancy pauses, wrestling with a decision. She digs into her purse,
text: pulls out her bottle of Hypnocyl, and shakes the contents into her
text: hand. Just two pills left. She gives them to Kristen.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN (cont.)
dialog: What are they?
speaker_heading: NANCY

speaker_heading: TV SET
speaker_heading: DICK CAVETT

speaker_heading: SALLY KELLERMAN
dialog: Well, I suppose it --

speaker_heading: JENNIFER
text: Her eyes fluttering.
speaker_heading: TV SET
text: Alternating between snow and image.
speaker_heading: KELLERMAN
dialog: -- find a good teacher. An actor has

speaker_heading: FREDDY/CAVETT
dialog: (gleefully)
dialog: WHO GIVES A FUCK WHAT YOU THINK?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
text: Her eyes snap open, her body stiffening. She stares at:
speaker_heading: TEH TV SCREEN
text: Nothing now but static.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
text: Frowning. Must have imagined it. She rises and smacks the side
text: of the set, trying to get the picture back. Nothing.
text: Suddenly, two arms rip from each side of the TV set and grab her
text: by the shoulders. The arms are a horrid hybrid of Freddy's arms
text: and RCA tubes and wiring. She SCREAMS as she is lifted off the
dialog: ground.
speaker_heading: TV SET
text: Freddy's head grows and stretches out of the top of the set,
text: wearing the rabbit-ear antenna like some horrible insect.
text: Jennifer keeps SCREAMING.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: This is it, Jennifer! Your big break
dialog: in TV!

scene_heading: EXT. CEMETARY - DAY

speaker_heading: NUN (O.S.)
dialog: Don't be ashamed, young man. This is
dialog: a place for sorrow.
speaker_heading: ANTOHER ANGLE
text: The nun in white stands clsoe by (Neil saw her in the hospital

speaker_heading: NUN (cont.)
dialog: What faith do you follow?
text: He chokes back a bitter laugh.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Science...I suppose.
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: A sad choice.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: There are times when it doesn't offer

dialog: I've seen you before. Sister...?
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: Mary Helena.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: You do volunteer work at the hospital?
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: I come from time to time. When I'm

text: Neil turns his gaze back toward the funeral, lost in his own
dialog: private grief.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: (softly)
dialog: I could've saved them.
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: Only one thing can save the children.
dialog: The unquiet spirit must be laid to

speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: (blankly)
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: NANCY

speaker_heading: NANCY (cont.)

speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: I was just talking to --

speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: To who?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Doesn't matter.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: C'mon. Let's get out of this rain.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. NANCY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

speaker_heading: NEIL

speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE

text: Nancy is crouched near the fireplace, feeding paper cartons to the

speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Stop blaming yourself.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: I'm running out of answers. A patient
text: sleepwalks out of a security ward up
text: to a tower with no access. A girl,
text: alone in a room, dies by jumping six
text: feet straight up into a television set.
dialog: Nothing makes sense anymore.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Then maybe you're ready.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: The truth.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Try me.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (considers it)

speaker_heading: TARYN
dialog: Who is he?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Freddy Krueger. He was a child murderer
dialog: before he died. After he died, he became
dialog: ...something worse.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Six years ago Freddy killed my friends.
dialog: He almost killed me. I thought I got rid
dialog: of him -- but I guess he was too strong.
text: Thick silence. The kids stare at her, flabbergasted, not knowing
dialog: whether to believe or doubt. Then:
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Why is he after us?
speaker_heading: TARYN
dialog: Yeah? What did we ever do?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Not what you did. Your parents. My
text: parents. They burned him alive.

speaker_heading: TARYN
dialog: Oh sure. That's just the sorta thing
dialog: parents tell their kids: "Goodnight
dialog: honey. Don't forget ot say your prayers.
dialog: Oh, by the way, your father and I torched
dialog: some maniac last night."
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: So what do we do about this creep?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Last time, it was me against him. I
dialog: wasn't strong enough...alone.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (catching the thread)
dialog: But together...
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Kristen's the key. She's got a very
dialog: special talent. A gift.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: I haven't been able to do that since
dialog: I was a little girl.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: You did it the other night.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN

text: Kristen nods.
speaker_heading: NANCY (cont.)

dialog: hypnosis.
text: He turns to a high-tech chrome pendulum device sitting on the

speaker_heading: NEIL (cont.)
dialog: I want you all to follow the pendulum
dialog: with your eyes. Tune out everything
dialog: else...nothing else exists but the

speaker_heading: NANCY

dialog: Take us there, Kristen.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Breathe deeply and relax...starting with

speaker_heading: PANNING THE KIDS

speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: I'm sorry.

speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: We can try again.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Everybody take five.

speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Look, I was willing to go along with this

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: The room's changing!

speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: This is crazy...crazy...
dialog: He looks down --
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE

speaker_heading: NUEROSURGEON

speaker_heading: NANCY

speaker_heading: CARVER
dialog: Young lady, your opinion is of no

speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: That's not true.
speaker_heading: CARVER
dialog: Dr. Goldman, in the last four days we've

dialog: windows.
speaker_heading: NEIL

text: THE FIGURE IN THE WINDOW

speaker_heading: NEIL
text: pauses for a moment, then approaches the building.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Neil comes to a set of double doors and rattles them -- they're
text: sealed with a rusty chain and padlock.
text: He moves to a broken window and peers through the boards nailed
dialog: across it.
speaker_heading: NEIL'S POV
text: He can see into the long main hallway of the ground floor. He

speaker_heading: NEIL
speaker_heading: NEIL

scene_heading: INT. OLD WING - BASEMENT LEVEL - NIGHT
text: A forgotten, dusty corridor with peeled paint like parchment on

text: The only feature in the dead end hallway is a partially open rusty
text: iron door with a small barred window. A FAINT BUZZING rises and
text: falls from within.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Excuse me. Sister?
text: No answer. Just another swell of FAINT BUZZING. Neil approaches
text: the door and pushes it open all the way. It SQUEALS LOUDLY on its
text: hinges.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM
text: Neil enters a huge, shadowy, dungeon-like room. Flaking cement
text: pillars stand draped with cobwebs. Rusted remains of bedframes
text: and scraps of wood litter the floor. The BUZZING grows louder,
text: then falls away again.
speaker_heading: NEIL (cont.)
dialog: Hello?
text: A wooden match ignites near him, going off like a gunshot in the
text: stillness -- the nun is reavealed. Neil gasps, startled.
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: This is where it began.
text: She turns and lights a candle in a tiny alcove before a statue of
text: the Virgin Mary. Dim light sputters up.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: This wing's been closed for years.
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: What was this place?
speaker_heading: NUN
text: Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of
dialog: men. Twisted, lost souls, the worst
dialog: of the criminally insane, were locked
dialog: away in here like animals.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: The whole facility was shut down in the
dialog: Forties, wasn't it? Some kind of
dialog: scandal...
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: (she nods)
text: A young girl on the staff was accidentally
dialog: locked in here over the holidays. The
dialog: inmates managed to keep her hidden for
dialog: days. She was raped...hundreds of times.
dialog: When they found her, she was barely
dialog: alive...and with child.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: (softly)
dialog: My God.
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: That girl was Amanda Krueger. Her

speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Freddy.
speaker_heading: NUN
text: The bastard son of a hundred maniacs.
dialog: Some say he was murdered, though no
dialog: body was ever found.
text: Neil is momentarily distracted by another swell of BUZZING. A fly
text: brushes past his face in the darkness.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: You said something before...about
dialog: laying him to rest...?
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: You must find the remains...and bury
text: them in hallowed ground.
text: The nun turns and climbs the stairs.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: (blankly)
dialog: Hallowed ground?
text: he moves to follow her, but his foot comes in contact with
text: something near the bottom of the steps. The BUZZING SWELLS UP
text: LOUDLY. He jumps back.
speaker_heading: NEIL'S POV
text: The grisly carcass of a cat stares up at Neil, hundreds of flies

speaker_heading: THE NUN
text: Pausing at the top of the stairs.
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: If your only faith is science, Doctor...
dialog: it may be you that's laid to rest.

speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Don't you think I know that? I don't

speaker_heading: NEIL

speaker_heading: NANCY

speaker_heading: TARYN
dialog: What about Kristen?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: We can't get to her. I've tried.
text: She dims the lights and goes to the pendulum device.
speaker_heading: NANCY (cont.)
dialog: I was hoping we'd have more time to

dialog: (beat)
dialog: But Joey's in there. And Kristen's
dialog: going in with or without us. They need

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You mean we're gonna try to go in with

speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: It's now or never. I won't kid you.
dialog: This is as dangerous as it gets. If

dialog: Nobody has to go in that doesn't want
dialog: to.
speaker_heading: THE KIDS
text: A long silence. Their faces reflect conflicting emotions. Fear,

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm in.
speaker_heading: TARYN
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: Let's go kick that motherfucker's ass all
text: over dreamland.

speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Now remember -- whatever happens, stay

speaker_heading: THOMPSON
dialog: That's it. The Caddy.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: The rear end of a ravaged 59 Cadillac sticks out from beneath a

text: Neil crosses to the car and runs his hands over the corroded
text: surface of the trunk. He tries to lift it, but it's locked tight.
speaker_heading: THOMPSON
text: stands beside the Dodge. He takes a swig from a pint bottle and
text: glances around into the darkness nervously.
speaker_heading: NEIL
text: finds a large four-pronged tire iron -- three ends for lug nuts,

text: Zevon's "I'll Sleep When I'm Dead" still blares from the radio.
text: Nothing has changed. She's still home. Safe. She wonders if all

speaker_heading: ELAINE

speaker_heading: KRISTEN

speaker_heading: ELAINE (cont.)
dialog: What's that for?
speaker_heading: KRISTEN

speaker_heading: FREDDY

speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Kristen turns and runs, Freddy right on her heels, his finger

speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Kristen's momentum takes her right up the wall -- she pushes off
text: in an incredible gymnast's flip, hurtling up in an arc back over
text: Freddy's head -- Freddy hits the wall, his finger-razors burying
text: deep in the plaster.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
text: makes a perfect landing near her bed and snatches up her
dialog: bedspread.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
text: howls with rags and yanks his razors from the wall in an explosion

speaker_heading: KRISTEN
text: hurtles herself out the window in an explosion of glass.
speaker_heading: FREDDY

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: TARYN

dialog: Kristen? Is that you?
text: She hurries up a passageway and turns a corner.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Freddy leaps from the darkness, blades flashing.
text: Taryn nimbly dodges and whirls, producing two large gravity

speaker_heading: TARYN
dialog: Okay asshole. Let's dance.
text: Freddy gives her an evil smile and squares off against her.
text: They circle each otehr slowly...then Freddy lashes out.
text: Taryn ducks and cuts deeply across Freddy's ribs.
text: Freddy SCREAMS with anger and swipes twice more, ripping deep
text: gouges in Taryn's shoulder.
text: Taryn draws back, keeping her guard up. She feints, then strikes

text: This time Freddy draws back.
speaker_heading: FREDDY

speaker_heading: FREDDY

dialog: the darkness.
speaker_heading: TARYN
text: Revolted by teh weird display. She looks down, feeling something
dialog: strange.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - TARYN'S ARMS

speaker_heading: WIDER

text: wall. Taryn SCREAMS.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - HYPO FINGERS
text: As their inner plunges depress, Taryn's biceps swell grotesquely,
text: veins bulging impossibly.
speaker_heading: TARYN
text: We can actually see the high-pressure fluid travel upward as her
text: veins and body balloon, racing from her arms -- her neck swells --
dialog: temples expand -- eyeballs bulge --

speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - FREDDY
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: What a rush.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ELM STREET BASEMENT - NIGHT

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Hello? You guys, where are you?
text: He heas a SOUND somewhere in the darkness ahead. He
text: pauses...nothing. Suddenly, there's a SOUND OF SCREECHING METAL
text: and a strange object comes racing out of the darkness at him. He
text: lunges out of the way.
speaker_heading: THE OBJECT
text: screeches to a halt and wheels about. It's an oversiezed,
text: nightmarish version of Will's wheelchair -- made of rusty, twisted

dialog: agonizing death.
speaker_heading: FREDDY (O.S.)

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: THE CHAIR
text: spins around, preparing for another run.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
speaker_heading: FREDDY

speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - WILL
speaker_heading: WILL

dialog: I'm the Dungeonmaster...the Dungeonmaster...
speaker_heading: WIDER

text: like the illustration on the Dungeonmaster game card.
speaker_heading: LOW ANGLE
text: The wheelchair ROARS over camera.
speaker_heading: WILL
text: Green lightning explodes from his fingertips and shatters the

speaker_heading: FREDDY

speaker_heading: WILL

dialog: face.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves --
dialog: demon begone!
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Will rushes at Freddy, shooting wizard's fire. The crackling
text: green energy engulfs Freddy completely --
text: -- but Freddy grabs Will by the front of his shirt and lifts him
text: off the ground.
speaker_heading: CLOSER
text: Freddy snarls into Will's face as the living energy twines around
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: Sorry kid. I don't believe in fairy

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: NANCY'S VOICE
dialog: (faint, faraway)
dialog: Kristen?
text: She turns a corner and sees Nancy at the end of a hallway.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN (cont.)
dialog: Nancy!
text: They rush toward each other -- but stop as they hear a strange
text: CRUNCHING SOUND.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I don't know.
text: The SOUND comes again -- a horrible CRACKING AND SNAPPING. The
text: wall begins to spiderweb with cracks as it bulges outward.
text: Something big seems to be trying to press through to cut them off
text: from each other. Nancy and Kristen back away warily.
text: Suddenly, there is an EXPLOSION of wood and plaster -- and Kincaid
dialog: steps through.
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: Yo. I thought I heard voices.

speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Kincaid! I could kiss you!
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: What's stopping you?

speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: Cool. So where's Joey?
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: I don't know. It's like a maze in here.
speaker_heading: KINCAID

speaker_heading: KRUEGER!

speaker_heading: KINCAID (cont.)

text: Suddenly, the lights around them flinker and dim. They hear a
text: DEEP, REVERBERATING GROAN OF METAL. All look over the railing.
scene_heading: OVER THE SHOULDER
text: as they peer downward. Where before there was nothing, there are
text: now two huge, rusty boiler room doors slowly swinging open like
text: the entrance to Hell. Orange light flickers from below.
speaker_heading: KINCAID
text: Still finishing his prior statement.
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: -- shhhiiiiit.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: The tree slowly descend teh stairs, all bravado lost. They stop

speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: This is it. Are you ready?
text: Kristen nods.
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: Let's snuff the fucker.
text: They descend.
scene_heading: INT. BOILER ROOM - ENTRANCE
text: Nancy, Kristen, and Kincaid cautiously come down the winding
text: stairs and pass under an arch way made of twisted, scorched
text: tricycles and shattered dolls.
text: They exchange worried looks, then step through.
speaker_heading: MASTER
text: A surrealistic boiler room, air red with heat and haze.
text: Freddy sits on a throne made of children's skulls and bones.
text: Joey is nearby, suspended over the pit of flames like a weird
dialog: altar.
dialog: Welcome to Freddy Hell.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: (low gutteral chuckle)
dialog: Look Joey...all the little piggies have
dialog: come home.
speaker_heading: JOEY
text: He turns his terrified, pleading eyes toward his friends. His
text: skin is hot and blistered. The tongues that lash his hands and
text: feet to the four posts are writhing slowly, licking his ankles and
text: wrists. He opens his mouth in a mute, silent scream.
speaker_heading: NANCY, KRISTEN, KINCAID
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Joey...
text: Nancy steps forward.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Let him go.
speaker_heading: THE THRONE
text: Freddy sweeps his hands, the obedient servant.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: Your wish is my command.
text: He makes a gesture.
speaker_heading: JOEY
text: The tongue/creature securing his left wrist unravels -- he drops
text: precariously. The other tongues begin to loosen their hold.
speaker_heading: NANCY
text: lunges to the edge of the pit, reaching for Joey.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
text: laughs maniacally.
speaker_heading: THE PIT
text: The last tongues give way and Joey drops --
text: -- just as Nancy snatches his wrist and hangs on. Kincaid grabs
text: Nancy by the belt and hauls them both back out.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
text: With a cry, she runs and does a double flip over the burning
dialog: pit -- right at Freddy.
speaker_heading: THE THRONE
text: Kristen snap-kicks right into Freddy's face, toppling him and the
dialog: throne backwards.
speaker_heading: KINCAID
text: strains as he rips a six-foot section of pipe from the wall and
text: races toward the throne.
speaker_heading: NANCY
text: helps Joey to his feet just as a tongue/creature flies out of the
text: darkness and whips around her neck, strangling her.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
text: rises from the rubble of his throne and lashes at Kristen. She
text: flips over his head -- but Freddy backhands her, sending her
text: spinning across the room.
speaker_heading: NANCY
text: Clutching one end of the writhing tongue, she forces it to the
text: ground. She grabs a furnace poker and skewers the creature. It
text: instantly unravels from her neck.
speaker_heading: THE FALLEN THRONE
text: As Freddy prepares to slash Kristen, Kincaid races in, swinging
text: his pipe in a wide arc. It smashes across Freddy's back, driving
text: him to his knees.
text: Kincaid raises the pipe for a second blow, but Freddy leaps up
text: with a ROAR and grabs Kincaid, hauling him high over his head.
text: Nancy rushes in just as Freddy's arms are extended and plunges the
text: poker into his heart.
text: Everyone freezes.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
text: looks down at the poker with an exaggerated gasp -- then flashes a
text: grin at Nancy.
speaker_heading: NANCY
text: reacts in horror.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
text: releases Kincaid's feet and holds him dangling by the throat.
text: With his free hand, he pulls the poker slowly from his chest. He
text: looks at the tip -- it glistens with dark, rancid gore. He licks
text: it like an ice cream cone.
speaker_heading: NANCY AND KRISTEN
text: Kristen rises, using Nancy for support.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Nancy!
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: He's too strong! He was never this
dialog: strong!
speaker_heading: FREDDY
text: whirls to her, Kincaid still choking in his upraised fist.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: (hissing)
dialog: Yesss! The souls of the children...
text: He rips his shirt open, revealing his hideously scarred body.
speaker_heading: FREDDY (cont.)
dialog: ...they make me stronger.
text: His flesh begins to undulate and swell.
scene_heading: TIGHT ON FREDDY'S TORSO
text: Rippling blisters appear, forming into faces -- horrible, tortured
text: faces wailing in despair. We recognize Phillip ... Jennifer ...
dialog: Will ... Taryn ...
speaker_heading: NANCY AND KRISTEN
text: Total horror and revulsion.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - FREDDY

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BOILER ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: THOMPSON

speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: THOMPSON
dialog: Listen.

speaker_heading: THOMPSON

dialog: "Sympathy for the Devil."
scene_heading: INT. WRECKED CHEVY

speaker_heading: NEIL AND THOMPSON
text: More MUSIC comes from all around them, blasting from teh radios of

text: We hear the HOWLING of Wolfman Jack.
scene_heading: THE CARS - VARIOUS ANGLES
text: Broken headlights sputter to life. A windshield wiper near

speaker_heading: NEIL AND THOMPSON
speaker_heading: THOMPSON
dialog: (hoarse whisper)
dialog: The whole place is coming to life...
text: Both men turn to look at the burlap sack. There is a slight

speaker_heading: THE SACK
text: Suddenly, a skeletal hand wearing finger-razors tears through the

text: The sack rips wide open as Freddy's charred bones leap into
text: life -- a hideous shambling skeleton SCREAMING with unearthly
dialog: rage.
speaker_heading: THOMPSON
text: Frozen to the spot. Can't believe his eyes.
speaker_heading: NEIL
text: falls back, scrambling away as Freddy's blades slash the air
text: inches in front of his face.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Suddenly, Jesse the junkyard dog hurtles out of the darkness onto
text: the hellish thing's back, biting and snapping.
text: The skeleton pulls the dog from its back, slashes its throat in
text: one quick motion, and tosses the carcass aside.
speaker_heading: THOMPSON
text: Something snaps in him as he glares at the skeleton.
speaker_heading: THOMPSON
dialog: It's really you.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - SKELETON
text: It turns and grins hideously at Thompson.
speaker_heading: THOMPSON
text: grabs a piece of pipe and rushes the monster.
speaker_heading: THOMPSON
dialog: I'll send you back to Hell here you
dialog: belong!
speaker_heading: THE CREATURE
text: meets Thompson's rush head on, blocking the pipe and yanking him
text: off his feet.
text: It hurls Thompson through the air with incredible force.
speaker_heading: THE CADILLAC
text: Thompson slams into it, impaled on the tail fin. He looks down at
text: the metal point jutting from his chest...and dies.
speaker_heading: NEIL
text: grabs the shovel and swings it -- the skeleton ducks and slashes
text: Neil's ribs, ripping his shirt wide open.
text: As Neil doubles over, the skeleton rips the shovel from his hands
text: and smashes it solidly against his head. Before Neil can crumple,
text: the creature straightens him up with a second vicious blow -- we
text: hear BONE CRACK. Neil falls back into the grave.
text: The skeleton shrieks with unholy laughter and begins to shovel the
text: loose dirt onto Neil.
text: It tosses the shovel aside, raises its arms into the air with a
text: victorious HOWL -- and collapses into a pile of bones.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Nancy, Kristen, Kincaid, and Joey exit the boiler room, limping,
text: battered, and bloody. They face the weird perspectives of the Elm
dialog: Street halls.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Kristen, can you pull us out?
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: They sedated me. We're stuck here till
text: it wears off.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Let's try this way.
text: They start down a corridor and enter:
scene_heading: INT. SEWING ROOM
text: Eerie mannikins and an ornate three-way mirror stand in teh
dialog: shadows.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: It's a dead end.
text: Suddenly, there's activity in the mirror. A wavering light...then
text: Freddy materializes. An infinity of Freddies are reflected in the
text: three-way mirror behind him.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: Sorry to keep you waiting. Perhaps if
dialog: there were more of me to spread around.
text: Freddy runs into the room, magically followed by rows of his
dialog: mirror reflections.
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: Holy shit! He's multiplying!
text: The room is suddenly filled with dozens of Freddies slashing and
dialog: chasing our heroes.
speaker_heading: NANCY
text: leaps over a wicker basket to escape a Freddy. As a second Freddy
text: lunges, she jams a knitting needle through its throat.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
text: springs over a group of Freddies, catches a wall fixture, and
text: flips across the room.
speaker_heading: KINCAID
text: With a battle cry, he plows into the charging Freddies, bowling
dialog: them over.
speaker_heading: JOEY
text: cringes back, cowering behind the mannikins.
speaker_heading: THE MIRROR
text: More Freddies pouring into the room.
speaker_heading: NANCY
text: is backed into a corner, torn with slash marks.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
text: delivering flying kicks, but slowing down. A Freddy grabs her
text: from behind, holding her for the others.
speaker_heading: KINCAID
text: goes down under the sheer weight of Freddies crawling all over
text: him, slashing. There are jsut too many.
speaker_heading: JOEY
text: steps out from behind teh mannikins, shaking with emotion as his
dialog: friends are overwhelmed -- none of them can last more that a few
text: seconds longer. He opens his mouth and --
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - JOEY
speaker_heading: JOEY
text: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
text: An incridible, deafening, universe-shaking cry. Joey has found
dialog: his dream power.
scene_heading: THE THREE-WAY MIRROR
text: is blown into fragments.
speaker_heading: VARIOUS ANGLES
text: All the Freddies EXPLODING into shards of hurtling glass as nancy,
text: Kristen, and Kincaied cover their ears.
speaker_heading: JOEY
text: finally stops. Total silence. He looks just as surprised as
text: everyone else at what he's done.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Wow.
dialog: (does a double take
dialog: at his own voice)
dialog: Did I say that?
speaker_heading: KINCAID
dialog: You sure as shit did! You saved our
dialog: asses!
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: He's gone! We got him!
text: Kincaid scoops Joey into his arms in a crushing bear hug.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Hey man, put me down!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. JUNKYARD - NIGHT
text: TIGHT ON the open grave. A bloody, dirt-encrusted hand grasps the
text: edge of teh grave. A second hand follows. Neil Goldman slowly,
text: painfully pulls himself out of the grave.
text: He has an ugly wound on the side of his head and his collarbone's
text: broken -- but he's alive.
text: Gasping with pain, Neil crawls to the pile of Freddy's remains.
text: With tremendous effort, he pushes hte bones over the edge into the
dialog: grave.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - GRAVE
text: The bones tumble into the earthen pit.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SEWING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Kristen helps Nancy to her feet as she brushes away the shattered
dialog: glass of the Freddies.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I think so.
text: They embrace tearfully.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (softly)
text: It's over. It's over.
speaker_heading: THOMPSON (O.S.)
dialog: Nancy...
text: Nancy turns and sees her father floating toward her, glowing in a
text: golden nimbus of light.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Daddy?
speaker_heading: THOMPSON (cont.)
dialog: I've crossed over, Princess.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Crossed over?
speaker_heading: THOMPSON
dialog: But I couldn't go until I told you how
dialog: sorry I am for all the things I've done.
text: Nancy gazes at him, slowly comprehending.
speaker_heading: THOMPSON (cont.)
dialog: I love you so much. I'll always love
dialog: you. Goodbye, Princess.
text: Nancy goes to embrace ehr father one final time.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I'll always love you, Dadd --
text: Her words are cut short as her body jerks violently.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - TIGHT
text: "Thompson" is wearing Freddy's glove -- the razors buried in
text: Nancy's stomach.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - NANCY
text: Her eyes wide and staring as she realizes.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - FREDDY/THOMPSON
text: As Thompson's face disappears and is replaced by Freddy's.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: Die, bitch.
text: He jams the blades in deeper.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT - JUNKYARD - NIGHT
text: CLOSEUP ON Neil -- using his one good hand, he grasps the bottle
text: of holy water and uncorks it with his teeth. He presses it to his
text: forehead and closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: (hoarse whisper)
dialog: Please God. For the children. For
dialog: Nancy.
text: He looks down at Freddy's remains.
speaker_heading: NEIL (cont.)
text: Ashes to ashes.
text: He flicks a stream of holy water onto the bones.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SEWING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Freddy, still locked in an embrace with Nancy as she dies, SCREAMS
text: as a pattern of holes rip across his body -- bright shafts of
text: light burst through.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. JUNKYARD - NIGHT
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Dust to dust.
text: He flicks a second stream of water.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SEWING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Another arc of holes explode across Freddy's body. He arches
dialog: back, SHRIEKING --
text: -- and Nancy slides of his blades. Kristen runs to her.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT - JUNKYARD - NIGHT
text: Neil holds the crucifix. He leans down and presses it against the
dialog: skull.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Lay this spirit to rest.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SEWING ROOM - CLOSEUP FREDDY
text: A cross-shaped hole explodes from Freddy's forehead -- brilliant,
text: blinding white light pours out.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: As Freddy staggers back, riddled with glowing holes, we see a
text: whrilwind of spirit faces pouring from him -- sould of his victims
text: soaring out, freed at last.
speaker_heading: KINCAID AND JOEY
text: Awestruck as they watch.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
text: The holes expand, eating Freddy alive as his SCREAM ECHOES across
text: the dreamscape.
text: The shafts of light from his body merge into one white hot ball --
text: then EXPLODES.
text: Freddy is gone.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
text: cradles Nancy in her arms. nancy is drifting toward death.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: (crying)
dialog: He's gone. It's over. Please don't
dialog: die, Nancy. Please.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (weak)
dialog: I'm so proud of you all.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Tell Neil I...
text: She sags against Kristen. Kristen shakes her head, tears
text: brimming.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: I won't let you die. i won't.
dialog: (lower, strange intensity)
dialog: I'm going to dream you...
dialog: (whispering in Nancy's ear)
dialog: I'm going to dream you into a beautiful
dialog: dream. Forever and ever.
text: She closes her eyes and holds Nancy tight.
scene_heading: SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - DUSK
text: Three caskets are surrounded by a large number of MOURNERS.
speaker_heading: CLOSER
text: Kristen, Joey, and Kincaid watch tearfully. Neil, wearing a neck
text: brace, puts his arm around the kids as the caskets are lowered.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - NEIL
text: He notices movement on the hilltop.
speaker_heading: NEIL'S POV
text: The nun stands on the crest of the hill. She turns and walks
text: away, disappearing from view.
speaker_heading: NEIL
text: leaves the funeral and starts up the hillside after her.
speaker_heading: HILLTOP
text: As neil reaches the tree where he first met the nun, he catches a
text: glimpse of her as she dissappears behind a crypt.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Sister...wait.
speaker_heading: THE CRYPT

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. NEIL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

dialog: driveway.
scene_heading: INT. NEIL'S HOUSE
text: Kristen and Neil have finished a meal together and are sipping
text: wine. Her hair is shorter. Neil looks thinner, a little weary.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: I'm glad things have worked out for you.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: I think new York was just what I
dialog: needed. So many people. I never feel
dialog: alone.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: The city that never sleeps.
dialog: (pause)

scene_heading: INT. NEIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
