dialog: Let’s work on how to get there.
text: Pan up to find...CLINT BARTON, with his daughter, LILA,
text: coaching her as she notches an arrow in her bow.
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, good...tip down...bow arm
dialog: out...three fingers-
speaker_heading: LILA BARTON
dialog: Why three?
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON
dialog: ‘Cause two’s not enough and four’s
dialog: too much-
speaker_heading: LAURA BARTON (0.S.)
dialog: You guys want mustard or mayo, or
dialog: both?
text: CLINT TURNS. IN THE FIELD BEHIND THEM, his wife, LAURA
text: BARTON sets up a picnic as COOPER and NATHANIEL play soccer.
speaker_heading: LILA BARTON
dialog: Who puts mayo on a hot dog?
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON
dialog: We’1l both have mustard, hon!
dialog: (to Lila)
dialog: Okay. Draw back, deep breath...
text: She lets loose. THUD! HER ARROW HITS NEAR THE BULLS-EYE.
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
dialog: Good job, Hawkeye. Go get your
dialog: arrow.
speaker_heading: LAURA BARTON (0.S.)
dialog: Enough murder practice! Soup’s on!
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON
dialog: One sec, babe. Be right there!
dialog: We’re gonna kill some hot dogs.
dialog: We're hungry.
text: But when he turns back...LILA IS GONE. The bow and arrow lie
text: at his feet. He stares.
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
dialog: Lila? Babe, did you see Lila-
text: He turns to his wife, BUT SHE’S GONE. So are the boys. The
text: soccer ball rolls to a stop near the picnic blanket.
text: NO ONE CAN BE SEEN FOR A HUNDRED YARDS IN ALL DIRECTIONS.
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
dialog: Guys? Guys, come on...
text: Clint walks toward the field, dread growing.
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: NEBULA
dialog: It was fun.
scene_heading: INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT
text: Tony, thin and haggard, kneels in front of HIS BROKEN IRON
text: MAN HELMET. He hits a switch. A light blinks.
text: TONY’S RECORDING: he stares directly into the “camera.”
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: This thing on? Hey, Ms. Potts.
dialog: Pep. If you find this recording,
dialog: don’t post it on social media.
dialog: It’s going to be a real tearjerker.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - NIGHT
text: THE BENATAR sparks, adrift.
speaker_heading: TONY (0.S.)
dialog: I don’t know if you’re ever going
dialog: to see these. I don’t even know if

dialog: Today’s day twenty-one, no...twenty-
dialog: two.
scene_heading: INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK
text: NEBULA lasers shut Tony’s infected wound.
speaker_heading: TONY (0.S.)
dialog: You know, if it wasn’t for the
text: existential terror of staring into
dialog: the literal void of space, I’d say
dialog: I’m feeling a little better today.
dialog: Infection’s run its course, thanks
dialog: to the Blue Meanie back there.
dialog: You’d like her. She’s very
dialog: practical. And only a tiny bit
text: sadistic.
scene_heading: INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK
text: TONY AND NEBULA MEND THE EMPTY FUEL CELLS UNDER THE FLOOR.
speaker_heading: TONY (0.S.)
dialog: The fuel cells were cracked during
dialog: battle, but we figured out a way to
dialog: reverse the ion charge. Bought
dialog: ourselves about 48 hours of flight
dialog: time. Problem is that was
dialog: about...49 hours ago.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK
text: Tony hands Nebula the last of A PURPLE POWDER. She pushes it

scene_heading: INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT
text: Tony stands on the flight deck, one hand resting on the
text: glass, staring into the unknown.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Pep, I know I said no more
dialog: surprises. But, I gotta say, I was
dialog: really hoping to pull off one last
dialog: one. But it looks like...well, you
dialog: know what it looks like.
scene_heading: INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT
text: Back to now. Tony records his thoughts into his helmet.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Don't feel bad about this. I mean,
dialog: actually, if you grovel for a
dialog: couple weeks, and then move on with
dialog: enormous guilt...I should probably
dialog: lie down for a minute, rest my
dialog: eyes. Please know, when I drift
dialog: off, it will be like every day
dialog: lately. I’m fine, totally fine.
dialog: I’m going to dream about you. It’s
dialog: always you.
text: Tony switches the helmet off.
speaker_heading: TIME CUT:
text: NEBULA finds TONY SPRAWLED ON THE FLOOR.
speaker_heading: TIME CUT:
text: Nebula helps Tony into Quill’s chair. Tony slumps,
text: completely still. Nebula gives him his privacy.
text: Move in on Tony’s face as...A LIGHT SLOWLY GROWS BRIGHTER.
text: Soon, the entire flight deck glows as bright as a sun.
text: Nebula appears from the galley, shading her eyes. Tony’s

scene_heading: CAPTAIN MARVEL (CAROL DANVERS) hovering in space.
scene_heading: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: STEVE ROGERS shaves.
text: He studies himself in the mirror, exhausted. He’s about to
text: tap his razor in the sink’s standing water, when...
text: THE WATER RIPPLES. Steve stares a beat, puzzled. Then the
text: lamp catches his eye...SWAYING GENTLY.
text: Just then, a sound roars overhead. Steve turns...
scene_heading: EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND - NIGHT
text: THE MOON HANGS HUGE OVER THE EARTH. Then the silhouette of
text: THE BENATAR races past, propelled by CAROL DANVERS.
text: Below...STEVE ROGERS, BRUCE BANNER, AND NATASHA ROMANOV watch
text: a flying woman guide the ship to the ground.
text: Behind them, PEPPER POTTS walks up to the group.
speaker_heading: TIME CUT:
text: Steve races up as NEBULA helps Tony down the ramp.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I couldn't stop him.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Neither could we.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I lost the kid.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (unable to say it all)
dialog: We...lost...
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Is Pepper...?
text: JUST THEN, PEPPER POTTS THROWS HERSELF INTO TONY’S ARMS.
speaker_heading: PEPPER POTTS
dialog: Stay here, you stay right here-
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I’m not going anywhere.
text: NEARBY, NEBULA watches the sad humans. ROCKET SITS BESIDE
text: HER, GRATEFUL. She rests a hand on his furry head.
scene_heading: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY
text: RHODEY, TONY, STEVE, NATASHA, AND CAROL watch...

scene_heading: WANDA. VISION. BUCKY. T’CHALLA. MARIA HILL.
speaker_heading: RHODEY
dialog: It’s been twenty-three days since
dialog: Thanos came to Earth.
text: TONY, weak, sits in a hi-tech wheelchair, IV dripping into
text: his arm. He stares, taking in the loss:
scene_heading: SAM WILSON. SECRETARY ROSS. SHARON CARTER. SCOTT LANG.
scene_heading: HOPE VAN DYNE. HANK PYM. NICK FURY.
text: At Fury, Carol bites back emotion.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: World governments are in pieces, as
dialog: you can imagine. But the parts
dialog: that still work are trying to take

dialog: what he said he was going to do.
scene_heading: JANE FOSTER. ERIK SELVIG. WONG. DR. STRANGE. THE BARTON
scene_heading: FAMILY. QUILL. DRAX. MANTIS. GROOT. PETER PARKER.
text: Finally, Tony looks away. RHODEY turns it off.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanos wiped out fifty percent of
dialog: all the living creatures on Earth.
speaker_heading: CAROL DANVERS
dialog: Not just Earth.
speaker_heading: RHODEY
dialog: You sure about that?
speaker_heading: CAROL DANVERS
dialog: You never have to ask me that.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Where is he now?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: We don’t know. He just opened a
text: portal and walked through.
text: Tony looks out to see...THOR on the patio.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What’s his deal?
speaker_heading: ROCKET (0.S.)
text: He’s pissed.
text: Tony turns to see Rocket for the first time.
speaker_heading: ROCKET (CONT'D)
dialog: He thinks he failed. Which, of
dialog: course, he did. But there’s a lot
dialog: of that going around, ain’t there?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Until this second, I literally
dialog: thought you were a Build-a-Bear.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: We've been hunting Thanos for three
dialog: weeks - deep space scans,
dialog: satellites - we got nothing. Tony,
dialog: you fought him-
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Who told you that? I didn’t fight
dialog: him, he wiped my face with a planet
dialog: while a Bleecker Street magician
dialog: gave away the store. There was no
dialog: fight because he’s not beatable.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Did he give you anything to go on?
dialog: Clues, coordinates-—
text: Tony stares, lost, barely acknowledging Steve.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I saw this coming, few years back.
dialog: Didn't wanna believe. I thought I
dialog: was dreaming...
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Tony, I need you to focus-—
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: And I needed you, as in past tense.
dialog: That trumps what you need. It’s
dialog: too late, buddy. You know what I
dialog: need?
text: Tony turns to everyone, slightly unstable.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: I need a shave and a burger, not a
text: bowl of soup.
dialog: (stands)
dialog: And I believe I remember telling
dialog: all of you, alive and otherwise,
dialog: that we needed a suit of armor
dialog: around the world, whether it
dialog: impacted our precious freedoms or
dialog: not-—
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: But that didn’t work out, did it?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I said we'd lose, you said we'd “do
dialog: that together, too.” Guess what,
dialog: Cap, we lost, and you weren’t
dialog: there. But that’s what we do,
dialog: right? Our best work after the
dialog: fact? We’re the “Avengers”, not
dialog: the “Pre-vengers-”"
speaker_heading: RHODEY
dialog: Tony, take it easy...
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I’ve got nothing for ya, Cap. No
dialog: coordinates, no clues, no
dialog: strategies, no options. Zero, zip,
dialog: nada. No trust.
dialog: (rips out RT)
dialog: Here. You take this. You find
dialog: him, you put this on, and hide.
dialog: (drops to his knees)
dialog: I’m fine!
text: Tony COLLAPSES. Rhodey catches him.
scene_heading: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CORRIDOR - DAY
text: CAROL, STEVE, AND NATASHA stare through GLASS DOORS at TONY
text: IN A HOSPITAL BED, PEPPER AND BANNER AT HIS SIDE.
text: RHODEY STEPS OUT OF THE HOSPITAL ROOM.
speaker_heading: RHODEY
dialog: Bruce gave him a sedative. Should
dialog: be out the rest of the day.
speaker_heading: CAROL DANVERS
dialog: (heading for the lab)
dialog: Take care of him. When I come
dialog: back, I’1l bring a bottle of
dialog: Xorrian elixir.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: CAROL DANVERS
dialog: To kill Thanos.
scene_heading: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY
text: NATASHA catches up to CAROL IN THE WORKSHOP.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Hey, hey, hang on. We’re sort of a
dialog: team here. Between you and me,
dialog: morale’s a little fragile.
speaker_heading: CAROL DANVERS
dialog: Oh, I’m sorry. My fault.
text: Carol sees Steve and Rhodey catch up. She claps her hands.
speaker_heading: CAROL DANVERS (CONT'D)
dialog: All right, team! I’m going to go
dialog: kill Thanos. Message me if you get
dialog: any intel that can help.
dialog: Otherwise, I’1l report back when
dialog: he’s dead. Great work, everybody.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Look, we realize “up there’s” more
dialog: your territory, but this is our
dialog: fight, too.
speaker_heading: RHODEY
dialog: Do you even know where he is?
dialog: 10
speaker_heading: CAROL DANVERS
dialog: I know people who might-
speaker_heading: NEBULA (0.S.)
dialog: Don’t bother.
text: They all turn to see NEBULA in THE LIVING AREA DOORWAY.
speaker_heading: NEBULA (CONT'D)
dialog: I can tell you where Thanos is.
scene_heading: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA - DAY
scene_heading: STEVE, NATASHA, RHODEY, BANNER, ROCKET, THOR, and CAROL
text: gather. NEBULA studies her robotic hand.
speaker_heading: NEBULA
dialog: Thanos spent a long time trying
dialog: to...perfect me. When he worked,
dialog: he talked. About his Great Plan.
dialog: Even disassembled, I wanted to
dialog: please him. I’d ask, where would
dialog: we go once his plan was complete?
dialog: His answer was always the same: “To
dialog: the Garden.”
speaker_heading: RHODEY
dialog: You're saying Thanos had a
dialog: retirement plan.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Where’s this garden?
text: ROCKET brings up EARTH on A HOLO-MAP. A BRIGHT SURGE OF
scene_heading: ENERGY ENVELOPS THE PLANET (EMANATING FROM WAKANDA) .
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: When Thanos snapped his fingers,
dialog: Earth become ground zero for a
dialog: power surge of ridiculously cosmic
dialog: proportions. No one’s seen
dialog: anything like it.
text: He shifts the map, crossing billions of light years, to...AN
scene_heading: IDENTICAL SURGE ENVELOPING A MYSTERIOUS, ORANGE PLANET.
speaker_heading: ROCKET (CONT'D)
dialog: Until two days ago.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: You're saying he snapped his
dialog: fingers again. Where?
dialog: 11
text: Rocket zooms the holo-image toward a cluster of stars...
speaker_heading: NEBULA
text: Planet is unnamed, but inhabitable.
dialog: Rich atmosphere, good soil-
speaker_heading: STEVE
text: A garden.
speaker_heading: BRUCE BANNER
dialog: Thanos is there. And he just used
dialog: the stones.
text: Steve eyes everyone. THOR FINALLY LOOKS UP.
speaker_heading: BRUCE BANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: (thinking of himself)
dialog: You know, we'd be going short-
dialog: handed.
speaker_heading: RHODEY
dialog: Because he killed all our friends.
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: Are we saying they’re dead? We're
dialog: using that word now?
speaker_heading: RHODEY
dialog: He’s still got the stones.
speaker_heading: CAROL DANVERS
dialog: So, we take them. And we use them
dialog: to bring everybody back.
speaker_heading: BRUCE BANNER
dialog: Just like that?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah. Just like that.
text: No one speaks. Finally...
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: If there’s even the smallest chance
dialog: we can undo this, then we owe it to
dialog: everyone who’s not sitting here to
dialog: try.
text: Everyone looks around the room...AGREED.
speaker_heading: BRUCE BANNER
dialog: If we do this...why would it end
dialog: any differently than it did before?
dialog: 12
speaker_heading: CAROL DANVERS
dialog: Because before you didn’t have me.
speaker_heading: RHODEY
dialog: Hey, new girl. All of us in here
dialog: are about that superhero life.
dialog: Where’ve you been all this time?
speaker_heading: CAROL DANVERS
dialog: There’s a lot of people in the
dialog: universe. And they didn’t all have
dialog: you.
text: THOR STANDS. He crosses to Carol and holds out his hand.
text: STORMBREAKER WHIPS PAST HER HEAD, RUFFLING HER HAIR.
text: Carol doesn’t flinch. Thor smiles.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: I like this one.
text: Steve stares at the planet a long, deciding moment. Then...
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Let’s go get that son of a bitch.
speaker_heading: SLAM TO:

text: ROCKET looks around from the pilot’s chair.
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: Okay, who here hasn’t been to

speaker_heading: ROCKET (CONT'D)

scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - DAY

dialog: not back in fifteen, you’1l know I
dialog: found him.
scene_heading: INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - SPACE
text: OUR HEROES wait on the flight deck, tense.
text: NATASHA looks at STEVE, who’s staring at...A COMPASS: PEGGY

speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: This is going to work, Steve.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I know it will.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Because I don’t know what I’m going
dialog: to do if it doesn’t.
text: JUST THEN, CAROL FLIES UP TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS.
speaker_heading: CAROL DANVERS (OVER COM)
dialog: No satellites, no ships, no armies.
dialog: No ground defenses of any kind.
dialog: It’s just him.
speaker_heading: NEBULA

scene_heading: FIRE, GRABBING THANOS’ GAUNTLET...
text: PREVENTING THANOS FROM CLOSING HIS FIST.
text: Thanos jerks back as HULKBUSTER SPRINGS INSIDE. CAROL AND
text: RHODEY BASH THROUGH THE ROOF, PINNING THANOS’ ARMS.
text: THOR crashes through the door, followed by the others. HE
text: SWINGS STORMBREAKER...CUTTING OFF THANOS’ HAND.
text: The Gauntlet lands at Rocket’s feet. He picks it up...and
text: his face goes slack. He turns the glove toward the others.
text: And we now realize...THE INFINITY STONES ARE GONE.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Where are they?
text: Thanos doesn’t answer. CAROL PRESSES HIM TO HIS KNEES.
speaker_heading: CAROL DANVERS
dialog: Answer the question!
speaker_heading: THANOS
dialog: The universe required correction.
dialog: After that, the stones served no
dialog: purpose beyond temptation.
speaker_heading: BRUCE BANNER
dialog: You murdered trillions.
speaker_heading: THANOS
dialog: You should be grateful.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Where are the stones?
speaker_heading: THANOS
text: Gone. Reduced to atoms.
speaker_heading: BRUCE BANNER
dialog: You used them two days ago!
speaker_heading: THANOS
dialog: I used the stones to destroy the
dialog: stones. It nearly killed me.
dialog: But the work is done. It always
dialog: will be.
text: That lands, sickening. ROCKET SEARCHES, FRANTIC, NEAR TEARS.
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: No...they can’t be gone...
dialog: 15
speaker_heading: RHODEY
text: He’s lying.
speaker_heading: NEBULA

speaker_heading: ROCKET

text: STEVE ROGERS, thinner, older, LISTENS INTENTLY.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: What did you talk about?
speaker_heading: GRIEVING MAN
dialog: Same old crap. How much things
dialog: have changed. How much we miss the
dialog: Mets. My job, his job. Then it
dialog: got kind of quiet. He cried during
dialog: the salads.
speaker_heading: OLDER MAN
dialog: What about you?
speaker_heading: GRIEVING MAN
dialog: I cried just before dessert. But
dialog: I’m seeing him again tomorrow.
dialog: So...
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: That’s great. You’ve already done
dialog: the hardest part. You took a jump,
dialog: didn’t know where you’d come down.
dialog: And that’s it, those little brave
dialog: baby steps we’ve gotta take. To
dialog: try to make us feel whole again, to
dialog: find a purpose...
dialog: (to everyone)
dialog: I went into the ice right after I

speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: NEBULA (HOLO)

speaker_heading: ROCKET (HOLO)

speaker_heading: CAROL DANVERS (HOLO)

speaker_heading: ROCKET (HOLO)
dialog: And now we smell like garbage-
speaker_heading: NATASHA

speaker_heading: OKOYE (HOLO)
dialog: Minor subduction in the African

speaker_heading: NATASHA

speaker_heading: OKOYE (HOLO)

speaker_heading: CAROL DANVERS (HOLO)
dialog: Not likely.
speaker_heading: ROCKET (HOLO)
dialog: Getting another haircut?
speaker_heading: CAROL DANVERS (HOLO)
dialog: Listen, fur-face, I’m covering a
dialog: lot of territory out here. The
dialog: things that have been happening on
dialog: Earth have been happening
dialog: everywhere else. On thousands of
dialog: planets. You might not see me for
dialog: a long time.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: All right. Everybody keep keeping

dialog: always active. Anything goes
dialog: sideways, anyone makes trouble

speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s up? Where are you?
speaker_heading: RHODEY (HOLO)
dialog: Mexico. Got some news.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Okay...
speaker_heading: RHODEY
dialog: Federalés found a room full of

speaker_heading: NATASHA

speaker_heading: STEVE (0.S.)
dialog: I'd offer to cook you dinner but

text: Natasha turns to see STEVE in the doorway.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Come by to do your laundry?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: And see a friend.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Your friend’s fine.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: She leave the house today?
speaker_heading: NATASHA

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: NATASHA

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Sorry. Force of habit.
speaker_heading: NATASHA

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I guess I don’t know how not to.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Me, neither.
text: After a long moment, Steve looks up at her, honest.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I keep telling them, move on. Grow
dialog: past it. And some of them actually
dialog: do. But not us.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: If I move on, who does this?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Maybe it doesn’t need to be done.
text: Natasha takes that in. Steve is thinking of giving up. She
text: looks around at Avengers Compound.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I used to have nothing. Then I got
dialog: this. This job, this family. And
dialog: I was better because of it.
text: She chokes slightly, collecting herself.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT'D)
dialog: And even though they’re gone, I’m

speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG (ON SCREEN)
dialog: Hello? Is anyone home? This is,
dialog: uh, Scott Lang? We met a few years
dialog: ago. At the airport?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: This an old message?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: (stunned)
text: It’s the front gate.
scene_heading: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - NIGHT

speaker_heading: STEVE (0.S.)
dialog: Scott, are you okay?
speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG
dialog: What? Yes.
text: He turns to STEVE and NATASHA.
speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG (CONT'D)
dialog: Have either of you guys ever
dialog: studied quantum physics?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
text: Only to make conversation.
text: Steve glances at her. She shrugs.
speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG
dialog: Well, five years ago, just before
dialog: this Thanos guy...I went into a
dialog: place called the Quantum Realm.
dialog: It’s like its own microscopic
dialog: universe. You can only get there
dialog: if you're incredibly small. Hope,
dialog: she’s my...she was supposed to pull
dialog: me out. But then Thanos happened.
dialog: And I was stuck in there.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I’m sorry. It must’ve been a long
dialog: five years.
dialog: 24
speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG
dialog: (getting excited)
dialog: Okay, but that’s the thing. It
dialog: wasn’t. For me, it was only five
dialog: hours. The rules in the Quantum
dialog: Realm aren’t like out here.
dialog: They're completely unpredictable.
dialog: Is anybody gonna eat that sandwich?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Scott, what are you talking about?
speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG
dialog: Time works differently in the
dialog: Quantum Realm.
text: Steve and Natasha share a look.
speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG (CONT'D)
dialog: Problem is, right now, it’s chaos,
dialog: there’s no way to navigate it. But
dialog: what if we could figure out a way
dialog: to enter the Quantum Realm at a
dialog: certain point in time...and come
dialog: out in another. Like, before
dialog: Thanos—
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Wait...wait. Scott. Are you
dialog: talking about a time machine?
speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG
dialog: No, not a machine. More like a...
dialog: (searches, then gives up)
dialog: Yeah, like a time machine. I know
dialog: it sounds crazy...
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Scott, I get emails from a raccoon.
dialog: Nothing’s crazy anymore.

scene_heading: wearing A PURPLE-BLUE IRON MAN HELMET (RESCUE).
speaker_heading: MORGAN STARK
dialog: Define lunch or be disintegrated.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You should not be wearing that.

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I just want to thank you folks for

text: one gets to contemplate biting it
text: on an inter-dimensional timescape.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: You've got some objections to the
dialog: plan.
dialog: 26
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: So you're calling it a plan. To
dialog: me, it sounds like an exotic
dialog: suicide method. Not to mention,
dialog: it’s impossible.
speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG
dialog: We know what it sounds like.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Tony, after what you’ve seen, is
dialog: anything really impossible?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Quantum fluctuation kinda messes
dialog: with the Planck Scale, which then
dialog: triggers the Deutsch Proposition,
dialog: can we agree on that?
dialog: (offering more tea)
dialog: Chai?
dialog: (back on message)
dialog: In layman's terms, it means you can
dialog: cancel your Netflix subscription
dialog: because you’re not coming home.
speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Which was a billion-to-one cosmic
dialog: fluke. Now you want to pull a-
dialog: What are you calling it?
speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG
dialog: A time heist.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Oh, of course, a time heist, why
dialog: didn’t we think of this before?
dialog: Right, because it’s a pipe dream.
dialog: Who are you again?
speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG
dialog: Still Scott...
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Tony, the Stones exist in the past.
dialog: We could get them and bring them
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: We can snap our own fingers. We
dialog: can bring everybody back.
dialog: 27
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Or screw it up worse than he
dialog: already has.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I don’t believe we would.
text: Tony stares at Steve, a lot of water under the bridge.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Gotta say it. Sometimes I’ve
dialog: missed that giddy optimism. Sadly,
dialog: all your high hopes won’t help me
dialog: if there’s no logical, tangible way
dialog: for me to safely execute said “time
dialog: heist.” I believe the most likely
dialog: outcome would be our collective
dialog: demise.
speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG
dialog: Not if we strictly follow the rules
dialog: of time travel. No talking to our
dialog: past selves. No betting on
dialog: sporting events-
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Stop, Scott. Stop. Are you
dialog: telling me that your plan to save
dialog: the universe is more than loosely
dialog: based on Back to the Future?
speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG
dialog: (meaning “yes”)
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Good. Because that would be
dialog: horseshit. Scientifically
dialog: speaking, your brother's picture
dialog: doesn’t disappear just ‘cause you
dialog: went to the dance with your mom.
dialog: That’s not how quantum physics
dialog: works.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: We have to take a stand.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: We did stand. And yet here we are.
speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG
dialog: Look, Stark- Can I call you Tony?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Please don’t-
speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG
dialog: Tony-
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG
dialog: I get that you’ve got a lot on the
dialog: line, here. You’ve got a wife. A
dialog: daughter. But I lost someone very
dialog: important - a lot of us did - and
dialog: now we have a chance to save her,
dialog: and everyone else, and you won’t
dialog: even-
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: No, Scott. I won’t. Even.
text: Suddenly, MORGAN walks onto the porch.
speaker_heading: MORGAN STARK
dialog: Mommy told me to come save you.
text: Tony takes Morgan into his arms and heads inside.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Good job. I’m saved.
dialog: (to Steve)
dialog: I wish you were coming here to ask
dialog: me something else. I’m honestly
dialog: happy to see you. If you want to
dialog: stay-
text: Steve tries one last time.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Tony, I get it. And I’m happy for
dialog: you. I am. But this is a second
dialog: chance.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Yeah, well, I got my second chance
dialog: right here. I can’t roll the dice
text: on it. The table is set for six.

dialog: I wear shirts now!
speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG

speaker_heading: SMART HULK

dialog: 30
text: Smart Hulk eats a stack of pancakes in two bites.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: He’s heard.
speaker_heading: SMART HULK
dialog: It was worse for me. Because I
dialog: lost twice. First Hulk lost. Then
dialog: Banner lost. Then we all lost.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: No one blamed you, Bruce.
speaker_heading: SMART HULK
dialog: I did- I feel like I’m the only
dialog: one eating. Here, try some.
text: He holds out a pizza. They decline. He shrugs.
speaker_heading: SMART HULK (CONT'D)
dialog: Thing is, I kept thinking, it
dialog: didn’t have to be that way. That
dialog: the best of Banner and best of
dialog: Hulk, if they’d worked together,
dialog: maybe they could’ve stopped Thanos.
speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG
dialog: Okay. But how did...this happen?
speaker_heading: SMART HULK
dialog: For years I treated the Hulk like a
dialog: disease, something to get rid of.
dialog: But when I started treating him
dialog: like the cure...
text: Smart Hulk MESHES HIS FINGERS together.
speaker_heading: SMART HULK (CONT'D)

text: Natasha nods at his Smart Hulk-ness, history between them.
speaker_heading: NATASHA

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (getting out of the car)
text: EPR Paradox. Instead of pushing

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You did.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Thank god, I’m here. Regardless, I
dialog: fixed it.
text: He holds up...HIS STAR-SHAPED CAPACITOR.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Me, too.
text: Something eases between them, for the first time in years.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: We've got a shot at the Stones. I
dialog: just need you to know my

dialog: found, definitely. And, let’s not
dialog: die trying.
text: Steve looks at Tony. Finally, he offers his hand.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Sounds like a deal.
text: They shake. This is a long time coming. Finally...
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: But wait, there’s more. Act now,

text: Tony pops the trunk. Steve stares, moved, at...HIS SHIELD.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Tony, I don’t know-
dialog: 39
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What’s to know? He made it for
dialog: you. Plus, I gotta get it out of
text: the garage before Morgan takes it
text: sledding.
text: Steve finally picks up the shield, SLIDING IT ONTO HIS ARM.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Thank you, Tony.
text: Tony chokes up, then covers by slamming the trunk.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Just don’t flaunt it. I didn’t

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: ROCKET

speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG

speaker_heading: RHODEY

speaker_heading: SMART HULK

speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: Yeah, I’m sure that’s it. Kind of

speaker_heading: SMART HULK

speaker_heading: ROCKET

speaker_heading: VALKYRIE

speaker_heading: SMART HULK

speaker_heading: THOR

speaker_heading: SMART HULK

speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Don’t I look all right?
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: (under his breath)

speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: So, what’s up? Just here for a

speaker_heading: SMART HULK
dialog: We need your help. There’s a

speaker_heading: THOR

speaker_heading: SMART HULK

speaker_heading: SMART HULK (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, I know the thought of...that

speaker_heading: THOR

dialog: (looking around)
dialog: Anyone else here kill that guy?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: 44
speaker_heading: THOR (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SMART HULK

speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Was it Natasha?
speaker_heading: SMART HULK
dialog: It was you. You helped me. And I
dialog: need you to help me again.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Ask the Asgardians down there how
dialog: much “my help” is worth.
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: At least they’re alive-
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: They were gods! Now they’re
dialog: fisherpeople!

speaker_heading: SMART HULK

speaker_heading: THOR

speaker_heading: RONIN

speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG

speaker_heading: SMART HULK

speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG

text: Scott takes the tubes from him and inserts them, himself.
speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG (CONT'D)
dialog: These are Pym Particles. You can’t
dialog: shrink to the Quantum Realm without
dialog: them, and since Hank Pym got
dialog: snapped out of existence, we can’t
dialog: make any more. I told you. We’ve
dialog: only got enough for one round trip

text: Scott gently clicks the tubes into their housing.
speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG (CONT'D)
dialog: Plus two test runs—

speaker_heading: RHODEY
dialog: Hang on, I’ve got to ask, if we can
dialog: do this, why don’t we just go find
dialog: baby Thanos and, you know...
text: Rhodey makes a STRANGLING GESTURE.
speaker_heading: SMART HULK
dialog: Uh, one, because that’s horrible.
dialog: And, two, killing baby Thanos
dialog: doesn’t kill adult Thanos. Time

dialog: past.
speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG
dialog: Sure, we can. We take the stones

speaker_heading: NEBULA

speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON
dialog: I don’t know. That is kind of what

speaker_heading: SMART HULK
dialog: Heard from who?
speaker_heading: RHODEY
dialog: Star Trek. Terminator. Bill and
dialog: Ted’s Excellent-
speaker_heading: SMART HULK
text: WHY DOES EVERYONE THINK THIS?

scene_heading: PRESENT HAS BECOME THE PAST, WHICH

speaker_heading: NEBULA

speaker_heading: TONY

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Forgot about that one.

speaker_heading: Al STEVE

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah, I know...

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: ANCIENT ONE

speaker_heading: ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D)
dialog: The Infinity Stones create the

speaker_heading: ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ASTRAL BANNER
dialog: No. But it can erase it.
text: Astral Banner reaches in and grabs THE VIRTUAL TIME STONE.
speaker_heading: ASTRAL BANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Because once we're done with the
dialog: stones, we can return each one to
text: its own timeline. At the moment it
dialog: was taken. So chronologically, in
dialog: that reality, the stone never left.
text: HE PUTS THE TIME STONE BACK. THE BLACK TIMELINE DISAPPEARS.
speaker_heading: ANCIENT ONE
dialog: You're leaving out the most

speaker_heading: ANCIENT ONE

speaker_heading: ASTRAL BANNER

speaker_heading: ANCIENT ONE

speaker_heading: ASTRAL BANNER

dialog: Whoa, whoa. We don’t have any
dialog: other options. We can’t go to any
dialog: other times. No do-overs! We've
dialog: only got one particle left, each.
dialog: Use it now, that’s it, bye-bye, we
dialog: don’t come home.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: But if we don’t try, nobody else
text: comes home, either.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I got it! There’s another way to
dialog: re-take the Tesseract, and acquire
dialog: new particles.

dialog: 91
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: When were they both there?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I have a vaguely exact idea.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: How vague?
speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG
dialog: Hang on, what’s in New Jersey?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I know they were there, and I know
dialog: how I know.
text: STEVE STUDIES TONY A LONG MOMENT...
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Looks like we’re improvising.
speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG
dialog: Wait! What are you improvising?
text: STEVE HANDS SCOTT THE STAFF.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Scott, take this back to the

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: All right, suits on. Try these

speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG
dialog: Steve- Cap- Captain America, if you
dialog: do this and he’s wrong...you’re not
text: coming back.
text: Steve and Tony let the weight of that sink in. dHe’s right.
text: Even so, Tony turns to Steve.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You trust me?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I do.
text: THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER, THEN...CLICK. THEY BOTH HIT THEIR

text: He passes by AN ARMY BASE, throwing a peace sign to A GUARD.
speaker_heading: STAN LEE

scene_heading: EXT. CAMP LEHIGH - DAY (1970)
scene_heading: SOLDIERS MARCH PAST AS...
text: Tony and Steve round the corner, TONY IN A LAB COAT and STEVE
text: IN GREEN KHAKIS, LOW-PULLED CAP, AND MIRRORED SUNGLASSES.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: The idea of me was.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: All right. If I was SHIELD and I
dialog: wanted to hide my quasi-fascistic
dialog: black site, where would I hide it?
speaker_heading: STEVE
text: In plain sight.
text: Steve nods at A MAN IN A GRAY SUIT approaching a building,

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Good luck with that mission,

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Good luck with your project,

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Come on, you little hexahedron,
dialog: where are you hiding?
text: Finally, he spots A HIGH TECH SAFE. He grabs a briefcase,

text: It opens revealing...THE TESSERACT. Tony smiles.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: You may not know it now, but
dialog: someday you’re going to be a real

speaker_heading: HOWARD STARK (0.S.)

speaker_heading: HOWARD STARK
dialog: I know you?

text: He holds it out.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: No, sir. Just visiting from MIT.
speaker_heading: HOWARD STARK
dialog: That so? Got a name?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Howard...
speaker_heading: HOWARD STARK
dialog: Easy to remember-
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Potts.
speaker_heading: HOWARD STARK
dialog: I’m Howard Stark.
dialog: (shaking hands)
dialog: You seem a little green around the
dialog: gills, Potts. Need some air?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: That'd be swell.
text: Tony distractedly walks away, leaving the briefcase.
speaker_heading: HOWARD STARK
dialog: Need the briefcase?
scene_heading: PRE-LAP A RINGING PHONE...
scene_heading: INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, PYM’S LAB - DAY (1970)

speaker_heading: STEVE (OVER PHONE)
dialog: Dr. Pym?

text: PAN across the shelf to A CHART OF WASP MATURATION.
speaker_heading: STEVE (OVER PHONE)
dialog: This is Captain Stevens, from

scene_heading: KEEP PANNING to A PROTOTYPE ANT-MAN HELMET.
speaker_heading: HANK PYM (0.S.)
dialog: So bring it up.
speaker_heading: STEVE (OVER PHONE)
dialog: That’s the thing, sir, we can’t.
text: ARRIVE ON...HANK PYM (20's), in brown hair and lab coat.
speaker_heading: HANK PYM
dialog: Maybe I’m confused. Isn’t that
dialog: your job?
speaker_heading: STEVE (OVER PHONE)
dialog: It’s just...sir, the box is
dialog: glowing. And to be honest, a
dialog: couple of our mail guys aren’t
dialog: feeling great-
speaker_heading: HANK PYM
dialog: They didn’t open it, did they?!
scene_heading: INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, HALLWAY - DAY (1970)

speaker_heading: TONY

speaker_heading: HOWARD STARK

text: Tony puzzles the dates out in his head...
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Congratulations.
speaker_heading: HOWARD STARK
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: How far along is she?
speaker_heading: HOWARD STARK
dialog: Gee, I suppose...
dialog: (indicating)
dialog: ...-this far. She’s at the point
text: where she can’t stand the sound of
dialog: my chewing. So I guess I’1l be
text: eating in the pantry again.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I have a little girl.
dialog: 96
text: TONY SMILES. He’s talking about the man-he’s-talking-to’s
dialog: granddaughter, fifty years before she’s born.
speaker_heading: HOWARD STARK
dialog: A girl would be nice. Less chance
dialog: she'd turn out exactly like me.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Would that be so bad?
speaker_heading: HOWARD STARK
dialog: Let’s just say the greater good
dialog: hasn't always outweighed my own
dialog: self interest.
text: The elevator doors open.
scene_heading: INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, PYM’S LAB - DAY (1970)

dialog: 97
scene_heading: INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, HALLWAY - DAY (1970)
text: Steve exits Hank’s lab and heads for the elevator. But it
text: opens, revealing THE FEMALE AGENT FROM EARLIER, WITH AN M.P.
dialog: M.P.
dialog: You've never seen either of these
dialog: men before?
scene_heading: FEMALE SHIELD AGENT
dialog: No. But I have an eye for this.
dialog: Something looked fishy.
dialog: M.P.
dialog: Describe ‘fishy’.
scene_heading: FEMALE SHIELD AGENT
text: One of them had a hippie beard.
dialog: M.P.
dialog: We talking Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?
scene_heading: FEMALE SHIELD AGENT
dialog: Definitely Mungo Jerry.
dialog: M.P.
dialog: (over walkie-talkie)
dialog: This is Chesler. We need every

dialog: have a potential breach.
text: Steve ducks through the nearest door...
scene_heading: INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, PEGGY’S OFC. - DAY (1970)
text: Steve enters a darkened office. A glass wall separates it
text: from another bullpen.
text: Then he sees something on the desk. He stares, stunned, at
text: two photos: one features PEGGY CARTER STANDING WITH JFK.
text: THE OTHER IS OF SKINNY STEVE.
text: Steve turns the desk nameplate around: “MARGARET CARTER.”
text: Steve realizes that even twenty-five years later, Peggy never
dialog: forgot about him.
text: Just then, THE BULLPEN DOOR FLIES OPEN. LIGHTS SNAP ON,
text: revealing PEGGY CARTER (49), talking to someone in the hall.
speaker_heading: PEGGY CARTER
dialog: So, send them in.
dialog: 98
speaker_heading: MALE AGENT
dialog: They're trying, ma’am, but
text: Braddock’s unit has been stopped by
text: lightning strikes.
speaker_heading: PEGGY CARTER
dialog: Oh, for the love of- I’1ll find the
dialog: weather projections. You call
dialog: Braddock and tell him to shelter in
dialog: place. Assuming he’s bright enough
dialog: to come out of the rain.
speaker_heading: MALE AGENT (0.S.)
dialog: Yes, ma‘am.
text: Steve stares at her from the darkness, STUNNED.
text: Peggy rifles through a file cabinet.
speaker_heading: PEGGY CARTER
dialog: Here we are...
text: She flips through a file, reading. In the darkness behind
text: her, Steve approaches. Peggy reads something disturbing.
speaker_heading: PEGGY CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Crikey O'Reilly.
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Sergeant? Hang up and call Air
dialog: Command. Braddock needs back up,
dialog: immediately.
speaker_heading: MALE AGENT
dialog: Ma’ am?
speaker_heading: PEGGY CARTER
dialog: Those aren't lightning strikes he’s
dialog: looking at...
text: She slaps the file closed and hurries out.

scene_heading: EXT. CAMP LEHIGH - DAY (1970)
text: Howard and Tony approach a WAITING LIMO.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Got any names, yet?
speaker_heading: HOWARD STARK
dialog: If it’s a boy, my wife likes
dialog: Elmonzo.
dialog: 99
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You might let that stew a while.
dialog: You've got time.
speaker_heading: HOWARD STARK
dialog: What are you, couple years older
dialog: than me?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Yeah. I guess.
speaker_heading: HOWARD STARK
dialog: Let me ask you a question. When
dialog: your kid was born...were you
dialog: nervous?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Wildly.
speaker_heading: HOWARD STARK
dialog: Did you feel qualified? Like you
dialog: had any idea how to successfully
dialog: operate that thing?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I pieced it together as I went
dialog: along. I thought about what my dad
dialog: did...
speaker_heading: HOWARD STARK
dialog: My old man never met a problem he
dialog: couldn’t solve with a belt.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I tried to hold onto the good
dialog: stuff. Dad dropped the odd pearl,
dialog: here and there.
speaker_heading: HOWARD STARK
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: “No amount of money ever bought a
dialog: second of time.”
speaker_heading: HOWARD STARK
dialog: That’s good. Smart guy.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: He did his best.
dialog: 100
speaker_heading: HOWARD STARK
dialog: I tell you, this kid’s not even
dialog: here yet, but there’s nothing I
dialog: wouldn't do for him.
scene_heading: Tony takes this in, GRATIFIED. Just then...EDWIN JARVIS (56)
text: opens the limo door.
speaker_heading: HOWARD STARK (CONT'D)
dialog: Besides, if I fall down on the
dialog: fathering job, old Jarvis is ready
dialog: to pick up the slack. Isn’t that
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: EDWIN JARVIS
dialog: Indeed, sir. I shall endeavor to
dialog: teach the lad the rudiments of
dialog: judo.
text: Tony smiles at his old friend. As Jarvis gets in the car,
text: Tony notices...STEVE WAITING BEHIND A JEEP. TIME TO GO.
text: Howard turns to shake Tony’s hand.
speaker_heading: HOWARD STARK
dialog: Well, good to meet you, Potts.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You're going to do fine, Howard.
speaker_heading: HOWARD STARK
dialog: Thanks. See you around?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Count on it...
text: As he gets into his car, Howard looks to Jarvis.
speaker_heading: HOWARD STARK
dialog: Have we met him before?
speaker_heading: EDWIN JARVIS

speaker_heading: BAD NEBULA
dialog: You’re weak.
speaker_heading: NEBULA
dialog: I’m you-
speaker_heading: BAD NEBULA
dialog: Shut up!
scene_heading: BAD NEBULA PUNCHES GOOD NEBULA DOWN. GOOD NEBULA GROANS AS
scene_heading: BAD NEBULA RIPS OFF HER TIME-SPACE GPS.
text: THEN GAMORA ENTERS. Nebula softens, taking in her (once
dialog: dead) sister.
speaker_heading: NEBULA
dialog: You could stop this. You know you
dialog: want to.
dialog: (off Gamora’s look)
dialog: Did you see what happens in the
dialog: future? Thanos finds the Soul
dialog: Stone.
text: MOVE IN ON GAMORA, WHEELS TURNING...
speaker_heading: NEBULA (CONT'D)
dialog: You want to know how he does that?
dialog: You want to know what he does to
dialog: you-
speaker_heading: BAD NEBULA
speaker_heading: ENOUGH!
text: BAD NEBULA SMACKS HER THE HARDEST YET, THEN LEANS IN WITH A
text: JAGGED INSTRUMENT OF TORTURE.
speaker_heading: BAD NEBULA (CONT'D)
dialog: You disgust me...but that doesn’t
dialog: mean you’re useless.
text: SHE PRIES OFF THE ORANGE PANEL FROM GOOD NEBULA’S HEAD.
dialog: Gamora takes in this new development...
scene_heading: INT. SANCTUARY-2, THRONE ROOM - DAY
text: Bad Nebula enters to find Thanos on his throne. She hands
text: him Good Nebula’s TIME-SPACE GPS. He smiles.
dialog: 102
text: Bad Nebula affixes Good Nebula’s orange panel onto her head.
speaker_heading: BAD NEBULA
dialog: How do I look?
scene_heading: EXT. BENATAR - SPACE

scene_heading: EXT. VORMIR - DAY
text: Clint and Natasha eye THE BENATAR resting on a sand dune.

scene_heading: WHOOSH, THE ENTIRE SHIP DISAPPEARS. CLINT lifts THE SHRUNKEN
text: BENATAR and tucks it in his pocket.
text: CLINT AND NATASHA TREK ACROSS THE DUNES OF VORMIR,
text: TOWARD...THE MOUNTAIN.
scene_heading: EXT. VORMIR, MIDWAY UP THE MOUNTAIN - DAY
text: Natasha and Clint climb, ragged. They approach AN ARCHWAY.
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON
dialog: Really starting to regret my choice
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Yeah. I’m gonna bet the raccoon
dialog: didn’t have to climb a mountain.
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON
dialog: I don’t think technically he’s a
dialog: raccoon...
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Whatever. He eats garbage-
dialog: 103
text: THEY HEAR SOMETHING. THEY WHIRL, WEAPONS UP. A HOODED
scene_heading: FIGURE APPROACHES.
speaker_heading: HOODED FIGURE
dialog: I assure you, you have nothing to

speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON
dialog: Creepy.
speaker_heading: HOODED FIGURE
dialog: Welcome Natasha, daughter of Ivan.
dialog: Clint, son of Edith.
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON
dialog: Creepier.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: RED SKULL
dialog: Consider me a guide. To you, and
dialog: to all who seek the Soul Stone.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Great. You show us where it is,
dialog: and we'll be on our way.
text: The figure removes his hood, revealing...THE RED SKULL.
speaker_heading: RED SKULL
dialog: Oh, liebchen. If only it were that
dialog: easy...
scene_heading: EXT. VORMIR, MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY
text: START ON JAGGED ROCKS. TILT UP TO SEE SKULL, NATASHA, and
text: CLINT staring down from the ALTAR.
speaker_heading: RED SKULL
dialog: What you seek lies in front of you.
dialog: As does what you fear.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: The Stone is down there?
speaker_heading: RED SKULL
dialog: For one of you. For the other...
dialog: (smiling it away)
text: The Stone demands a sacrifice. In
dialog: order to take it, you must leave
dialog: behind that which you love.
dialog: 104
text: SKULL POINTS A BONY FINGER DOWN THE WELL.
speaker_heading: RED SKULL (CONT'D)
dialog: A soul for a soul.
text: Natasha and Clint stare down the well, stunned.
speaker_heading: TIME CUT:
text: RED SKULL STARES DOWN THE WELL, robes whipping in the wind.
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON (0.S.)
dialog: Maybe he’s full of shit.
text: FIFTY FEET AWAY, AT THE MONOLITHS, NATASHA AND CLINT HUDDLE.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I don’t think so.
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON
dialog: Why, because he knew your daddy’s
dialog: name?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I didn’t.
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: Thanos left here with the stone,
dialog: and without his daughter. You
dialog: really think that’s a coincidence?
text: They both look out at the well, heavy.
speaker_heading: NATASHA (CONT'D)
dialog: (under her breath)
dialog: Whatever it takes...
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Whatever it takes...
text: Natasha goes to Clint, resolved.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: If we don’t get the stone, billions
dialog: of people are going to stay dead.
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON
dialog: Then I guess we both know who it
dialog: has to be.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Yeah. Guess we do.
text: They take each other’s hand. A long goodbye beat. Except...
dialog: 105
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON
dialog: I'm starting to think we don’t mean
dialog: the same person.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: For the last five years, I’ve been
dialog: trying to do one thing -- get to
dialog: right here. This is all it’s been
text: about. Bringing everybody back.
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON
dialog: Do not get all decent on me-
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: You think I want to do it? I’m
dialog: trying to save your life, you idiot-
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON
dialog: And I don’t want you to.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Nat. You know what I’ve done.
dialog: What I am now. Your life’s worth
dialog: ten of mine-
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: I don’t judge people by their worst
dialog: mistakes-—
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON
dialog: Maybe you should-
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: You didn’t.
text: That stops him. He looks in her eyes, then down, giving in.
dialog: She
speaker_heading: OUT
speaker_heading: SHE
speaker_heading: SHE
speaker_heading: THE
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON
dialog: You're a pain in my ass, you know
dialog: that?

text: HER LEGS, PINNING HER DOWN.
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell my family I love them.
text: REVERSES, SENDING HIM TUMBLING.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Tell them yourself.
text: FIRES A WIDOW’S BITE INTO HIS CHEST AND MAKES A BREAK FOR
scene_heading: CLIFF. SHE’S HALFWAY THERE WHEN...
dialog: 106
text: BOOM! AN EXPLODING ARROW KNOCKS HER OFF HER FEET.
text: Clint races past her...leaping off edge of the cliff. Just
text: as he falls...
text: NATASHA TACKLES HIM IN MID-AIR. They drop, but NATASHA
text: SHOOTS HER GRAPPLING LINE INTO THE CLIFF.
text: THEY SLAM INTO THE CLIFFSIDE. She attaches the other end of
text: her grappling line to Clint’s belt...saving his life.
text: She slides, but he reaches out and grabs her...saving hers.
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON
dialog: Damn you.
text: They hang there a long, terrible moment. CLINT’S GRASP
text: STARTS TO LOOSEN. Finally, she looks him in the eye.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Let me go.
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON
dialog: No. Please no...
text: The two friends stare at each other, a lifetime between them.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: It’s okay...
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON
dialog: Natasha, no-
text: Then Natasha Romanoff kicks off the cliff wall, yanking out
text: of Clint’s grasp.
dialog: She falls...
text: Clint dangles from the grappling hook, staring down,
text: helpless, stifling his scream.
text: WHOOSH! THE WHOLE WORLD GOES WHITE.
scene_heading: EXT. VORMIR, BOTTOM OF THE MOUNTAIN - DAY
text: When the light fades, CLINT LIES FLOATING IN SPACE. The
text: camera rotates until we see...IT’S A REFLECTION OF THE SKY.
text: CLINT LIES IN THE POOL AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN. He sits
text: up and opens his hand to see THE SOUL STONE. His eyes well.
dialog: 107
scene_heading: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY
text: THE PENCIL FINALLY CLATTERS TO A STOP AS... WHOOSH, CLINT

scene_heading: RHODEY THE ORB, ROCKET & THOR THE EXTRACTION DEVICE, AND TONY
scene_heading: & STEVE THE TESSERACT. NEBULA RETRACTS HER TIME SUIT.

speaker_heading: RHODEY
dialog: Are you telling me that actually
dialog: worked?
speaker_heading: SMART HULK
dialog: Did we get them all?
text: CLINT DROPS TO HIS KNEES. Steve turns, concerned.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Clint? Are you okay?
text: Clint stares, haunted. SMART HULK realizes...
speaker_heading: SMART HULK
dialog: Where’s Nat?
dialog: (everyone stares)
dialog: WHERE’S NAT?!
text: Clint looks up at them, eyes glassy.
scene_heading: EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, RIVER - DAWN
text: SMART HULK, eyes red, stands beside a bench on the dock.
text: Behind him, STEVE, TONY, THOR, AND CLINT STARE OUT, GRIEVING.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Do we know if she had family?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah. Us.
text: Thor turns, thrown.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Why are you doing that?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I’m just asking a question-
dialog: 108
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Why are we talking as if she’s
dialog: dead? We have the stones. Bring
dialog: her back. C’mon, stop this shit.
text: Clint squeezes away tears.
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON
dialog: We can’t get her back.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: What’s he talking about? Of
dialog: course, we can.
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON
dialog: It can’t be undone. That’s why.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: No offense, but you’re...a very
dialog: earthly being. We're talking about
dialog: space magic, here. “Can’t” seems a
dialog: little definitive, don’t you think?
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON
dialog: Well, I know I’m a little outside
dialog: my pay grade here, but, she still
dialog: isn’t here, is she?
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: That's my point-
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON
dialog: It can’t be undone. At least
dialog: that’s what the red, floating guy
dialog: said. But why don’t you go talk to
dialog: him, okay? Why don’t you grab your
dialog: hammer and fly to that place and
dialog: talk to him. IT CAN’T BE UNDONE.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It was supposed to be me. She
dialog: sacrificed her life for that
dialog: goddamn stone. She bet her life on

text: That lands heavily on all of them. A moment passes.
text: THEN SMART HULK HURLS THE BENCH INTO THE WATER. It skips

speaker_heading: SMART HULK
dialog: She’s not coming back. We have to
dialog: make it worth it. We have to.
dialog: 109
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: We will.
text: PULL BACK, LEAVING OUR MOURNERS IN TABLEAU...
scene_heading: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY
text: ALL SIX INFINITY STONES rest behind safety glass. SOON,
text: ROBOTIC ARMS ENTER FRAME, PLUCKING UP THE POWER STONE.
text: TONY operates the arms as ROCKET and SMART HULK watch.
text: The robot arms swing the stone over to...A NEW IRON MAN
scene_heading: GAUNTLET. NANO-TECH SHIFTS AND SLIDES, HOLDING IT IN PLACE.
text: Smart Hulk releases a deep breath.
speaker_heading: TIME CUT:

text: SCOTT, THOR, CLINT, RHODEY, and STEVE watching TONY AND

speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: All right. The glove’s ready.
dialog: Question is, who’s gonna snap their
dialog: freaking fingers?
text: Everyone stares a beat. Then, THOR REACHES FOR THE GAUNTLET.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: I'll do it.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Whoa, whoa, what are you doing-
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Thor, we haven’t decided who's
dialog: putting that on.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Oh. Were all of you just waiting
dialog: for the right opportunity?
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: Maybe I was getting around to it-
speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG
dialog: We should at least discuss it-
dialog: 110
speaker_heading: THOR
text: Staring at the thing isn’t going to
dialog: bring everybody back, is it? Look,
dialog: I’m the strongest Avenger. It’s my
dialog: responsibility. Fate wills it so.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Hold on, hold on-
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Stop it! Let me do this. Let me
dialog: do something good. Something right-
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: That thing is channeling enough
dialog: energy to light up a continent.
dialog: You’re in no condition-
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: What do you think is coursing
dialog: through my veins right now?
speaker_heading: RHODEY
dialog: Cheez Whiz?
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Lightning.
text: Smart Hulk steps toward the Gauntlet.
speaker_heading: SMART HULK
dialog: Lightning won’t help you, pal.
dialog: It’s gotta be me.
dialog: (approaching)
dialog: You saw what those stones did to
dialog: Thanos. They almost killed him.
dialog: None of you could survive.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: And how do we know you can?
speaker_heading: SMART HULK
dialog: We don’t. But the radiation’s
dialog: mostly gamma.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It’s like I was made for this...
scene_heading: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY
text: THE QUANTUM TUNNEL LIES IN DARKNESS. Then, clack, the lights

text: NEBULA, STARING UP AT THE WAITING MACHINE.
dialog: 111
scene_heading: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY
text: SMART HULK STUDIES THE GAUNTLET. The moment of truth.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Good to go?
speaker_heading: SMART HULK
dialog: Let's do it.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Okay, remember, everyone Thanos
dialog: snapped away five years ago, you're
dialog: just bringing them back...to today.
dialog: Don’t change anything from the last
dialog: five years. Got it?
speaker_heading: SMART HULK
dialog: Got it.
text: PAN AROUND as the Avengers ready themselves:
text: STEVE steps forward, shield on his arm. SCOTT deploys his
text: helmet. RHODEY readies his repulsors.
text: ROCKET covers his raccoon junk and hides behind THOR. TONY
text: armors up, then nanos a shield to protect CLINT beside him.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Friday, why don’t you go ahead and
dialog: activate Barn Door Protocol?
text: STEEL DOORS SLIDE SHUT ALL AROUND THE WORKSHOP.
text: FINALLY, SMART HULK HOLDS UP THE GAUNTLET.
speaker_heading: SMART HULK
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Everybody’s coming home...
text: HE SLOWLY SLIPS HIS HAND IN THE GLOVE. SUDDENLY, HE SPASMS,
text: TAKING IN THE POWER AS THANOS DID IN ML1. HE STRUGGLES.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: What’s happening? Take it off,
dialog: take if off!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Bruce, you okay?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Talk to me, Banner.
dialog: 112
speaker_heading: SMART HULK
dialog: I’m...okay...
text: THEN SMART HULK REACHES OUT HIS HAND...AND SNAPS HIS FINGERS.
text: CRAAAACK! THE STONES FLARE. A BRIGHT SURGE OF ENERGY RACES
text: UP SMART HULK’'S ARM. HE ROARS AS HIS EYES BLAZE GREEN.
text: A BLAST WHITES OUT THE SCREEN.
scene_heading: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY
text: NEBULA studies THE QUANTUM CONSOLE. She takes off her glove,
text: revealing A PERFECTLY INTACT ARM. THIS IS BAD NEBULA.
text: SHE OPENS A PANEL IN HER ARM, SNAKES OUT A CABLE...AND JACKS
text: INTO THE CONSOLE. THE QUANTUM TUNNEL boots up.
text: AS SHE HURRIES AWAY...
scene_heading: EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND - DAY
text: FROM HIGH OVERHEAD, WE SEE THE TIME ENERGY SIGNATURE SHOOT
text: FROM THE HANGAR. AN OMINOUS RIPPLE WARPS ACROSS THE SKY...
scene_heading: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY
text: WHOOSH! EVERYTHING COMES BACK INTO VIEW. THE GAUNTLET FALLS
text: OFF, ROLLING ACROSS THE FLOOR.
text: SMART HULK COLLAPSES, ARM WITHERED, SIDE BURNT BLACK.
text: EVERYONE RUSHES OVER. Steve checks Smart Hulk’s pulse.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Bruce!
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Don’t move him!
text: Then THE BLAST DOORS OPEN, revealing the sound of...CHIRPING.
text: SCOTT walks toward the courtyard.
text: Smart Hulk’s eyes clear. He grasps Steve’s arm.
speaker_heading: SMART HULK
dialog: Did it work?
text: They pause, as if it only just now occurred to them.
text: JUST THEN...A CELL PHONE BUZZES.
dialog: 113
text: A STUNNED CLINT TURNS AND APPROACHES HIS PHONE. On the home

text: CLINT FINALLY PUTS THE PHONE TO HIS EAR.
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON
dialog: Honey?
text: AT THE WINDOW, SCOTT STARES AT A BIRD FEEDER. DOZENS OF

speaker_heading: SCOTT LANG

scene_heading: EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY
text: Nothing moves. The smoke clears, revealing...A BOMBED OUT
text: CRATER A MILE WIDE. Avengers Compound has been destroyed.
text: Then the light changes...AND THE SANCTUARY-2 parts the
text: clouds. It hovers over the ruins like a vulture.
text: AN ENERGY BEAM drops to the ground, releasing...
text: THANOS, FLANKED BY A SQUAD OF OUTRIDERS. The Mad Titan looks

speaker_heading: THANOS (INTO COM)
dialog: Daughter?
speaker_heading: BAD NEBULA (OVER COM)
dialog: Yes, father...
text: OUT OF THE SMOKE WALKS “BAD” NEBULA. Bruised and dirty.
speaker_heading: THANOS
dialog: So this is the future. Well done.
text: She tears off THE ORANGE HEAD-PLATE.
speaker_heading: BAD NEBULA
dialog: Thank you, Father. They suspected

speaker_heading: THANOS

speaker_heading: THANOS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BAD NEBULA

speaker_heading: THANOS

scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE, RUINS - DAY

speaker_heading: RHODEY (INTO COM) (CONT'D)
dialog: Mayday! Tony. Cap. Does anybody
dialog: hear me?!
text: HE FINALLY REACHES ROCKET. Rocket wheezes, in pain.
speaker_heading: RHODEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hang on!
text: RHODEY WEDGES A PIECE OF REBAR INTO THE DEBRIS. HE HEAVES,

speaker_heading: RHODEY (INTO COM) (CONT'D)

text: He opens his hand to find HIS CELLPHONE: HIS WIFE SMILES ON
text: THE SCREEN. “LAURA, ONE MISSED CALL.” Clint stares, amazed.
text: He winces, finding he’s been lying atop...THE GAUNTLET. It’s
text: bashed out of shape, BUT ALL SIX STONES STILL GLEAM.
speaker_heading: CLINT BARTON (INTO COM)
dialog: Cap? Stark? Anyone?
text: STATIC. Then, he hears...A SCRAPING SOUND, TALONS ON CEMENT.
text: He peers down a darkened tunnel, then unshoulders his bow.
text: HE LOOSES A FLARE ARROW, revealing...
text: DOZENS OF OUTRIDERS SCRABBLING ALONG THE WALLS AND CEILING.
text: CLINT GRABS THE GAUNTLET AND RUNS. THE CREATURES GIVE CHASE.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LAB, RUINS - DAY
text: FIRES SMOULDER BENEATH THE COLLAPSED CEILING. MOVE THROUGH
text: SMOKE TO FIND...STEVE, out cold. SOMEONE SHAKES HIM.

dialog: 116
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You lose this again, I’m keeping

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Told you. We messed with time.
dialog: Time messed back.
text: Woozy, Steve follows Tony through the ruins of the lab.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Where are the others?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I read life signs, maybe 800 feet
text: down, but it’s hard to tell.
text: They reach the edge of the crater where THOR LOOKS DOWN
text: AT...THANOS. Sitting on a rock. Waiting.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s he been doing?
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Absolutely nothing.
text: The three of them stare a long moment. Then, as if sensing
text: them, Thanos turns his head...AND LOOKS THEIR WAY.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Son of a bitch.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Where are the stones?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Somewhere under all of this. All I
dialog: know is...he doesn’t have ‘em.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: So we keep it that way.
dialog: That lands. This is their chance.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: You know it’s a trap.
text: TONY DEPLOYS HIS ARMOR.
dialog: 117
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Don’t think I care.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Just so we're all in agreement.
text: Thor holds out his hand: MJOLNIR FLIES INTO IT. He holds out

speaker_heading: THOR (CONT'D)

text: TONY APPROACHES, WARY, AS IF SNEAKING UP ON A RABID DOG.
text: STEVE AND THOR FAN OUT ON EITHER SIDE.
speaker_heading: THANOS (CONT'D)
dialog: I thought by eliminating half of
dialog: life, the other half would thrive.
dialog: But you’ve shown me that’s
dialog: impossible.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Life clings to the past with bloody
dialog: fingernails. As long as there are
dialog: those who remember what was, there
dialog: will be those unable to accept what
dialog: can be. They will resist.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Yep. We’re all kinds of stubborn.
speaker_heading: THANOS
dialog: I’m thankful. Because now I know
dialog: what I must do.
text: Thanos reaches for his helmet.
speaker_heading: THANOS (CONT'D)
dialog: I will shred this universe down to

speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 118
speaker_heading: THANOS (CONT'D)
dialog: And then, with the stones you've
dialog: collected for me, create a new one,
dialog: teeming with life that knows not

dialog: universe.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Born out of blood.
text: Thanos studies Steve as if seeing him for the first time.
speaker_heading: THANOS
dialog: They'll never know it.
text: THANOS DRAWS A BLADE OFF HIS BACK, TOWERING OVER THEM.
speaker_heading: THANOS (CONT'D)
dialog: Because you won’t be alive to tell
dialog: them.
text: Tony glances over at Steve. Ready? Steve nods...
text: JUST AS THOR CHARGES THANOS. WHAM! ALL THREE AVENGERS

speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: In the future...what happens to you

speaker_heading: NEBULA

speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: That’s hard to believe.
dialog: 119
speaker_heading: NEBULA
dialog: A lot of things that happen will be
dialog: hard to believe.
text: Gamora nearly smiles. She takes a long look at Nebula.
text: Finally...SHE HOLDS OUT HER HAND.
speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: Come on. We can still stop him.
text: Nebula takes a deciding moment. Then SHE GRABS GAMORA’S

scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE, RUINS - DAY

speaker_heading: SMART HULK

speaker_heading: ROCKET

speaker_heading: GAMORA

speaker_heading: NEBULA

speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: Sister, listen to her-
speaker_heading: BAD NEBULA
dialog: Shut up. You're a traitor!
speaker_heading: NEBULA

speaker_heading: BAD NEBULA

text: THANOS KNOCKS TONY ASIDE, THEN SQUEEZES THE CRUSHED GAUNTLET,
text: POPPING IT OPEN...JUST WIDE ENOUGH TO PUT HIS HAND INSIDE.
text: STEVE LUNGES, BUT THANOS THROTTLES HIM. FINALLY CLEAR,
text: THANOS SLIPS ON THE GAUNTLET. BUT BEFORE HE CAN SNAP...
text: CAROL ARRIVES. SHE GRABS THE GLOVE, PREVENTING HIM FROM

text: CAROL PRESSES THANOS DOWN, BUT BEFORE HE FALLS...
text: THANOS PULLS THE POWER STONE FROM ITS HOUSING AND PUNCHES

text: Tony gets to his knees, realizing...
dialog: The Avengers are going to lose.
text: ACROSS THE FIELD...WATER STARTS TO SPILL INTO THE CRATER.
text: STRANGE TRIES TO HOLD IT BACK...BUT IT’S A LOSING BATTLE. He

scene_heading: HIS ATOMS DISSOLVE. FINALLY, THANOS DISAPPEARS.

speaker_heading: PETER PARKER
dialog: Mr. Stark...Tony...it’s okay, it’s
dialog: okay...Mr. Stark, we won. You did

speaker_heading: TONY (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, death at any time is

dialog: thing we’re going to try to pull

speaker_heading: THOR

speaker_heading: VALKYRIE

speaker_heading: THOR
