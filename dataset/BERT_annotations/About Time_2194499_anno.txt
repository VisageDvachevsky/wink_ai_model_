text: ARE PASSED BY ANOTHER FAMILY MEMBER, WHO THE CAMERA THEN
text: FOLLOWS. ONE FLOWING MORNING IN THEIR RAMBLING SEA-SIDE HOME.
speaker_heading: TIM (V.O.)
dialog: I always knew we were a fairly odd
dialog: family.
dialog: First there was me - too tall, too
dialog: skinny, too orange - unfortunate
dialog: hair.
dialog: My mum was lovely, but not like
dialog: other mums - there was something
dialog: solid about her, something
dialog: rectangular - her fashion icon was
dialog: the Queen Mother - I never remember
text: her not in tweed.
dialog: Dad, well, he was more normal. He
dialog: always seemed to have time on his
dialog: hands - after giving up teaching
dialog: university students on his 50th
dialog: birthday, was always available for
dialog: a leisurely cup of tea, or to let
dialog: me win at table tennis once more.
dialog: Then there was Mum’s brother, Uncle
dialog: D. Always impeccably dressed, he
dialog: spent the days just, well, being
dialog: Uncle D. He was the same age as Mum
dialog: but by the time I was 8, he was
dialog: really my younger brother.
dialog: And then finally, there was
dialog: Catherine, Katie, Kit Kat. Ina
dialog: household of suits and hair cuts,
dialog: there was this - what can I call
dialog: her - nature thing. With her big
text: oval eyes, her wild hair, her
text: purple t-shirts, her torn jeans and
dialog: her eternally bare feet - she was
dialog: then and still is, to me, about the
dialog: most wonderful thing in the world.
dialog: All in all - it was a pretty good
dialog: childhood - full of repeated
dialog: rhythms and patterns - charades in
dialog: the winter, with me always losing -

dialog: croquet with Uncle D every summer -
dialog: and by the time I was 21, we were

scene_heading: THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE - ALL OF THEM IN DECKCHAIRS. IT STARTS
scene_heading: TO DRIZZLE —- AND UP GO SIX UMBRELLAS - NO-ONE MOVES. KIT KAT

scene_heading: MIXTURE OF YOUNG PEOPLE, OLD PEOPLE AND CHILDREN. THERE'S ONE
scene_heading: YOUNG MAN DANCING WITH PECULIAR, UNWARRANTED CONFIDENCE -
text: TIM’S FRIEND JAY. WE SEE TIM SORT OF SMILING HOPEFULLY AT A
scene_heading: PRETTY GIRL - SHE IGNORES HIM IN FAVOUR OF A HANDSOMER GUY.
text: HE ENDS UP DANCING WITH A GIRL TWICE HIS SIZE, POLLY - SHE,
text: IN CONTRAST, GIVES HIM A VERY WELCOMING SMILE.
text: KIT KAT IS TALKING TO A TOO GOOD LOOKING LOUCHE YOUNG MAN.
text: CUT ON - TIM IS JUST TRYING TO GET THROUGH THE NIGHT -—
scene_heading: AVOIDING DRUNK PEOPLE. ONE PERSON NUDGES A TABLE AND 27 WINE

text: SUDDENLY IT IS MIDNIGHT - A BIG COUNTDOWN TO THE BIG MOMENT.
text: TIM FINDS HIMSELF NEAR THE NOW RATHER DRUNK POLLY - SHE MOVES
text: TOWARDS HIM, LEANING IN FOR A NEW YEAR KISS. HE PANICS.
text: DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. FINALLY, ON THE DOT OF MIDNIGHT, AS
text: ALL AROUND HIM EVERYONE IS KISSING, HE JUST TAKES HER HAND

speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Happy New Year. Sorry.
scene_heading: THEY LOOK AROUND - EVERYONE ELSE IS KISSING. KIT KAT IS

scene_heading: A SWEET 23 YEAR OLD, TEDDY, HAS SWEPT HIS PRETTY 10 YEAR OLD
text: SISTER, AMBER, OFF HER FEET, KISSING HER ON THE CHEEK.
text: AS TIM HOLDS POLLY'S HAND, WE SEE A TEAR APPEAR IN THE CORNER
scene_heading: OF HER EYE. FOR HER, IT’S A PROFOUNDLY SAD MOMENT - NO-ONE
text: LOVES HER. SHE WALKS AWAY. TIM IS MORTIFIED. SHAKES HIS HEAD.
text: BAD START TO THE YEAR.
scene_heading: INT. TIM’S BEDROOM. MORNING. 3
text: A WIDE WINDOW OVERLOOKS THE CAMOMILE LAWN AND THEN THE SEA.
speaker_heading: TIM (V.O.)
dialog: And so I woke up the next morning,
dialog: hung over, ashamed of myself and
dialog: not realising it was the day that
dialog: would change my life forever.
text: KIT KAT ENTERS IN THE PURPLE T-SHIRT SHE SLEEPS IN.
speaker_heading: KIT KAT
dialog: Wake up, Stupid. Dad wants you.
scene_heading: INT. DAD'S STUDY. MORNING. 4
scene_heading: TIM OPENS THE DOOR AND ENTERS - IT'S A BIG OLD FASHIONED
scene_heading: STUDY - BOOKS AND RECORDS LINE THE WALL MASSIVELY - WHERE
text: THERE AREN'T BOOKSHELVES, THERE ARE PAINTINGS OF OLD
text: RELATIVES. AGAIN, VIEW OUT ON TO CRAGGY TREES AND THE
scene_heading: ENORMOUS SEA BEHIND.
scene_heading: HIS DAD IS A FAMILIAR, LIVED IN, QUITE FORMAL MAN. DEEPLY
scene_heading: CIVILIZED AND ATTRACTIVE.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Ah, Tim, come in... Do sit down.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: This is all very formal.
scene_heading: THEY HAVE A PRETTY GOOD RELATIONSHIP - IRONIC AND FAMILIAR,
text: EVEN IF NOT COMPLETELY CLOSE.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Well, yes, ahm, this is an odd
dialog: moment for me - because I had
dialog: exactly the same moment with my
dialog: Father, when I’d just turned 21 -
dialog: and after it, my life was never the
dialog: same - so, I approach it pretty
dialog: nervously.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Okay - when you're ready. All very
dialog: mysterious.
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
scene_heading: AN ODD PAUSE.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Alright. Right. Tim - my dear son -
dialog: the simple fact is that the men in
dialog: this family have always had the
dialog: ability to... This is going to
dialog: sound strange. Be prepared for
dialog: strangeness. But there’s this
dialog: family secret - and the secret is
dialog: that all the men in the family can -
dialog: travel in time.
speaker_heading: (HEADING ON FAST)
dialog: Well, more accurately, travel back
dialog: in time. I mean, once we’ve
dialog: travelled back, we can of course
dialog: travel forward back to the present,
dialog: but we can't travel into the future
dialog: from now.
text: CUT BACK TO TIM. HE IS PERFECTLY STILL. THEN...
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: This is such a weird joke...
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: It’s not a joke.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: It’s got to be a joke.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: It’s seriously not a joke.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: So you're saying that you, and
dialog: granddad, and his brothers... could
dialog: all travel back in time?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: And you still do?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Okay - if it’s true - which it
dialog: isn’t...
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Although it is...
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Although it isn’t, obviously. But
dialog: if it was, which it’s not...
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Which it is...
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Which it isn’t - but if it was, how
dialog: would I actually..?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: The 'how’ is the easy bit in fact.
dialog: You go into a dark place - big
dialog: cupboards very useful generally -
dialog: toilets at a pinch - then you
dialog: clench your fists like this, think
dialog: about the moment you’re going to,
dialog: and you'll find yourself there.
text: After a bit of a stumble and a
text: rumble and a tumble.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: .»..is as good a reaction as any. I
dialog: think I plumped for 'fuck'. But it
dialog: was the 80s.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Do you mind if I just take a few
dialog: moments to think about it?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Please do. I’1l just be here.
text: TIM HEADING OUT.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: No - no - this is so obviously just
dialog: a joke.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: It’s not. Why would I lie?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Okay. Well, I mean, there’s
dialog: obviously only one way to settle
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Yes. Obviously.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: But when I come back downstairs -
text: after standing in a cupboard with
dialog: my fists clenched - you’re going to
dialog: be in so much trouble. I mean it.
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Let’s see, shall we? And Tim... Try
dialog: to do something useful. You want
dialog: the first time to be interesting at
dialog: least.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: So much trouble. I mean it. Really.
scene_heading: INT. TIM’S BEDROOM. DAY. 5
text: TENSE MUSIC. TIM ENTERS HIS BEDROOM CUPBOARD CEREMONIOUSLY.
text: THEN CLOSES HIS EYES, CLENCHES HIS FIST. THEN SOMETHING
scene_heading: HAPPENS. A TINY VISION OF THE TIME BEING PASSED THROUGH - A
text: FEW RANDOM IMAGES, LIKE TRAVELLING THROUGH A TIME TUNNEL. CUT
scene_heading: OUTSIDE INTO HIS BEDROOM. IT IS NIGHT - TIM STEPS OUT -
text: DRESSED AS HE WAS FOR THE NEW YEAR'S PARTY.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN HALL. NIGHT. 6
text: TIM WALKS DOWN THE STAIRS - UTTERLY STUNNED BY THE
text: STRANGENESS OF LIVING SOMETHING FOR THE SECOND TIME.
speaker_heading: FRIEND JAY
dialog: You okay, Tim?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Yes. Good, good.
text: HE CUNNINGLY STOPS THE SPILLAGE OF THE 27 WINE BOTTLES HE
text: REMEMBERS FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE.
text: HE SEES KIT KAT LOCK EYES WITH THE NASTY HANDSOME BOY SHE WAS
scene_heading: LATER KISSING.
text: CUT FORWARD TO MIDNIGHT. THE SAME MOMENT AT THE PARTY WHEN HE
text: FAILED TO KISS POLLY. AND INSTEAD OF SHAKING HER HAND - HE
text: NOW KISSES HER. IT MAKES HER SO HAPPY.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: Thank you, Tim.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: You're welcome, Polly.
text: AND HE HEADS OFF INTO A DARK ROOM, OFF THE PARTY ROOM...
scene_heading: INT. TIM’S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 7
text: HE’S BACK IN THE CUPBOARD AGAIN. HE LOOKS AT HIS WATCH - HIS
text: CLOTHES. YES, HIS LIFE HAS UTTERLY CHANGED. HE STEPS OUT OF
text: THE CUPBOARD, DAZED. AT WHICH MOMENT, POLLY COMES IN FROM THE
text: BATHROOM. SHE IS WEARING JUST A TOWEL...
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: I've actually never done this
dialog: before.
text: TIM, IN TOTAL SHOCK ALREADY, IS JOLTED INTO TOTAL SHOCK
text: NUMBER TWO. AN ALMOST NAKED STRANGE GIRL IN HIS BEDROOM.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: But then no-one has ever really
dialog: kissed me before - so I thought, if
dialog: I'm going to lose my virginity with
dialog: someone, it might as well be you.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Great news.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: I told Mum I was going to stay at
dialog: Shirley's - so we've got all night.
speaker_heading: This (HER BODY) is yours for 12
dialog: hours. Do with it as you will, Tim
dialog: Lake.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Great. Great. Will you just give me
dialog: one second?
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: Of course - ‘man stuff’.
text: HE GOES INTO THE BATHROOM, SWITCHES OFF THE LIGHT, CRUNCHES
text: HIS FIST - AND GOES BACK TO THE NEW YEAR'S PARTY.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN HALL / BEDROOM. NIGHT. 8
text: MIDNIGHT AGAIN. AND ONCE AGAIN TIM SHAKES HER HAND. THE TEAR
text: FALLS FROM HER EYE AGAIN.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I really AM sorry.
text: AND THEN TIM ARRIVES BACK IN HIS BEDROOM. STEPS OUT. HIS LIFE
text: IS UTTERLY CHANGED.
scene_heading: INT. FATHER’S STUDY. DAY. 9
text: HE HEADS DOWN INTO HIS DAD'S STUDY - OPENS THE DOOR - OPENS
scene_heading: HIS ARMS IN AMAZEMENT —- ‘WHAT THE HELL’ - DAD SHRUGS HIS

scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
dialog: 10
dialog: 11
dialog: 8.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH. DAY. 10
text: CUT TO TIM WALKING ALONG THE BEACH - PASSIONATE, UNFOLDING
text: MUSIC. HE IS LOST IN HIS THOUGHTS AND AMAZEMENT.
scene_heading: INT. DAD'S STUDY. EVENING. 11
text: TIM IS BACK IN THE STUDY WITH HIS DAD. FULL OF URGENT
scene_heading: QUESTIONS NOW.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Does Mum know?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Not a whistle.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Strange. And what about the
dialog: whole. .?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Butterfly effect thing - what can I
dialog: say, we don't seem to have messed
dialog: up civilization yet...
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: It’s going to be a complicated
dialog: year.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: It’s going to be complicated life.
dialog: Any ideas how to use it?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Well, it’s going to take a lot of
dialog: thinking about - what have you
dialog: done... with it?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: For me it’s books, books, books.
dialog: I've read everything a man could
dialog: hope to. Twice. Dickens three
dialog: times. And music of course.
dialog: (GESTURES TO ALL HIS
speaker_heading: RECORDS )
dialog: And then, I've got to spend more
dialog: time with you and the family. What
dialog: are you thinking?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Well, apart from changing this
dialog: haircut, money would be the obvious
dialog: thing.
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
dialog: 12
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Very mixed blessing. Utterly fucked
dialog: up your grandfather's life - left
dialog: him without love or friends. I've
dialog: never bumped into a genuinely happy
dialog: rich person.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: But it would be nice not to have to
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: No - that’s a real recipe for
dialog: disaster. Look what happened to
dialog: your Uncle Fred.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: What happened to Uncle Fred?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Nothing. Absolutely sod all. Wasted
dialog: his life. You have to use it for
dialog: things that will really make your
dialog: life how you want it to be.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Well. I suppose, to be honest, for
dialog: the moment, I really just hope it's
dialog: going to get me a girlfriend.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Wow. Big one.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Yup - the mothership.
speaker_heading: TIM (V.O.)
dialog: For me, it was always going to be
dialog: all about love. Of course - there
dialog: were some old scores to be
dialog: settled....
scene_heading: INT. LECTURE HALL. DAY. 12
scene_heading: TIM’S HAIR IS A BIT DIFFERENT - IT’S A YEAR BACK, HIS FINAL
text: MOMENT AT UNIVERSITY. A SLOUCHY ARROGANT TUTOR ADDRESSES THE
scene_heading: SMALL CLASS.
speaker_heading: TUTOR
dialog: Well, we draw near the close of
dialog: your ignominious time here. I wish
dialog: you all the best, although I fear
dialog: the worst. God help the legal
dialog: system if you lot are entering it.

dialog: 14
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: TUTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes, Lake, what is it?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Can I just say, sir, on behalf of
dialog: all of us, that we also wish you
dialog: the best - but fear the worst.
dialog: You’re the worst teacher any
dialog: student has ever had - you’re not
dialog: only stupid, you’re arrogant,
dialog: aggressive, sleazy and wouldn’t
dialog: recognise an original thought if it
dialog: gave you a tender and caring blow-
dialog: job.
speaker_heading: TUTOR
dialog: You are in such trouble, young man.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Or not. Excuse I’m just popping to

scene_heading: INT. TIM’S ROOM. DAY. 13
text: TIM IS CASUALLY DRESSED FOR THE DAY, BAGGY TROUSERS, OLD
scene_heading: SHORT-SLEEVED SHIRT.

scene_heading: KIT KAT’S LITTLE PURPLE CAR ENTERS THE DRIVE - TIM MOOCHES
text: OUT OF THE HOUSE - AND OUT OF THE CAR STEPS THE MOST
scene_heading: BEAUTIFUL GIRL HE HAS EVER SEEN. SLOW MOTION AND MUSIC AS

speaker_heading: KIT KAT
dialog: Charlotte, this is Tim.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: No it’s not. Excuse me.
text: TIM RUNS INTO THE HOUSE. RUSHES INTO A CUPBOARD. GRIPS HIS
scene_heading: FISTS. RUSHES UPSTAIRS. TRIES ON FOUR DIFFERENT OUTFITS -
text: TRIES TO LOOK COOL IN EACH OF THEM. SHAVES. EVEN CUTS HIS
text: HAIR A TINY BIT. PLUCKS HIS NOSE. AND THEN HEADS DOWNSTAIRS
text: AND TRIES TO LOOK CASUAL AS THE CAR PULLS UP. OUT STEPS
scene_heading: CHARLOTTE, PARADISE AGAIN.
speaker_heading: KIT KAT

scene_heading: SECONDS EARLIER.
speaker_heading: DAD

text: TIM JUMPS IN...
speaker_heading: TIM

text: TIM SCRATCHES HIS HEAD. WHAT HAPPENED THERE?
speaker_heading: TIM (V.O.)
dialog: It was the summer from heaven - it

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Ask away. O no - wait - it's not
dialog: going to be about love is it?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Kit Kat warned me about this and

speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Okay. Okay. Last night a bad idea?
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Last night a very bad idea - seems

speaker_heading: TIM

speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, obviously, this was going to
dialog: happen, because you’re the
dialog: prettiest girl in history with the
dialog: prettiest face and the prettiest
dialog: hair... but even if, you know, you
dialog: didn’t have the face and you had,
dialog: absolutely no hair for some bizarre
dialog: reason, I’d still adore you - not
dialog: in a schoolboy way, in a really
dialog: profound adult but not threatening
dialog: way, and I just wondered whether by
dialog: any chance you might share my
dialog: feelings?
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Wow. Ahm. I tell you what. Why
dialog: don’t you ask me again on my last
dialog: night?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Your last night.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE

scene_heading: EXT. FAMILY HOME. DAY. 21

text: GENTLY AS THE CAR MOVES INTO THE DISTANCE.
speaker_heading: TIM (V.O.)
dialog: And so the love of my life drove,

speaker_heading: TIM

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: (PASSING A PHOTO)
dialog: You wouldn't like her at first -
dialog: sarcastic cow - but eventually
dialog: you'd realize she was the best

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Is that bad?
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Well, I don't know, but I would've
dialog: thought that was quite bad -
dialog: because no-one wants to sleep with
dialog: their mother - so if someone's got
dialog: your mother's name, that's got to
dialog: be an initial turn off, initially.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: That's never occurred to me.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: No. Well, good. It'd be worse if I
dialog: looked like your mother. Unless
dialog: your mother's very beautiful.
speaker_heading: TIM
text: She's not. She’s rectangular.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Good. Or bad - for your Dad. I'm
dialog: sorry for your Dad, but glad for

speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: TIM

speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: TIM

speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: MARY / JOANNA
dialog: She is / I am

speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Really?

scene_heading: UNDER THE NAME ‘MARY X'.
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)

scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z

speaker_heading: PAUSE.

speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Really. Until - and this is the
dialog: crucial plot point, I think - until
dialog: the lead actor had the most massive
dialog: freeze in the history of theatre.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yes. He didn't just forget his
dialog: lines. He forgot his lines to an
dialog: extent that no actor has ever
dialog: forgotten his lines before in the
dialog: annals of dramatic art. In the
text: crucial courtroom scene. The
dialog: reviews won't say “Major
dialog: Masterpiece Gets Unveiled” -
dialog: they'll say “Major Actor Gets
dialog: Alzheimers”.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: It's a disaster?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Is an understatement. It's a
dialog: catastrophe. It's the Titanic of
text: play openings. No survivors.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Okay. I'll see what I can do.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What the fuck do you mean ‘what you
dialog: can do?’ - what you going to ring
dialog: up every critic and offer them a

speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Yes, I'm afraid I'm rather busy at
dialog: the moment.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Yes, I appreciate that. It's just,
dialog: I thought - ahm, how's it going
dialog: with the lines?
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: 'The lines' - what do you mean 'the
dialog: lines'?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: It's just - you know - in the court
dialog: scene - some of those lines are
dialog: pretty complex - I thought it might
dialog: be worth just, you know, having one
dialog: last look at the lines before you
dialog: go on - a little refresher...
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Get the fuck out of here, you
text: sodding lunatic.

dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: I have been alive many weary years -
dialog: but never, in that long catalogue

speaker_heading: SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: I rest my case.
scene_heading: THE AUDIENCE ACTUALLY APPLAUDS THIS TOUR DE FORCE. TIM
text: APPLAUDS LOUDEST, LOOKING ROUND, UTTERLY DELIGHTED.
speaker_heading: JUDGE

scene_heading: A SLIGHTLY YOUNGER ACTOR - 55 - STANDS. ANOTHER LONG PAUSE.

text: TRY TO HELP...
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Does my honourable friend mean to

speaker_heading: FORGETFUL ACTOR
dialog: Yes. I do.

scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z

speaker_heading: FORGETFUL ACTOR
dialog: Nevertheless.
speaker_heading: (HUGE PAUSE)
dialog: No, it's gone.

speaker_heading: VOICE (0/S)

speaker_heading: FORGETFUL ACTOR

dialog: Do the Prosecution have anything
dialog: final to add?
scene_heading: THE FORGETFUL ACTOR STANDS. BUT IT'S THE SAME PAUSE. AT FIRST
scene_heading: DRAMATIC, THEN WORRYING.
text: CUT TO HARRY IN HIS SEAT. HE KNOWS SOMETHING IS WRONG. WE
text: SORT OF NOTICE THAT TIM DOESN'T SEEM TO BE IN HIS SEAT.
text: BACK ON STAGE WITH THE ACTOR. TOTAL FEAR IN HIS EYES. THE
text: OTHER ACTORS NERVOUS AROUND HIM.
text: THEN HE HEARS A COUGH. IT REGISTERS IN HIS EYES. THEN A
text: ‘PSST' - AND HE LOOKS OFF STAGE FOR A MOMENT - AND THERE,
text: STANDING IN THE WINGS, CARRYING HUGE CARDBOARD CUE CARDS,
text: WITH THE SPEECH WRITTEN IN BLACK FELT PEN, IS TIM.
scene_heading: JUST IN TIME - BEFORE IT REALLY IS A NOTICEABLE DRY - THE
scene_heading: ACTOR BEGINS TO SPEAK. SPEAK, AND READ, THAT IS - WEAVING HIS
text: MOVEMENTS AND PACE TO FACE TIM AND GIVE HIM TIME TO FLIP THE
text: CARDS. IT'S A CRACKING SPEECH.
speaker_heading: FORGETFUL ACTOR
dialog: Gentlemen. I regard today's
text: proceedings with utmost gravity.
dialog: All the more so because a man's
dialog: life is at stake. Nevertheless let
dialog: us be clear of one thing - it is
dialog: the life of A Guilty Man...
text: CUT TO THE END OF THE PLAY. HUGE APPLAUSE. STANDING OVATION -

dialog: 39
dialog: 32.
text: THE AUDIENCE TURNS TO HARRY WHO COULDN'T BE MORE SCORNFUL OF
text: THE PRAISE. AND DELIGHTED BY IT.
text: CUT INTO THE BAR AFTERWARDS. HARRY IS THE BLAZING CENTRE OF
text: ATTENTION. OUTSIDE THE RING OF FANS HE SPOTS TIM.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: O look - and here's the little
text: prick who walked out half way
dialog: through. You missed the best scene,
dialog: you twerp.
text: TIM WANDERS OFF ALONE. HE TAKES OUT HIS PHONE. GOES TO THE
scene_heading: ADDRESS BOOK, TYPES IN 'M' THEN 'A'. THERE ARE 'MARYS' - BUT
text: THERE'S NO 'MARY X'. SHE'S BEEN WIPED FROM HIS PAST.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: O no - fuck.
scene_heading: EXT. ‘DANS LE NOIR’ RESTAURANT. NIGHT. 38
text: HOT AND HAVING RUN, TIM'S OUTSIDE “DANS LE NOIR”. HE CHECKS
scene_heading: HIS WATCH. IT'S 10.48.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Shit. Shit.
speaker_heading: (RUSHES IN)
dialog: Two girls in earlier tonight - one
dialog: of them looked like Kate Moss - the
dialog: other one like a sort of nice
dialog: prostitute. Do you have their
dialog: names?
speaker_heading: MAITRE D'
dialog: O yes - no, I'm sorry, they were
dialog: walk-ins and they paid by cash.
dialog: Sorry, sir.
speaker_heading: TIM

scene_heading: BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING. MERRY HARRY, MISERABLE TIM.

text: HE THROWS TIM THE REVIEW SECTION OF A SUNDAY PAPER, WITH THAT

text: THEN TIM GLIMPSES AN ADVERT, A REPRODUCTION OF A PHOTO OF
scene_heading: KATE MOSS. IT'S AN EXHIBITION OF MARIO TESTINO PHOTOS OF HER -—
text: LASTS A WEEK.
speaker_heading: TIM

scene_heading: INT. GALLERY. DAY. 40
text: CUT TO TIM SITTING WITH A HUGE PICTURE OF KATE MOSS BEHIND
text: HIM, LOOKING, LOOKING - HE IS SURROUNDED BY THE HUGE ROOMS OF

scene_heading: EVENING FALLS. NOTHING.
text: AND AGAIN, THE NEXT DAY, TIM IN DIFFERENT CLOTHES. AND AGAIN.
text: AND AGAIN - KIT KAT’S NOW SITTING WITH HIM. THE SEVENTH DAY.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Nice of you to keep me company,

speaker_heading: KIT KAT
dialog: Nothing better to do.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: How's Jimmy?
speaker_heading: KIT KAT
dialog: Dumped me.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Not again. And work?
speaker_heading: KIT KAT
dialog: Sacked me.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Idiots. Coffee?
speaker_heading: KIT KAT
dialog: Please. And muffins. I need treats.
text: HE HEADS OFF, AND WHILE KIT KAT'S WAITING, MARY CASUALLY SITS
text: DOWN NEXT TO HER FOR A MOMENT, RE-TIES HER SHOE LACE, AND
text: THEN HEADS OFF. TIM RETURNS.
speaker_heading: KIT KAT (CONT'D)
dialog: What does she actually look like,
dialog: your future wife? Who you met at a
dialog: party, and found out she liked Kate
dialog: Moss but didn’t find out her
dialog: number?
text: AND SUDDENLY MARY IS ACTUALLY STANDING RIGHT BEHIND THEM.
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: TIM
text: Soft face. Fringe. Bright eyes. The
dialog: prettiest girl in the world.
text: AND THEY WALK OFF IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.
text: AND THEN, TOTALLY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SHOW, HE SUDDENLY
speaker_heading: SEES HER.
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: O my God. It's her.
text: HE CHARGES OVER TOWARDS HER. KIT KAT FOLLOWS BEHIND. HE
text: SPEAKS FROM BEHIND MARY.
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Hi.
scene_heading: SHE TURNS. VERY EMPTY LOOK, OF COURSE - HE'S A STRANGER. WITH
text: A GRINNING SISTER BESIDE HIM, GIVING A FRIENDLY LITTLE WAVE.

speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: TIM

speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Great.
scene_heading: PREGNANT PAUSE.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: We've never met before.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: O no. Fuck. Of course we haven't.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You must've mistaken me for someone
dialog: else.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Yes. No. No. Your name's Mary.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: That's a bit weird. How do you
dialog: know?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: You... look like a Mary.
text: KIT KAT OBSERVING THIS SCEPTICALLY.
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: In what way?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Well, my Mum's called Mary.
text: HE ISN'T DOING WELL - AND KNOWS IT.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: And I look like your mother?
speaker_heading: TIM
text: Not at all. Much prettier.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Right - well... great meeting you.
dialog: Sorry, I've got to go - my friend's

speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Yes. Absolutely.
text: HE TURNS IN DESPAIR TO KIT KAT.
speaker_heading: KIT KAT
dialog: Very poor.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Very poor indeed. But let me handle
dialog: it from here.
speaker_heading: KIT KAT
dialog: Coke-ee-dokee... But, you know, she
text: looks cute. Two thumbs up from the
dialog: English judge.
text: CUT TO MARY - WITH HER FRIEND JOANNA. TIM REAPPEARS.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Ahm, me again.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: TIM

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Joanna, this is..?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Tim.
speaker_heading: JOANNA

scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Yes. I just had a weird experience
dialog: with Mary here of thinking she was
dialog: someone else I knew - but she
dialog: wasn't BUT I just wondered if... I
dialog: could walk round with you, because
dialog: I'm... quite lonely.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What about the girl you were with?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: My sister. She had to go. Somewhere
dialog: interesting. We’re a very
dialog: interesting family.
speaker_heading: MARY
speaker_heading: (TO JOANNA)
dialog: We should definitely say 'no'.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Yes - this is dangerous territory.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: All right. You have to promise you
dialog: are not one of the following things
dialog: - 1/ a lunatic 2/ a stalker 3/
dialog: worst of all - a bore.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: No. I'm just a big Kate Moss fan.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Really? Do you agree the magic of
dialog: her lies in her history - the
dialog: informality of her early shots,
dialog: compared to this stuff, so you
dialog: always know, despite the high
dialog: fashion, she's still just that same
text: cheeky normal girl naked on the

speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Yes, I do agree.

speaker_heading: TIM

speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: No! You don't have a boyfriend!
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Don't I look like I would have a
dialog: boyfriend?
speaker_heading: (TO JOANNA)
dialog: Do I look like I'd never get a
dialog: boyfriend?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: No, no, I don't mean that. It’s
dialog: just... I didn't expect - is he -
dialog: quite a new boyfriend?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yes. In fact - Rupert - over here.
speaker_heading: TIM
speaker_heading: (TO HIMSELF)
dialog: Rupert?
text: A RATHER GROOVY, GOOD LOOKING YOUNG MAN APPROACHES.
speaker_heading: RUPERT
dialog: Hi - sorry I'm late - with my Dad -

speaker_heading: MARY

text: TIM IS HATING THIS.
speaker_heading: RUPERT
dialog: How's the exhibition?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Gorgeous - she’s so beautiful.
speaker_heading: RUPERT

text: THIS DOESN'T GO DOWN WELL WITH TIM.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Who is your type then?
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: RUPERT
dialog: Her, obviously.
text: TIM PULLS A FACE AT THAT. THEN A THOUGHT OCCURS...
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: So tell me, when did you two meet?
speaker_heading: RUPERT
dialog: Only a week ago actually. It's been
dialog: a bit of a whirlwind, hasn't it,
dialog: poochy face?
text: THAT'S EVEN WORSE. BILE GATHERING IN TIM'S THROAT.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'm going to have to teach you what
dialog: you can and can't say in front of
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: RUPERT
dialog: "Poochy face' out?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Definitely out. And don’t even
dialog: think about 'fuckbucket'.
speaker_heading: RUPERT
dialog: I would never call you
dialog: '‘fuckbucket'.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Good.
text: TIM AMUSED, THOUGH IT HURTS...
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: So, come on, more details. About
dialog: the wonderful first meeting.
speaker_heading: RUPERT
dialog: Well, okay, it was, what, a week
dialog: ago - your birthday, Joanna...
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: June 10.
speaker_heading: RUPERT
dialog: And Jo was having a little party.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: My flat.
speaker_heading: TIM

scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
dialog: 42
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What are you - a detective?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: No, no - I just have a very visual
dialog: imagination - I like to, you know,
dialog: imagine stuff completely.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Meard Street, W 11 - 8.30 at night -
dialog: will that do?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Absolutely. Excuse me - sorry -
dialog: I've now suddenly got a bit of a
dialog: tummy ache - watch out for those
dialog: muffins - I'll be back in a tick.

scene_heading: EXT. MEARD STREET. NIGHT. 42

speaker_heading: RUPERT
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: RUPERT
dialog: Can I help?
text: SOMETHING A BIT NASTY POSH ABOUT HIM NOW HE'S NOT WITH MARY.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Yes - ahm - ahm - it's about your
dialog: father.
speaker_heading: RUPERT
dialog: My father?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Yes - ahm - I'm afraid he's in real
dialog: trouble.
speaker_heading: RUPERT
dialog: What kind of trouble?
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Well, I'm not at liberty to reveal
dialog: that - but my strong advice would
dialog: be that you go to see him straight
dialog: away.
text: RUPERT TAKES OUT HIS PHONE. TIM HAS TO ACT FAST.
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: But don't ring him first.
speaker_heading: RUPERT
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: He's not at liberty to make or
dialog: receive phone calls, I'm afraid.
speaker_heading: RUPERT
dialog: I'm sorry - but who are you? -
dialog: because there is a scenario here
dialog: where you're a random lunatic.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: (DRAWS BREATH)
dialog: Well then let me explain the actual
dialog: scenario. I'm a plain clothes
dialog: policeman and I'm doing you a
dialog: fucking favour because I know how
dialog: badly these things can affect the
dialog: kids - so, risking my career, I'm
dialog: telling you to move your posh arse
dialog: in the direction of Paddington
dialog: Police station. You weren't your
dialog: Dad's one phone call because he
dialog: called his lawyer because he
dialog: doesn't want to rot in jail for 50
dialog: years - but now he desperately
dialog: needs a friend - and my sources
dialog: tell me you may be the only member
dialog: of the family left, with your
dialog: mother... gone. But, of course, you
dialog: could just go get drunk instead,
dialog: and leave him to suffer - miserably
dialog: - alone - forever.
text: RUPERT LOOKS AT HIM.
speaker_heading: RUPERT
dialog: Paddington Police Station?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: RUPERT
dialog: Where's that?
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: PAUSE
speaker_heading: TIM
text: Paddington. Obviously.
text: A FRIEND COMES BACK OUT TO THE STEPS.
speaker_heading: FRIEND
dialog: What the hell's going on, Rupe?
text: RUPERT LOOKS AT TIM WHO SHAKES HIS HEAD - 'DON'T BLAB'.
speaker_heading: RUPERT
dialog: It's okay. Nothing. I'll be back in
dialog: an hour. Save me a drink.
text: THAT ‘BACK IN AN HOUR’ WORRIES TIM A BIT.
speaker_heading: RUPERT (CONT'D)
dialog: I suppose I should say ‘thank you’.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Just doing my job, friend.
text: A CAB FLIES BY - RUPERT HAILS IT. CUT INSIDE THE CAB.
speaker_heading: RUPERT

speaker_heading: CABBIE

speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Hi. I’m Tim.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Mary.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: My mother's name. But let’s not get
dialog: into that. You wouldn't like to
dialog: come out to dinner with me, would
dialog: you? Sometime in the next... hour.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: That's my friend Joanna over there -
dialog: she’s much prettier than me -
dialog: shouldn't you hit on her first?
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
dialog: 44
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: No, I like the look of you more.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Easier to get?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: No. Just generally preferable.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Okay - I might come, if you’re not
dialog: crazy. Which you now have to prove.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Well, let's talk about Kate Moss.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I actually like Kate Moss.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I always think the key thing about
dialog: her is the history. We all remember
dialog: those fantastic pictures of her as
text: a young school girl on a beach, so
dialog: that even now, beneath all the
dialog: glamour, we still see the wonderful
text: young, impish amateur.
speaker_heading: MARY
speaker_heading: (AMAZED)
dialog: That is exactly right.
text: CUT TO THEM HEADING OUT THE DOOR AND HAILING A CAB - JUST AS
text: RUPERT'S CAB COMES AND RUPERT JUMPS OUT, FUMING.
scene_heading: INT. GREEK RESTAURANT. NIGHT. 44
text: TIM AND MARY IN AN AVERAGE GREEK RESTAURANT.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: So - what do you do?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'm a reader at a publisher.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: No! You read for a living.
speaker_heading: MARY
speaker_heading: (SENSING HIS IRONY)
dialog: Yes - that's it. I read.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: That’s so great - the rest of us,
dialog: we just read, you know newspapers,
dialog: books - but you, you get paid for
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: It's like someone asking, 'what do
dialog: you do for a living?' - 'I breath,
dialog: I'm a breather. I get paid for
dialog: breathing'. How did you get that
dialog: job?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Okay - what do you do, smartarse?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I'm a lawyer. Sort of.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Sexy.
speaker_heading: TIM
speaker_heading: (GENUINELY SURPRISED)
dialog: Is it?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I think so - in a suit, in a court
dialog: saving people's lives - that's
dialog: quite sexy, isn't it?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Yes, I guess it is. But not as sexy
dialog: as reading. Sitting there, in your
text: office, in a little chair -
dialog: reading.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Wait right there, mister. A lot of
dialog: books get submitted to the
dialog: publisher I work for, and it’s my
dialog: responsibility to find out if any
dialog: of them are masterpieces. No-one
text: ever forgets the PWIDJKRALB.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: The People Who Turned Down JK
dialog: Rowling And Lost Billions.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Of course. Scary...
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Exactly. So it's an IMMENSE
dialog: responsibility.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I bet it is. And does this mean
dialog: when you’re doing normal reading,
dialog: it's ruined, because it's your job?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
dialog: 45
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Like prostitutes. I always worry
dialog: that when they stop being
dialog: prostitutes, they can't enjoy sex
dialog: any more.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You always worry about that?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: No, I sometimes worry about it.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Good - because someone who always
dialog: worried about that would be a
dialog: worry.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Right - but, when you read a
dialog: newspaper, do you think, “o fuck
dialog: this - it's work”? Or a menu - 'I'm
dialog: not reading this unless you pay me
dialog: hard cash...”

speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
text: It’s a front opener.

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Ah yes - man things...

speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Wow. You know your bras.
speaker_heading: TIM

dialog: Best night of my entire life. And
dialog: now I've got a suspicion I'm going
dialog: to have the best sleep of my life.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: O really. So my perfect man is a

speaker_heading: TIM

speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: TIM

speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
speaker_heading: (PUZZLED)

speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: That is so brilliant - hello Tina.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Why is it brilliant?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Well, you know there are certain

dialog: for life - and Charlotte's
dialog: rejection of me was one of those
dialog: moments - totally screwed up my
dialog: self-confidence. But now I know
dialog: she's got a... girlfriend that's
dialog: suddenly a huge burden off my mind -
dialog: I can be a confident heterosexual

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Not that kind of 'girlfriend'.
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE

speaker_heading: (HUGE HUG)
dialog: O - this is my girlfriend, Tina.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Hello, Tina - though you should be
dialog: a little careful with that, by the
dialog: way. There are still quite a lot of
dialog: us old-fashioned types who
dialog: interpret 'girlfriend' as sort of
dialog: meaning 'gay' so if you say Tina's
dialog: your girlfriend, people will assume
dialog: you're 'gay'.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: I am gay. Do you have a problem

speaker_heading: PAUSE.

dialog: proposal?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Not a very romantic one.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: No. You want more romantic?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Maybe just a little bit more
dialog: romantic than “turn that fucking
dialog: thing off and tell me if you want
dialog: to marry me or not.” But, no, it
dialog: has a certain rough charm...
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I’ll be back in a minute.

dialog: Who are you getting married to?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Mary here.
speaker_heading: UNCLE D
dialog: Thank God for that - would have
dialog: been jolly embarrassing if it had
dialog: been another girl. Imagine that -
dialog: (TO MARY) you would have looked
dialog: like a total gooseberry, wouldn't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Can I say I've only known Mary for
dialog: a few hours, but already I'm sure,
dialog: in the event of a nasty divorce,
dialog: I'm sticking with her, not Tim.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Thank you. O, and by the was...
dialog: the wedding will be quite soon,
dialog: because we're having a baby too.
speaker_heading: UNCLE D
dialog: You're pregnant?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: KIT KAT SCREAMS AGAIN.
speaker_heading: UNCLE D
dialog: Good lord - who's the father?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Tim here...
speaker_heading: UNCLE D
dialog: Thank God for that. Very awkward if
dialog: it had been another fella...
scene_heading: 66 INT. MARY'S FLAT. NIGHT. 66
text: NIGHT IN THEIR FLAT A FEW DAYS LATER. TIM IS READING - MARY

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: We have to decide tonight.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: What?
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
speaker_heading: EXPECTANT
speaker_heading: SHE TAKES
speaker_heading: SHE TAKES
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Everything you've refused to engage
dialog: with. Best man. Honeymoon. Where
dialog: we're marrying. How many guests.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: We haven't decided any of those?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: The only thing you've decided is
dialog: that I will come down the aisle to
dialog: the sound of an Italian weirdo
dialog: singing a song called Il Mondo.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Excellent...
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: To which I have said a definitive
dialog: ‘no’. So here's the deal. I will
dialog: take off one item of clothing for
dialog: every decision you manage to make.
dialog: This is a one off offer.
dialog: Striptease, in your own living
dialog: room, by a woman you think, by your
dialog: own admission, is very pretty.
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Okay. You have my attention, young
dialog: lady.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Right. Good. Where do you think we
dialog: should get married?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Home - I’d hate anywhere else.
text: OFF HER T-SHIRT, AND IS WEARING A BRA UNDERNEATH.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Good. Who should the priest be?
speaker_heading: TIM
text: The local bloke with the yellow
text: teeth and massive uni-brow...
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Okay, that's a lock for Hagrid.
text: OFF HER BAGGY SWEAT PANTS. SHE HAS NO SOCKS. SHE IS
text: JUST STANDING THERE IN BRA AND PANTS.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Ah. Right. I should have thought
dialog: this through first.
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I should have worn more clothes.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: So I better pick two really
dialog: important questions. Best man.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Damn. I really want to see those
dialog: breasts, but...
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Best man. Now.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: This is SO hard. It's lose/lose -
dialog: you piss off all the ones you don't
dialog: pick and you end up hating the one
dialog: you do pick because he makes an
dialog: embarrassing speech and ruins your
dialog: day.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Do you want to see these puppies or
dialog: not?
speaker_heading: TIM
scene_heading: (VERY TENTATIVE) Harry?
speaker_heading: MARY
text: The breasts are the border from
dialog: which no decision can ever return.
dialog: Harry? Really?
text: SHE REACHES BACK FOR HER BRA STRAP.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: No. Bad idea. He'll get drunk. Jay?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Your choice.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: He's my best friend, but he’s a
dialog: moron.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: He will fuck up everything, yes.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Rory - he's boring - but he'll try
dialog: SO hard...
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
dialog: 67
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Sure?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Yes. Definitely. Rory. No, Harry.
dialog: It's Harry.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Okay. It's Harry.
text: WE SEE FROM BEHIND AS SHE FLICKS OFF HER BRA.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Actually, no - Rory.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: That is such a cheat. But Rory it
dialog: is - it's Rory and it can never
dialog: change. Honeymoon?
text: SHE PLACES HER THUMBS ON HER PANTS.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Wow - this is turning into an
dialog: exceptionally good night. I know
dialog: this one! VENICE!!!
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Don’t think we can afford Venice...

text: JAY MAKES EYE CONTACT WITH A VERY CUTE BRIDESMAID, JOANNA.
text: THE PRIEST IS THE YELLOW TOOTHED UNI-BROWED GUY.
text: A CLANK OF A DOOR - SUDDEN HUSH. THEN, WE SEE A FINGER PUSH A

scene_heading: DRAMATIC POP SONG STARTS TO PLAY. THEN AN ITALIAN VOICE
text: BEGINS TO SING.
text: CUT TO TIM SHOCKED. CUT TO VARIOUS SURPRISED MEMBERS OF THE
text: CONGREGATION. CUT TO HIS DAD... AND HIS MUM LOOKING AT HIS

dialog: 
text: WE ALSO SEE BIG POLLY FROM THE BEGINNING - NEXT TO HER
scene_heading: ENORMOUS 6' 8” HUSBAND.
text: WHEN MARY TURNS INTO THE MAIN AISLE, IN HER HEAVENLY WEDDING
text: DRESS, TIM IS OVERJOYED.
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
dialog: 68
dialog: 69.
text: IT IS HIS REQUEST “IL MONDO”, A HUGE EPIC ITALIAN LOVE
scene_heading: BALLAD. KIT KAT'S BRIDESMAID DRESS IS, BY THE WAY, AN INSANE
scene_heading: PURPLE WONDER.
text: WHEN WE HIT THE SONG’S CHORUS, TIM’S DAD STARTS TO DO A
scene_heading: GROOVY DANCE MOVEMENT TO IT - AS DOES TIM - AS FINALLY, SO
text: DOES THE BRIDE, HEADING DOWN THE AISLE... EVENTUALLY, DAD
text: DOES THE FULL ARMS UP IN THE AIR - AND THEN REALIZES IT'S
text: SLIGHTLY UNSUITABLE... AND APOLOGISES TO HIS WIFE...
text: CUT TO THE BRIDE AND GROOM KISSING AT THE ALTAR - WE HEAR
scene_heading: THUNDER - CLEARLY IT’S GETTING STORMY OUTSIDE - THE
scene_heading: CONGREGATION APPLAUD - AND NOW THERE IS MASSIVE RAIN ON THE
text: WINDOWS. AMONGST THE GUESTS IS THE SWEET LOOKING GUY WHO
text: DANCED WITH THE 10 YEAR OLD.
text: CUT TO THE END OF THE SERVICE - AS THE COUPLE COME OUT OF THE
text: CHURCH, IT IS ABSOLUTELY POURING. THE NEXT TWO MINUTES OF
scene_heading: FILM SHOW THE WORST RAINSTORM/HURRICANE EVER SEEN IN BRITAIN.
text: IT IS ABSOLUTE CHAOS. WITH A BELLOWING ITALIAN AND A THOUSAND
text: VIOLINS AS THE SOUNDTRACK.
text: AS THEY WALK FROM THE CHURCH, THE BRIDE'S TRAIN IS TOTALLY IN
scene_heading: THE SKY - AND THEN TEARS OFF - OLD PEOPLE FALL - SOMEONE IN A
text: WHEELCHAIR SCOOTS DANGEROUSLY TO THE CLIFF EDGE...
scene_heading: THEY REACH THE COMFORT OF THE MARQUEE - BUT IT'S FALSE
scene_heading: COMFORT - IT TEARS QUICKLY - AND STARTS TO DECONSTRUCT AS
text: WATER FLOODS IN THROUGH THE HOLES IN THE FABRIC. PEOPLE ARE
scene_heading: HANGING ON FOR DEAR LIFE - SOMEONE IS NEARLY DECAPITATED BY A
text: FLYING METAL POLE. SOME CHILDREN HAVE FOUND THE UTTER MUD OF
text: THE GARDEN AND ARE COMPLETELY FILTHY. EVERYONE IS COMPLETELY
text: SOAKED. A LOT OF THE WOMEN APPEAR TO BE ALMOST NAKED NOW, AS
text: THEIR WET THIN DRESSES STICK TO THEM LIKE COLOURED FLESH.
scene_heading: IT IS BROAD, REALISTIC, CHAOTIC COMEDY. ALL ACCOMPANIED BY
scene_heading: THE REMAINING, EPIC, ORCHESTRAL MINUTE OF ‘IL MONDO'.
scene_heading: INT. FAMILY HOME / MARY'S FLAT. DAY. 68
text: THE ENTIRE WEDDING IS NOW BEING SQUEEZED INTO THE UNPREPARED
text: LIVING ROOM OF THE FAMILY HOUSE. RORY STANDS UP TO SPEAK. HE
text: IS INCREDIBLY NERVOUS.
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: When Tim asked me to be his Best
dialog: Man I was terrified, so I thought,
dialog: well, the best thing is to finda
dialog: book about speeches - and ahm, this
dialog: is it and it says “think of really
dialog: funny anecdotes” - and there IS one
dialog: very funny story actually from
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: RORY (CONT'D)
dialog: It was quite a complicated case
dialog: based on an issue of cross-
dialog: amortization of ownership of post-
dialog: divorce properties - and ahm - let
dialog: me just explain the context - the
dialog: defendant - a certain Mr...
text: CUT STRAIGHT TO HARRY SPEAKING, IN EXACTLY THE SAME PLACE...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: When Tim asked me to do his best
dialog: man speech, my immediate reaction
dialog: was - “how much are you going to
dialog: pay me, you little shit? I don’t
dialog: write for free, you know...”
text: CUT BACK TO THE STRIPPING GAME IN THE FLAT...
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I'm going to go for Jay.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Yeh - he might be funny and I'm
dialog: pretty sure we can rein him in...
text: WE CUT RIGHT BACK TO THE RECEPTION. JAY HAS A WHITE BOARD -
text: WITH A POWERPOINT PRESENTATION.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: These were the girls available in
dialog: Tim's teenage years.
text: SLIDE OF TIM AND, AROUND HIM, FIVE PHOTOS OF GIRLS.
speaker_heading: JAY (CONT'D)
dialog: And this is how far he got with
text: each of them.
text: THERE ARE NOW NUMBERS ON LINES BETWEEN TIM AND THE GIRLS.
speaker_heading: JAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Let me explain the code. Zero -
dialog: obviously nothing. Quite a lot of
dialog: those. 5 - blow job. Only one, I’m
dialog: afraid.
text: AND BACK TO MARY AND HER BRA.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Do you know, I know it's unusual,
dialog: but I think I'll go for Dad.
text: CUT TO DAD FINISHING HIS TOAST AND IT'S GOING WELL...
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: And so, a toast to the man with the
dialog: worst haircut, but the best wife in
dialog: the room.
text: THEY ALL LAUGH AND CLAP AND TIM SMILES AT HIM.
text: AFTER THE DAD'S SPEECH, THEY CHAT IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM.
speaker_heading: DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: I wish I'd said that I love you.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: You did, Dad - it was implied...
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I'm not sure 'implied' is good
dialog: enough for a wedding day, are you?
text: PAUSE - THEY BOTH KNOW WHAT HE MEANS.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Don't do it - it's fine - I'm
dialog: really happy with it as it was -
dialog: you really don't have to.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I'll do what I want to do, young
dialog: man.
text: CUT BACK TO THE NEW SPEECH...
speaker_heading: DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: My natural instinct of course is to
dialog: try to be funny about my son - so
dialog: many flaws - plays table tennis
dialog: like a hairy goat, has never quite
dialog: mastered the art of shaving. But
dialog: always important, first, to say the
dialog: one big thing. I’ve only loved
dialog: three men in my life - my Dad was a
dialog: frosty bugger - so that only leaves
dialog: dear Uncle D - Nat King Cole, of
dialog: course - and this young man here.
dialog: I'd only give one piece of advice
dialog: to anyone marrying. We're all quite
dialog: similar in the end, we all get old,
dialog: we all wrinkle, we all tell the
dialog: same tales too many times - but try
dialog: to marry someone... kind. And this
dialog: is a kind man - with a good heart.
dialog: I'm not particularly proud of many
dialog: things in my life - but I'm very
dialog: proud to be the father of my son.
text: AFTERWARDS, BACK IN THE SWING OF THE PARTY...
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
speaker_heading: WE SHOULD
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: KIT KAT
dialog: Well done, Daddio. I thought you'd
dialog: probably just joke your way through
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I was tempted to - but decided not
dialog: to. This time.
text: BE A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT KIT KAT AGAIN.
speaker_heading: DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you okay, Kit Kat?
speaker_heading: KIT KAT
dialog: O yes - I'm good, very good. Orange
dialog: juice, no vodka - or is it the
dialog: other way round?
text: SHE TOASTS HIM IN VODKA.
speaker_heading: UNCLE D
dialog: You next, Kittle Kattle?
speaker_heading: KIT KAT
dialog: I don't know Uncle D. Boys aren’t
dialog: very nice.
speaker_heading: UNCLE D
dialog: Aren't they, darling?
speaker_heading: KIT KAT
dialog: Not in my experience. Always taking
dialog: liberties. Not giving much back in
dialog: return.
speaker_heading: UNCLE D
dialog: O dear.
text: SHE'S GETTING DRUNK AND JIMMY KINCADE IS IGNORING HER. TIED
text: INTO THE FACT THAT KIT KAT WAS AT HOME WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED
text: THEIR PROPOSAL, AND THAT SHE’S JOBLESS, IT IS STARTING TO BE
text: A NAGGING WORRY, THE DIMMING OF THIS GORGEOUS GIRL.
text: CUT TOWARDS THE END OF THE RECEPTION...
speaker_heading: OLDER WOMAN
dialog: I'm so sorry to disturb you - but I
dialog: wonder if I could have your
dialog: autograph.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No - no! Fuck off. It's a wedding
dialog: for God's sake.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
dialog: 69
dialog: 70
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm here to celebrate true love -
dialog: not to hand out stupid bits of
dialog: paper with my illegible signature
dialog: on it that you can flog on eBay, so
dialog: at the next wedding you can afford
dialog: to buy a less hideous hat.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I see you've met my mother-in-law.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: O God - (TO HER) you might have
dialog: told me. People should wear name
dialog: tags.
scene_heading: MOTHER IN LAW
dialog: What would you have said if you'd
dialog: known?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: ‘Sod off’, rather than ‘fuck off’,
dialog: I suppose.
text: A FEW FINAL WEDDING IMAGES, AND A FINAL WORRYING MOMENT WITH
text: KIT KAT, OUT COLD, JIMMY JUST CASUALLY SMOKING BESIDE HER,
text: NOT WORRYING. CUT TO MUM AND DAD ROMANTICALLY WALTZING...
text: THEN MOVE FROM THEM DANCING TO TIM AND MARY. MARY TAKES A
text: GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE FROM A WAITER AND DOWNS IT.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Do you wish we'd picked another
dialog: day?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Not for all the world.

dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: O Jesus. What do we need? Ahm...
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I've done it all - it's all in the
dialog: bag.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Nappies? Phone chargers?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Everything. Every single thing.
dialog: Just get the car. All you have to
dialog: do is drive me to the hospital.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Right. Okay. Excellent.
scene_heading: 71 EXT. MARY'S FLAT / LONDON STREETS. DAY. 71
text: THEY ARE SQUEEZED INTO THE CAR - HE SETS OFF, NERVOUSLY...
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: To the hospital.
speaker_heading: MARY
text: Which is in the opposite direction.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Of course it is.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Okay - stop the car.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Is it coming? (THE BABY...)
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: No, it's not coming. I just want to
dialog: point out you just had one job,
dialog: that's ONE. The keeping fit, I did -
dialog: the preparing the nursery, I did -
dialog: the packing the bag, I did - the
dialog: carrying the alien in my sodding
dialog: stomach for nine years, I did. Your
text: ONE AND ONLY job after impregnation
dialog: was driving me to the hospital. Do
dialog: you actually know which hospital
dialog: we're going to?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Which hospital?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Ahm...
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: YOU TELL ME THE NAME OF THE

text: THE BABY IN YOUR FACE.
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Either St. Mark something or

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (WITH THE VOICE OF SATAN) DRIVE! I
dialog: WILL GUIDE YOU.

speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: For God's sake - do something.
dialog: There's a head appearing between my

text: TIM LEAPS OUT OF THE CAR. AND GOES ROUND THE CORNER - TO SEE
text: A HUGE TRAFFIC JAM AHEAD, LEADING TO A FAMOUS ZEBRA CROSSING.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: O Christ - Abbey Road.
text: THERE'S A QUEUE OF PEOPLE WAITING TO TAKE PHOTOS. TIM

scene_heading: SPECIALITY.
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Could you just, you know, hurry up?
speaker_heading: JAPANESE PERSON
dialog: Abbey Road. Beatles. John, George,

speaker_heading: AMERICAN 2
dialog: Well, I'm not doing it - I didn't
dialog: come all the way from Minnesota
dialog: just to be holding the goddamn
dialog: camera.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Look, I'll do it - okay. Jesus - be
dialog: careful.
scene_heading: HE NEARLY GETS RUN OVER - BUT GETS THE PHOTO DONE. HE TURNS
text: TO THE NEXT LOT, SOME GRUMPY NORTHERN TEENS.
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Right. The thing is, though, that

speaker_heading: NORTHERNER 2
dialog: It's not going to be any bloody
dialog: good anyway, Dave, with only three

speaker_heading: TIM

speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Cool - I've finalised the route.

dialog: we were in driving distance of

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Come on, he wasn't that bad.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: O don't be silly... But look, the
dialog: past is the past, the nightmare is
dialog: over, he grew up human, the days of

dialog: a hold?
speaker_heading: UNCLE D
dialog: O yes please...
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: (NERVOUS) Ahm, do you think

speaker_heading: TIM (V.O.)

text: CUT ON MONTHS - THE HOUSE IS DRESSED FOR A BIRTHDAY PARTY,

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: That'll be your Mum and Dad.
text: Bizarrely early as ever.
text: TIM IS OPENING THE DOOR - IT IS THE THREE OF THEM FROM HOME.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Hello, Mum, Dad. Uncle D. Wonderful
dialog: to see you. Come on in. And look,
dialog: if it isn't Godfather Rory...
text: RORY IS CARRYING THE LARGEST TEDDY BEAR IN HISTORY.
scene_heading: EVERYONE IS GATHERED - A FEW FRIENDS - A FEW BABIES - THE
text: FAMILY GROUP IN THEIR COMFY CHAIRS. THE GIANT TEDDY BEAR NEXT
scene_heading: TO UNCLE D.
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: Only two important things for a
dialog: godfather, I reckon - tell the
dialog: child never to eat anything bigger
dialog: than its head. And never bring a
text: present smaller than the child.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: O shut up.
text: HARRY IS THERE TOO, WITH A VERY SMALL BEAR.
speaker_heading: MUM
dialog: I didn't expect to see you here,
dialog: Harry. Children's parties not
dialog: exactly your style.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I was tricked. I was told there'd
dialog: be free booze. Hate kids, as you
dialog: know. For fuck's sake, Tim - I'm
dialog: going to need straight vodka if
dialog: there's a fucking clown coming.
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
dialog: 81.
text: CUT TO THE CLOWN IN ACTION. IT IS GOING VERY BADLY. THE KIDS
scene_heading: ARE UTTERLY DISTRACTED - THE MUMS ARE PRETENDING TO BE
text: INTERESTED. MARY LOOKS AT TIM SAVAGELY.
text: CUT TO EVERYONE LATER, IN ANOTHER CLOWN-LESS VERSION OF THE
dialog: PARTY...
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: We thought of having a clown but
dialog: decided against it - best keep
dialog: first birthdays small, just family,
text: two friends, one giant stuffed toy.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Speaking of which, where is Kit
dialog: Kat?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Don’t know. She said she'd be here
dialog: around three.
text: THE DOOR BELL GOES.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Speak of the devil...
text: THE FRONT DOOR. TIM OPENS IT. IT IS A GREASY HAIRED, HANDSOME
text: BUT NOT NICE LOOKING YOUNG MAN. HE'S JIMMY KINCADE, WHO WE
text: FIRST SAW AT THE NEW YEAR’S PARTY, YEARS AGO.
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Jimmy - what can I do for you? And
dialog: where's my sister?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I thought she was here.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: No - she never arrived.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: That's not good.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: What does that mean? What does
dialog: ‘that's not good' mean?
text: AND THE CAMERA FOCUSSES IN ON HIM - AND IT ALL GOES WEIRD FOR

speaker_heading: TIM (V.O.)
dialog: There's a song by Baz Luhrmann,
dialog: called Sunscreen - and I've never
dialog: forgotten two lines from it -
dialog: “Worrying about the future is as
dialog: effective as trying to solve an
dialog: algebra equation by chewing
dialog: bubblegum. The real troubles in
dialog: your life will always be things
dialog: that never crossed your worried

scene_heading: INT/EXT. HOSPITAL. NIGHT. 79
text: CUT TO MARY AND TIM RACING INTO A HOSPITAL.
scene_heading: THEN CONTRASTING STILLNESS. IN A QUIET ROOM - ON MARY AND
speaker_heading: TIM'S FACES.
text: CUT TO KIT KAT, LYING IN A HOSPITAL BED - HER BEAUTIFUL FACE
text: BADLY CUT AND BRUISED. HER HAIR PULLED BACK TIGHTLY.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: What happened?
text: WE SEE A FLASH BACK TO A HUGE CAR CRASH - SMASHING GLASS AND
scene_heading: VIOLENCE. THE CAR, A PURPLE MINI, CLEARLY BELONGS TO KIT KAT.
text: CUT BACK - IT'S HARD FOR KIT KAT TO TALK, BUT SHE DOES.
speaker_heading: KIT KAT
dialog: We had a fight. And maybe I wasn't
text: completely sober.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: It was tea time. On a weekday.
speaker_heading: KIT KAT
dialog: I know. Very poor. Sorry.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I blame Jimmy.
speaker_heading: KIT KAT
dialog: It’s so not his fault.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Well, so you say...

speaker_heading: OUTSIDE.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: How is she?
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z

scene_heading: OPENING A DOOR.
speaker_heading: PASSING NURSE

speaker_heading: TIM

text: CUT BACK TO THE FRONT DOOR, FOUR HOURS EARLIER.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You cut it fine.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Sorry - I had to pick up Kit Kat.
text: HE HEADS IN WITH KIT KAT FOLLOWING - ALTHOUGH NOW WELL, OF
text: COURSE, SHE IS NOT LOOKING HER BEST. SHE SLINKS IN, HAS BAGS
scene_heading: UNDER HER EYES. THERE'S STILL SOME OF THE USUAL NATURAL
text: SPARKLE, BUT A SENSE OF SOMETHING WRONG UNDERNEATH. KIT KAT
text: APPROACHES THE FAMILY GROUP...
speaker_heading: MARY (WHISPERING TO TIM)
dialog: She couldn't come herself?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: No, as it turns out, she couldn't.
text: CUT BACK TO THEM AFTER THE PARTY. RELAXING IN THE CHAOS....
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm worried about Kit Kat.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I know. She was drinking vodka
dialog: while we were drinking tea. And
dialog: Jimmy wasn't nice to her.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: We have to do fix it.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: We can’t do that. If it’s going to
dialog: be fixed, she has to fix it

speaker_heading: TIM

speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: You're not. But I AM a little
dialog: worried...
speaker_heading: KIT KAT
dialog: What did I tell you? It's a full-
text: blooded ticking off.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: It's just, you know, this is a
dialog: strange place for you still to be
dialog: coming all the time. Here with Mum
dialog: and Dad and Uncle D...
speaker_heading: KIT KAT
dialog: My best friend.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Indeed. But, what's happened?
dialog: You're the best person in the

dialog: the dog in The Artist. I don't

speaker_heading: KIT KAT
dialog: Neither do I.
text: TIME FOR THE TRUTH. SHE DOESN'T LOOK AT HIM AS SHE TALKS.
speaker_heading: KIT KAT (CONT'D)
dialog: I thought life was going to be so
dialog: great. But somehow up in London, in
dialog: the real world, I keep getting
dialog: knocked about...
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: And getting drunk.
speaker_heading: KIT KAT
dialog: So sometimes I get drunk. And

speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: And so you end up back with Jimmy.
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
speaker_heading: KIT KAT
dialog: Maybe, just maybe, Tim, I'm the

speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Exactly. All your beliefs, total

speaker_heading: KIT KAT

speaker_heading: TIM

speaker_heading: KIT KAT

speaker_heading: TIM

scene_heading: 97 EXT. LONDON PARK. DAY.

scene_heading: A BEAUTIFUL DAY - THEY STROLL THROUGH A PARK. MARY HAS A BABY
text: IN A PAPOOSE...
speaker_heading: TIM (V.O.)
dialog: And that's another big strange
dialog: thing - you pour all your possible
dialog: love into one child...
text: POSY, NOW GETTING BIGGER IS RUNNING TOWARDS HIM.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: And this is incredible, Posy Lake,
text: only three years old, is about to
dialog: break the Women’s Olympic record,
dialog: if only her trousers can stay up...
text: WHICH THEY DON’T. SHE TRIPS AND FALLS.
speaker_heading: TIM (V.O.)
dialog: And then you have another one, and
dialog: it turns out you've got exactly the
dialog: same amount of love on tap...
text: HE'S SWINGING HIS SON ROUND AS THEY WALK ON.
speaker_heading: TIM (V.O.)
dialog: Love, this extraordinary ingredient
dialog: that has no limits, ever expanding,

scene_heading: - WET HAIR, JUST WEARING A TOWEL.
speaker_heading: MARY

dialog: do you wear for dinner with the
dialog: greatest author in the country??
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I'll settle the kids and come
dialog: straight up.
text: UP IN THEIR BEDROOM. MARY EMERGES FROM A LITTLE DRESSING
text: ROOM, IN A PRETTY BLUE DRESS.
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: How about this?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Gorgeous. Job done.
text: SHE CHECKS HERSELF IN THE FULL-LENGTH MIRROR TO HER LEFT.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: No. Take it seriously. I hate it.
dialog: Makes me look lumpy.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Right. I hate it too.
text: A SHARP CUT - SHE RE-EMERGES IN ANOTHER DRESS.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What about this?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Gorgeous. We did it!
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Not too breasty for Le Carre?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It's too breasty.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Is it?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yes.
text: AND ANOTHER ONE.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: This?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Not too breasty.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: No, but I think high heels. Or my
dialog: legs will look too short.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Which they aren't, but whatever
dialog: makes you feel good. High heels are
dialog: great.
text: SHE NOW HAS THE HIGH HEELS ON.
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I can't wear high heels - it's not
dialog: that kind of evening.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Not high heels then.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: But then we have the short legs
dialog: problem.
text: CUT TO THE NEXT ONE.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't think this one is too bad.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I think it's fabulous.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What about the blue one?
scene_heading: LITTLE PAUSE.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: The first one? The lumpy one that
dialog: wasn't actually lumpy?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yes. Which do you prefer?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I don't know. I'm actually starting
dialog: to go a bit mad now.
text: SHE EMERGES IN THE ORIGINAL DRESS.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Okay, let's go with this then.
dialog: Although I think viz a viz breasts
dialog: it's a bit disappointing. Where are
dialog: the kids?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I left them downstairs.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Not in the room with the
dialog: manuscript.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I don't think so...
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
dialog: 100.
text: CUT INTO THE LIVING ROOM. IT IS A FIRESTORM OF PAPER —
text: TOTALLY COVERED IN TORN AND COLOURED AND SHREDDED PAGES.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You are joking. You left them in
dialog: here. With the only copy of the
dialog: book in existence apart from the
text: one on John Le Carre's computer.
dialog: I'll be fired. The company will be

speaker_heading: THE PHONE
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Okay - take it easy - I'm just
dialog: going to...
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Don't you dare leave the room. If
dialog: you leave the room, I'm leaving
dialog: you. I mean it - face it like a
dialog: man. Talk to me - how could you be
dialog: so stupid?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I just have to...
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: DON'T YOU DARE!
speaker_heading: GOES.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: And don't you dare answer that.
dialog: What are we going to do?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Look, I'm sure we can, you know,
dialog: reconstruct it.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: And how do you suggest we
dialog: reconstruct this? (A FULLY CHEWED
speaker_heading: PAGE)
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Well, no, that's not going to be
dialog: particularly easy. May not be a
dialog: very important page...
text: PAUSE. THE PHONE RINGS ON.
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: I really think we should...
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: If you answer the goddamn phone, I
dialog: will kill you.
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
speaker_heading: THE PHONE
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: All right. I won't answer the

text: IS STILL RINGING.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: NO! “Sorry, Mr Le Carre - we've
dialog: read most of your book - but the
dialog: rest of it got eaten, or coloured
dialog: in - or actually shredded.”
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Yes - I had no idea Posy actually
dialog: knew how to use that machine. In a
dialog: way, it's impressive, though
dialog: obviously not in a particularly
dialog: good way today.
text: MARY CAN'T BEAR IT ANY LONGER. SHE ANSWERS THE PHONE AND
text: SHOUTS INTO IT.
speaker_heading: SHE HANDS
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: WHAT DO YOU WANT? Okay. Sorry I
dialog: shouted, Helen. He'll explain. It's
dialog: for you. Your Mum.

speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Right - we'll come up.
speaker_heading: HE HANGS UP.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Dad. I'll call Kit Kat.

dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: MUM
dialog: Honestly?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: MUM
dialog: Fucking furious. I am so...
text: disinterested in a life without
dialog: your father.
text: TIM HEADS INTO THE LIVING ROOM. THERE'S UNCLE D LOOKING OUT
text: THE WINDOW.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: D. How are you?
speaker_heading: UNCLE D
dialog: Do you know - I'm very well, though
dialog: a little hot. But your father I
dialog: think is not so well. Cancer.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: UNCLE D
dialog: I'm very unhappy about that. At
dialog: your wedding he said he loved me.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: He does.
speaker_heading: UNCLE D
dialog: I know. That was the best day of my
dialog: life. So this is probably the
dialog: worst.

speaker_heading: DAD'S STUDY.
scene_heading: INT. DAD’S STUDY. DAY. 100
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Dad.
text: IN CONTRAST TO THE DEEP SORROW OF THE REST OF THE HOUSE - IT
text: SEEMS LIKE BUSINESS AS USUAL FOR HIS FATHER.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: O for God's sake - not you too?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: What?
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Well, Kit Kat's just rolled up
text: blubbing her eyes out - and now
dialog: you're here. What's Mum been
dialog: saying?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: The truth.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Yes, well, apart from that.
text: CUT TO THEM, SITTING IN HIS STUDY - THEY'VE BEEN TALKING.
speaker_heading: DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't think I haven't tried. It may
dialog: have been the smoking but I
dialog: couldn't undo that, as it was
dialog: before you were all born - and Mum
dialog: definitely wouldn't have gone out
dialog: with me at all if I hadn't been
dialog: such a sexy smoker. I did get it
dialog: found as soon as possible - but it
dialog: was too late.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: How long?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: O, you know, it could be years.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: How long really?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Weeks, I'm afraid.
scene_heading: PAUSE. MOMENT OF AWKWARDNESS. SOMETHING STRANGE IN THE AIR.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Have we had this conversation
dialog: before?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I rather let myself down. Hugged
dialog: you.
text: AND TIM WALKS TOWARDS HIM - HIS DAD STANDS - HE HUGS HIM. AS
text: HE EMERGES FROM THE HUG.
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
dialog: 101
dialog: 102
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: I never said we could fix things. I
dialog: specifically never said that. Life
dialog: is a mixed bag, no matter who you
dialog: are. Look at Jesus - he was the son
dialog: of God, for God’s sake, and his
dialog: life was still all a terrible old
dialog: fuck up.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I know - but you must see, I feel a
dialog: bit cheated.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Don’t - in fact feel the opposite -
dialog: the only people who give up work at
dialog: 50 are the Time Travellers with
dialog: cancer who want to play more table
dialog: tennis with their sons.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Right - so that was...
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Sorry we had to call. It's suddenly
dialog: got very bad - and Mum and I have
dialog: been fighting it alone for quite a
dialog: while.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Is there anything at all I can do?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I have thought of this one thing.
dialog: If we're very careful. Just do it
dialog: exactly the same...

text: IN THE JOYFUL WIND AROUND THE FATHER HE HAS ALWAYS LOVED...
scene_heading: INT. DAD'S STUDY. DAY. 102
text: BACK IN THE STUDY, THE NEXT DAY. DAD IS LOOKING OUT TO SEA,

scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: So. Tim. My son. Do you want to
dialog: know the secret - or do you want to
dialog: find it out for yourself - like I
dialog: did?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: O Christ - there's not another
dialog: secret?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Less dramatic. More important. The
dialog: big one.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: No - tell me. Let’s save some time.
text: AND WE CUT OUTSIDE THE WINDOW AS WHEN THEY FIRST SPOKE. WE
text: ARE NOT PARTY TO THE INFORMATION REVEALED.
scene_heading: 103 INT. FAMILY HOME. DAY. 103
text: THE NEXT DAY. FATHER AND SON ARE STANDING BY THE FRONT DOOR.
speaker_heading: DAD

speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I will. Thank you.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Mary.
scene_heading: SHE HUGS HIM - HE WHISPERS.
speaker_heading: DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: I've left everything to you. Don’t

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Thanks. The moment you die, I’m

scene_heading: 104 INT. TRAIN. DAY. 104

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What did you two talk about all

speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Stuff. And you and Mum?
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
dialog: 105
dialog: 106
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: We decided it would be best if you
dialog: never die. If you can work on
dialog: immortality that would be great.
text: HE LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW - WHEN HE TURNS BACK, A TEAR IS
text: FALLING DOWN HER CHEEK.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: You’re such a wonderful woman. I’m
dialog: so lucky to have you.
scene_heading: INT. TIM AND MARY'S HOUSE. DAY. 105
text: BACK HOME IN BED...
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What's your day tomorrow?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Ghastly. Long, boring meeting. Very

scene_heading: INT/EXT. LONDON. DAY. 106
text: DISTINCTIVE MUSIC PLAYS. FIRST, WE SEE TIM IN THE MIDDLE OF A
scene_heading: LONG LEGAL MEETING - WE SEE THEM ALL TALKING AND RORY IS
scene_heading: THERE - BUT WE ONLY NOTICE THE BORING DISCUSSION...
text: THEN TIM RUSHES LUNCH... BUYS A SANDWICH FROM 'PRET A
speaker_heading: MANGER’.
text: HE GETS A PHONE CALL FROM KIT KAT AS HE AND RORY WALK TOWARDS
text: THE COURT. HE IS IMPATIENT HEARING FROM HER, TRYING TO GET
text: OFF THE CALL FROM THE VERY START...
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Hey Kit Kat. How's things? O Good -
dialog: great. Look, I'm sorry, this isn't
dialog: a great time. Maybe later. Okay.
dialog: Okay. Well look, that's great - I'm
dialog: really pleased. Wow. Great. Good
dialog: old Teddy. Urgh. Honey - this is so
dialog: not the right time - I'm needed in
dialog: court in about five minutes. Okay.
dialog: Yes. I'm going to have to go or
dialog: I'll lose my job. Let's talk later.
dialog: Okay. Okay.
text: THEN INTO COURT. HE IS SUMMING UP TO THE JURY. HIS CLIENT IS
scene_heading: VERY WORRIED AND HE IS VERY TENSE - BUT HE GETS THE RESULT
text: THAT HE WANTED - ‘NOT GUILTY’ - AND, AS HE TIDIES HIS PAPERS,
text: HE SAYS TO HIMSELF “PHEW”.
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z

text: COMING BACK HOME ON THE UNDERGROUND - BORED. CHECKING HIS

speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Tough. Dull. Tense. Time for bed.
text: CUT TO THEM IN BED.
speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: TIM

text: CUT TO TIM IN THE BATHROOM.
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, Dad, let’s give it a go.
text: HE SHUTS HIS FISTS AND TRAVELS.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. LONDON. DAY. 107
text: CUT STRAIGHT BACK TO THE START OF THE SAME DAY.
scene_heading: THE SAME LONG MEETING - WE SEE THEM ALL TALKING - BUT THIS
text: TIME WE SEE TIM LOOK ACROSS AT RORY WHO WE JUST GLIMPSED IN
text: THE BACKGROUND EARLIER - AND HE SMILES AT HIM - AND RORY
text: BEAMS BACK. RORY MIMES A LITTLE SECRET YAWN. THEN TIM GOES
text: BACK TO LISTENING... AND WHEN THE OTHER LAWYER SAYS SOMETHING
text: CLEVER SAYS “THAT IS A VERY GOOD POINT”.
text: THEN TIM RUSHES LUNCH... BUT THIS TIME, HE ENJOYS SCANNING
text: THE FOOD AND PICKS OUT SOMETHING NICE - AND THEN THERE'S A
text: PRETTY GIRL WHO SERVES HIM IN THE SAME WAY AS BEFORE, BUT HE
text: RESPONDS POSITIVELY AND CIVILLY TO HER.
text: HE GETS THE PHONE CALL FROM KIT KAT AS HE AND RORY ARE IN THE
text: CORRIDOR LEADING TO THE COURT.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Give me a second.
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: We are really late.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Just...
scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
dialog: 108.
text: AND HE STOPS AND TAKES THE CALL.
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey Kit Kat. How's everything?
dialog: You're kidding! You’re kidding! O
dialog: Christ - I’m so sorry I’m in a tiny
dialog: bit of a rush...
text: RORY IS LITERALLY JUMPING UP AND DOWN WITH NERVES - THE
text: CORRIDORS ARE GETTING EMPTY - EVERYONE IS SUDDENLY AT WORK...
dialog: - but that is so great. Good old
dialog: Teddy. Say ‘yes’ - even if you’re
dialog: not sure - say ‘yes’. And yes - we
dialog: are absolutely free on Thursday.
dialog: I'm actually needed in court ten
dialog: minutes ago, so can’t tie down ALL
dialog: the details. But yes, my darling, I
dialog: love you and this is great news.
dialog: And I‘'1l ring you back a little bit
dialog: later when I’m not about to give a

dialog: attack. Bye, sweetie, bye.
text: AND THEN HIM AND RORY SPRINT FASTER THAN USAIN BOLT ALONG THE
text: ANCIENT CORRIDOR IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COURTROOM.
text: CUT INTO THE COURT. THIS TIME THOUGH, INSTEAD OF THE MYOPIC
text: RUSHED VIEW - TIM SEES THE BEAUTY OF THE BRITISH COURTROOM,
scene_heading: GRAND, BEAUTIFUL, LEATHER, CIVILIZED, ORGANISED.
text: CUT TO HIS SUMMARY - “LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY” — AND
text: HE LOOKS INTO THEIR EYES TO SEE THEM AS REAL PEOPLE, REALLY
text: LISTENING, TAKING THEIR JOB SERIOUSLY. AND HE LOOKS BACK AT
scene_heading: HIS CLIENT - REALLY CARING. HE CAN FEEL THE POWER OF WHAT
text: HE'S SAYING - SAYS IT WITH A LITTLE MORE RELISH.
text: AND THEN CUT TO THE VERDICT. AND WHEN THE JUROR SAYS 'NOT
scene_heading: GUILTY' - TIM IS UNCOOL - A HUGE SMILE - A WARM HANDSHAKE
text: WITH THE OVERJOYED CLIENT - A LOOK AT THE JURORS AND HOW
text: PROUD THEY ARE OF THEIR CORRECT DECISION. HIS EARLIER “PHEW” —
scene_heading: NO CELEBRATION, JUST RELIEF - IS REPLACED BY “HURRAY”.
text: COMING BACK HOME ON THE UNDERGROUND - LOOKING AT HIS WATCH.
text: ACCEPTING IT'S LATE - UNBUTTONING HIS JACKET, LOUNGING BACK.
scene_heading: ACTUALLY HEARING THE MUSIC COMING FROM THE MAN'S IPOD - AND
text: ENJOYING IT.
text: CUT TO MARY AND TIM IN BED AGAIN.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: So, not as bad a day as expected?

scene_heading: RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
dialog: 108
dialog: 109
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: That’s a relief. If it’d been a bad
dialog: day, I thought I might have had to
dialog: have sex with you to make up for
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: It was a very bad day. It went very
dialog: badly. I lost my job. I killed a
dialog: man. And I think I just heard one
dialog: of our children die downstairs.
text: HE GIVES HER A BIG SMILE. IT WAS EXACTLY THE SAME DAY - AND
scene_heading: COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.
speaker_heading: TIM (V.O.)
dialog: And so I began to live the new life
