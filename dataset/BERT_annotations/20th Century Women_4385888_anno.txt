dialog: Maybe I did do the wrong thing?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Jamie's energy’s very unstable, I think
dialog: that’s why he does all this.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Well there’s an energy crisis, that must

dialog: You want to fool around, with me?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Really? Yeah.
text: He touches her hair. She closes her eyes, melts more than she

speaker_heading: ABBIE (CONT'D)
dialog: You know I’m recovering from cervical
dialog: cancer?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I know.
text: She can’t believe he still wants to fool around. Everyone

text: He kisses her. She smells his hair.
speaker_heading: ABBIE (CONT’D)
dialog: Your hair smells good.

speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Fuck. What’re you gonna do?

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It'll be fine.
text: She's actually very worried. Her mind spins, disturbed. She changes

speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Can’t I just be me?
speaker_heading: ABBIE
dialog: No... sorry.

dialog: in last night. I was awake.
speaker_heading: ABBIE
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Yea, I couldn’t sleep, so I was,
text: listening for him.
dialog: It’s clear she knows what happened, Julie really enjoys

text: Jamie finally enters, a bit sheepish, he did run away.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: How was the show?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Next time you take a trip just tell
dialog: me, I won’t make too much dinner.

text: CUT TO: Everyone cleaning up and heading off.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Hey, do the stocks with me?

speaker_heading: DOROTHEA

speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: What if it’s like, bad news?
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: You can handle it. Or if you can’t, you
dialog: just gotta start somewhere.
text: He’s not so sure.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA CONTD
dialog: Men feel like you have to fix everything
dialog: for women, or you’re not doing anything.
dialog: But some things can’t be fixed. Just be
dialog: there. Somehow, that’s hard for you all.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: I’m not all men, I’m just me.

speaker_heading: ABBIE
dialog: What about in the future?
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: There was damage to the muscle wall, from
dialog: the surgery. You have an incompetent
dialog: cervix.
speaker_heading: ABBIE
dialog: Incompetent?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: It may not be strong enough to go full
text: term during pregnancy. As the baby grows,
text: the cervix widens. If it’s weakened,
text: it’s likely to open prematurely.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY
text: Abbie and Jamie walk down the hall. She looks at him, a swirl of

scene_heading: INT. DOROTHEA’S KITCHEN
speaker_heading: ABBIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Having Jamie, was that the biggest

dialog: What can Dorothea say? Abbie can see this is true.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: I guess so. You’1ll get through
dialog: this. You will get through it.
dialog: You will do it. This is the really
dialog: hard part. And then what happens

speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Yeah, do they have names?
speaker_heading: ABBIE
dialog: (No) It’s a boy and a girl. The
dialog: guy at the store said they’re
dialog: monogamous for life, if one dies
dialog: the other one will die like a week

speaker_heading: DOROTHEA

speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: So, you went to her doctor’s office
dialog: with her, and waited there?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: I told you to just wait here?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: I thought it would be better to
dialog: just go with her, really be there.
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Well, are you OK, sweetie?
text: Then, awkward, out of character.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA (CONT'D)
dialog: She’s really upset, that must have
dialog: been a lot to deal with.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: No, not really.
text: Already feeling her plan slipping away from her. A little

speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: I'm fine. I’m good. I learned a

text: He does in slow motion, softly. She liked that. She leaves.

scene_heading: INT. JULIE’S BEDROOM - DAY
text: Jamie and Julie sit in her bedroom. She unpacks the E.P.T

text: at the instructions.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Fuck, what is that?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: It’s a pregnancy test.
text: LATER: The door to Julie’s attached bathroom is closed. She’s
text: in the bathroom, not happy about peeing in a cup. Jamie sits
text: on the bedroom floor. Quiet, then the sound of pee in a cup.
text: They speak through the door.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: The doctor said, Abbie won’t be
dialog: able to have kids.
text: Look of confusion and heaviness on Julie. She opens the door,
text: tube filled with urine in her hand.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Why’d she take you?
text: Julie’s jealous.
dialog: 46.
text: We watch her follow Jamie’s instructions, it all gets more
dialog: and more real for her.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Now what?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Um, shake for 10 seconds.
text: She shakes the vial. Counts to ten, very nervous. He inspects
text: it, reads the next part of the instructions.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
text: Leave undisturbed for 2 hours.
text: She's shocked.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Two hours?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Yeah, that’s what it says. If it

scene_heading: EXT. JULIE’S SAN YSIDRO CREEK, UNDER BRIDGE - DAY
text: Jamie and Julie stand in front of a long circular tunnel and

text: inhales, coughs. Looks at the cigarette.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: That’s not how guys smoke. Don’t
dialog: hold it like that.
text: She imitates a real guy smoking.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Like this. Hold it like this.
text: He echoes her smoking moves. Still off.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Okay now walk, do like a cool
dialog: cigarette walk.
dialog: 47.
text: He walks.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Guys don’t look like they’re
text: thinking about what they look like.
text: JULIE IMPROVS acting like a man: holding a cigarette,
text: posture, walking. Jamie follows, mostly thinking this is just
text: a laugh.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: See?
text: He continues imitating her, but then he coughs. He throws his
text: cigarette away, grossed out. She teases him playfully.
speaker_heading: JAMIE JULIE
dialog: Smoking’s gross. No it’s not.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Gives you cancer.
scene_heading: EXT. JULIE’S SAN YSIDRO CREEK, UNDER BRIDGE - LATER
text: Julie and Jamie sit and talk. She smokes.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It’s just my opinion, I think being
dialog: strong is the most important
dialog: quality, it’s not being vulnerable,
dialog: not being sensitive, it’s not even
dialog: about being happy, it’s about
dialog: strength and your durability
text: against the other emotions.
scene_heading: INT. JULIE’S BEDROOM - DAY
text: They come back into the room. Julie’s upset, Jamie looks into
text: the EPT test.
speaker_heading: JAMIE

speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Hello -

speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: What was that? What does that mean?

speaker_heading: ABBIE (V.O.)
dialog: And then William told me he didn’t

speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I read this. The chapter on home birth.
dialog: It was pretty helpful.
text: He digs into it, he’s a mystery to them. Does he read something

speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: I’m into older women.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Oh? How old are you?
text: Abbie whispers, he repeats.
speaker_heading: JAMIE

speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Good answer.
speaker_heading: JAMIE ABBIE
dialog: Age is a bourgeois construct. OK, OK.
text: All in front of Trish...
speaker_heading: ABBIE (CONT’D)
dialog: If she asks any questions, just say

dialog: - cars, carpentry, electrical,
dialog: plumbing, you can do anything. You
dialog: could have more than that.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: That’s not how most people see
dialog: it... What about you? What happened

speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: He didn’t turn out like I thought

speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Must’ve been something good about
dialog: him.
text: She stops and thinks.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
text: He was left handed.
dialog: She acts it out.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: I’m right handed, so in the

dialog: stock reports together, he could
text: write with his left hand and
dialog: scratch my back with his right.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: That's it?
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: I liked that.

dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: You ever meditate?
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: He’s sitting on the edge of his bed, eyes closed. Dorothea’s
text: in a chair across from him, sneaking peeks at him.
text: There is something calming about it, and his strange little
text: room with his pottery in it. She finds her cigarettes, lights
text: up. The sound wakes him up, she mimes ‘keep going, I’m fine,
dialog: I’m just gonna smoke while I meditate.’
text: William laughs, enjoys her humor, they share a look.
text: He smiles at her.
