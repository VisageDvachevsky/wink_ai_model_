dialog: Wes Craven's
text: A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET
scene_heading: 1A. INT. (MONTAGE). 1A.
text: NIGHTMARE MUSIC THEME begins as we FADE UP on a SERIES OF SHOTS,
text: all CLOSE and teasing.
text: -- A man's FEET, in shabby work shoes, stalking
text: through a junk bin in a dark, fire-lit, ash-
text: dusted place. A huge BOILER ROOM is what it
dialog: is, although we only glimpse it piecemeal.
text: Then we SEE a MAN'S HAND, dirty and nail-bitten,
text: reach INTO FRAME and pick up a piece of METAL.
text: -- ANOTHER ANGLE as the HAND grabs a grimey
text: WORKGLOVE and slashes at it with a straight
text: razor, until its fingertips are off.
text: -- CLOSE ON SAME HANDS dumping four fishing knives
text: out of a filthy bag. Their blades are thin,
text: curved, gleaming sharp.
scene_heading: -- MORE ANGLES, EVEN CLOSER. We can HEAR the MAN's
dialog: wheezing BREATHING, but we still haven't seen
dialog: his face. We never will. We just SEE more metal
text: being assembled with crude tools, into some sort
text: of linkage -- a splayed, spidery sort of apparatus,
text: against a background light of FIRE, and a deep
text: rushing of STEAM and HEAVY, DARK ENERGY.
dialog: -- And then we see this linkage attached to the glove.
text: -- Then the BLADES attached to all of it.
text: -- Then the MAN'S HAND slips into this glove-like
text: apparatus, filling it out and transforming
text: it into an awesome, deadly claw-hand with
text: four razor/talons gleaming at its blackened
text: fingertips. Suddenly the HAND arches and STRIKES
text: FORWARD, SLASHING THROUGH a DARK CANVAS, tearing
text: it to shreds.
scene_heading: 1. EXT. LOS ANGELES. NIGHT. (2nd Unit) 1.
text: A PULSATION OF LIGHT AND SHADOW. MUSIC DROPS AWAY to a hushed
text: RUSHING OF WIND and DISTANT SIRENS. CAMERA RACKS INTO FOCUS on a
text: HIGH PANORAMA of the San Fernando Valley, its night sky lit from
text: within by a strange GREENISH LIGHT. TITLES BEGIN.
text: CAMERA TILTS DOWN and ZOOMS SWIFTLY into the valley's web of
dialog: light.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: 2. INT. CONCRETE PASSAGEWAY. 2.
text: TITLES CONTINUE as TINA GRAY, a strong girl of fifteen in a thin
text: night shift, moves towards us down a dark concrete corridor. Her
text: steps quicken as TITLES appear in the portion of frame she leaves
dialog: free.
text: A subliminal COLLAGE of SOUND threads in and out of the MUSIC.
text: Distant insane LAUGHTER. Slamming iron DOORS. A bleating animal
text: CRY. A LAMB, white and blank-faced, skitters across her path and
dialog: on into the dark. No reason why it's there.
text: Then another SOUND, much nearer -- the slithering SCRAPE of
text: something like fingernails across slate. It sets our teeth on
text: edge, twists the MUSIC, and sends TINA running.
scene_heading: 3. INT. BOILER ROOM. 3.
text: Suddenly TINA's a tiny figure running among huge boilers steam
text: pipes and catwalks -- a shadowed forest of iron and stone. She
text: stops, listening intently as the SOUND of tiny hooves suddenly
text: turns into the rattle of DISTANT RAIN.
text: Then she hears RIPPING FABRIC.
text: Someone is shouldering behind a ragged screen of dirty canvas,
speaker_heading: approaching TINA.
text: CLOSER ON THE CANVAS. The long curved fingerblades suddenly
text: punch through, flashing in the firelight, and begin ripping
text: through the thick fabric, as easily as scalpels through flesh.
text: They make a hideous, extended RIPPING SOUND.
text: TINA rushes away, hands over her ears.
text: ANOTHER ANGLE -- as the blinded girl stumbles backwards. Then
text: the canvas flaps free. The blades are gone. The TITLES END, and
text: everything goes silent.
text: CAMERA CIRCLES until TINA's looking right into our eyes. The
text: light from a nearby boiler pours through her thin night dress,
text: leaving her naked and vulnerable. Then a deep, ragged VOICE
text: whispers at her as CAMERA CLOSES IN ON HER FACE.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: One two, Freddie's coming for
dialog: you...
text: TINA opens her mouth to scream but only a dry, yellow dust pours
text: out. And at that precise moment a huge shadowy MAN with a grimey
text: red and yellow sweater and a weird hat pulled over his scarred
text: face lunges at her. And it's his fingers that are tipped with
text: the long blades of steel, glinting in the boney light and giving
text: the hulk the look of an otherworldly predator.
text: TINA dodges away, her legs suddenly elephantine and slow. The
text: MAN seizes the trailing hem of her nightgown and hauls her back.
text: The MUSIC shrieks as TINA manages to tear free -- the MAN lurches
text: after her with a hoarse SHOUT as we --
speaker_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: 4. INT. TINA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 4.
text: TINA convulses in bed with a SCREAM, looking around wildly.
text: Someone is KNOCKING on her door.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: You okay, Tina?
text: TINA'S MOTHER sticks her head in with a worried look. TINA sits
text: up and blows out a breath, groggy.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Just a dream, Ma...
dialog: (more to herself)
dialog: Damn dream, is all...
text: The woman, once attractive, ventures a step into the room. A MAN
text: hovers BACKGROUND. TINA'S mother waves him away without looking,
text: shoving a strand of bleached hair from her eyes. She appraises
dialog: her daughter.
speaker_heading: TINA'S MOTHER
dialog: Some dream, judging from that.
text: She nods at TINA's nightshift.
text: TINA looks down at her nightgown, only now aware of the chill
text: penetrating it from the room. There are four long slashes up its
text: middle, cleanly cut as if by scalpels.
speaker_heading: MAN (OS)
dialog: (distant, annoyed)
dialog: You coming back to the sack or
dialog: what?
speaker_heading: TINA'S MOTHER
dialog: Hold your horses.
dialog: (lower, to Tina as she
dialog: stands to leave)
dialog: You gotta cut your nails or stop
dialog: that kind of dreaming, Tina. One
dialog: or the other.
text: The woman shuts the door behind her. TINA looks back to her
dialog: nightgown.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: (low)
dialog: Oh, shit.
text: She suddenly snatches up the cross that hangs over her head, her
text: face white as her sheet.
speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK
speaker_heading: BURN ON
scene_heading: 5. THE FIRST DAY 5.
speaker_heading: CHILDREN (OS)
dialog: (singing)
dialog: One two, Freddie's coming for you...
dialog: Three four better lock your door
dialog: Five six grab your crucifix...
scene_heading: 6. EXT. HIGH SCHOOL. DAY. 6.
text: FADE UP ON SHOT OF this large highschool and its crowds of
text: STUDENTS. FOREGROUND, TINA climbs out of a cherry-red 1959
text: Cadillac convertible with two other students, best friend NANCY
text: WILSON, and Nancy's boyfriend and owner of the car, GLEN LANTZ.
text: FOREGROUND several GRADESCHOOLERS are playing jump-rope, and the
text: old ditty they sing continues unbroken from TINA's bedroom.
speaker_heading: ROPE JUMPERS
dialog: Seven eight, gonna stay up late!
dialog: Nine ten -- never sleep again!
text: 7. MOVING ANGLE FAVORING NANCY. She's a pretty girl in a letter 7.
text: sweater, with an easy, athletic stride and the look of a natural
text: leader. GLEN, holding her hand, wears one of the school's
text: football jerseys; a good-natured, bright kid. Tina's in
text: mid-conversation.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: (referring to kids' song)
dialog: That's what it reminded me of --
dialog: that old jump rope song.
dialog: (shudders)
dialog: Worst nightmare I ever had.
dialog: You wouldn't believe it.
text: Nancy nods.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Matter of fact I had a bad dream
dialog: last night myself...
text: TINA turns to NANCY, but before either can say more, ROD LANE, a
text: lean, Richard Gere sort in black leather and New Wave studs joins
text: up with them and interupts.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: (to Tina)
dialog: Had a hardon this morning when
dialog: I woke up, Tina. Had your name
text: written all over it.
text: Tina cracks her gum with a look of withering indifference.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: There's four letters in my name,
dialog: Rod. How could there be room
dialog: on your joint for four letters?
text: The guy's stopped in his tracks.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Hey, up yours with a twirling lawn
dialog: mower!
text: He cuts off across the lawn.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Rod says the sweetest things.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: He's nuts about you.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Yeah, nuts.
text: TINA makes a face and rakes her fingernails across a tree as she
dialog: passes.
speaker_heading: TINA (CONTD)
dialog: (yawns)
dialog: Anyway, I'm too tired to worry
dialog: about the creep. Couldn't get
dialog: back to sleep at all.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So what you dream?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Forget it, the point is, every-
dialog: body has nightmares once in a while.
dialog: No biggy.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Next time you have one, just
dialog: tell yourself that's just all
dialog: it is, right while you're having
dialog: it, y'know? That's the trick.
dialog: Once you do that, you wake right
dialog: up. At least it works for me.
text: TINA looks at GLEN sharply. He kisses NANCY and darts off for
dialog: class.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Hey! You have a nightmare too?
dialog: But GLEN's gone.
speaker_heading: TINA (CONTD)
dialog: Maybe we're gonna have the Big
dialog: Earthquake. They say things get
dialog: weird just before that...
text: BELLS ARE RINGING, and STUDENTS crowding; TINA and NANCY are
text: drawn into the crush.
speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK
scene_heading: 8. EXT. A VALLEY STREET. NIGHT. 8.
text: ANGLE ON A MODEST HOME; no car, just a couple of BIKES in the
text: drive. Every light in the house and yard is turned on. We HEAR
text: the rock group MADNESS played at a 'No adults home' volume.
scene_heading: 9. INT. TINA'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 9.
text: ON GLEN, dialing. Nancy and TINA are watching, giggling.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: I can't believe his mother let him
dialog: come over here.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Right. Well, she didn't, exactly...
text: GLEN shoves a cassette into TINA's Ghetto Blaster.
speaker_heading: GLEN
speaker_heading: (to TINA)
dialog: See, I got this cousin who lives
dialog: near the airport, that it's okay
dialog: for me to stay with, right? So I
dialog: found this sound effects tape at
dialog: Licorice Pizza, and...
text: The phone is answered. GLEN jerks the tone arm off the record
dialog: with a SCRUUPT!!
speaker_heading: GLEN (CONTD)
dialog: Hello, Mom?
dialog: (pushes the 'play' button)
dialog: Yeah, out here at Barry's.
text: A JET PLANE begins to make itself heard on the tape. GLEN moves
text: the machine closer to the phone. It's a big plane -- sounds like
text: a 747 coming in for a landing.
speaker_heading: GLEN (CONT)
dialog: Huh? Yeah, noisy as usual. Glad
dialog: we don't live here -- huh? Yeah,
text: Aunt Eunice says hello.
text: The Jet is SCREAMING IN now, full flaps and howling like a
text: monstrous banshee. NANCY and TINA dissolve into muffled
dialog: giggles.
speaker_heading: GLEN (CONT)
dialog: (shouting over the din)
dialog: Right, right -- I'll call you in the
dialog: morning! Right! Huh? Yeah, sure,
dialog: I, huh?...
text: Suddenly the tape goes silent. GLEN blanches. Next moment
text: another ENGINE is heard, but this one is a FORD LOTUS screaming
dialog: by at 180 mph.
speaker_heading: GLEN (CONT)
dialog: (reacting to his mother's
dialog: reaction)
dialog: Uh... some kid's drag racing
dialog: outside, I think...
text: The sound effect changes abruptly to a SPEEDING SEDAN -- and the
text: ages-old SCREECH of BRAKES, last-second SCREAM and horrible
text: COLLISION. NANCY gamely tries to find the right button to turn
text: it off, but misses. There's a loud SCREEK of fast-forward mayhem
text: -- Glen improvises desperately.
speaker_heading: GLEN (CONT)
dialog: Listen, Mom, I got to go -- I
dialog: think there's been an accident out
dialog: front -- I --
text: NANCY jumps back from the cassette player -- WORLD WAR II bursts
scene_heading: out at top volume -- MACHINE GUNS, HAND GRENADES, DIVING BEARCATS
text: and SHOUTS of charging Huns. GLEN makes a last-ditch dive and
text: flings the cassette out of the machine.
text: Blessed silence at last.
speaker_heading: GLEN (CONT)
dialog: Right. I'll call the police. No,
dialog: just some neighbors having a fight,
dialog: I guess. I'm fine, I'm fine!
dialog: Call you in the morning!
text: He hangs up and sags back.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Worked like a charm.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Jesus.
text: TINA shoves another cassette in, and MICHAEL JACKSON'S 'THRILLER'
text: blasts from the STEREO. The kids relax, the CAMERA GLIDES PAST
text: THEM TO THE WINDOW.
text: The WIND is moving the bare TREE BRANCH outside. CAMERA PANS
text: BACK to the comfortably threadbare room, uneasy. We see NANCY
text: poking at a flame in the hearth as TINA comes FOREGROUND to draw
text: the drapes.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Nice to have a fire.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Really. Turn 'er up a little.
text: NANCY turns a nearby valve handle, and the gas fire climbs
text: brightly over its artificial log. TINA joins her, heartened.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Maybe we should call Rod, have him
dialog: come over too. He might get jealous.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Rod and I are done. He's too much
dialog: of a maniac.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: He should join the Marines, they
dialog: could make something out of him.
text: Like a hand grenade.
text: TINA laughs despite herself. NANCY brightens.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: See? You've forgotten the bad
dialog: dream. Didn't I tell you?
text: TINA shakes her head, wishing she had forgotten.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: All day long I been seeing that
dialog: guy's weird face, and hearing
dialog: those fingernails...
text: NANCY looks up with a flinch.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Fingernails?
dialog: (blinks, laughing)
dialog: That's amazing, you saying that.
dialog: It made me remember the dream I
dialog: had last night.
text: TINA looks up.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: What you dream?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I dreamed about this guy in a
text: dirty red and yellow sweater;
dialog: I dream in color, y'know; he
dialog: walked into the room I was in,
text: right, right through the wall,
dialog: like it was smoke or something,
dialog: and just stared at me. Sort of
dialog: ...obscenely. Then he walked
text: out through the wall on the
dialog: other side. Like he'd just
dialog: come to check me out...
text: The story has left the room deathly quiet. Especially TINA seems
dialog: effected.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: So what about the fingernails?
text: NANCY remembers, imitating the frightful coincidence.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: He scraped his fingernails
dialog: along things -- actually, they
dialog: were more like fingerknives or
dialog: something, like he'd made them
dialog: himself? Anyway, they made
dialog: this horrible nose --
dialog: (imitates)
dialog: sssssccrrrtttt....
text: TINA pales.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Nancy. You dreamed about the
dialog: same creep I did, Nancy...
text: The girls stare at each other.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: That's impossible.
text: They look at him. He looks away, as if suddenly listening.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: There's somebody out there,
dialog: isn't there...
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I didn't hear anything...
text: Then there's an unmistakeable SOUND. A distinct SCRAPING against
text: the house, just outside the window. Something multiple, thin and
text: sharp. Something like metal fingernails. NANCY's mouth opens a
dialog: fraction of an inch.
scene_heading: 10. EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE. NIGHT. 10.
text: CLOSE ON FRONT DOOR as a BOLT UNLOCKS, a KEY TURNS, a CHAIN is
text: REMOVED. At last the door swings open and GLEN swaggers out.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: I'm gonna punch out your ugly
dialog: lights, whoever you are.
text: No answer but a slight RUSTLE in the bushes. GLEN does a 180 and
text: walks right back inside. The girls prod him right back out,
text: giddy with giggling fear.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: It's just a stupid cat.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Then bring us back its tail
text: and whiskers.
text: The girls push him farther. GLEN edges towards the shadows.
text: Then the SCRITCHING again. GLEN stops; TINA edges back into the
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Anyway, I don't have a cat...
text: ANGLE INTO THE SHADOWS. Turned from the girls, GLEN sobers,
text: listening. IN HIS POV we see the street. Silent houses.
text: Motionless trees on empty lawns.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Kitty-kitty? Chow chow chow?
text: Not a living, or dead, soul. GLEN turns back to the girls with a
text: shrug. Instantly, a large FIGURE pounces and throws him to the
text: ground with a shout.
text: The girls SCREAM in panic and run for the house.
text: 11. REVERSE -- ROD leaps up and shouts like a sportscaster -- 11.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: And it's number thirty-six, Rod
dialog: Lane, bringing Lantz down just
text: three yards from the goal with a
dialog: brilliant tackle! And the fans
dialog: go wild!
text: ROD dances into the light, flashing a wild gypsy's grin at TINA.
text: The girl's relieved and frightened at the same time.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: What the hell you doing here?
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Came to make up, no big deal.
dialog: Your ma home?
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Of course. What's that?
text: ROD takes the spindly hand rake he's found and scraps the house's
text: wall. It makes a terrible SCRIIITCHING SOUND. He grins and
text: tosses it aside.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Intense, huh?
dialog: (sizes up the three)
dialog: So what's happening, an orgy or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Maybe a funeral, you dickhead.
text: ROD wheels, a knife suddenly in his hand, as if ready to take
text: Glen's throat out. NANCY breaks between --
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: -- Just a sleep-over date, Rod.
dialog: Just Tina and me. Glen was just
dialog: leaving.
text: ROD eyes GLEN, laughs and flips the knife closed and away,
text: putting his arm around TINA's shoulder and laughing as if it's
dialog: all a great joke.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: You see his face?
dialog: (lower)
dialog: Your ma ain't home, is she?
dialog: (to Nancy & Glen)
dialog: Me and Tina got stuff to discuss.
text: He pulls TINA inside without further ceremony.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Rod...
dialog: But ROD's already got himself and TINA halfway through the living
text: room, heading into the darker part of the house.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: We got her mother's bed.
dialog: You two got the rest.
text: ANGLE BACK ON GLEN AND NANCY.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: We should get her out of here...
text: TINA darts to the front door, her blouse half out.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Hey -- you guys're hanging around --
dialog: right?
dialog: (fake laughing/whine)
dialog: Don't leave me alone with this
dialog: lunatic -- Pleeeeze, NANCY!
text: She disappears. GLEN looks at NANCY. Too innocent.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: So we'll guard her together.
dialog: Through the night.
dialog: (moving closer)
dialog: In each others' arms like
dialog: we always said.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Glen. Not now. I mean,
dialog: we're here for Tina now,
dialog: not for ourselves.
text: She kisses him lightly, then pushes him back.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: Why's she so bothered by a
dialog: stupid nightmare, anyway?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Because he was scary, that's
dialog: why.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Who was scary?
text: NANCY turns and looks at him.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Don't you think it's weird, her
dialog: and me dreaming about the same
dialog: guy?
dialog: (GLEN looks away;
dialog: NANCY stares closer)
dialog: You didn't have a bad dream
dialog: last night, did you?
text: GLEN gives her a funny look.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Me? I don't dream.
text: He takes her inside. Over the SOUNDS of locks falling shut we
speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK
scene_heading: 13. INT. TINA'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 13.
text: FADE UP ON an old 50's CLOCK, one of those set into the black
text: plaster body of a stalking panther. It's just past 2 AM.
text: PAN the cold hearth and darkened living room to REVEAL GLEN on
text: the couch, cacooned in sheets. He's listening miserably to the
text: SOUNDS OF LOVEMAKING coming from the next room. TINA peaks, ROD
text: howls. Then silence.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Morality sucks.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 14. INT. TINA'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 14.
text: This is a slightly larger room than TINA's. Adult. Female.
text: Spare in its appointments. The streetlight throws the narrow bed
text: into broken shadow and light. TINA AND ROD lie in each other's
text: arms in the middle of the big bed. Satiated.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: I knew there was sometihng
dialog: about you I liked...
text: ROD yawns into the pillows, happy.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: You feel better now, right?
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Jungle man fix Jane.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: No more fights?
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: No more fights.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: (sleepily)
dialog: Good. No more nightmares for
dialog: either of us then.
text: He pulls the covers over his head. He's almost out already.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: (beat)
dialog: When did you have a nightmare?
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: (under the blankets)
dialog: Guys can have nightmares too,
dialog: y'know. You ain't got a corner
dialog: on the fucking market or something.
text: He rolls over, practically snoring, and pulls another cover over
text: his head. A dirty red and yellow cover.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: (sleepily)
dialog: Where'd you get this snotty old
dialog: thing?
text: SNORES from ROD. TINA yawns, turns off the light and snuggles
text: against ROD, pulling the cover gingerly over herself, too.
scene_heading: 15. INT. TINA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT 15.
text: CAMERA MOVES across the room of the original nightmare to find
text: NANCY alone in TINA's bed, staring at the slanting ceiling above
text: the bed. Thinking. We can just hear her HEART beating. She
text: sighs and turns on her side.
text: Immediately the wall above her head turns a faint reddish hue,
text: with a broad yellow smear across its center. All unseen by
text: NANCY, the wall begins to pulse in exact time with her heart's
dialog: beat.
text: CLOSE ON NANCY'S FACE. She closes her eyes.
text: ANGLE BACK UP ON THE CEILING JUST ABOVE HER HEAD. SOMETHING
text: presses against the surface from the inside. The plaster buldges
text: out as if suddenly elastic, taking the shape of the thing
text: pressing from inside -- taking the shape of a man's face. The
text: face opens its mouth. The knives rake through the surface.
text: ANGLE ON NANCY -- as plaster dust snows down on her.
text: She jerks awake, sitting bolt upright. The face retracts
text: suddenly -- the wall is normal.
text: ANGLE DOWN ON NANCY as she looks up to the ceiling, touching her
text: hair and feeling the plaster dust.
text: REVERSE IN HER POV TO THE CEILING. There are three parallel cuts
text: in the plaster there. About eight inches long. As if cut by
text: sharp knives. Nothing else.
text: Back on NANCY. She draws the covers around her and shivers.
text: Eyes wide open.
scene_heading: 16. EXT. TINA'S HOUSE. NIGHT. 16.
text: Not a car or person in sight. A stricken breeze dies in the
dialog: trees.
text: 17. ZOOM IN on the window of the room where TINA sleeps. By the time 17.
text: we're FULL IN CLOSE on it, the air is again still as death. A
text: moment later a PEBBLE bounces off the pane. The NIGHTMARE THEME
text: appears in the lower registers and holds its breath.
text: Another PEBBLE strikes, with a sharper RAP.
scene_heading: 18. INT. TINA'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 18.
text: CLOSE ON TINA'S FACE as her eyes open.
text: 19. REVERSE IN HER POV. Another PEBBLE clatters off the glass. 19.
text: 20. TINA raises slowly. 20.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: ROD...
text: SNORES FROM ROD. TINA sits up.
text: PAST HER TO THE WINDOW. The WIND MOVES AGAIN; the trees brush
text: the window with their shadows. Then another pebble. RAP! TINA
text: slips to the window.
scene_heading: 21. EXT. TINA'S BACKYARD. NIGHT. 21.
text: She looks out on an old yard with a patch of bananna trees
text: rattling in the Santa Ana winds. It seems deserted, though the
text: welling dark won't let her be sure. Then another pebble -- PAP!
text: -- hitting with a sharp RACK FOCUS.
text: 22. A LOW ANGLE TO WINDOW as TINA jumps back, startled. She hadn't 22.
text: seen that one coming. But she's drawn back to the glass out of
text: curiousity, straining to see in the dark. It's as if the stones
text: are materializing out of thin air.
scene_heading: 23. INT. TINA'S MOTHER'S ROOM. NIGHT. 23.
text: WHAP! This time a heavier stone, and a thin crack bristles
text: across the glass.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: (low)
dialog: Who the fuck you think you are,
dialog: whoever you are?
scene_heading: 24. EXT. TINA'S BACK YARD. NIGHT. 24.
text: WIDE ANGLE ON THE REAR OF THE HOUSE. A LIGHT COMES ON. TINA
text: appears in the doorway.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: (listening)
dialog: Somebody there?
text: She can see through the backward to a yawning gate and the back
text: alley. No one there. But a word is spoken, as if by wind.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (garbled)
dialog: Tina.
text: TINA straightens, unable to swallow. There's a ragged, obscene
text: GIGGLE. Deep in the throat. Phlegmy.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Who the hell is that?
text: TINA charges across the yard and through the gate, the MUSIC
text: chasing after.
scene_heading: 25. EXT. A SERVICE ALLEY. NIGHT. 25.
text: She brakes in the middle of the alley and whirls around.
text: Listening. Shivering in the same thin slashed nightgown.
text: A sharp crank of METAL, and fifty feet down the alley the lid of
text: an ash can rolls from the dark like a huge tin coin and spirals
text: noisily down.
text: 26. LOW REVERSE ACROSS LID TO TINA. Despite herself she comes over 26.
text: and touches it. She comes up with long worms on her fingers.
text: Next moment the exact same shambling MAN from her nightmare
text: staggers into view fifty feet behind her. TINA falls back into
text: the shadows, shaking the worms off her fingers in repulsion. The
text: MAN turns and starts directly for her, something shining on his
text: right hand as he spreads his arms wide. He starts scraping the
text: steel FINGERNAILS along a cinderblock wall. Orange sparks spurt
text: out -- his arms elongate until they reach from one side of the
text: alley to the other -- and TINA is cut off from her home!
text: CLOSE ON HER as the SCRAPING of the blades gets louder and
text: closer. She begins to shake uncontrollably.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Oh, shit, please God...
speaker_heading: KILLER
dialog: (softly, approaching)
dialog: This is God...
text: He holds up his steel-tipped hand like a surgical-steel spider.
dialog: TINA runs for her life.
text: 27. WIDER ANGLE IN THE ALLEY -- a terrifying, all-out footrace 27.
text: between the girl and her pursuer. The MAN is fast; the distance
text: between them closes with each heartbeat. TINA overturns ashcans
text: -- claws her way through a rotten back fence, hammers against a
text: window. Ashen FACES appear, recoil, pull curtains closed and
dialog: disappear in fright.
scene_heading: 28. EXT. TINA'S STREET. NIGHT. 28.
text: TINA runs out onto front lawns, SCREAMING for help. No help
text: comes. In fact, the only response is for all the porch lights on
text: the block to be turned off. The MAN roars out from behind a tree
text: -- a tree too narrow to have hidden him -- nearly upon the girl!
text: TINA runs in panic -- at last making her own home, only to be
text: trapped against its locked front door.
text: She hammers against its thick wood.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Nancy! Open the door -- Nancy!
text: The MAN slows. He has TINA now and knows it.
speaker_heading: MAN
text: She's still awake. Nancy can't
dialog: hear you.
text: TINA turns and looks full at the approaching MAN. Smudged by
text: deep shadow, he's big and hideous. He wears the same dirty
text: yellow sweater from the first nightmare -- from the wall-hanging
text: and blanket too -- and has the same sagging hat and leering grin
text: over his misshapen face. And on his fingers are the steel
dialog: talons.
text: 29. CLOSE ON HIM as he takes the blade on the end of his right index 29.
text: finger and lopes off one of the fingers of his left hand. Then
text: another. We SEE the PIECES OF FINGERS fall past TINA'S face in
text: SLOW MOTION.
text: ANGLE ON THE GROUND of the FINGERS squirming on the ground, one
text: flopping onto TINA's naked foot.
text: TINA leaps back, sickened, and begins stamping on then as if they
dialog: were huge bugs.
text: The MAN snaps up his arm and the FINGERS fly back into place on
text: his hand. He leers at TINA -- then suddenly lunges at her,
dialog: sweeping with his cutting hand!
text: TINA's no weak sister -- blocks his arm, deflecting the spines,
text: and grabs the MAN's ugly face with her other hand. But the face
text: only slides off to the bone. The MAN presses in, and TINA
text: contorts in horror as the knives slash across her shoulder --
text: cutting her deeply.
text: 29A. TINA staggers backward, GROANING, her foot now inexplicably 29A.
text: caught in bedclothes! She falls over her bed's conformter, twists
text: away from the man and, like a child, pulls the cover over her!
text: The skull-faced MAN crushes down, and there's a fierce grappling
text: -- punctuated by his GRUNTS and the girl's DEAFENING SCREAMS --
text: and they both become totally wrapped in the comforter -- until
text: they're beneath it, fighting for life and death.
scene_heading: 30. INT. TINA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 30.
text: ROD lurches up into CLOSE UP in the lightless bedroom,
text: half-awakened by the tremendous struggle somewhere, somehow
text: inside the dark bed. ROD grabs groggily, lifting the blanket.
text: 30A. IN HIS POV we glimpse the dark underside of the blanket -- see 30A.
text: TWO SHADOWY FIGURES flailing and clawing under the bedspread --
text: TINA and the MAN -- or a shape that could be a man -- raging
dialog: against each other.
text: ROD drops the blanket and leaps from the bed, scared full awake
text: and terrified. Then the horrible TINA's GASPS change to the
text: CRIES of a terribly wounded victim. ROD instantly jerks back the
dialog: bedspread.
text: IN HIS POV we SEE TINA struggling and flailing along on the
text: sheets, the MAN nowhere in sight.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: T-tina!?
text: Suddenly TINA -- eyes turned inward to her tormentor -- give an
text: awful jolt -- her arms and legs are spraddled as if by
text: overwhelming force and pinned to the bed. Next instant, her
text: nightgown flies apart and four long gashes chase across her
text: torso. From no visible instruments! A huge irrigation of blood
text: floods the bed.
text: Terrified, ROD dives for the light -- but at the same moment
text: something invisible grabs TINA, wielding her body in the air and
text: bringing it around in a swift blow that knocks ROD crashing into
text: the light -- smashing it to bits.
text: 31. CLOSER ON HIM as he struggles around. In the blue FLASHES OF 31.
text: ELECTRICITY ROD sees TINA sliding up the bedroom wall in a dark
dialog: smear, dragged feet first!
text: ANGLE ON ROD -- paralized by terror!
text: ANGLE ON TINA'S DYING EYES -- moving with her up the wall and
text: bumping around the corner onto the ceiling. She's just looking
text: at who's dragging her, eyes glazing.
text: REVERSE IN HER POV -- to the shadowy, horrendously ugly MAN,
text: dragging her with fierce glee across the ceiling, literally
text: swabbing the ceiling with her bloody body. SEEN in FORCED
text: PERSPECTIVE, the SHOT carries her across a great distance without
text: seeming to get anywhere -- as if the ceiling is an endless
dialog: plane.
text: ANGLE DOWN ON ROD -- on his hands and knees -- the lamp next to
text: him blurting blue SPARKS and STROBING the nightmare room. ROD'S
text: screaming up at TINA'S invisible tormentor.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: What the hell's going ON here!
dialog: Tina!
text: ANGLE ON TINA -- upside down, clawing at the hanging swag lamp
text: above her mother's dressing table -- desperate for some anchor.
text: But she's dragged away from it. The lamp swings back, it's wires
text: gushing more SPARKS.
text: CLOSER along the ceiling as TINA rakes a long furrow in the
text: ceiling with her fingernails. But her eyes are glazing,
text: glazing. And then they fall closed.
text: WIDE, UP ON THE CEILING, as her body suddenly flops loose,
text: hanging for an awful moment by the feet over the bed.
text: REVERSE ON ROD -- staring like a terrified child.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Tina --
text: REVERSE IN HIS POV -- as the body falls like a sack of rocks onto
text: the devastated bed, in SLOW MOTION, striking with a huge splash
text: of blood. A sick, awful GIGGLE floats around the room, then
text: ECHOES off into infinity. ROD staggers up, staring around as if
dialog: hoping to see this phantom.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: You motherfucker! I'll kill you
dialog: for that!
scene_heading: 32. INT. TINA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 32.
text: NANCY is sitting straight up in bed, terrified. The CRIES of ROD
text: are ringing through the whole house. She forces herself to move
text: -- bolting from the bed despite her terror and sense of dread.
scene_heading: 33. INT. HALLWAY. NIGHT. 33.
text: NANCY flies into the dark hall -- crashing directly into SOMEONE
text: who lurches out of the dark before her. She SCREAMS and jumps
dialog: back --
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: What the hell's going on!?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's
dialog: gone ape!
speaker_heading: ROD (OS)
dialog: (sobbing)
dialog: I'll kill you!
text: NANCY grabs the door; it's locked; she pounds on it. BAM! BAM!
speaker_heading: BAM!
text: Things fall into sudden, awful silence on the other side. GLEN's
text: voice cracks with fear.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Rod?
dialog: (silence)
dialog: Rod, you better not hurt Tina...
text: ROD erupts into terrible HOARSE LAUGHTER AND SOBBING. Then they
text: hear BREAKING GLASS.
text: GLEN barrels into the door like the football player he is. The
text: frame splinters and they're in.
scene_heading: 34. INT. TINA'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 34.
text: Just inside the door NANCY slips and goes down hard. GLEN finds
text: her in the dark more by touch than sight.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Yeah. Something slippering all
dialog: over here...
dialog: (feeling)
dialog: Tina?
text: No answer. The room is quiet as a tomb. Except for a stead
text: DRIPPING, from all over. Then GLEN finds a LIGHT SWITCH.
text: On the CLICK the devastation is revealed. There's BLOOD
text: everywhere: up the walls, over the clawed ceiling, soaking the
text: killing floor of the bed, and pooling in the dark red puddle
text: where NANCY has slipped and fallen.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Oh, shit...
text: NANCY wobbles up and sees TINA in the center of the ravaged bed.
text: Unmistakeably and utterly dead. NANCY presses against the wall,
text: then contorts and chokes.
speaker_heading: GLEN (CONTD)
dialog: (numb)
dialog: I...I'm gonna call the cops --
text: He bursts from the room.
text: 35. TIGHT ON NANCY. She turns away from the body in repulsion, 35.
text: sticking her head through the shattered window ROD LANE used for
text: his escape, sucking in the cold night air and moaning.
speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK
scene_heading: 36. EXT/INT. POLICE STATION. NIGHT. 36.
text: FADE UP ON RED LIGHTS and SIREN as an unmarked POLICE CAR speeds
dialog: to the curb.
text: LT DON THOMPSON, a decent-looking man in his mid-40's, exits and
text: punches a cigarette from his pack. His shaken aide, a uniformed
text: patrolman named PARKER, greets him. (CAMERA FOLLOWS them from
text: the car straight into the station and eventually to THOMPSON'S
speaker_heading: OFFICE.)
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to
dialog: wake you, but --
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: I'd've canned your ass if you
dialog: hadn't. What you got?
text: PARKER stumbles to open the door for THOMPSON as the man bulls
text: into the station at a furious pace.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Her name was Tina Gray. It
dialog: was her home. Father abandoned
dialog: ten years ago, mother's in
dialog: Vegas with a boyfriend. We're
text: trying to reach her now.
text: LT THOMPSON grimaces as if he knows the story.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: What's the Coroner got to say?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Something like a razor was
dialog: the weapon, but nothing
text: found on the scene.
text: THOMPSON is already to the desk officer SERGEANT GARCIA. The big
text: MAN shoves him a sheaf of papers --
speaker_heading: SERGEANT GARCIA
dialog: (wary)
dialog: Leautenant. You know who --
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: SERGEANT GARCIA
dialog: I put her in your office...
text: PARKER scurries after.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Looks like her boyfriend did
dialog: it. Rod Lane. Musician type,
dialog: arrests for brawling, dope --
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: Terrific. What the hell was
dialog: she doing there?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: She lived there.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: OMIT 37. I don't mean her -- OMIT 37.
scene_heading: 38. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. NIGHT. 38.
text: THOMPSON enters his office and confronts NANCY and her mother,
speaker_heading: MARGE SIMSON.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON (CONTD)
dialog: I mean you.
dialog: (accusingly, to Marge)
dialog: What the hell was she doing there?
text: MARGE SIMSON is in her middle thirties; a good-looking woman
dialog: despite the hour and circumstances.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Hello to you, too, Donald.
text: THOMPSON stops, the steam suddenly out of him. The girl is a
text: wreck and he winces to see it.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: Marge.
text: THOMPSON glances at PARKER and the other UNIFORMED COPS who are
text: in the room. As a man they head for the door. There's no
text: question who the boss is here. THOMPSON turns to NANCY. She
text: fumbles a smile.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON (CONTD)
dialog: How you doing, pal?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Okay. Hi, dad.
text: NANCY's dress is dark with dried blood, her skin clammy and the
text: color of paste. MARGE shoots her ex-husband a worried glance.
text: THOMPSON pulls a chair close to NANCY.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: I don't want to get into this now,
dialog: god knows you need time.
dialog: (hotter)
dialog: But I'd sure would like to know
dialog: what the hell you were doing
dialog: shacked up with three other kids
dialog: in the middle of the night --
dialog: especially a delinquent lunatic
dialog: like Lane.
speaker_heading: NANCY weaves.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Rod's not a lunatic.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: You got a sane explanation for
dialog: what he did?
text: The girl is shredding a Kleenex, staring off.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Apparantly he was crazy jealous.
dialog: Nancy said they'd had a fight,
dialog: Rod and Tina.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: It wasn't that serious...
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Maybe you don't think murder's
dialog: serious --
text: NANCY sits bolt upright in her chair, her eyes flashing.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: She was my best friend! Don't
dialog: you dare say I don't take her
dialog: death seriously!
dialog: (lower, near tears)
dialog: I just meant their fights
dialog: weren't that serious.
text: The girl holds the woman's eyes a moment, then looks away.
speaker_heading: NANCY (CONTD)
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: She dreamed this would happen...
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: She had a nightmare about somebody
dialog: trying to kill her, last night.
dialog: That's why we were there; she was
dialog: afraid to sleep alone.
text: A tear splashes off the arm of her chair.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: She's been through enough for one
dialog: night. You have her statement.
text: The mother and daughter rise; THOMPSON raps on the door and
text: PARKER opens it.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
speaker_heading: (to MARGE)
dialog: I suggest you keep a little better
dialog: track on her -- she's still a kid,
dialog: y'know.
text: MARGE wheels on him.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: You think I knew there were boys
dialog: there!? You try raising a
dialog: teenager alone.
text: Then she and the girl are gone. THOMPSON glares at PARKER.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
speaker_heading: (low to PARKER)
dialog: See they get home okay.
text: PARKER shoves his hands in his pockets. ON HIS FACE we
speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK
scene_heading: 39. INT. NANCY'S KITCHEN. MORNING. 39.
speaker_heading: BURN ON
speaker_heading: THE SECOND DAY
text: FADE UP ON MARGE SIMSON opening a new bottle of gin, pouring
text: herself a careful shot, drinking it, then chasing it with
text: coffee. Nearby a TV drones the morning news. We can't yet see
dialog: the SCREEN.
speaker_heading: TV NEWSCASTER (OS/FILTER)
dialog: In the headlines this morning --
dialog: a local teenage girl was brutally
text: murdered during an all-night party.
text: MARGE TURNS, startled, seeing NANCY coming downstairs.
text: The girl looks a little better than she did in the Police
text: Station, but her eyes are still red-rimmed, and a vacant stress
text: masks her face. She looks to the TV. Stops.
speaker_heading: TV NEWSCASTER (CONTD)
dialog: Police say the victim, fifteen-year
dialog: -old Christina Grey, had quarrelled
dialog: earlier with her boyfriend, Rod
dialog: Lane, a punk rocker with a history
dialog: of delinquency. Lane is now the
text: subject of a city-wide manhunt.
dialog: According to --
text: 39A. The TV PICTURE has begun featuring a HANDHELD NEWSREEL SHOT of a
text: dark rubber BODY BAG being carried to a CORONER'S VAN. Just
text: before the thing is lifted inside, TINA'S bloodied, white ARM
text: slips from its zippered side and lolls into the dark night air.
text: A man rudely shoves it back inside and pulls the zipper up the
dialog: rest of the way.
text: 39B. WIDER -- as NANCY pales visible. MARGE darts to the TV and slaps
text: it off, then turning to NANCY. She looks at the girl a moment,
text: then goes to her and hugs her.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (kind)
dialog: Where you think you're going?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: School.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I could hear you tossing and
dialog: turning all night, kiddo. You've
dialog: no business going to school.
text: NANCY pulls away, determined.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I gotta go to school, Mom.
dialog: Please. Otherwise I'll just
dialog: sit up there and go crazy
dialog: or something.
text: MARGE studies her face a moment.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Did you sleep?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I'll sleep in study hall, promise.
dialog: I'd rather keep busy, you know?
text: She absently drains the woman's coffee cup -- then pecks her
dialog: cheek.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Right home after.
speaker_heading: NANCY (cont'd)
dialog: Right home after. See you.
text: MARGE watches the girl disappear outside, then lights a cigarette
text: from the one already burning in her fingers.
scene_heading: 40. EXT. STREET. DAY. 40.
text: MUSIC slips back in, subtle but tense as we TRACK with NANCY as
text: she walks alone down a sidewalk edged with thick flowering
text: Oleander. She cocks her head, puzzled, as if sensing something.
text: MUSIC mounts. NANCY looks across the street.
text: 40A. REVERSE IN HER POV. A MAN is over there in dark clothes, reading 40A.
text: a newspaper, but really watching her.
text: 40B. NANCY shrugs and continues on, then stops and looks back again. 40B.
text: 40C. IN HER POV we SEE the MAN is gone. 40C.
text: 40D. Next moment -- with a MUSIC STING -- a BLOODIED HAND jumps out 40D.
text: from the opposite direction, clamps over NANCY'S mouth and drags
text: her into the bushes.
scene_heading: 41. EXT. BUSHES. DAY. 41.
text: NANCY struggles, twisting against the powerful assailant.
text: A WIDER ANGLE REVEALS ROD LANE -- barefoot, clad only in jeans
text: and leather jacket, still caked with dark blood. The rest of his
text: skin is pale as a ghost's.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: I'm not gonna hurt you.
text: He releases her warily. NANCY makes no move to run or scream,
text: even though several STUDENTS pass on the nearby sidewalk. This
text: reassures ROD just a little.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Your old man thinks I did it,
dialog: don't he?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: He doesn't know you.
dialog: (eyeing the blood)
dialog: Couldn't you change?
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: The cops were all over my house.
dialog: (shivers)
dialog: They'll kill me for sure.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Nobody's gonna kill you.
text: He runs his hands down his face, trying to believe that. The two
dialog: study each other.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: I never touched her.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: You were screaming like crazy.
text: NANCY says this without accusation, just cool observation.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Someone else was there.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: The door was locked from your
dialog: side.
text: ROD grabs her hard. His muscular body tenses.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Don't look at me like I'm some
dialog: kind of fucking fruitcake or
dialog: something, I'm warning you.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Morning, Mr. Lane.
text: 42. The boy jerks around. NANCY's father, his .38 leveled right at 42.
text: ROD's belly, eases out of the bushes.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
text: Now just step away from her, son.
dialog: Like your ass depended on it.
dialog: I'm warning you.
text: ROD backs away, looking once at NANCY with a look of terrible
text: sadness. Then he dives out of the bushes and runs like hell.
text: THOMPSON snaps his revolver to fire -- but instinctively NANCY
dialog: jumps between --
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: No!
text: THOMPSON jerks his gun into the air, furious.
speaker_heading: THOMPSON
dialog: Jesus -- are you crazy!?
text: He plunges past the girl.
scene_heading: 42A. EXT. STREET. DAY. 42A.
text: ROD races like a frightened animal across the lawns -- but is
text: soon cut off by the PLANECLOTHESMAN NANCY saw watching her before
text: -- and then TWO UNIFORMED POLICEMAN, who close from another
text: angle. The chase is short and pitifully off-balance, and ROD is
text: soon wrestled to the ground. Next moment one of the cops is
text: holding ROD'S knife into the air for THOMPSON to see. THOMPSON
text: looks at NANCY, as if to say 'I told you.' Background, ROD'S
text: SHOUTS can be heard as he's shoved into a SQUAD CAR.
speaker_heading: ROD (O.S.)
dialog: I didn't do it -- !
dialog: (fading)
dialog: I didn't kill her, Nancy!
text: The car's door slams and ROD is gone. NANCY turns to her father,
dialog: livid.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: You used me, daddy!
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: What the hell you doing going to
dialog: school today, anyway -- your
dialog: mother told me you didn't even
dialog: sleep last night!
text: NANCY spins angrily and walks away.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: Nancy! Hey!
dialog: But she just keeps going.
speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK
scene_heading: 43. INT. CLASSROOM. DAY. 43.
text: FADE UP ON an ENGLISH TEACHER and CLASS, NANCY among the kids,
text: trying to concentrate.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: According to Shakespeare, there
dialog: was something operating in Nature,
dialog: perhaps inside human nature itself,
dialog: that was rotten -- a canker, as
dialog: he put it.
text: The TEACHER'S eyes glance across the room. ANGLE ON NANCY;
text: yawning but listening.
speaker_heading: TEACHER (CONTD)
dialog: Of course Hamlet's response to
dialog: this, and to his mother's lies,
dialog: was to continually probe and
dialog: dig -- just like the gravediggers --
dialog: always trying to get beneath the
dialog: surface. The same was true in a
dialog: different way in Julius Caesar.
dialog: Jon, go ahead...
text: She nods to a SURFER who's been waiting uncomfortably in front of
text: the class. He squints at his book and begins, the recitation a
text: struggle between baked and salted brain and the poetry of the
dialog: Bard.
speaker_heading: SURFER
dialog: (reading aloud)
dialog: Uh, In the most high and palmy
dialog: state of Rome...
speaker_heading: WISEGUY STUDENT (O.S.)
dialog: California's the most high and
dialog: palmy state, man.
text: The SURFER halts with a grin; KIDS snicker.
speaker_heading: ENGLISH TEACHER
dialog: Can it.
text: She glares them back into silence. The SURFER starts over, as we
text: CUT TO NANCY.
text: She's nodding off now, barely able to keep her eyes open in the
text: warm, close boredom of the classroom.
speaker_heading: SURFER (O.S.)
dialog: In the most high and palmy state
dialog: of Rome, a little ere the mightiest
dialog: Julius fell...
dialog: (NANCY's head pitches
text: forward; she jerks it
dialog: back up, barely awake)
dialog: The graves stood tenantless, and
text: the sheeted dead did squeak and
text: gibber in the Roman street...
text: 44. NANCY's head has sunk again, eyelids drawn as if by enormous 44.
text: weight. By the time her cheek's against the desk, the SURFER'S
text: VOICE is ECHOED and DISTANT. But another voice, TINA'S, is very
text: near, very much present. A sad, thin plaint.
speaker_heading: TINA (O.S.)
dialog: Nancy.
text: NANCY gives a start. Her eyes lock onto something.
text: 45. REVERSE. TILTED SIDEWAYS, IN HER HEAD'S POV, we look straight 45.
text: out through the open doorway of the classroom into the hall.
text: There, standing in a black pool of fluid, is a full-sized rubber
text: body bag. Dark red and yellow. Weaving slightly, the merest
text: suggesting of movement within it.
text: 46. BACK ON NANCY, sitting upright, wiping the sleep from her eyes, 46.
text: shaking her head like a punchy prozefighter. She looks back out
dialog: the door.
text: 47. REVERSE IN 'NORMAL' POV -- the hallway is empty. But there's a 47.
text: dark smear on its floor tiles.
text: 48. NANCY looks nervously towards the rest of the class. No one else 48.
text: has noticed a thing outside the door. All are dumbly spellbound
text: by the SURFER, who now recites like a deep-voiced robot, his face
text: wreathed by white hair.
speaker_heading: SURFER
dialog: O God, I could be bounded in a
dialog: nutshell and count myself a king
dialog: of infinite space, were it not
dialog: that I have bad dreams...
text: 49. ANGLE BACK ON NANCY. She slips from her seat, eye warily on the 49.
text: teacher and class. But no one turns as she disappears through
dialog: the doorway.
scene_heading: 50. INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY. DAY. 50.
text: NANCY turns and looks both directions. No sign of anybody.
speaker_heading: TINA (O.S.)
dialog: (distant)
dialog: Nancy.
text: NANCY wheels and sees the bag, prone on the tiles at the far end
text: of the hall, at the end of a long snail's trail of slime. A pale
text: hand thrusts out of it. A moment later, as if pulled by
text: invisible gravity, the bag slides out of sight into an
text: intersecting corridor.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Tina!
text: NANCY starts running for it.
text: 51. ANGLE AT THE CORNER as NANCY races blindly around the turn and 51.
text: smashes straight into a BODY lunging at her from the opposite
dialog: direction! Both go down.
text: 52. ANGLE AT THE FLOOR. A dazed freshman HALLGUARD cranks herself up 52.
text: on one elbow. She wears a plastic plaque on her red and yellow
text: sweater that reads 'Hall Guard'. Her nose is bleeding from the
dialog: impact.
speaker_heading: HALLGUARD
dialog: Y-you're not supposed to run.
dialog: W-where's your pass -- you got a
dialog: pass?
dialog: NANCY leaps up --
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Screw your stupid pass!
text: 53. She turns -- sees the body bag halfway down this darker, narrower 53.
text: hall, upright again. But just as she sees it, it tips and
text: pitches headlong through a doorway -- like some godawful rotten
text: tree finally timbering down. She can hear the sickening
text: CRUNCHING of it falling down a long flight of stairs.
text: NANCY runs for it again. The HALLGUARD staggers up FOREGROUND,
text: bleeding profusely from her eyes and ears.
speaker_heading: HALLGUARD
dialog: Hey, no running in the halls!
text: The HALLGUARD raises her hand and we see it's tipped with long
dialog: metal spikes.
text: REVERSE ANGLE AT THE DOOR as NANCY runs up. NANCY turns to check
text: out the HALLGUARD. She's vanished. NANCY turns and looks down
text: through the open door. The MUSIC sweeps through a strange,
text: brooding movement of strings, mounting towards the NIGHTMARE
speaker_heading: THEME.
scene_heading: 54. INT. A STAIRWELL. 54.
text: NANCY edges into the stairwell and looks down. Looks like
text: there's a fire somewhere down there, from the way the orange
text: light dances. But there's only a low WHITE NOISE.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Tina?
text: No answer. NANCY starts down the stairs.
scene_heading: 55. INT. BOILER ROOM. DAY. 55.
text: NANCY comes off the stairs into a dank boiler room. The smear
text: trail is there. It runs behind a cracking, red-hot boiler the
text: size of a diesel locomotive. Everything about the place feels
text: dreadfully wrong, and the MUSIC is deep into the NIGHTMARE THEME
dialog: when it pauses.
text: TIGHT ON NANCY. Slow terror moves into her face. There's a low,
text: sinister GIGGLE.
text: 56. REVERSE IN HER POV -- we see a tangle of pipes, shadows, and the 56.
text: tainted fire of the huge boiler. Then from behind this, deeply
text: shadowed but still identifiable, steps TINA's KILLER. The same
text: filthy red and yellow sweater and slouch hat, the same melted
text: face twisting into a smile, the same GARBLED LAUGH as he slides
text: the long blades from beneath his shirt and fans them on the ends
text: of his bony fingers.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Gonna get you.
text: 57. The leering MAN brings the bloodied scalpel-fingernails across 57.
text: his own chest, splitting a nipple. Yellow fluid pours out.
speaker_heading: MAGGOTS and WORMS.
text: NANCY forgets the question -- jerks around and flees in blind
text: panic into the first opening she sees -- a dark pipe tunnel.
scene_heading: 58. INT. PIPE TUNNEL. 58.
text: ANGLE IN THE NARROW PASSAGEWAY. In the BACKGROUND the killer
text: shambles towards her; FOREGROUND NANCY breaks into a run.
text: The killer sprints -- NANCY tears ahead into darkness.
text: She flees deeper and deeper into the labyrinth of steaming,
text: SIZZLING pipes, squeezing through smaller and smaller openings.
text: The killer is just yards behind her, and soon she's trapped, just
dialog: as TINA was before her.
text: She presses her back to the wet bricks. There's no hope of
text: fighting him off, for NANCY is not as strong as TINA. But she is
dialog: smart as hell, and thinking even in this nightmare. So by the
text: time the creep has raised his knives to strike, NANCY has
text: realized something. She wheels and shoves her arm against one of
text: the scalding steam pipes. In the sme split second we HEAR her
dialog: flesh scald, we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 59. INT. ENGLISH CLASS. DAY. 59.
text: NANCY lurches up SCREAMING, arm raised to ward off the invisible
text: blow, books clattering to the floor -- other GIRLS nearby SCREAM
text: in surprise as she stumbles over them. Then she stops, confused
text: and groggy from the nightmare.
text: WIDER ANGLE. EVERYBODY is staring at NANCY as if she's gone
text: mad. The ENGLISH TEACHER rushes over, herself frightened by the
text: terror in the girl's eyes.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Okay -- Okay, Thompson! Every-
dialog: thing's all right now -- Nancy!.
text: 60. NANCY jerks around with panicked eyes, expecting the killer to 60.
text: leap from any direction. But there's only the sea of staring
dialog: eyes.
text: NANCY begins methodically picking up her books.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: I'll call your mother.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: No! No, really, I'm fine. I'll go
dialog: straight home. I'm okay.
text: She marches for the door.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: You'll need a hall pass!
text: But the girl's gone.
scene_heading: 61. EXT. THE SCHOOL. DAY. 61.
text: NANCY walks out of the building, shaken. Then she pauses at one
text: of the big pine trees out front, stops and rests her head against
text: its bark, teeth set. NANCY starts to shake, and next second
text: she's sobbing like a broken-hearted, frightened child. OMIT 61A.
speaker_heading: OMIT 61A.
text: 62. But she shakes herself silent. Wipes the tears away with a slash 62.
text: of sleeve. She rubs her arm absently, lost in thought, then
text: reacts in surprise and pain. She lifts her arm and stares at the
text: spot she's touched.
text: INSERT ON HER ARM and the BURN there; about the size and shape of
dialog: a half-dollar.
text: WIDER ON NANCY. Utterly, chillingly confused.
text: 62A. TINA, against the tree inches from NANCY, (SC 7) -- turns to her and
dialog: says --
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Couldn't get back to sleep
dialog: at all.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What you dream?
scene_heading: 63. EXT. A BUSY STREET. DAY. 63.
text: NANCY is walking quickly, head erect, jaw set. Then she enters
dialog: her father's Police Station.
scene_heading: 64. INT. VAN NUYS POLICE STATION. DAY. 64.
text: NANCY crosses directly to the GARCIA.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: My dad here?
text: GARCIA looks up from his paperwork.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT GARCIA
dialog: Lieutenant.
text: LT THOMPSON emerges from another room, uneasy to see NANCY.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: Decide to take a day off after
dialog: all?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
text: THOMPSON doesn't miss a beat.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: Only family allowed, Nancy. You
dialog: know the drill.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Just want to talk to him a second.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: He's dangerous.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: You don't know he did it.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: No, I know, thanks to your
dialog: own testimony, that he was
text: locked in a room with a girl
dialog: who went in alive and came
text: out in a rubber bag.
text: NANCY flinches; her father shows the first signs of color in his
dialog: neck.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I just want to talk to him.
dialog: (beat, lower)
dialog: Please, Dad.
text: THOMPSON shifts almost imperceptibly towards GARCIA, then turns
text: back to NANCY.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: Make it fast.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 65. INT. CELL AREA. DAY. 65.
text: A GUARD exits pushing a cart of food trays. NANCY waits warily
text: until he's gone, then looks back to ROD LANE. ROD looks more
text: like a captured coyote than a human; haggard, ribbed, expecting
text: poisoned bait. His hair is wet, his clothes are borrowed jeans
dialog: and work shirt.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (low)
dialog: And then what happened?
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: I told you.
dialog: (reluctantly)
dialog: It was dark, but I'm sure there
dialog: was someone else IN there, under
text: the covers with her.
speaker_heading: NANCY reacts.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: How could somebody get under
dialog: the covers with you guys
dialog: without you knowing it?
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: How the fuck do I know?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don't expect you to believe
dialog: me.
text: NANCY studies his encrypted eyes. Surprisingly, she looks like
text: she just might believe him. She leans closer with a new
dialog: thought.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: What he look like? You get
dialog: a look at him?
text: He looks away.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Well then how can you say
dialog: somebody else was there?
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Because somebody cut her. While
dialog: I watched.
text: Now the place is so quiet you can hear heartbeats.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Somebody cut her while you watched
dialog: and you don't know what he looked
dialog: like?
text: ROD smiles an insane smile, stuck with a reality no one will
dialog: buy.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: You couldn't see the fucker.
dialog: You could just see the cuts
text: happening, all at once.
text: NANCY gives a twitch.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: What you mean 'all at once'?
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: (low)
dialog: I mean, it was as if there were
text: four razors cutting her at the
text: same time. But invisible razors.
dialog: She just... opened up...
text: By now he's picking at a clot of dark blood on his jacket, as if
text: it was a scab on his own body. Then he catches NANCY watching
text: and turns away to the back of the cell. He smashes his fist into
text: the wall -- bone-crushing blows that scare the wits out of
speaker_heading: NANCY.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Rod!
text: He stops, and his fist is dripping blood as he says in a small,
dialog: sad voice.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: I probably could've saved her
dialog: if I'd moved sooner... But I
dialog: thought it was just another
dialog: nightmare, like the one I had
dialog: the night before.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: There... was this guy who had
dialog: knives for fingers...
text: CLOSE ON NANCY, unable to swallow the gorge rising in her
text: throat. ROD turns to her, and to his surprise she's ashen.
speaker_heading: ROD (CONTD)
dialog: Do you think I did it?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK
scene_heading: 66. EXT. ELM STREET / NANCY'S HOME. NIGHT. 66.
text: FADE UP ON ESTABLISHING SHOT as a spooky WIND sets a DOG BARKING
text: down the block. A CAR goes by, then this pleasant residential
text: street falls into silence. CAMERA has MOVED IN on NANCY's
text: well-tended two-story home.
scene_heading: 67. INT. NANCY'S KITCHEN. NIGHT. 67.
text: The house is in shadow. Alone, MARGE scrapes the last of the
text: evening's dishes and slips them into the dishwasher. Neither she
text: nor her daughter has touched the food. But MARGE is well into a
text: bottle of gin; her appetite for that is growing, right along with
text: her dread. She turns and looks up the stairs, calling.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Nancy, don't fall asleep in
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: NANCY (OS)
dialog: I won't.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Get into bed.
scene_heading: 68. INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM. NIGHT. 68.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I will.
text: NANCY'S in the tub, so drowsy she can hardly rinse without
text: falling asleep. The water in the tub is opaque with suds.
dialog: Luxurious.
text: CLOSER ANGLE, AT WATER LEVEL ON NANCY. Her eyes droop. She
text: slides closer to the surface of the water, letting its heat sooth
text: her nerves. Her eyes stare straight up, glazed; her breathing
text: deepens.
text: REVERSE, across to her legs, crooked, one knee on each side of
text: the tub. There's a ripple in the water between. Then something
text: tiny and shiny breaks the surface between them. It pops up with
text: a slithering MUSIC CUE and catches a sliver of light. Then it
text: begins to rise.
text: Higher and higher it rises, soon accompanied by another, then two
text: more shining, gleaming blades, and then the full glove and dark
text: hairy hand and then the wrist and arm, straight up light an evil
text: sapling between the girl's knees, the knives bloosoming into a
text: bright flower of razor sharp steel in the air, moving over the
text: girl's belly. The hand rears back, the claws arch to strike.
speaker_heading: MARGE (OS/APPROACHING)
dialog: Nancy?
text: MARGE raps on the door. The instant she does NANCY jerks up,
text: opening her eyes groggily. The dark wet arm, hand and knifes are
dialog: gone.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARGE (OS)
dialog: (through the door)
dialog: You're not falling asleep,
dialog: are you? You could drown,
dialog: you know.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Mother, for petesakes.
speaker_heading: MARGE (OS)
dialog: It happens all the time.
dialog: (brighter)
dialog: I've got some warm milk all
dialog: ready for you. Why don't you
dialog: jump into bed?
dialog: (fading)
dialog: I'm gonna turn on your electric
dialog: blanket, too. C'mon, now.
dialog: (then she's gone into
dialog: another room)
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (low)
dialog: Warm milk. Gross.
text: She slides down to water level again, and sings softly,
dialog: thoughtfully to herself.
speaker_heading: NANCY (CONTD)
dialog: One, two, Freddie's coming for
dialog: you, three four, better lock
dialog: your door, five six, grab your
dialog: crucifix, seven eight gonna
dialog: stay up late, nine ten, never
dialog: sleep again...
text: The next instant she's jerked with incredible violence straight
text: down beneath the surface of the tub -- as if the bottom had
text: suddenly dropped out and she was in a bottomless well!
scene_heading: 68A. EXT. UNDERWATER SHOT. NIGHT. 68A.
text: LOOKING UP PAST HER ANKLES we SEE NANCY pulled sharply down into
text: really deep water, the dim light of the surface and bathroom
text: beyond receding with each yank. And yet she somehow flails and
text: gasps and struggles back towards the surface, managing by pure
text: panic to break the surface with her hands!
scene_heading: 68B. INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE BATHROOM. 68B.
text: MARGE rushes to the door and listens, alarmed at the wild
text: SPLASHING audible through the locked door.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Nancy! NANCY!
scene_heading: 68C. EXT. UNDERWATER SHOT. NIGHT. 68C.
text: MARGE'S VOICE reaches to the girl, who thrusts up through main
text: force and breaks the surface with her head and shoulders.
scene_heading: 68D. INT. BATHTUB. 68D.
text: Gasping and choking, NANCY breaks the surface of her bathwater,
text: like a drowning sailer getting one last chance. Her mother's
text: VOICE booms over her, ECHOED and frantic -- and the loud BANGING
text: on the door finally opens her eyes. She turns and calls gasping
dialog: to her mother --
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Mommy!
text: REVERSE ON THE DOOR -- as MARGE, using the old hangar through the
text: doorhandle truck, makes it into the room. She rushes across to
text: the tub. NANCY is staggering up in the bathwater, again with
text: solid porcelain beneath her feet.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I told you! Hundreds of people
dialog: a year drown like that!
text: The mother throws a towel around the gasping girl, helps her from
text: the tub and begins drying her like a child. NANCY looks like
text: she's likes paralized with some sort of weird dread.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Great
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (not believing it for
dialog: a minute)
dialog: To bed with you, c'mon.
text: MARGE rushes out to get the room ready. NANCY turns and looks at
text: herself in the cabinet mirror, then opens the medicine chest and
text: begins a quick, furtive search.
text: CLOSER as she takes out the box of No Doz and slips it into her
dialog: robe.
scene_heading: OMIT SCS. 69 & 70------------------------------- OMIT SCS. 69 & 70
scene_heading: 71. INT. HALLWAY. NIGHT. 71.
text: NANCY emerges from the bathroom yawning. MARGE follows as the
text: girl plods obediently to her room.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: No television, forget the
dialog: homework, no phone calls.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: No, Mother. Yes, Mother.
dialog: No, Mother.
scene_heading: 72. INT. NANCY'S ROOM. NIGHT. 72.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: And no school tomorrow, either.
dialog: you take a little vacation, relax
dialog: and rest for a change.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Yes, Mother. G'night.
text: MARGE offers a smile, and a little yellow pill.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Take this, it'll help you sleep.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Right.
text: NANCY pops it in her mouth and swallows obediently. MARGE leans
text: to her with a kiss.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Sleep tight, don't let the
text: bedbugs bite.
text: MARGE goes out, relieved. NANCY closes the door, leans against
text: it and spits the pill into her hand. She tosses it straight out
text: her window and takes a NoDoz.
speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK
scene_heading: 73. OMIT OMIT 73.
text: 74. FADE UP ON INSERT OF TELEVISION SCREEN. 74.
text: A MONSTER MOVIE in BLACK AND WHITE. NO SOUND from the set.
text: 75. PULL BACK to REVEAL NANCY propped up in bed, furtively watching. Or 75.
text: is she just thinking? A bedside CLOCK reads 12:45 pm.
text: The girl YAWNS. She shakes herself violently and sits up
text: straighter, forcing herself to concentrate on the movie.
text: 75A. ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN. A DIVER struggles to keep facing a 75A.
text: large circling shark.
text: 75B. ON NANCY. Her eyes droop shut -- then she jerks awake, rattling 75B.
text: her head as if it were a radio drifting off station. She tumbles
text: out of bed, throws open the window and takes a deep breath of the
text: cool night air.
scene_heading: 76. EXT. NANCY'S HOUSE AND STREET. NIGHT. 76.
text: HIGH ANGLE, AT SECOND-STORY LEVEL. NANCY looks directly across
text: the street to a lighted, open window. Its curtains, sucked out
text: and waving in the night breeze, give the only motion to the
text: deserted street.
text: Then someone pitches out of the dark at her. NANCY gives a YELP
text: -- then clamps her hand over her mouth as she recognizes GLEN,
text: balanced precariously on the rose trellis outside her window.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Sorry! Saw your light on.
dialog: Thought I'd see how you were.
text: She gets herself together, barely.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Sometimes I wish you didn't live
text: right across the street.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Shut up and let me in. You ever
dialog: stand on a rose trellis in your
dialog: bare feet?
scene_heading: 76A. INT. NANCY'S ROOM. NIGHT. 76A.
text: NANCY looks over her shoulder to make sure her mother hasn't
text: heard. GLEN's already through her window and planted on her
text: bed. NANCY points to a chair.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: If you don't mind.
text: GLEN crosses to the chair and plops down.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: So. I heard you freaked out
dialog: in English class today.
text: There's no maliciousness in his voice, and the familiar frankness
text: is actually comforting to NANCY.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Guess I did.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Haven't slept, have you?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Not really.
text: NANCY tries to smile, but can't fake it very well. GLEN looks
dialog: her over.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: You look dead and rained on, if
dialog: you want the ugly truth. And
dialog: what you do to your arm?
text: She shrugs, trying to keep it casual.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Burned myself in Englsh class.
text: She hazards a look in the mirror, and her jaw drops.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: M'god, I look twenty years old.
dialog: (turning back to him)
dialog: You have any weird dreams last
dialog: night?
speaker_heading: GLEN
text: Slept like a rock.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (pleased)
dialog: Well at least I have an objective
dialog: wall to bounce this off.
dialog: (off)
dialog: You believe it's possible to dream
dialog: about what's going to happen?
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: You believe in the Boogey Man?
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: One two, Freddie's coming
dialog: for you? No. Rod killed Tina.
dialog: he's a fruitcake and you know it.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: You believe in anything?
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: I believe in you, me, and
dialog: Rock and Roll. And I'm not
dialog: too sure about you lately.
speaker_heading: NANCY thinks.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Listen, I got a crazy favor
dialog: to ask.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Uh-oh...
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: It's nothing too hard or anything.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm just going to... LOOK
dialog: for someone, and... I want
dialog: you to be sort of a ...guard.
dialog: Okay?
text: GLEN makes the Twilight Zone sound.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Okay, okay.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I think.
text: She comes very close to him.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: You won't screw up, right? I
dialog: mean, a whole lot might depend
dialog: on it.
text: The way she's looking at him gives him the creeps.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Okay, I won't screw up.
text: 77. Nancy takes a deep breath. Then without another word turns off 77.
text: the TV and the light.
speaker_heading: GLEN (IN DARK)
dialog: Jesus, it's dark in here.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Shhh. Now listen, here's what
dialog: we're gonna do...
scene_heading: 78. EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT. 78.
text: FADE UP ON NANCY, still in her pajamas, walking through the
text: shadowy streets near her home, listening for the slightest
text: sound. We MOVE with her. But nothing, not even the dog barking
text: earlier, is there now. NANCY peers into the darkness of lawns
text: and trees behind her.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (stage whisper)
dialog: You still there?
text: Across the street and a distance away, GLEN steps from behind a
dialog: tree.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Yeah. So?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Just checking -- keep out of
dialog: sight!
text: GLEN throws up his hands in exasperation and walks back out of
text: sight. NANCY turns and looks down between the houses, deep into
text: a dark alleyway. Then she forces herself to walk into it.
scene_heading: 79. EXT. ALLEY. NIGHT. 79.
text: MOVING WITH HER as she makes herself go deeper and deeper into
text: shadows. Each time she pauses and waits, the MUSIC grows more
text: threatening and expectant. The feeling is of immense tension --
dialog: we're sure the killer will come screaming out on her at any
dialog: second.
text: But he doesn't. In fact absolutely nothing happens, and NANCY
text: emerges from the far end of the alley unscathed. The only thing
text: strange is that she now finds her self looking across the mall to
scene_heading: 80. EXT. POLICE STATION. NIGHT. 80.
text: The Police Station. It takes her a little by surprise, it just
dialog: seems to have appeared.
text: MUSIC creeps into the NIGHTMARE THEME as NANCY whispers hoarsely
text: back down the dark alley.
speaker_heading: NANCY (CONTD)
dialog: Still there?
scene_heading: 81. EXT. ALLEY. NIGHT. 81.
dialog: We only HEAR the DISTANT VOICE, slightly ECHOED.
speaker_heading: GLEN'S VOICE (OS)
dialog: (yawning)
dialog: Still here!
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: On your toes, right?
text: NANCY stares into the dark trying to see him, but she can't. She
text: turns back and makes up her mind to move without him in sight.
scene_heading: 82. EXT. POLICE STATION. NIGHT. 82.
text: MUSIC MOUNTS as we MOVE WITH NANCY across the lawns to the police
text: station, creeping to the first lighted window she sees. It's a
text: low, barred basement window, and NANCY reacts as soon as she
text: looks through it.
scene_heading: 83. INT. ROD'S CELL. NIGHT. 83.
text: NANCY'S POV down into ROD LANE's cell. The boy is on his rough
text: cot, twitching in disturbed sleep. And a long SHADOW is sliding
text: across the wall.
text: A big SHAPE appears in the shadowed corridor outside the boy's
text: cell, and as IT walks closer NANCY can barely see it's the
text: shambling, grimly scarred man with the filthy red and yellow
text: sweater and strange slouch hat pulled across his brow. The
text: KILLER from all of their nightmares.
text: And this giant shadow of a man passes through the bars of the
text: cell, like so much evil Jello. Halfway through he pauses,
text: turning to check over his shoulder. We see the bars clearly
text: penetrating his body, going in his head, passing out his ankles.
text: Then he turns back to ROD and moves forward, and within another
text: heartbeat is beside the boy.
scene_heading: 84. EXT. POLICE STATION. NIGHT. 84.
text: NANCY draws back sharply, swallowing in terror. She looks behind
dialog: her for help.
speaker_heading: NANCY (CONTD)
dialog: Glen.
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: NANCY (CONTD)
dialog: (louder)
dialog: Glen?!
text: The street is absolutely deserted. There is no motion, and no
text: sound save one: the distant but unmistakeable sound of GLEN
speaker_heading: SNORING.
speaker_heading: NANCY (CONTD)
speaker_heading: GLEN!
text: A beat of silence after the shout's echoes die, then the steady,
text: boyish SNORES again. NANCY swears under her breath and jerks
text: back around, forcing herself to look again into ROD's cell.
scene_heading: 85. INT. ROD'S CELL. 85.
text: IN HER POV -- the killer picks up ROD's bedsheet and tests it
text: between his powerful hands. Without thinking, NANCY bangs
text: against the glass.
speaker_heading: NANCY (CONTD)
dialog: Rod! Look out!
text: The KILLER wheels around, locking eyes with NANCY. The girl goes
text: white. The man's face is in the light, and it's horrible --
text: seething with hatred and a twisted, insane intelligence.
text: The hold of those eyes is only broken when ROD rolls up on an
text: elbow with a deep, troubled GROAN. The instant ROD does this,
text: the KILLER fades into the shadows in the cell. But even then his
text: eyes hold on NANCY's until the last second he's visible.
text: ROD looks around the cell groggily, runs his fingers through his
text: matted hair, then collapses back on his pillow. No matter how
text: hard NANCY screams, ROD never once looks at the window. He just
text: pulls the twisted covers about his shoulders and succumbs once
dialog: more to sleep.
text: And now the bed sheet is no longer on the bed. The KILLER,
text: materializing out of the shadow again, is holding it between his
text: hands like a garrote. He looks up and leers at NANCY, then moves
dialog: for ROD.
scene_heading: 86. EXT. POLICE STATION. NIGHT. 86.
text: ANGLE BACK ON NANCY. She pounds on the window, then turns in
text: frustration and yells into the night.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Glen!!
text: She turns back to the cell in desperation.
scene_heading: 87. OMIT OMIT 87.
scene_heading: 88. INT. ROD'S CELL. 88.
text: IN NANCY'S POV we look into a cell that is quite deserted save
text: for ROD. Sleeping peacefully.
scene_heading: 89. EXT. POLICE STATION. NIGHT. 89.
text: NANCY pulls back from the window, stunned.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I swear...
text: Suddenly NANCY feels utterly exposed. She shivers, chilled and
text: vulnerable to the bone in her thin night clothes. She can't
text: move. It's as if some great nerve between her instincts and body
text: had been severed. And she hears the SOUND behind her. A sort of
text: filling-vibrating Scrriiitchh.
text: MUSIC sneaks in -- the unmistakeable NIGHTMARE THEME, creeping
text: over her. NANCY forces herself, by sheer will, to look.
text: 90. Ahead of her perhaps twenty-five feet, covered with a thick 90.
text: plastic body bag through which we can barely see her face, is
text: TINA. Standing square in the middle of the street. A dark ooze
text: of BLACK EELS roil out of its bottom, and at its top, the zipper
text: CHATTERS down and the greenish-white face of TINA lolls out. She
text: gestures, supplicating, her watery eyes desperate to convey some
dialog: desperate message.
text: The MUSIC FALLS TO A HUSH.
text: 91. NANCY backs away, eyes streaming tears. 91.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Glen, where are you! Wake up!
dialog: Glen!
speaker_heading: DEEP RAGGED VOICE
dialog: I'm here.
text: NANCY twists around in horror at the same instant the KILLER
text: grabs for her face with his knife-fingers! The girl
text: intinctively pitches back, then scrambles up and runs like
dialog: hell!
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Glen! Glen!!!
scene_heading: 92. EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT. 92.
text: MOVING WITH NANCY at full gallop, running blind. She crashes
text: through a sawhorse into a new sidewalk, sinking into the wet
text: cement over her ankles. The stuff sticks to her legs in long
text: gluey globs and she can barely pull her feet loose.
text: The KILLER looms nearby,
text: mocking her -- his scalpel claws gleaming in the streetlight. He
text: just misses the girl as she wrenches free and flees again, now so
text: winded she can only stagger.
text: MOVING WITH THEM. Time after time NANCY just barely manages to
text: elude the shadowy form, leaping from his reach by inches and
text: pouring on more steam. It's too close to even bother screaming
dialog: now; and besides, that would take breath she doesn't have. The
text: only SOUND is of RUNNING FOOTSTEPS, RASPING BREATH and the
text: KNIFE-FINGERS WHISTLING through the air.
scene_heading: 93. EXT. NANCY'S HOME. NIGHT. 93.
text: NANCY tears across her front lawn and into the open front door of
text: her home, SLAMMING it with all her might. There's a tremendously
text: satisfying CONCUSSION of wood against doorframe, and the LOCKS
dialog: fall shut.
scene_heading: 94. INT. NANCY'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 94.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Glennn!!!
text: But her voice is garbled as if she's under water, and there's no
text: answer. The only clue to Glen being there at all is his distant
text: SNORING. Innocent. Persistent. Deep.
text: NANCY stops, breath in shreds, face smeared with dirt and tears.
text: Something is clawing the window in the dark of the kitchen.
text: NANCY looks and catches the MAN prying at the glass with his big
text: knife-fingers, the sharp blades SIZZLING against the edges of the
text: glass as they crack it away from the frame. NANCY runs upstairs
text: in blind panic.
scene_heading: 95. INT. NANCY'S ROOM. NIGHT. 95.
text: NANCY darts into her unlit bedroom, slams the door and locks it.
dialog: Safe at last.
text: She listens at the door. Nothing. She crosses to her bed. Next
text: second the KILLER dives through her window and seizes her in a
dialog: shower of shattered glass!
text: NANCY twists and manages to grab the wrist of his knife hand with
text: both of hers, barely keeping the blades from her throat.
text: The two fall backwards in a terrible, gasping struggle, crashing
text: onto NANCY's bed. Her grip is broken -- the MAN stabs -- NANCY
text: twists away, backed into a corner of bed and walls. Defenseless,
text: she snatches a pillow up; the KILLER lashes out -- disemboweling
text: the pilow and sending a great gush of feathers flying. NANCY
text: dives for escape in a virtual blizzard.
text: The KILLER manages to snare her with his other hand, and the two
text: crash across the bedside table to the floor, the table and all
text: its contents cascading around them in a whiteout of feathers.
scene_heading: ANGLE AT FLOOR LEVEL -- CLOSE ON NANCY'S AND THE KILLER'S HEADS.
text: The blades inch towards the girl's face -- the drool of the
text: grizzled shadow with the horribly scarrred face spills into her
dialog: eyes. Feathers are everywhere; MUSIC is absolutely insane!
text: But just when the points of steel are less than an inch from her
text: eyes, the old fashioned alarm clock thrown to the floor next to
text: NANCY's head goes off with a jarring RINGGGGGGG!
text: 96. Instantly the MUSIC STOPS. And a moment later the room is 96.
dialog: light.
text: WIDER as NANCY reels up, blinded by the sudden light, SCREAMING
text: AND FIGHTING on her bed.
text: ANGLE ON GLEN, lurching from his own sleep at the frightening
text: noise. He discovers NANCY pressed in terror against her
text: headboard, clutching a pillow like a drowning woman would a
dialog: straw.
text: It's an intact pillow, and there isn't a feather in sight.
text: NANCY stares incredulously at GLEN, then around the room,
text: untangling herself from her bedclothes. Wary and furious, her
text: voice hoarse.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Glen, you bastard...
text: The boy looks at his friend in groggy alarm. She's absolutely
text: livid, more angry than he's ever seen her, and more strange.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: What I do?
text: He reaches for her -- she flattens against the wall, eyes hard,
text: and terribly hurt, too.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (low)
dialog: I asked you to do just one thing.
dialog: Just stay awake and watch me --
dialog: Just wake me if it looked like
dialog: I was having a bad dream.
dialog: (eyes wild)
dialog: But you. You shit -- what do
dialog: you do -- you fall asleep!
text: She stops herself, wiping a bit of spittle off her lip, alarmed
text: at how out of control she's become. And suddenly she breaks,
text: sinking into her 	torn bedclothes and rubbing her head.
speaker_heading: NANCY (CONTD)
dialog: (mostly to herself)
dialog: I must be going nuts...
speaker_heading: MARGE (OS)
dialog: Nancy?
text: Her mother's door opens OS.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Oh, shit.
text: NANCY composes her voice as best she can.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Yes, mother?
text: MARGE's flip-flops approach outside the door. GLEN barrels out
text: the window -- NANCY dives for the bed, jams off the light and
text: disappears under the covers. MARGE, bleary eyed herself, opens
text: the door and flicks on the light.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: Yeah. Just had a little dream.
dialog: I'm falling right back to sleep.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Okay... You need anything, just call.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Okay.
text: MARGE closes the door. NANCY immediately sits up and looks at
text: the window. A single bone-white feather floats down in the
text: moonlight. Then it's sucked outside and is gone.
scene_heading: 97. EXT. POLICE STATION. NIGHT. 97.
text: GLEN's CADILLAC CONVERTABLE careens into the parking lot and
text: SCREECHES to a stop. GLEN and NANCY jump out and head for the
dialog: station.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: You mind telling me what's
dialog: going on?
text: NANCY's races into the station without answering.
speaker_heading: GLEN (CONTD)
dialog: Oh, I see. That makes it all
text: perfectly clear.
scene_heading: 98. INT. POLICE STATION. NIGHT. 98.
text: NANCY goes straight to the SERGEANT's desk.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Garcia, I want to see Rod
dialog: Lane again.
speaker_heading: GARCIA winces.
speaker_heading: SGT GARCIA
dialog: I thought when I took the
dialog: night shift I'd have peace
dialog: and quiet for a change.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: It's urgent, we've gotta see Rod.
speaker_heading: SGT GARCIA
text: It's three in the morning.
dialog: Your mother know you're out this
dialog: late?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (faking it)
dialog: Of course -- look, at least go
dialog: back and look at him. Just see
dialog: if he's okay.
speaker_heading: GARCIA glances at GLEN.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: (faking it)
dialog: We have reason to think there
dialog: might be something weird going
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON (OS)
dialog: Oh, no argument on that.
text: NANCY jumps around at the sound of her father's voice. LT
text: THOMPSON emerges from his office, rumpled and yawning.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Dad -- what you doing here?
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: It so happens I work here, and
dialog: there's an unsolved murder. I
dialog: don't like unsolved murders,
dialog: especially ones my daughter's
dialog: mixed up in -- what are you
dialog: doing here at this hour? You're
dialog: supposed to be getting some
dialog: sleep.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Listen, sir, this is serious.
dialog: Nancy had a nightmare about Rod
dialog: being in danger, or something,
dialog: and so she thinks...
text: He trails off, loosing it under LT THOMPSON's glare. Besides, he
dialog: doesn't know exactly what the hell's really going on himself.
text: GARCIA puts his beefy hand on NANCY's shoulder.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I just want to see if he's okay!
speaker_heading: SGT GARCIA
dialog: Take my word for it, Nancy. The
dialog: guy's sleeping like a baby. He's
dialog: not going anywhere.
scene_heading: 99. INT. CELL BLOCK. NIGHT. 99.
text: ANGLE ON ROD in his cell. He's asleep, all right, but not safely
text: so. His bedsheet has come alive. It twitches, pulsates, then
text: snakes towards his throat.
text: ROD stirs, the sheet falls still; ROD slips into deeper sleep,
text: and the sheet moves again, completing the noose around his neck!
scene_heading: 100. INT. BOOKING ROOM. NIGHT. 100.
text: NANCY makes a move for the cell block --
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: This isn't your average nightmare,
dialog: Daddy -- damn it!
text: The door's locked; she hauls on it in desperation.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: Now look, Nancy, don't push
dialog: it. You've already rubbed my nose
dialog: in sex, drugs and violence -- don't
dialog: start throwing in insanity!
text: NANCY takes that one to heart. She wheels on him and pleads, her
text: intensity sobering even to him.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Just go back and check -- please!
text: The man takes a beat, then shrugs and nods towards SGT GARCIA.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: Okay, Garcia. What the hell.
speaker_heading: SGT GARCIA
dialog: Right...
dialog: (feeling in his pockets)
dialog: Now where'd I put the key...
text: He mumbles backs towards his desk. MUSIC BUILDS as we HOLD ON
speaker_heading: NANCY'S FACE.
scene_heading: 101. INT. ROD'S CELL. NIGHT. 101.
text: With a terrible SNAP ROD's sheet jerks tight around his neck.
text: The startled teenager is hauled upright -- eyes popping, face
text: purple. He claws at the sheet, but despite his strength he can't
text: get his fingers between the noose and his windpipe. He's dragged
text: backwards across the cot.
scene_heading: 102. INT. BOOKING ROOM. NIGHT. 102.
text: GARCIA finally has the keys. Urged on by NANCY he fumbles with
dialog: the lock.
scene_heading: 103. INT. ROD'S CELL. NIGHT. 103.
text: ROD'S being dragged backwards, gasping and struggling in vain
text: against the powerful pull -- right across his cell and up the
text: wall, too. He clutches blindly at his throat at the far end of
text: the sheet coils around the bars of the high window. Then there's
text: a powerful wrench of the sheet, and ROD'S neck SNAPS. The kid's
text: body sags lifeless.
scene_heading: 104. ANGLE THROUGH THE BARS as NANY, GLEN, LT THOMPSON and GARCIA 104.
text: appear in the corridor outside, the girl sprinting ahead.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Rod!
text: But it's too late; NANCY sinks back in horror as her father and
text: GARCIA rush into the cell.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: Gimme a hand, dammit!
text: GLEN, pale as the sheet that's killed ROD, climbs to the bars and
text: unties the knot. ROD slides down over the SERGEANT'S shoulders,
text: limp as a marrionette with its strings slashed.
speaker_heading: SGT GARCIA
dialog: Goddamn loco kid -- he didn't
dialog: have t'do that -- Madre dios!
text: They lay ROD at NANCY's feet; a strange Pieta. NANCY's father
text: looks at her in spooked suspicion.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: How'd you know he was gonna do
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: NANCY says nothing.
speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK
scene_heading: 105. EXT. FOREST LAWN CEMETERY. DAY. 105.
speaker_heading: BURN ON:
speaker_heading: THE FOURTH DAY
text: FADE UP ON a stark afternoon. On a hill of sere grass
text: overlooking the valley, the casket of ROD LANE is lowered into
dialog: its grave.
text: A small group of FAMILY and FRIENDS watches soberly as the
text: MINISTER raises his hand in benediction.
speaker_heading: MINISTER
text: Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
dialog: May God be with this young man's
dialog: soul.
text: ON THE FACES of MARGE, LT THOMPSON, TINA'S MOTHER and ROD'S
text: PARENTS. Just for a second or two, in looks too rapid for an
text: outsider to even notice, these adults exchange looks. Furtive,
text: quick glances that suggest an immense something that they all
dialog: share, something beyond even this second death among their
text: children. Then they are all staring ahead again, as if the
dialog: others weren't even there.
speaker_heading: MINISTER (CONTD OS)
dialog: His life and his death attest to
dialog: the Scripture's warning that he who
dialog: lives by the sword shall die by
dialog: the sword.
dialog: ANGLE ON GLEN, watching --
text: NANCY, standing alone, not believing it for a minute.
speaker_heading: MINISTER (CONTD OS)
dialog: But let us recall also our Lord's
dialog: admonition that we 'Judge not,
dialog: lest we be judged.' Let us
dialog: attempt only to love. And may
dialog: Rod Lane rest in peace.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Amen to that much.
text: The mourners walk away from the grave, MARGE among them. She
text: pauses near a MAN and two WOMEN in black -- TINA'S MOTHER, ROD'S
text: PARENTS. They almost, it seems, speak. Then MARGE hurries on.
text: WE MOVE WITH HER as she's joined by LT THOMPSON. Both are worn
text: and on edge. THOMPSON absently lights another cigarette,
dialog: offering one to MARGE.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: How's Nancy doing?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I don't think she's slept since
dialog: Tina died.
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: She's always been a delicate
dialog: kid.
text: THOMPSON lights her cigarette, attempting some sort of
dialog: nonchalance.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: She's tougher than you think.
dialog: Any idea how she knew Rod was
dialog: gonna kill himself?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: No. All I know is, this reminds
dialog: me too much of ten years ago.
text: THOMPSON blows a plume of smoke against the hard sky and looks
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: Yeah. Well... Let's not start
dialog: digging up bodies just because
dialog: we're in a cemetery.
text: He gives her a look that could cut stone. MARGE toses down her
text: cigarete and crosses to NANCY. The girl is simply staring off
text: over the valley.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (very gently)
dialog: Time to go home, baby.
text: She moves her away from the brink of the hill.
scene_heading: 106. EXT. CEMETERY PARKING AREA. DAY. 106.
text: MARGE opens the door of the station wagon for NANCY. NANCY turns
text: to them both, speaking in a still, small voice.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: The killer's still loose,
dialog: you know.
text: She has a wild, Cassandra aspect that sends a chill right up
speaker_heading: MARGE'S spine.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: You saying somebody else killed
dialog: Tina? Who?
text: NANCY smiles a weird sort of smile.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I don't know who he is. But he's
text: burned, he wears a weird hat, a
dialog: red and yellow sweater, real
dialog: dirty, and he uses some sort of
dialog: knifes he's got made into a sort
dialog: of... glove. Like giant finger-
dialog: nails.
text: As NANCY has described this monster from her dream, unseen by
text: her, 	the faces of MARGE LT and THOMPSON have drained completely
dialog: of color.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: (low, even, to MARGE)
dialog: I think you should keep Nancy
dialog: at home a few days. 'Til she's
dialog: really over the shock.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I got something better...
speaker_heading: (to NANCY)
dialog: I'm gonna get you help, baby.
dialog: So no one will threaten you
dialog: any more.
text: She takes the girl by the arm and guides her into the car,
text: locking the door from outside. NANCY never taking her eyes from
text: her father's as the car bears her away.

speaker_heading: UCLA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE
speaker_heading: INSTITUTE FOR THE
scene_heading: STUDY OF SLEEP DISORDERS
scene_heading: 108. INT. A LABORATORY SLEEPING CHAMBER. 108.
text: A NURSE applies sencors to the head, breast, arms, and fingers of
text: NANCY THOMPSON. The girl is lying on a simple broad cot, in her
text: pajamas. The room is subdued in color and holds only this single
text: bed. A large mirror set into one wall hides an observation room
dialog: beyond.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: But I just don't feel... ready
dialog: to sleep yet. Please, do I
dialog: have to?
text: 109. WIDER, REVEALING DR SAMUEL KING, a young, curly-haired internist; 109.
text: intelligent and wry. He treats NANCY at all times like a young
text: adult, never patronizing. He winks as the NURSE finishes.
speaker_heading: DR KING
dialog: Don't worry, you're not gonna
dialog: change into Bride of Frankenstein
dialog: or anything.
text: NANCY manages a smile, but she's haggard and visibly thinner.
text: MARGE, background, looks downright distraught.
speaker_heading: DR KING (CONTD)
dialog: Nancy have any severe childhood
dialog: illnesses? Scarlet Fever?
dialog: High temperatures -- concussions?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: No, nothing.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: He means, did you ever drop me
dialog: on my head.
text: The doctor and girl share a nervous laugh; MARGE doesn't even
dialog: smile.
speaker_heading: DR KING
dialog: Nightmares are expected after
dialog: psychological trauma. Don't
dialog: worry, they go away.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I sure as hell hope so.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I don't see why you couldn't
dialog: just give me a pill to keep me
dialog: from dreaming...
speaker_heading: DR KING
dialog: Everyone's got to dream.
dialog: If you don't dream, you go...
text: (he drills his finger
dialog: at his temple)
dialog: All set?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: They're just simple tests,
dialog: Nan. We'll both be right
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: DR KING
dialog: Look, I know it's been fright-
dialog: ening, I know your dreams have
dialog: seemed real. But... it's
dialog: okay. Okay?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Please, Nancy. Trust us.
text: The girls gauges her mother, the doctor, the situation very
text: carefully. Then lowers her eyes.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: It's not you I don't trust.
dialog: It's...
dialog: (gives up)
dialog: Okay. Let's do it.
text: Greatly relieved, MARGE gives NANCY a goodnight kiss, then
text: follows the doctor through a doorway near the mirror. As soon as
text: her mother is out of sight, NANCY'S eyes drift to the mirror
text: itself. In its reflection she sees herself looking back, alone
text: on the bed.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: 110. INT. THE OBSERVATION ROOM. 110.
text: MARGE and DR KING overlook NANCY's sleeping chamber through the
text: one-way mirror. And KING monitors the girl even more closely
text: with a bank of instruments -- a mass of glowing dials, graphs and
text: meters. His manner with MARGE is slightly more sober.
speaker_heading: DR KING
dialog: How long's this been going on?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Since the murder. She was fine
dialog: before that.
speaker_heading: DR KING
dialog: Not to worry. No signs of path-
dialog: ology in Nancy's EEG or pulse
dialog: rate. I'd guess what we've got
dialog: is a normal young girl who just
dialog: happens to have gone through
dialog: two days of hell.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: It's just made her think...
dialog: her dreams are real...
text: KING adjusts a dial, watching the EKG like a hawk.
speaker_heading: DR KING
dialog: Ever hear the old Buddhist tale
dialog: about the King who dreamed he
dialog: was a beggar who dreamed he
dialog: was a king?
text: MARGE twitches. Then there's a slight alteration in the sound of
text: the EKG. KING nods in satisfaction.
speaker_heading: DR KING (CONTD)
dialog: Okay, good. She's asleep.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (immensely relieved)
dialog: Thank God.
text: MUSIC RISES SOLEMNLY, MAJESTICALLY into a haunting transition as
dialog: we
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO
text: 111. A MONTAGE OF SHOTS, of the EKG GRAPH, its inky needles calming, 111.
text: of a METER tracing the quieting of NANCY's pulse, and of OTHER
text: INSTRUMENTS, indicating life processes we can only guess. All
text: smoothing out.
text: 112. CLOSE ON NANCY on TV MONITOR, asleep like the child she is. 112.
dialog: Innocent.
text: MARGE lights a cigarette, angry at her helplessness.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: What the hell are dreams, anyway?
speaker_heading: DR KING
dialog: Mysteries. Incredible body
dialog: hookus pokus. Truth is we
dialog: still don't know what they
dialog: are or where they come from.
dialog: As for nightmares...
dialog: (leans closer)
dialog: Did you know that in the last
dialog: three years twenty Philipino
dialog: refugees in California died
dialog: in the middle of nightmares?
dialog: Not from heart attacks, either.
dialog: They just died.
text: He gives a "Ah don' know" shrug. MARGE looks out into the
text: sleeping room. NANCY is a motionless bundle in the middle of the
dialog: bed.
text: 113. ANGLE ON A NEEDLE on an EKG dipping to a lower reading. 113.
text: 114. WIDER ANGLE -- the mother and DOCTOR watching. 114.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: What happened? That needle
text: sank like a rock.
speaker_heading: DR KING
dialog: (quietly)
text: She's entering deep sleep now.
dialog: Heart rate's a little high due
dialog: to anxiety, but otherwise she's
text: nicely relaxed. All normal.
dialog: She could dream at any time now.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Right now she's like a diver
text: on the bottom of an ocean no
dialog: one's mapped yet. Waiting to
dialog: see what shows up.
scene_heading: 115. INT. THE SLEEPING ROOM. 115.
text: We can see NANCY drift from the initial stage, over the
text: brink into deep sleep. Her hair falls into her eyes; her face
text: relaxes; her shoulders curl round her like comforters. THE MUSIC
text: DEEPENS, and begins to hint at the tones of the NIGHTMARE THEME.
scene_heading: 116. INT. CONTROL ROOM. DAY. 116.
text: DR KING and MARGE watch the instruments' every move.
text: One of the machines begins a slight CHIRPING. KING scans it,
text: liking what he sees.
speaker_heading: DR KING
dialog: Okay, she's started to dream.
text: He leans forward in his chair, like a pilot starting an
text: instrument approach. MARGE THOMPSON licks her dry lips, fighting
dialog: a turn of nausea.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: How can you tell?
speaker_heading: DR KING
text: R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements.
dialog: The eyes follow the
dialog: dream -- their movement picks
dialog: up on this --
text: He prods a dial with his pencil and scribbles the time on a note
dialog: pad.
speaker_heading: DR KING (CONTD)
text: Beta Waves are slowing, too.
dialog: She's dreaming, all right.
dialog: A good one, too.
text: MARGE watches the TV MONITOR. It's in extra-close on NANCY's
text: eyes -- and they're darting beneath the lids, reacting to events
text: lost behind a skein of flesh and neurons.
text: KING points to a moving graph. A needle's begun waving lazily
text: between plus and minus three. The DOCTOR nods, assured.
speaker_heading: DR KING (CONTD)
dialog: Typical dream parameter. A
dialog: nightmare, now, would be plus or
dialog: minus five or six; she's just
dialog: around three point --
text: He stops. Outside, visible through the glass, NANCY twists
text: around. Eyes still closed, she's nevertheless holding her head
text: in the attitude of prey listening to the first faint sound of the
text: predator's approach.
text: MARGE looks from her daughter to the DOCTOR, color draining from
dialog: her face.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: What the hell's this? She
dialog: awake or asleep?
text: The needle of the graph gives a jagged pitch up, plunges, then
text: surges well above the eight mark. A strange MUSIC CUE --
text: disonant and threatening, creeps in -- the NIGHTMARE THEME
text: slurred into awful minors and weird disonance. KING stares at
text: the gauge in disbelief, rapping his finger on its glass.
speaker_heading: DR KING
dialog: Can't be. It never gets
dialog: this high...
text: The needle swings even higher, benind.
speaker_heading: DR KING (CONTD)
dialog: Jesus H. Christ.
text: He's cut off by the high-pitched KEENING of the girl, the SOUND
text: cutting through the double thickness of the glass like a lasar.
text: A warning BEEPER has begun, the instruments light up like a
text: Christmas tree -- and outside in the sleeping room, NANCY is
text: contorting as if shot through with a thousand volts. KING knocks
text: over his chair in his sprint for the door.
scene_heading: 117. INT. SLEEPING ROOM. 117.
text: The DOCTOR and MARGE come in on the run -- NANCY's flailing and
text: screaming as if the devil himself were after her. KING grabs her
dialog: to shake her awake;
text: ANGLE ON NANCY (eyes open) -- looking in terror -- SOUND ECHOED
speaker_heading: STRANGELY.
text: IN HER POV -- dressed in KING'S clothes -- the horribly scarred
speaker_heading: MAN reaches out.
text: WIDER -- (NANCY'S eyes closed in sleep) as the girl's fist shoots
text: out with incredible force and knocks DR KING flying!
text: The NURSE and MARGE both descend on her --
text: and again in her SLEEPING POV we see the MAN stagger for her.
text: WIDER ON NANCY -- (still in her nightmare) -- fighting like a
text: tiger with both MARGE and the NURSE -- sending the NURSE
text: sprawling -- leaving MARGE hanging on for dear life.
text: ANGLE on the stunned DOCTOR fumbling with a hyperdermic needle,
text: spilling most of the stuff on himself with his shaking hands --
text: the SCREAMS AND CURSES of NANCY are deafening and worthy of a
text: stevador fighting off his worst enemy. Stranger still, her hair
text: is electrified, standing on end and greying before their very
dialog: eyes!
text: MARGE screams at the top of her lungs.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: NANCY!!! IT'S MOM -- NANCY!!!!
text: Some deep bolt of psychic power smacks through the girl, and her
text: eyes flap open -- they're glazed with terror and fury, but open.
text: NANCY's awake.
text: She stares around like a cornered animal in the middle of the
text: bed, her purple face gasping out gut-wrenching SOBS. The NURSE
text: and MARGE dare to go back in and hold the sweat-drenched girl as
text: DR KING comes for her with the needle.
speaker_heading: DR KING
dialog: Now, this is just going to let
dialog: you relax and sleep, Nan --
text: With incredible swiftness, NANCY backhands the hypodermic into a
text: far wall, shattering it into a million pieces.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: No. That's enough sleep.
text: Her eyes are windows straight into white fire as she locks into
text: KING'S face. He dabs his split lip, swallowing painfully.
speaker_heading: DR KING
dialog: Okay, kid. Okay. Fair enough.
text: He holds out his hand. NANCY at last takes it, and sags back
text: into her pillow, exhausted. Then KING comes up with blood on his
dialog: hand.
text: He stares at it, dumbfounded, then at the girl. Across her left
text: forearm, a deep gash is bleeding freely, as if made by a very
dialog: sharp instrument.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Oh my god, oh my god...
speaker_heading: DR KING
dialog: (to the NURSE)
dialog: Get the kit!
text: The NURSE scrambles away as the DOCTOR claps his hand over the
text: wounds. He looks into NANCY's face. What he sees frightens him
text: even more: NANCY'S haunted, ghost-like eyes turn from him to her
text: mother, and a terrible, chilling smile opens across NANCY's white
dialog: lips.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: You believe this?
text: She pulls her free arm from beneath the sheets and reveals a
text: strange hat, filthy and worn -- the KILLER'S hat. The sight of
text: it frightens MARGE more than anything that's come before.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (deathly pale)
dialog: Where the hell did you get that?
text: NANCY fixes her with Xray eyes.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I grabbed it off his head.
text: MARGE stares at the hat as if it held her whole future, and her
dialog: future was a horror.
speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK
scene_heading: 118. EXT. NANCY'S HOUSE. DAY. 118.
speaker_heading: BURN ON
speaker_heading: THE SIXTH DAY
text: FADE UP ON NANCY'S HOUSE, early morning.
scene_heading: 119. INT. NANCY'S KITCHEN. DAY. 119.
text: MARGE is on the telephone, the dirty hat in her hand. Nearby is
text: a nearly empty bottle of gin.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: She said she snatched it off
text: his head in a dream.
dialog: (listens)
dialog: No, I'm not crazy, I've got
dialog: the damn thing in my hand!
dialog: (listens)
dialog: I know we did, we all...
speaker_heading: (hears NANCY
dialog: approaching)
dialog: Gotta go.
text: She hangs up and stuffs the hat and bottle into a drawer,
text: screening the action with her body. NANCY enters.
text: By now the girl has an extraordinary look. Her hair is ashen,
text: her skin transluscent, and eyes dark-ringed. Her right forearm
text: is heavily bandaged over the slashes. In short, instead of the
dialog: girl next door, we now could be looking at the lunatic from the
text: next cell. MARGE, though she does her best to hide it, is
text: downright frightened of her.
speaker_heading: MARGE (CONTD)
dialog: You didn't sleep, did you?
dialog: The doctor says you have to
dialog: sleep or you'll --
text: NANCY pours herself a cup of black coffee.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Go even crazier?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I don't think you're going
dialog: crazy -- and stop drinking
dialog: that damn coffee!
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Did you ask Daddy to have the
dialog: hat examined?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I threw that filthy thing away --
dialog: I don't know what you're trying
dialog: to prove with it, but --
text: NANCY comes closer, her eyes shining with a new sureness.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: What I learned at the dream
dialog: clinic, that's what I'm trying
dialog: to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina,
dialog: and he didn't hang himself.
dialog: It's this guy -- he's after
dialog: us in our dreams.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: But that's just not reality,
dialog: Nancy!
text: 120. Furious, NANCY janks open the drawer before MARGE can stop her 120.
text: and spills the bottle and hat onto the counter.
text: MARGE grabs away the bottle protectively -- but it's the hat
text: NANCY goes for. She waves it triumphantly -- demonically.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: It's real, Mamma. Feel it.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (horrified)
dialog: Put that damned thing down!
text: MARGE lunges for it -- NANCY leaps out of reach --
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: His name is even in it -- written
dialog: right in here -- Fred Krueger --
dialog: Fred Krueger! You know who that
dialog: is, Mamma? You better tell me,
dialog: cause now he's after me!
text: MARGE swallows, then persists in the lie.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Nancy, trust your mother for
dialog: once -- you'll feel better as
dialog: soon as you sleep!
text: NANCY shoots a hard humorless laugh, holding up her slashed arm.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: You call this feeling better?
dialog: Or should I grab a bottle and
dialog: veg out with you -- avoid
dialog: everything happening to me
dialog: by just getting good and loaded --
text: MARGE slaps her hard.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (losing it)
dialog: Fred Krueger can't be after you,
dialog: Nancy -- he's dead!
text: The room falls silent, both women staring at the other.
speaker_heading: MARGE (CONTD)
dialog: (low, raw)
text: Fred Krueger is dead. Dead and
dialog: gone. Believe me, I know. Now
dialog: go to bed. I order you, go to
dialog: bed.
text: MARGE snatches the hat away. NANCY is furious, betrayed.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: You knew about him all
dialog: this time, and you've been acting
dialog: like he was someone I made up!
text: MARGE pulls away.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: You're sick, Nancy. Imagining
dialog: things. You need to sleep,
dialog: it's as simple as that.
text: NANCY wheels and smashes MARGE'S bottle of gin in the sink.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Screw sleep!
speaker_heading: MARGE (CONTD)
dialog: Nancy!
text: But NANCY runs past her mother for the front door.
speaker_heading: MARGE (CONTD)
dialog: Nancy -- it's only a nightmare!
text: NANCY turns in the doorway.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: That's enough!
dialog: On the door SLAM, we
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: 121. EXT. SHAKESPEARE BRIDGE. DAY. 121.
text: ANGLE ON A NEIGHBORHOOD STREET. We hear GLEN's VOICE and PAN UP
text: to REVEAL NANCY and GLEN high above, two tiny figures walking
text: across this strange white bridge in old Los Angeles. CAMERA
text: BEGINS A SLOW ZOOM.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Whenever I get nervous I eat.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: And if you can't do that, you
dialog: sleep.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Used to. Not anymore.
text: GLEN jams more Big Mack into his face. By now our ZOOM reveals
text: he's attacking a huge bag of Big Macks, and furtively eyeing
text: NANCY. The girl's hair is startlingly white in the sunlight.
text: She's reading a book, hardly paying attention.
speaker_heading: GLEN (CONTD)
dialog: You ever read about the Balinese
dialog: way of dreaming?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: They got a whole system they
dialog: call 'dream skills'. So, if
dialog: you have a nightmare, for
dialog: instance like falling, right?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Instead of screaming and getting
dialog: nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna
dialog: make up my mind that I fall
dialog: into a magic world where I can
dialog: get something special, like a
dialog: poem or song.
dialog: (grins hopefully)
dialog: They get all their art literature
dialog: from dreams. Just wake up and
dialog: write it down. Dreamskills.
text: He stops, seeing the look on NANCY's face. Our ZOOM is much
text: closer now, a wide medium, and still coming in on the kids.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: And what if they meet a monster
dialog: in their dream? Then what?
speaker_heading: GLEN
text: They turn their back on it.
dialog: (grins hopefully)
dialog: Takes away its energy, and
text: it disappears.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: What happens if they don't do
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I guess those people don't
dialog: wake up to tell what happens.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Great.
text: She leans over the railing, poking her face back into her book.
text: GLEN tips its cover and reads its title. OUR ZOOM IS STILL
text: MOVING CLOSER, a MEDIUM CLOSE UP NOW.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: 'Booby Traps and Improvised
dialog: Anti-personel Devices'!
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I found it at this neat
dialog: survivalist bookstore on
dialog: Ventura.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: Well what you reading it for?
text: OUR ZOOM LOCKS IN ON A TIGHT TWO ON THEIR FACES, NANCY's grimly
dialog: determined.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I'm into survival.
text: She walks away, OUT OF FRAME, leaving GLEN watching after her in
dialog: astonishment.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: She's starting to scare the
dialog: living shit out of me.
scene_heading: 122. EXT. ELM STREET/NANCY'S HOME/EVENING 122.
text: ANGLE ACROSS NANCY'S "TREE LAWN", the grass between
text: the sidewalk and the street, in the general direction
text: of GLEN's home. This ANGLE doesn't quite reveal
dialog: Nancy's house.
text: FOREGROUND is a utility truck in which a half dozen
text: Hispanic WORKERS are loading tools, extension cords
dialog: and hardware. They
dialog: look like they've put in one hell of a hard day's work.
text: MARGE appears and hands a check to the FOREMAN of the crew, a
text: white guy in clean coveralls and a gold chain. He scrutinizes
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: FOREMAN
dialog: And the other...
text: MARGE forks over a wad of cash, hands trembling in her
text: half-drunk, helpless rage.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Where's your mask and gun?
text: The FOREMAN counts the money swiftly.
speaker_heading: FOREMAN
dialog: Don't bust my chops, lady.
dialog: If the city found out I put
dialog: 'em in without inside releases
dialog: I'd loose my license.
text: He shoves the money in his pocket and climbs in his truck. MARGE
text: EXITS FRAME for her house.
text: PAN WITH THE TRUCK as it pulls away, THEN PICK UP NANCY, walking
text: across the street from the corner. Alone. Dispirited. She
text: lifts her eyes to her home and stops in her tracks.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Oh gross...
text: 123. WIDENING TO REVEAL THE HOUSE as NANCY walks across her front 123.
text: yard. Every single window has been covered with brand-new
text: ornamental iron bars, bolted deeply into their frames.
text: CLOSER, AT A WINDOW. NANCY gives a set of bars a powerful
text: shake. They don't budge. Then girl looks up and sees even the
text: window to her second floor bedroom is barred. And the rose
text: trellis has been ripped down and heaped at the foundation in a
text: tangle of wood, thorns and broken flowers.
scene_heading: 124. INT. MARGE'S ROOM. EVENING. 124.
text: ANGLE ON THE DOORWAY INTO THE HALL. Easy listening MUSIC wafts
text: through the air. NANCY appears in the doorway.
speaker_heading: NANCY (OS)
dialog: Mom, what's with the bars!?
text: 125. REVERSE to MARGE, propped against the headboard of her bed, a 125.
text: crooked shadow in the gloom. A fresh bottle of Gin glints in her
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Oh, Mom...
text: The girl crosses and reaches gently for the bottle. MARGE
text: snatches it away.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: 'S'mine...
text: She rocks the bottle in her arms.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: What's with the bars?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: S'curity.
text: NANCY sits on the bed, a surprising compassion entering her
dialog: voice.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Mom, I want to know what you
dialog: know about Fred Krueger.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Dead and gone.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I want to know how, where --
dialog: if you don't tell me, I'm going
dialog: to call daddy.
text: MARGE gives a laugh -- a rasping chachination from deep in her
dialog: chest.
speaker_heading: MARGE (CONTD)
dialog: Your father the cop. That's a
dialog: good one.
dialog: (colder)
dialog: Forget Fred Krueger. You don't
dialog: want to know, believe me.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I do want to know. He's not
dialog: dead and gone -- he's after me
dialog: and if I sleep he'll get me!
dialog: I've got to know!
text: MARGE blinks at her a moment, then cracks a terrible, crooked
dialog: grin.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: All right.
scene_heading: 126. INT. NANCY'S CELLAR/NIGHT 126.
text: MARGE drags NANCY headlong down the cellar stairs and across the
text: room with a crazy fury, twisting her down near the foundation.
text: And she thrusts her face so close to her daughter's that NANCY
text: reels from the alcohol.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: You want to know who Fred
dialog: Krueger was? He was a filthy
dialog: child killer who got at least
dialog: twenty kids, kids from our
dialog: area, kids we all knew. It
dialog: drove us all crazy when we
dialog: didn't know who was doing it --
dialog: but it was even worse when
dialog: they caught him.
text: MARGE draws herself up with a shake.
speaker_heading: MARGE (CONTD)
dialog: Oh lawyers got fat and the judge
dialog: got famous, but someone forgot to
dialog: sign the search warrant in the
dialog: right place, and Fred Krueger
dialog: was free, just like that.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: So he's alive?
text: MARGE smiles grimly.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: He wouldn've stopped. The
dialog: bastard would've got more
dialog: kids first chance he got --
dialog: they found nearly ten bodies
text: in his boiler room as it
dialog: was. But the law couldn't
dialog: touch him.
text: At the mention of "boiler room", NANCY gives a shake. MARGE
text: misses this, too busy taking a pull on the bottle that's never
dialog: left her hand.
speaker_heading: MARGE (CONTD)
dialog: What was needed were some private
dialog: citizens willing to do what had
dialog: to be done.
text: She reels slowly, looking at NANCY is defiance.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: What did you do, mother?
text: MARGE cradles the bottle.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Bunch of us parents tracked him
dialog: down after they let him go. Found
text: him in an old boiler room, just
dialog: like before. Saw him lying there
dialog: in that caked red and yellow sweater
dialog: he always wore, drunk an' asleep
text: with his weird knives by his side...
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (dreading it)
dialog: Go on...
text: MARGE reaches over and taps a dusty two-gallon jug of gasoline
text: near the lawn mower.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: We poured gasoline all around
dialog: the place, left a trail out the
dialog: door, locked the door, then...
dialog: She mimes striking a match --
speaker_heading: MARGE (CONTD)
dialog: WHOOSH!!!
text: Her arms shoot up and her eyes go wide with the light of that
text: fire. There's awe in her voice. Then she drops her arms.
speaker_heading: MARGE (CONTD)
dialog: (hushed, remembering)
dialog: But just when it seemed not
dialog: even the devil could live
dialog: in there any more -- he crashed
text: out like a banshee, all on fire
dialog: -- swinging those fingerknives
dialog: every which direction and
dialog: screaming he... he was going
dialog: to get us by killing all our
dialog: kids...
text: She stops with a sudden quake and drinks for a long moment. But
text: the intake doesn't hide the image. Her face bathed in tears, she
text: looks at her daughter and shakes her head.
speaker_heading: MARGE (CONTD)
dialog: There were all those men, Nancy,
dialog: even your father, oh yes, even
dialog: him. But none could do what
dialog: had to be done -- Krueger rolling
dialog: and screaming so loud the whole
dialog: state could hear -- no one could
dialog: take your father's gun and kill
dialog: him good and proper except me.
text: She sweeps her hand across the air in a terrific slash, then
text: stops, her hand shaking, her voice hoarse and terrified. She
text: looks at her daughter, begging.
speaker_heading: MARGE (CONTD)
dialog: So he's dead Nan. He can't
dialog: get you. Mommy killed him.
dialog: For someone who started this film at a very young seventeen,
text: NANCY's now the battle-tempered veteran as she takes her mother
text: in her arms and rocks her.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Who was there? Were Tina's
dialog: parents there? Were Rod's?
text: MARGE sags back.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Sure, and Glen's. All of us.
dialog: But that's in the past now,
dialog: baby. Really. It's over.
dialog: (slyly)
dialog: We even took his knives.
text: The woman twists around and opens the door on an old furnace -- a
text: furnace unused since the newer gas one nearby was put in. She
text: fishes inside the cavity -- as then we hear a touch of the
text: familiar 'SCRRIITCH'. Next moment she pulls out an object
text: wrapped in rags, opens it and displays the long, rusted blades
text: and their glove-like apparatus.
speaker_heading: MARGE (CONTD)
dialog: See?
text: NANCY stares at the damn things, chilled.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: All these years you've kept those
dialog: things buried down here? In our
dialog: own house?
speaker_heading: MARGE (CONTD)
dialog: Proof he's declawed. As for him,
dialog: we buried him good and deep.
text: MARGE shoves the knives into their hiding place, closes the
dialog: little iron door.
speaker_heading: MARGE (CONTD)
dialog: So's okay, you can sleep.
text: She lurches up and staggers upstairs.
text: NANCY shivers and looks down at her arm. The cut beneath her
text: bandage has begun to bleed again. And from inside the furnace,
text: as if from deep below, the PULSING of the boundless
text: nightmare-boiler room can be faintly heard.
scene_heading: 127. EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT. 127.

speaker_heading: GLEN

speaker_heading: NANCY (CONTD)
dialog: Fine. Stand by your window
dialog: so I can see you. You sound
text: a million miles away.
text: In the lighted window across the way, she can SEE GLEN move into
text: sight. In his shot, we can SEE NANCY step into her window behind
dialog: the bars.
speaker_heading: NANCY (CONTD)
dialog: Much better.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: I heard your ma went ape at the
dialog: security store today. You look
dialog: like the Prisoner of Zenda or
dialog: something. How long's it been
dialog: since you slept?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Coming up on the seventh day. It's
dialog: okay, I checked Guiness. The
dialog: record's eleven, and I'll beat
dialog: that if I have to.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Listen, I... I know who he is.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: The killer.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: You do?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm

speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Me!? Why would anyone want to
dialog: kill me?!
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Don't ask -- just give me some
dialog: help nailing this guy when I
dialog: bring him out.
speaker_heading: GLEN pales.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Bring him out of what?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: My dream.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: How you plan to do that?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Just like I did the hat. Have

dialog: wake me up.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Me?
dialog: (switching back to a more
dialog: comfortable reality)
dialog: Wait a minute, you can't bring
dialog: someone out of a dream!
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: If I can't, then you all can
dialog: relax, because it'll just be a
dialog: simple case of me being nuts.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: I can save you the trouble.
dialog: You're nutty as a fruitcake.
dialog: I love you anyway.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking
dialog: this guy when I bring him out.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: What!?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (simplicity itself)
dialog: You heard me. I grab him in the
dialog: dream -- you see me struggling
dialog: so you wake me up. We both come
dialog: out, you cold cock the fucker,
dialog: and we got him. Clever, huh?
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: You crazy? Hit him with what?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: You're a jock. You must have

dialog: Come to my window at midnight.

speaker_heading: GLEN

dialog: Meanwhile..?
speaker_heading: NANCY

speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON

speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Whuu?
text: He refocuses his eyes, takes off his earphones.
speaker_heading: MRS LANTZ

dialog: Well how you gonna hear what
dialog: she says?
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Who cares what she says?
text: The mother gives up.
speaker_heading: MRS LANTZ
dialog: You should get to sleep soon,
text: Glen. It's almost midnight.
dialog: Goodness knows we've all had
dialog: enough of a time the last few
dialog: days...
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: I will, Mom...in a while.
dialog: You guys turning in?
speaker_heading: MRS LANTZ
dialog: Pretty soon.
text: His MOTHER sighs and goes out, closing the door behind her. GLEN
text: flips the TV back on and glances at the clock.
text: 138. INSERT OF CLOCK. It's 11:42. 138.
text: 139. TIGHT ON GLEN's face. He clamps the earphones back on, and turns 139.
text: the volume up high. The MUSIC is so loud we can hear it
text: resonating inside his skull.
text: CAMERA MOVES PAST GLEN to his window, then ZOOMS through to:
scene_heading: 140. EXT. ELM STREET / NANCY'S HOUSE. NIGHT. 140.
text: CONTINUE ZOOMING into the LIGHTED window of NANCY's barred second
dialog: floor bedroom and
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 141. INT. NANCY'S ROOM. NIGHT 141.
text: CLOSE ON MARGE, weaving on the edge of NANCY's bed, stroking
text: the girl's hair. NANCY's still something of a wreck, but less
speaker_heading: than 	MARGE.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: We'll go away, take a vacation.
dialog: Get your hair colored nice, the
dialog: way it was. No one will ever
dialog: know.
dialog: (sniffs)
dialog: This whole room smells of coffee,
dialog: y'know?
text: She gathers up NANCY's coffee cups and empty NoDoz boxes, leans
text: down and kisses her.
speaker_heading: MARGE (CONTD)
dialog: It's all over now, baby. The
dialog: nightmare's over. Please.
text: NANCY nods her head, half stubborn, half sadly. She can barely
dialog: keep her eyes open now.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Okay.
text: She scrunches into her pillow. MARGE smiles haggardly and shuts
text: off the light, taking the coffee pot with her as she leaves.
speaker_heading: NANCY (CONTD)
dialog: Night-night.
text: MARGE smiles, relieved. The girl pulls the blanket around her
text: shoulders. Her eyes flutter closed, her breathing becomes regular
text: and deep. Once again she's the litle girl MARGE fantasizes she
dialog: is.
text: The mother tiptoes out of the room, closing the door behind her.
text: HOLD ON NANCY's sleeping face as the DOOR CLOSES. Her eyes
text: remain closed another beat, then open wide.
text: She quietly jumps out of bed and shakes herself savagely to
text: scatter the sleep settling so quickly.
text: Still in the dark, she fishes a full electric coffepot from under
text: her bed and pours herself a fresh fix into a mug she digs from
text: beneath her pillow. The face illuminated by the neon light on the
text: pot is set in absolute determination.
text: NANCY drains the cup, then crosses to her closet, retrieves a
text: pitcher of ice water from behind a heap of clothes and splashes
text: her eyes and the back of her neck. That done she eases open her
text: window and presses her face to the bars, sucking in cool night
text: air until every shred of sleep is gone from her brain.
text: Then she starts pulling on clothes.
scene_heading: 142. INT. NANCY'S HOUSE/DOWNSTAIRS. NIGHT. 142.
text: ANGLE ON MARGE as she checks the lock on the backdoor. Firm.
text: 143. ANGLE IN THE LIVING ROOM as she pads through the darkened house, 143.
text: feels her way to a wall of shelves and takes down a book. Then
text: another, and a third. Then reaches in and fishes out a bottle of
dialog: gin.
scene_heading: 144. EXT. NANCY'S HOUSE AND ELM STREET. NIGHT. 144.
text: The sky has gathered in greater darkness. LOW, DISTANT THUNDER
text: rolls around the horizon like a great drum.
text: ANGLE ON NANCY'S HOUSE from across the street. The moon glints
text: off the barred windows. CAMERA ZOOMS to NANCY's window. The
text: imprisoned girl hovers in the darkness behind the grill like a
text: ghost, her eyes turned towards GLEN's. Then she switches to
text: something much CLOSER TO CAMERA ANGLE, and she draws back.
text: 145. REVERSE ON GLEN's father, standing on the front porch of his 145.
text: home, also in the shadows, looking straight across and up at
text: NANCY. He 	draws on his cigarette; his face glows red.
text: 146. NANCY pulls down the shade. 146.
text: 147. GLEN's father grinds the cigarette beneath his shoe. 147.
speaker_heading: MRS LANTZ
dialog: Shouldn't stare.
text: As the man turns our SHOT WIDENS TO REVEAL MRS LANTZ.
speaker_heading: MR LANTZ
dialog: Know what I think? I think
dialog: that kid's some kinda lunatic.
text: The woman spoons more sweetness into her mouth and rubs her
dialog: forehead.
speaker_heading: MRS LANTZ
dialog: Shouldn't say such a thing about
dialog: the poor child. If you mean the
dialog: bars, Marge's just being cautious,
dialog: her being alone and Nancy acting
dialog: so nervous lately.
text: The woman rises and pulls him gently towards the living room. As
text: he goes inside he takes one last look.
speaker_heading: MR LANTZ (CONTD)
dialog: Well, she ain't gonna hang around
dialog: our boy no more.
text: Once the two are inside, the door is locked.
scene_heading: 148. INT. NANCY'S ROOM. NIGHT. 148.
text: CLOSE ON NANCY's face. VERY CLOSE. Her eyes stare ahead,
text: red-rimmed, anxious. She picks absently at the thick bandage
text: covering her forearm. The long cuts from Fred Krueger's fingers
text: are bleeding again, but she doesn't even care anymore. Too late
text: to sweat the small stuff. She crosses the room.
text: On the bedside table with the nearly empty Pyrex coffee maker,
text: the empty cup and the empty box of No-Doz, is her old fashioned
text: alarm clock, and a phone.
text: NANCY pours herself the last of the coffee and drinks it to the
text: dregs, then looks to the clock.
text: INSERT CLOCK -- ten minutes to midnight.
text: NANCY'S eyes go to the door.
text: WIDER. Fully clothed and in a jacket now, she creeps to the door
text: and cracks it, just to make sure. Then freezes.
scene_heading: 149. INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE NANCY'S DOOR. 149.
text: IN NANCY'S POV through the door we see MARGE, rummaging around in
text: the linen closet not fifteen feet away. There's no way NANCY can
text: get past her. The woman pulls out a full bottle of gin in
text: satisfaction and begins fumbling with its cap.
scene_heading: 150. INT. NANCY'S ROOM. NIGHT. 150.
text: NANCY eases the door closed again and sinks to the key hole,
text: watching through it with a sinking heart.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (very quiet, very intense)
dialog: Hang on GLEN...
scene_heading: 151. INT. GLEN'S ROOM. NIGHT. 151.
text: GLEN, coat now on, goes to his window, checking.
scene_heading: 152. INT. ELM STREET. NIGHT. 152.
text: GLEN'S POV -- NANCY'S porch is deserted; front door closed,
text: lights out. No sign of NANCY.
scene_heading: 153. INT. GLEN'S ROOM. NIGHT. 153.
text: GLEN shrugs, takes off his jacket and plops back onto his bed.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Well, I'm not gonna risk
text: sneaking out until she does.
text: He puts the earphones back on.
scene_heading: 154. INT. NANCY'S ROOM. NIGHT. 154.
text: Absolutely frustrated, NANCY turns from the keyhole to the
text: window. She opens the blind and eases back the curtain.
scene_heading: 155. EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT.
text: IN NANCY'S POV THROUGH THE BARS we ZOOM directly across to GLEN's
dialog: window.
scene_heading: 156. INT. GLEN'S ROOM. NIGHT. 156.
text: GLEN lies on his bed, fully clothed, earphones over his ears,
text: CARSON droning from the TV. And the boy's eyes begin to droop.
scene_heading: 157. INT. NANCY'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 157.
text: NANCY picks up her phone, bites her lip, then begins dialing.
scene_heading: 158. INT. GLEN'S ROOM. NIGHT. 158.
text: TIGHT ON PHONE as it begins RINGING loudly.
text: WIDER SHOT, revealing GLEN asleep BACKGROUND, the MUSIC still
text: LOUD in his earphones.
scene_heading: 159. INT. GLEN'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 159.
text: RINGING here, too, just as MR LANTZ is turning out the lights for
text: bed. He stops in the dark, scowling.
speaker_heading: MR LANTZ
dialog: Who at this hour?
text: He refuses to turn the light back on. His wife picks her way to
dialog: the telephone.
speaker_heading: MRS LANTZ
dialog: Hello?
dialog: (listens, frowns
dialog: slightly)
dialog: Oh... Hold on.
dialog: (covers the mouthpiece)
dialog: It's her. She wants to talk to
dialog: Glen.
text: The father crosses to the telephone, suspicious.
speaker_heading: MR LANTZ
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: MRS LANTZ
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: What's this about, Nancy?
text: She listens, covers up again.
speaker_heading: MRS LANTZ (CONTD)
dialog: She says it's private. Very
dialog: private and very important.
text: MR LANTZ grabs the telephone from his wife and barks into it.
speaker_heading: MR LANTZ
dialog: Glen's asleep. Talk to him
dialog: tomorrow!
text: He SLAMS down the telephone with a grunt of satisfaction to his
dialog: wife.
speaker_heading: MR LANTZ (CONTD)
dialog: Just got to be firm with kids,
dialog: is all.
text: Then as a refinement he takes the phone off the hook and lays it
text: on the table.
scene_heading: 160. INT. NANCY'S ROOM. NIGHT. 160.
text: NANCY dials again. This time she gets a BUSY SIGNAL. She slams
text: the phone down in frustration and looks out the window.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Glen. Don't fall asleep...
text: She goes and sits on the bed, propping her chin on her fists.
text: 161. Yawns. The TELEPHONE RINGS. 161.
text: NANCY snatches it up.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Glen?
text: TIGHT ON HER, ZOOMING EVEN CLOSER ON HER EAR AND THE EARPIECE as
text: we HEAR the awful SCRITCHING SCRAPE of STEEL FINGERKNIVES.
text: NANCY slaps the phone down as if it were diseased -- then, in
text: pure rage, rips the thing's cord from the wall.
text: Spent instantly, she puts the receiver back on the cradle and
text: lays it on her bed, chiding herself.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Brilliant. Now what if Glen
dialog: calls?
text: She wraps the phone cord around the useless machine and puts it
text: on her bed, then sneaks back to the door. This time she gives an
text: expression of relief, and opens the door. MARGE is gone.
text: Then the TELEPHONE RINGS again.
text: CAMERA MOVES IN ON NANCY as she turns slowly.
text: 162. REVERSE IN HER POV. THE TELEPHONE RINGS again, despite the fact 162.
text: that the end of its janked-out cord is clearly visible. The
text: NIGHTMARE MUSIC THEME slips right up our spines.
text: BACK ON NANCY. She starts to shake. She goes to the telephone
text: as we WIDEN, unwraps it as it RINGS even louder. She's shaking
text: so hard by now she can barely manage to lift the receiver. MOVE
text: IN CLOSE ON HER, so close we can HEAR her teeth chattering as she
text: brings the phone to her ear.
speaker_heading: NANCY (CONTD)
dialog: Hello?
text: The unmistakeable VOICE of FRED KRUEGER comes over the phone,
text: garbled by time and unknown dimensions, but clear enough.
speaker_heading: KRUEGER (FILTER)
dialog: (triumphant)
dialog: I'm your boyfriend now...
text: CLOSE ON THE MOUTHPIECE. It's changed from a normal telephone
text: mouthpiece to an actual mouth -- Fred Krueger's mouth -- and his
text: long, slick tongue flicks out and darts into the startled girl's
dialog: mouth!
text: WIDER -- as NANCY explodes from her micro-dream -- absolutely
text: mad. She jerks the telephone away from her and smashes it
text: against her wall, then attacks it with her feet and hands,
text: smashing it to smithereens.
text: ANGLE ON THE TELEPHONE PIECES. Normal pieces of a normal
dialog: telephone.
text: She pinches herself hard -- until tears come and her flesh is
text: nearly bleeding.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I'm awake, I am awake. This is
dialog: not a dream! I am --
text: She stops, realizing what Krueger meant.
speaker_heading: NANCY (CONTD)
dialog: My boyfriend...!
scene_heading: 163. INT. NANCY'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 163.
text: NANCY barrels down the stairs and across the darkened living room
text: to the front door.
text: It takes her a moment of tugging and fumbling to realize the
text: deadbolt is locked from inside. And there's no key in it now.
text: She races to a porch window and throws it open, shaking and
text: banging on the bars like a mad woman. But there's no getting
text: through. She staggers back, stymied and furious. Then somebody
text: moves behind her in the dark.
speaker_heading: VOICE (OS)
dialog: Locked.
text: NANCY jumps around in shock. Her mother has posted herself on
text: the couch with her bottle.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (furious)
dialog: Give me the key, mother.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I don't even have it on me,
dialog: so forget it.
text: The word is final. NANCY runs past the woman to the back door,
text: to one window after the other, shaking bars and slamming locks
text: and SCREAMING in teenage fury. But it's no good. The house is
dialog: her prison.
speaker_heading: MARGE (CONTD)
dialog: (drunk satisfaction)
dialog: Paid the guy damn good to make
dialog: sure you stayed put. You ain't
dialog: goin' nowhere, kid. You're
dialog: gonna sleep tonight if it kills
dialog: me.
text: NANCY clenches her fists and screams at the top of her lungs, a
text: heart-wrenching, eardrum-breaking cry of love in despair --
speaker_heading: NANCY
speaker_heading: GLEEENNNNNN!
speaker_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: 164. INT. GLEN'S ROOM. NIGHT. 164.
text: CLOSE ON GLEN'S FROM DIRECTLY ABOVE. The MUSIC is tinny from the
text: earphones, the TV SOUND DISTANT AND ECHOED. The boy is breathing
text: deeply now, slowly and gently. Then, unmistakeably, he begins to
text: SNORE. Very faintly, far in the background, we can hear NANCY.
speaker_heading: NANCY (OS)
dialog: Glen!! Don't fall asleeeeeep!
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK AND STRAIGHT UP as the SNORES merge with a
text: weird, unsettling MUSIC CUE. The boy lies sprawled, still
text: clothed, in the middle of his bed. Save for the bedside lamp,
text: the room is dark.
text: FULL WIDE ANGLE FROM THIS HIGH SPOT looking down at him as from
text: the eyes of some great fly hung on the ceiling. THE MUSIC
scene_heading: REACHES A TERRIFYING PITCH OF ANTICIPATION -- THEN STOPS
speaker_heading: ABRUPTLY.
text: There's a heartbeat's pause. Then with tremendous force, two
text: powerful arms shoot up beneath the red and yellow bedspread and
text: grab GLEN around the waist!
text: Next moment the young man's body is dragged straight down into
text: the bed, as if some huge beast had grabbed him and heaved him
text: down! His feet and his arms shoot up -- there's another hauling
text: yank -- and the boy disappears except for his hands and fingers
text: -- down into the pit in the middle of the bed! His hands are
text: last to go, clawing for a hold. But soon they vanish as well,
text: dragging blankets and bedsheets, wires and stereo across the
text: caved-in bed and into the abyss.
text: There's HIDEOUS SCREECHING of MUSIC jamming in with GLEN's
text: ECHOING SCREAMS -- then an unholy, sudden silence.
text: Next moment what's left of GLEN is vomited up from the pit of the
text: nightmare bed...a horrible mess of blood and bone and hair and
text: wires...streaming out and over the bed. Then the pit in the bed
text: is gone as if it were never there.
text: Drawn by the terribly screams and struggle, GLEN's mother bursts
text: into the room. The women stares for one moment of horrified
text: disbelief, then reels back and lets out the most god-awful SCREAM
text: imaginable. The cry splits the night.
scene_heading: 165. EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT. 165.
text: The SOUND of the SCREAM CROSS-FADES WITH the WAIL of the
text: AMBULANCE as it screeches to a halt at the curb, followed by two
text: BLACK AND WHITES and an UNMARKED CAR. Uniformed POLICEMEN spill
text: out FOREGROUND.
text: LT THOMPSON and PARKER exit the unmarked car. By habit or by
text: premonition THOMPSON glances at the house that was his home. His
text: eye is caught by a movement; his daughter is at her upstairs
text: window, white-haired, hollow-eyed, looking down on him through
text: her bars. She gives a little wave.
text: Unnerved, THOMPSON waves back, then walks rapidly for GLEN's
text: home. MR LANTZ, pale as a ghost himself, waits on the porch; we
text: can hear the mother's WAILING inside.
scene_heading: 166. INT. NANCY'S ROOM. NIGHT. 166.
text: CLOSE ON NANCY'S BIG OLD WINDUP ALARM CLOCK. Its big and little
text: hands sweep together at midnight.
speaker_heading: BURN ON:
speaker_heading: THE NINTH DAY
text: There's a BABBLE of POLICE RADIOS, SIRENS WINDING DOWN, RUNNING
text: FOOT-STEPS, SHOUTS, NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS and DOGS BARKING as CAMERA
text: LIFTS TO NANCY'S FACE. Set. Unafraid. Ruthless.
text: The girl pulls the window shade on it all, then looks at her
dialog: bed.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Okay, Krueger, you bastard.
dialog: We play in your court.
scene_heading: 167. INT. GLEN'S LIVING ROOM/NANCY'S KITCHEN -- INTERCUT. NIGHT. 167.
text: 168. LT THOMPSON is halfway across the living room when he stops. 168.
text: Something dark and red is welling from a crack in the ceiling.
text: One of his men is rigging a bucket beneah to catch the leaking.
text: The telephone rings and PARKER picks it up.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Lieutenant. It's your daughter.
dialog: Says it's urgent.
text: THOMPSON turns away from the dripping.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: (low)
dialog: Tell her I'm not here, tell
dialog: her...
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Uh, she just saw you, sir...
text: THOMPSON nods, crosses and picks up the telephone. SCREEN
dialog: SPLITS; we see both.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON (CONTD)
dialog: Hello Nancy.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Hi daddy. I know what happened.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: Then you know more than I do --
dialog: I haven't even been upstairs.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (guessing)
dialog: You know he's dead though, right?
text: THOMPSON debates, then admits it.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: Yeah, apparantly he's dead.
dialog: How the hell'd you know?
text: A tear coarses down NANCY's cheek, but her voice remains firm.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I've got a proposition for
dialog: you. Listen very carefully,
dialog: please.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: Nan, I --
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Please. I'm gonna go get
dialog: the guy who did it and bring
dialog: him to you. I just need you
dialog: be right there to arrest him.
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: Just tell me who did it and
dialog: I'll go get him, baby.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Fred Krueger did it, Daddy,
dialog: and only I can get him. It's
dialog: my nightmare he comes to.
text: The detective flinches at the name.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: Where'd you hear about Krueger --
text: NANCY presses, very firm, very rational.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: -- I want you to come over here
dialog: and break the door down exactly
dialog: twenty minutes from now -- can
dialog: you do that?
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: Sure, but...
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: That'll be exactly half past
dialog: midnight. Time for me to fall
text: asleep and find him.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: Sure, sure, honey. You just
dialog: do that -- get yourself some
dialog: sleep -- that's what I've been
dialog: saying all along.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: And you'll be here to catch
dialog: him, right?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Lieutenant -- they're waiting
dialog: upstairs.
text: THOMPSON waves curtly, still speaking to NANCY.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: Sure, okay, I'll be there.
dialog: Now you just turn in and get
dialog: some rest, sweetheart. Please.
dialog: Deal?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Deal.
text: NANCY hangs up. LT THOMPSON starts upstairs. But then he stops,
dialog: and as an afterthought he could never really explain, turns to
speaker_heading: PARKER.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON (CONTD)
text: Get outside and watch her house.
dialog: If you see anything funny call
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: 'Anything funny' like what?
text: THOMPSON shakes his head, embarassed.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: I don't know -- but one thing
dialog: for sure, I don't want her
dialog: coming over here. She's way
dialog: too far gone to be able to
dialog: to handle this.
text: As PARKER exits, ANGLE CUTS TO NANCY'S KITCHEN as the girl hangs
text: up and sinks back agiainst the wall, trapped by her own
text: resolution. She looks at her watch.
text: 169. INSERT -- five past midnight. NANCY switches modes to stopwatch 169.
text: and sets the COUNTDOWN going at twenty-five minutes.
scene_heading: 170. INT. GLEN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 170.
text: LT THOMPSON steps into GLEN's room, anxious to be done with it.
text: He hits a wall of stench and horror even before he takes it in
text: with his eyes, and as soon as he sees the bed he claps his hand
text: over his mouth, pivots and walks right back into the hallway.
scene_heading: 171. INT. HALLWAY. NIGHT. 171.
text: He sags against the wall, unable to look at the COPS who hover
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: (faint)
dialog: What the hell did that,
dialog: Lieutenant? There ain't even
text: a head left.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: Goddamed if I know.
dialog: (tries to straighten)
dialog: What's the Coronor say?
speaker_heading: COP
text: He's in the john puking since
dialog: he saw it.
scene_heading: 172. INT. CELLAR. NIGHT. 172.
text: NANCY pulls tools and hardware out with grim resolution. Hammer,
text: nails, spools of wire, an old square of heavy fishneting, some
text: old shot gun shells, a file -- referring only once to the booklet
text: in her hand.
scene_heading: 173. INT. NANCY'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 173.
text: Barely able to control her shaking hands, NANCY starts stringing
text: off the spool of wire across the living room, crying and swearing
dialog: at the same time.
text: DISSOLVE TO HER HANDS wrapping bare lamp wire around two
text: thumbtacks stuck into the insides of the pinchers of a common
text: wooden clothespin. The wire goes OFF SCREEN.
text: ANOTHER ANGLE as she inserts a Lifesaver between the two prongs.
text: One end of the fishline is tied to the lifesaver. The whole now
text: is stretched taut about three inches off the living room carpet.
text: ON NANCY carefully filing a hole in a LIGHTBULB.
text: OH HER pouring powder and shot from shotgun shells into the
text: opening in the bulb until it's full, then sealing it with tape.
text: DISSOLVE TO HER screwing the bulb back into the floor lamp, and
text: placing the thing near the foot of the stairs.

text: -- NANCY screws a hinge into the wall directly above her door.
text: Attached to the hinge is the shank of something -- some kind of
dialog: tool. We can't see what it is because CAMERA never quite frames
dialog: the whole thing.
text: -- NANCY tiptoes to her mother's door and peeks in.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 176. INT. MARGE'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 176.
text: MARGE lies propped in her bed looking back at NANCY. Her

text: a sort of comatose clarity.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Guess I should'n'a done it.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Just sleep now, Mom.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Just wanted to protect you,

speaker_heading: DELETE SC 177
scene_heading: 178. INT. NANCY'S ROOM. NIGHT. 178.
text: The girl enters, turns out her bedside light, slips out of her

speaker_heading: NANCY (quietly)
dialog: Now I lay me down to sleep,
dialog: I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
dialog: If I should die before I wake,
dialog: I pray the Lord my soul to take.
text: She gets into bed and pulls the blankets to her chin.

speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: I know it's hard to think at
dialog: a time like this, Walter, but
dialog: can you think of anyone who
dialog: could've done such a thing?
text: The father stares away, his voice low and dull.
speaker_heading: MR LANTZ
dialog: He done it.
text: THOMPSON looks at the man, baffled.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: Who? Who did that?
speaker_heading: MR LANTZ
dialog: Krueger.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: Krueger?
text: The father gives him the strangest look.
speaker_heading: MR LANTZ
dialog: Had to've done it. No one
dialog: else was in there.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: How you know that?
speaker_heading: MR LANTZ
dialog: Cause I thought Glen was
dialog: gonna sneak out to see your
dialog: lunatic daughter, that's why.
dialog: So I locked him in his room!
dialog: (getting control)
dialog: Sorry. Anyways, the door was
dialog: still locked when we heard the
dialog: screams.
text: He blinks.
speaker_heading: MR LANTZ (CONTD)
dialog: Maybe god's punishing us all...
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: (much lower and hard)
dialog: Keep your head -- this is a

dialog: we're talking about.
speaker_heading: MR LANTZ

speaker_heading: COP (OS)

dialog: NOTE: These rewrites of scenes 180 and 180 A replace NANCY
text: walking through the 'dream streets' at night, and NANCY
text: approaching the huge deserted building at night, prior to her
text: entering the Boiler Room the final time.
scene_heading: 180. INT. DOWNSTAIRS, NANCY'S HOUSE. NIGHT. 180.
text: LOW ANGLE UP STAIRS as NANCY appears at head. As she comes
text: downstairs, CAMERA MOVES WITH HER through the hallway to the
text: cellar door. She opens the door.
scene_heading: 180A. INT. NANCY'S CELLAR. NIGHT. 180A.
text: NANCY appears at top of these stairs, hesitates, then comes down.
text: WIDER as NANCY approaches center of room, stops in CU, then turns
text: eyes. We HEAR the distant SOUND of the boiler room now, faint
text: but unmistakeable. NANCY MOVES, and CAMERA PANS HER to the
text: cellar's side WALL, where another, new doorway is REVEALED.
text: NANCY opens this door and looks down. FIRELIGHT is on NANCY'S
text: face now, and the SOUND of the Boiler Room is very clear. NANCY
text: goes through the door.
scene_heading: 180B. INT. BOILER ROOM. 180B.
text: NANCY decends like Orpheus into hell, but without weapon save her
dialog: wits.
text: She decends a steel stair to the lowest level, then hears the
text: SOUND of the knives from down another shaft. She sees there's an
text: even deeper place down there. She starts down.
text: Again, and then again, NANCY decends, each ladder narrower or
text: more twisting, each level deeper, wetter, darker, more airless.
text: Soon she's gasping for air, but still she pushes herself on. She
text: doesn't stop until she breaks out at last at the very bottom of
text: the place, a wet, firelit sump deep in the bowels of the place.
text: CAMERA NOW PANS AROUND WITH HER, and for the first time we SEE
text: the vast maul of the empty boiler behind her.
text: She stares at it. It's seething with some dark WIND that soughs
text: and whines like a huge dying dog.
text: NANCY crosses to it, touching the pile of old, coal-dusted dirt
text: at its base. It looks almost like an old grave.
text: She turns suddenly, listening. Then, hearing nothing, she looks
dialog: down.
text: NANCY'S POV as she picks up GLEN's earphones.
text: WIDER as she suddenly drops them, staring at her fingers.
text: They're dripping blood.
text: There's another BEEP.
text: 180C. INSERT ON NANCY'S WATCH -- the COUNT-DOWN a blur of black digits 180C.
dialog: counting down to zero. They've just crossed the ten minute
dialog: warning.
text: 180D. CLOSE ON NANCY'S FACE. She speaks into the night. 180D.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Come out and show yourself,
dialog: you bastard.
text: No sooner are these words off her lips than the huge bulk of FRED
text: KRUEGER lurches up behind her! The man is even more hideous
text: hatless, his bald head and tormented face veiled in skeins of
text: ruined flesh, his ragged teeth barred, the great spider of
text: razor-blades flashing from his fingertips.
text: He leaps, but the girl leaps just as fast, a fierce jump,
text: that sends her out over black space and down into a huge, dark
text: sump of blackness.
scene_heading: 180E. EXT. THE HEAVENS. NIGHT. 180E.
text: CLOSE ANGLE ON NANCY as she curves like a swan though her
text: apogee, and begins falling, diving, planing through black air,
text: the wind ripping at her hair and eyes. Suddenly the complex,
text: glittering skein of light that is the San Fernando Valley seen
text: from the air slides INTO FRAME, and we see she's falling from
text: high, high over the earth.
text: NANCY falls, falls in slow motion against the spinning lights,
text: free as a sky diver freefalling -- a giddy, acrophobic plunge.
dialog: 181,182,183,184 OMIT OMIT 181,182,183,184
scene_heading: 185. EXT. ELM STREET/NANCY'S HOUSE. NIGHT. 185.
text: NANCY crashes suddenly out of the night and into a hedge just
text: outside her own front door, rolling out at its bottom scratched
dialog: and bloodied. If she were in any normal reality she'd be a mass
text: of broken bones -- but somehow she's able to claw her way up and
text: look at her watch once more.
text: INSERT. Just a few seconds from zero.
text: She staggers for her house's front door -- but a moment later
text: KRUEGER crashes down atop her! NANCY struggles to her knees just
text: as the man lunges with that godawful handful of blades. But
text: instead of running, she ducks inside the deadly grab and seizes
dialog: him in a desperate bearhug!
text: The surprise move sends him pitching backwards, her still on him
text: --and they fall into the jumble of torn-down trellis of roses
text: beneath her window. Almost at that very second we HEAR the
text: jarring, deafening RINGING of NANCY's alarm clock!
speaker_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: 186. INT. NANCY'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 186.
text: NANCY sprawls out of her bed onto the floor, twisting from the
text: jabs of the already vanished thorns, briars and brush. Gasping,
text: she takes a second to get her bearings
text: ANGLE ON THE BED as she recovers quick as she can, snatching up
text: the net, ready for an assault from any direction.
text: But the room is empty.
text: Hardly able to catch her breath, her hair tangled, her nightgown
text: torn, she drops the net. She sits on the bed, turns on the
text: bedside lamp and re-examines her room. No one there but herself.
text: It's a terrible blow, despite the fact that she's safe. Her face
text: is covered with tears, she's shaking and breathless. She rattles
text: her head in confusion and despair, realizing her own madness.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I'm crazy after all...
text: At that very instant FRED KRUEGER leaps up from the far side of
text: the bed with an EXPLOSIVE SHOUT of rage!
text: He lunges across the table for her, missing by inches as NANCY
text: pitches backwards and scrambles for the window. But she's
text: stopped by the bars.
text: KRUEGER, incredibly fast, regains his feet and leaps again -- the
text: girl wheels and shatters the coffeepot over his head. As he
text: crashes backwards NANCY flings open the door of her room and
text: dives through -- only to rebound off someone on the other side --
scene_heading: 187. INT. HALLWAY. NIGHT. 187.
text: MARGE, knocked flying by NANCY'S charge, hits the floor hard,
text: knocking the wind out of herself. NANCY sees what she's done,
text: jumps over the body and slams the door and throws the new bolt
text: home. Next instant she gingerly ties a string to the door's
text: knob, a string that trails down from the ceiling, attached to
text: something up there that's still just barely out of sight.
text: Next instant she's dragging her MOTHER towards the woman's
text: bedroom as fast as she can.
text: KRUEGER is already splintering the doorway behind her as NANCY
text: dips and makes it into MARGE's room, SLAMMING the DOOR behind her
text: and locking it in a flash.
text: The MANIAC breaks the bolt and rips open the door.
dialog: But the in the very act of doing this he of course unknowingly
text: pulls the string attached to the outside doorknob with terrific
dialog: force.
text: CLOSE ANGLE ON THE CEILING. The string jerks against a
text: single-edged razor, which in turn cuts a tight wind of cord
text: holding a heavy wedge of steel to the ceiling.
text: WIDER as the thing falls free, pivoting at the hinge at the far
text: end of its handle, and drives straight into KRUEGER'S groin with
text: a terrific blow. As he catapaults backwards with an incredulous
text: shriek, the twenty pound sledge hammer swings back and reveals to
dialog: camera just what it is!
text: ANGLE DOWN ON KRUEGER, clawwing his way up despite his agony,
text: lurching and cursing forward like an enraged bull.
text: WIDER ANGLE IN THE HALLWAY as KRUEGER roars out -- only to
text: immediately strike the length of WIRE strung across the hallway,
text: catching it just above the thigh. He cartwheels head-over-heels
text: and lands flat on his back!
text: Instantly the DOOR to NANCY's MOTHER's bedroom flies open and
text: NANCY brings a brass lamp down over KRUEGER's head with all her
text: might! It sounds like a line-drive caroming off a metal
text: flagpole.
text: NANCY SLAMS the DOOR as KRUEGER struggles up, clutching his
dialog: head.
text: Enraged, the huge man CRASHES against the door with terrific
text: force, and rears back and starts smashing against the door like
text: the utter homicidal lunatic that he is.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 188. EXT. ELM STREET/NANCY'S HOME. NIGHT. 188.
text: HIGH ANGLE at the second floor level. NANCY jerks open the
text: window to her MOTHER's bedroom and jams her face to the bars.
text: The AMBULANCE is pulling away with a tremendous WAIL of its SIREN
text: as NANCY SCREAMS down, trying to make herself heard.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Help! Hey -- Daddy -- I got
dialog: him trapped! Where are you!?
text: 189. ANGLE ON the street. PARKER, assigned to guard the house, sees 189.
text: NANCY -- hair white, eyes wide -- pounding on the bars and
text: screaming like a lunatic. But her meaning is utterly lost in the
text: noise of the ambulance next to him.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: (yelling up at her)
dialog: Everything's going to be all
dialog: right! Everything's under
dialog: control!
text: ANGLE at the window. Close on NANCY's face, incredulous at his
dialog: response.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Get my father, you asshole!
text: PARKER does a little take. That almost sounded sane.
speaker_heading: PARKER (OS)
dialog: You heard what I said! Now get
dialog: back inside or I'll tell your
dialog: dad!
text: 191. Behind her the DOOR SPLINTERS. NANCY whirls around just in time 191.
text: to see KRUEGER bull in! NANCY's eyes go wide -- she's trapped
text: against the bars and has nowhere to go. The man bunches his
text: knives into a single thick blade and rushes her, stabbing. NANCY
dialog: closes her eyes --
text: Then from OUT OF FRAME Marge leaps between the two.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: No!
text: She blocks the charge perfectly -- blocking the knives.
text: Both she and NANCY are slammed backwards against the bars
dialog: behind.
text: Drunk though she is, is hanging onto KRUEGER'S weapon hand,
text: keeping the knives inside herself, away from her daughter!
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Nancy -- for god's sake's run!
text: But NANCY turns to the window instead, screaming for her father.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Daddy! Where are you!
scene_heading: 192. EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT. 192.
text: PARKER, just about to turn back to the business at GLEN's house,
text: sees NANCY and SOMEONE else fall just inside the window.
text: Something begins to dawn on the man. Just a little.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Poor woman's got her hands full
dialog: with that kid. Maybe I better
dialog: tell the lieutenant.
text: He turns and jogs towards GLEN's house.
scene_heading: 193. INT. MARGE'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 193.
text: ANGLE ON KRUEGER, hauling MARGE up in rage, knocking her
text: senseless across her bed and climbing after her with his knives
text: raised. NANCY wheels behind him and whams him in the kidneys
text: with her fists, spilling him back off the bed, then running past
text: him for the door. She makes it to safety,
text: then turning back. She flips the monster the bird, her eyes wild
text: with pain and fury.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Hey fuckface -- can't catch me!
text: The bait works -- KRUEGER leaves MARGE and howls after NANCY.
scene_heading: 194. INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY. NIGHT. 194.
text: As NANCY clears the hall and makes the stairs, KRUEGER lurches
text: through the shattered doorway after her.
scene_heading: 195. INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 195.
text: The girl careens down the stairs, across the room and to the
text: front door, banging against it with terrified fury.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Come on -- he's in here!
dialog: Daddy! Don't let him kill
dialog: me too!
text: Behind her the huge MAN is thumping down the stairs, KNOCKING
text: THINGS OVER, SCRAPING his LONG STEEL FINGERNAILS along the wall
dialog: with a horrible sound!
text: NANCY flings a heavy ash tray through the porch window and
text: screams through the bars.
speaker_heading: NANCY (CONTD)
dialog: HEELLLPPP!!! Daddyyyyyyy!!!!
text: KRUEGER, bloody and spewwing threats, staggers for her -- NANCY
text: dives behind the couch.
text: CLOSE ON KRUEGER'S FEET as they hit another wire.
text: CLOSE ON the Lifesaver jerking out -- the clothespin snapping
text: together, completing the circuit with a CRACKLING SPARK.
text: WIDER ON THE EXPLOSION that rips out of the floor lamp next to
text: KRUEGER and knocks him sprawling across the room.
text: NANCY peeks out from behind the couch. The man lies in a smoking
text: heap. NANCY runs to the windows and screams out again.
speaker_heading: NANCY (CONTD)
dialog: Hey -- Daddy! Hey! I got the
dialog: bastard!
text: KRUEGER roars up behind her -- she throws herself sideways -- he
text: crashes into the window frame, smashing glass and wood to bits.
text: NANCY turns SCREAMING and runs deeper into the house.
text: 196. OMIT 196.
scene_heading: 197. INT. CELLAR. NIGHT. 197.
text: She careens down the stairs, throwing on the lights, the man
text: thundering after her.
text: ANGLE AT THE FAR END OF THE CELLAR. NANCY brakes at the wall.
text: Nowhere left to hide.
text: THE SCRAPPING of the blades against brick turns her to see the
text: huge killer holding his knife-laden fingers up for her.
speaker_heading: KRUEGER
dialog: Ready for these?
text: 198. ON NANCY -- she ducks behind the furnace -- comes out the other 198.
text: side with the big jug of gasoline and lets KRUEGER have it
text: straight over the head. The heavy container shatters, showering
text: its contents over every square inch of the man.
text: He staggers backwards with a ROAR of fury, NANCY screaming after
text: him with a box of kitchen matches. Before the man can realize
text: what she's up to, she ignites the whole box and throws it in
text: KRUEGER's face.
text: There's a blinding WHOOSH -- and KRUEGER goes up in a terrific
text: BALL OF FIRE. Faster than a flash the girl runs past the howling
text: maniac and makes for the stairs, KRUEGER after her in full
dialog: pyrrhic rage.
scene_heading: 199. INT. NANCY'S KITCHEN. NIGHT. 199.
text: NANCY holds the heavy door until the precisely right moment.
text: Just as the burning, blind monster tops the stairs, NANCY brings
text: the heavy oak door round with all her might and catches him in a
text: great RINGING CONCUSSION. It sends him windmilling backwards and
text: down the stairs in an ass-over-teakettle sprawl of sparks and
dialog: flames.
text: NANCY slams the door and throws the deadbolt home.
text: No sooner does she accomplish this than the man is SLAMMING again
text: and again against the door from the cellar.
text: The terrible SCREAMS and CURSES PEAK,
text: THEN GROW WEAKER AND MORE GARBLED. Then there's just silence.
text: NANCY staggers, half blind, from the kitchen.
text: As the room begins seething SMOKE from every pore, we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 200. INT. GLEN'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY. NIGHT. 200.
text: The CORONER steps out of the bathroom peeling bloody rubber
text: gloves. Pale and sweating.
speaker_heading: CORONER
dialog: Found you something, Donald.
dialog: Should remind you of something...
text: The man shoves out his hand to LT THOMPSON. THOMPSON stares at
text: it without touching it. A long, thin steel blade, razor sharp,
text: attached to some sort of ring and armature -- broken off...
text: The CORONER gives a sweaty, grim smile.
speaker_heading: CORONER (CONTD)
dialog: Only place I ever heard of such
dialog: a thing before was ten years
dialog: ago. Remember that fucker
dialog: Fred Krueger?
text: LT THOMPSON has just knocked PARKER sprawling in his race to the
dialog: stairs.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Hey -- your daughter's acting
dialog: kinda -- !
speaker_heading: (THOMPSON'S gone)
dialog: Strange...
scene_heading: 201. EXT. NANCY'S HOME. NIGHT. 201.
text: CRASH as NANCY breaks another window and presses against the
text: bars. The house shudders and glows orange behind her. She sees
text: her father bursting out the front door of Glen's house!
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!
dialog: (to his men)
dialog: Hey! We got a fire!
text: 202. ANGLE ON NANCY'S FRONT DOOR. Many MEN batter the door down as 202.
text: black smoke pours from the windows and NANCY's SCREAMS and SHOUTS
text: fill the air. Within moments they've destroyed the door and LT
text: THOMPSON has pulled his daughter into the safety of his arms.
text: But NANCY immediately fights free and darts right back to the
text: front door -- beckoning him to follow -- gesturing like a wild
dialog: woman.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I got him -- I got Fred Krueger!
text: THOMPSON stares at his wild little girl in astonishment, then
text: runs in after her. The others follow, coughing and choking.
scene_heading: 203. INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 203.
text: THOMPSON collides with NANCY as she brakes, frozen. THE SMOKE IS
text: BELCHING OUT OF THE CELLAR, but whoever was locked in there
text: certainly isn't now. The door is flat on the kitchen floor.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
dialog: What the hell are you talking about,
dialog: Nancy?
text: NANCY wheels without answering. A series of tiny, isolated fires
text: burn across the living room and up the stairs. Firesteps.
speaker_heading: NANCY (CONTD)
dialog: He's after Mom! Come on!
text: She darts across the living room, following the flaming
text: footprints of FRED KRUEGER up the stairs before THOMPSON can stop
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: LT THOMPSON
speaker_heading: NANCY!
scene_heading: 204. INT. MARGE'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 204.
text: NANCY STOPS IN THE SPLINTERED DOORWAY -- a ragged gold-red light
text: splashing her horrified face.
text: 205. REVERSE IN HER POV -- FRED KRUEGER, literally a man of fire, has 205.
text: a screaming MARGE pinned to the bed and is crawling all over
text: her! NANCY gives a banshee's howl, snatches up a chair and
text: brings it down over the back of the firey beast, stunning him.
text: By the time LT THOMPSON races into the room NANCY'S seized a
text: heavy blanket has thrown over both of them, fighting the flames.
text: The father joins his daughter without a second thought, heaving
text: another blanket over the bed and smothering the last of the
dialog: flames.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: He's under there! Watch it!
text: 206. THOMPSON pushes the girl back -- yanks out his .38 and pulls off 206.
text: the first cover. No movement. He pulls back a second one,
text: ready to fire. But the only thing he sees is the blackened
text: half-skeleton of his ex-wife, smoking and seething and sinking
text: into the fluid-like mattress, sinking right down through it as if
text: she were sinking into a lake. A blackened, gnarled hand goes
text: last, then the bed solidifies over the place she's disappeared.
dialog: And it's as if no one was ever there.
dialog: 
text: NANCY turns and looks at LT THOMPSON, her face white as her
text: ghostly hair. THOMPSON shoves his .38 back in its holster and
text: finds a cigarette, his hands shaking so badly he can barely
dialog: manage.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Now do you believe me?
text: PARKER barges in. The room is filled with smoke, the bed is
text: stripped, but other than that, the place seems normal.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: You find him?
dialog: (looking closer
speaker_heading: at THOMPSON)
dialog: Sir?
text: LT THOMPSON just walks by him. PARKER chases after.
speaker_heading: PARKER (CONTD OS)
dialog: (fading)
dialog: Sir -- here, let me light that
dialog: for you -- Lieutenant? What
dialog: happened?
dialog: (gone)
text: WIDER, ON NANCY alone in the room. She turns and looks at the
text: bed. MUSIC slips in and builds. The bed has changed color.
text: It's now an ash-darkened red and yellow.
text: 207. CLOSER ON NANCY from the direction of the bed. MUSIC SUDDENLY 207.
text: STOPS, and the surface of the red and yellow bed gets a bump in
text: its center that keeps raising, raising until it's a hump that's a
text: head and shoulders, still raising until it looms over NANCY.
text: Then FRED KRUEGER's entire shape sweeps up into the yellow and
text: red mass -- and the garish head, smoking and seething, pops
dialog: through.
text: NEW ANGLE -- KRUEGER, a burned, sizzling black hump of a killer,
text: clumps onto the floor between NANCY and the door.
text: NANCY falls absoltely still, and her face goes through a
text: strange, almost sublime transformation.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I know you're there, Krueger.
text: She turns and faces him.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: You think you was gonna get
dialog: away from me?
text: NANCY shakes her head.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I know you too well now,
dialog: Freddie.
text: KRUEGER smiles bitterly. Coming closer.
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: And now you die...
text: There's a SLICKERING RATTLE at his side, and he raises the only
text: thing on him not charred -- the gleaming steel talons.
text: 208. NANCY simply shakes her head again, as if seeing a light at the 208.
text: end of her long, long tunnel. And the way she says the words,
text: they might be appearing on the inside of her eyes.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: It's too late, Krueger. I
dialog: know the secret now -- this
dialog: is just a dream, too -- you're
dialog: not alive -- the whole thing
dialog: is a dream -- so fuck off!
dialog: I want my mother and friends
dialog: again.
text: KRUEGER grins insanely, confused and amused at the same time.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: You what?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (even, firm)
dialog: I take back every bit of
dialog: energy I ever gave you.
dialog: You're nothing. You're
dialog: shit.
text: And then she turns her back on him. KRUEGER bunches his
text: fingers, producing a single ragged bundle of razor talons and
text: raises his hand over the back of her head and neck.
text: NANCY closes her eyes and steps to the door.
text: CLOSE ON HER HAND, touching the door knob.
text: CLOSE ON KRUEGER'S KNIFE-FINGERS poised.
text: MUSIC BUILDS then SHRIEKS as KRUEGER stabs down, right through
text: NANCY -- as if she were an optical illusion -- loosing his
text: balance and falling down, down, down... And he's gone.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 209. EXT. ELM STREET. DAY. 209.
text: CLOSE ON NANCY'S FRONT DOOR AS NANCY jerks it open and blinks in
text: the bright, diffused light. The MUSIC FADES on a transitional
dialog: note, into light.
dialog: We hear BIRDS.
text: CHILDREN playing.
text: Early morning SOUNDS.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: God, it's bright.
text: MARGE sticks her head out, squinting, and nods. Sober.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Gonna burn off soon or it
dialog: wouldn't be so bright.
text: NANCY turns and looks her mother over.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Feeling better?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: They say you've bottomed out
dialog: when you can't remember the
dialog: night before.
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: No more drinking, Baby, suddenly
dialog: I just don't feel like it
dialog: any more.
text: She touches NANCY.
speaker_heading: MARGE (CONTD)
dialog: Didn't keep you up last night,
dialog: did I? You look a little
dialog: peeked.
text: NANCY smiles.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Nah. Just slept heavy.
text: The girl gives a wave and goes off. MARGE calls after.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: See ya.
text: NANCY turns and waves.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: See ya.
text: 210. WIDER ON NANCY as she walks to the curb. The whole scene is 210.
text: wrapped in an unseasonal tule fog, bright yet diffuse. We notice
dialog: that NANCY's house no longer has bars on its windows. Then we
text: see a familiar convertible pull up at the curb, top down. TINA
text: and ROD are in the back seat. They all wave to MARGE as NANCY
dialog: climbs in.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: (calling)
dialog: You believe this fog?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I believe anything's possible.
text: TINA slaps five with NANCY.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Lookin' good, girl!
text: ANGLE INSIDE THE CONVERTIBLE. GLEN slips into the seat next to
text: NANCY. Someone else is driving, it seems. NANCY looks up to the
text: DRIVER. The big MAN turns and grins at NANCY, a terrible,
text: scarred, hideous leer of a grin -- FRED KRUEGER'S grin!
text: ANGLE BACK OUTSIDE THE CONVERTIBLE as its top clamps over the
text: kids within -- a bright red and yellow top that closes as fast
text: and hard as a beartrap! NANCY'S frightened face flies to the
text: window, pressing against the thick glass as the car roars away
text: from the curb and into the thick fog.
text: 211. CAMERA PANS TO a group of LITTLE GIRLS, half-hidden by the fog, 211.
