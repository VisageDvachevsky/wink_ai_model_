dialog: make up our rassoodocks what to do with
text: the evening. The Korova Milk Bar sold

speaker_heading: TRAMP
text: It's a stinking world because there's no
dialog: law and order any more. It's a stinking
dialog: world because it lets the young get onto

dialog: (singing)
text: ... I've a smile on my face.
dialog: I'1l walk down the lane... to a happy

dialog: I'm singing... just singin' in the rain.

text: twanged off and out, and in the short
dialog: silence before the next one came on, she
text: suddenly came with a burst of singing, and
dialog: it was like for a moment, O my brothers,
text: some great bird had flown into the milkbar
dialog: and I felt all the malenky little hairs on
text: my plott standing endwise, and the shivers
text: crawling up like slow malenky lizards and
dialog: then down again. Because I knew what she
dialog: sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th,
dialog: by Ludwig van.
text: Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two
text: fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw.
text: Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
speaker_heading: DIM
dialog: What did you do that for?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: For being a bastard with no manners and

speaker_heading: DIM

text: Music starts.
speaker_heading: ALEX (V.0.)
dialog: Then, brothers, it came. O bliss, bliss
dialog: and heaven, oh it was gorgeousness and
text: georgeosity made flesh. The trombones
text: crunched redgold under my bed, and behind
dialog: my gulliver the trumpets three-wise,
text: silver-flamed and there by the door the
text: timps rolling through my guts and out
text: again, crunched like candy thunder. It was
text: like a bird of rarest spun heaven metal or
text: like silvery wine flowing in a space ship,
dialog: gravity all nonsense now. As I slooshied,
dialog: I knew such lovely pictures. There were
text: veeks and ptitsas laying on the ground
dialog: screaming for mercy and I was smecking all
text: over my rot and grinding my boot into

text: devotchkas ripped and creeching against

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Hi, hi, hi there, Mr. Deltoid, funny
dialog: surprise to see you here.
speaker_heading: DELTOID
dialog: Ah, Alex boy, awake at last, yes? I met
dialog: your mother on the way to work, yes? She
dialog: gave me the key. She said something about
dialog: a pain somewhere... hence not at school ,
dialog: yes?
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: A rather intolerable pain in the head,
dialog: brother, sir. I think it should be clear
text: by this afterlunch.
speaker_heading: DELTOID
dialog: Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The
dialog: evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex
dialog: boy?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: A cup of the old chai, sir?
speaker_heading: DELTOID
dialog: No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit.
text: Alex sits next to him.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: To what do I owe this extreme pleasure,
dialog: sir? Anything wrong, sir?
text: Deltoid "playfully" grabs Alex's hair.
speaker_heading: DELTOID
dialog: Wrong? Why should you think of anything
dialog: being wrong, have you been doing something
dialog: you shouldn't. Yes?
text: He shakes Alex's hair.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Just a manner of speech, sir.
speaker_heading: DELTOID
dialog: Well, yes, it's just a manner of speech
dialog: from your Post Corrective Advisor to you
dialog: that you watch out, little Alex.
text: He puts his arm round Alex's shoulder.
speaker_heading: DELTOID
dialog: Because next time it's going to be the
dialog: barry place and all my work ruined. If
dialog: you've no respect for your horrible self,
dialog: you at least might have some for me who'se
dialog: sweated over you.
text: He slaps Alex on the knee.
speaker_heading: DELTOID
dialog: A big black mark I tell you for every one
dialog: we don't reclaim. A confession of failure
dialog: for every one of you who ends up in the
text: stripy hole.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I've been doing nothing I shouldn't, sir.
dialog: The millicents have nothing on me,
dialog: brother, sir, I mean.
text: Deltiod pulls Alex down on the bed.
speaker_heading: DELTOID
dialog: Cut out all this clever talk about
dialog: milicents. Just because the Police haven't
dialog: picked you up lately doesn't, as you very
dialog: well know, mean that you've not been up to
dialog: some nastiness. There was a bit of a
dialog: nastiness last night, yes. Some very
dialog: extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain
text: Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off
dialog: late last night, yes. Your name was
dialog: mentioned, the word's got thru to me by
dialog: the usual channels. Certain friends of
dialog: yours were named also. Oh, nobody can
dialog: prove anything about anybody as usual, but
dialog: I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good
dialog: friend to you as always, the one man in
dialog: this sore and sick community who wants to
dialog: save you from yourself.
text: Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead.
text: Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches
text: for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set
text: of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The
text: clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes.
speaker_heading: DELTOID
dialog: What gets into you all? We study the
dialog: problem. We've been studying it for damn
dialog: well near a century, yes, but we get no
dialog: further with our studies. You've got a
dialog: good home here, good loving parents,
dialog: you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it
dialog: some devil that crawls inside of you?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir.
dialog: I've been out of the rookers of the
text: milicents for a long time now.
speaker_heading: DELTOID
dialog: That's just worries me. A bit too long to
dialog: long to be reasonable. You're about due
dialog: now by my reckoning, that's why I'm
dialog: warning you, little Alex, to keep your
text: handsome young proboscis out of the dirt.
dialog: Do I make myself clear?
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: As an unmuddied lake, sir. Clear as an
dialog: azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely
dialog: on me, sir.
text: Deltoid drinks again but this time sees the teeth in the glass. He
text: groans and retches.
scene_heading: INT. MUSIC BOOTICK - DAY
text: Alex enters. Two pretty micro-boppers, Marty and Sonietta, sucking

dialog: might have been like offended by something
dialog: or other, so around we come to your abode.
speaker_heading: ALEX

dialog: sure the pain's gone? You sure you'll not
dialog: be happier back up in bed.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Lets get things nice and sparkling clear.
dialog: This sarcasm, if I may call it such, does
dialog: not become you, O my brothers. As I am
dialog: your droog and leader, I am entitled to
dialog: know what goes on, eh? Now then, Dim, what
text: does that great big horsy gape of a grin
dialog: portend?
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: All right, no more picking on Dim,
dialog: brother. That's part of the new way.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: New way? What's this about a new way?
dialog: There's been some very large talk behind

speaker_heading: DIM
dialog: Big, big money.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: And what will you do with the big, big,
dialog: money? Have you not everything you need?
dialog: If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from
dialog: the trees. If you need pretty polly, you
dialog: take it.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Brother, you think and talk sometimes like
dialog: a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize

dialog: the time, so now it was to be Georgie the
dialog: General, saying what we should do and what
dialog: not to do, and Dim as his mindless,

dialog: that thinking was for the gloopy ones and
dialog: that the oomny ones use like inspiration

dialog: nothing at all, but you never know...
dialog: Well, a young man rang the bell asking to
dialog: use the telephone... He said there had
dialog: been some kind of accident. The thing that
dialog: caught my attention was what he said - the
dialog: words he used, sounded exactly like what
dialog: was quoted in the papers this morning in
dialog: connection with the writer and his wife
dialog: who were assaulted last night... Well,
dialog: just a few minutes ago... Well, if you
dialog: think that's necessary, but, well, I'm

speaker_heading: DELTOID

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: It wasn't me, brother, sir. Speak up for

speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: Sings the roof off lovely, he does that.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: And where are my stinking traitorous
dialog: droogs. Get them before the get away. It

speaker_heading: DELTOID
dialog: You are now a murderer, little Alex. A
dialog: murderer, yes.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Not true, sir. It was only a slight

speaker_heading: DELTOID

dialog: Your victim has died.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You try to frighten me, sir, admit so,

dialog: it, brother, sir.
speaker_heading: DELTOID
dialog: It will be your own torture. I hope to God
dialog: it will torture you to madness.
speaker_heading: FATNECK
dialog: If you'd care to give him a bash in the

text: Priest walks by and nods pleasantly.
speaker_heading: ALEX (V.0.)
dialog: It had been arranged by the prison
dialog: charlie, as part of my further education
dialog: to read him the Bible. I didn't so much
text: like the latter part of the book which is
dialog: more like all preachy talking, than
dialog: fighting and the old in-out. I liked the
dialog: parts where these old yahoodies tolchock
dialog: each other and then drink their Hebrew

speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Father, I have tried, have I not?
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: You have, my son.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I've done my best, have I not?
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Indeed.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: And, Father, I've never been guilty of any
dialog: institutional infractions, have I?
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: You certainly have not, 655321. You've
dialog: been very helpful, and you've shown a
dialog: genuine desire to reform.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Father - may I ask you a question in
dialog: private?
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there
dialog: something troubling you, my son? Don't be
dialog: shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the
dialog: urges that can trouble young men deprived
dialog: of the society of women.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No Father. It's nothing like that, Father.
dialog: It's about this new thing they're all
dialog: talking about. About this new treatment
dialog: that you out of prison in no time at all
dialog: and makes sure you never get back in
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Where did you hear about this? Whose been
dialog: talking about these things?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: These things get around, Father. Two
dialog: Warders talk as it might be, and somebody
text: can't help overhearing what they say. Then
text: somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in
dialog: the workshops and the newspaper tells all
dialog: about it. How about putting me in for this
dialog: new treatment, Father?
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: I take it you are referring to the
dialog: Ludovico Technique?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I don't know what it's called, Father, all
dialog: I know is that it gets you out quickly and
dialog: makes sure that you never get in again.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is
dialog: only in the experimental stage at this
dialog: moment .
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: It has not been used yet in this prison.
dialog: The Governor has grave doubts about it and
dialog: I have heard that there are very serious
dialog: dangers involved.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I don't care about the danger, Father. I
dialog: just want to be good. I want for the rest
dialog: of my life to be one act of goodness.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: The question is weather or not this
dialog: technique really makes a man good.
dialog: Goodness comes from within. Goodness is
dialog: chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases
dialog: to be a man.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I don't understand about the whys and
dialog: wherefores, Father. I only know I want to
dialog: be good.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Be patient, my son, and put your trust in

dialog: Not a chance, my dear fellow. The

text: with outmoded penological theories. Soon
dialog: we may be needing all of out prison space
dialog: for political offenders. Common criminals
dialog: like these are best dealt with on a purely

dialog: say, if someone hits you, you hit back, do
dialog: you not? Why then should not the State
dialog: very severely hit by you brutal offenders
dialog: not hit back also? But the new view is to

speaker_heading: ALEX (V.0.)
dialog: The next morning I was taken to the

speaker_heading: CHIEF GUARD

text: Doctor nods. Officer steps forward.
speaker_heading: CHIEF GUARD
dialog: If I might offer a word of advice, Doc.

speaker_heading: DR. BRANOM
dialog: Oh no, nothing of the sort.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Vitamins will it be then?
speaker_heading: DR. BRANOM
dialog: Something like that. You are a little

dialog: your right side please, loosen your pajama

text: He does, somewhat reluctanly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What exactly is the treatment here going
dialog: to be then?
speaker_heading: DR. BRANOM
dialog: It's quite simple really. Were just going
dialog: to show you some films.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You mean like going to the pictures?
speaker_heading: DR. BRANOM
dialog: Something like that.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Well, that's good. I like to viddy the old
dialog: films now and again.
scene_heading: INT. AUDIO VISUAL LUDOVICO CENTRE - DAY
text: Auditorium setting. Alex is bound in a examination chair in front
text: of a large video screen. A white-coated Technician is strapping
text: Alex's head to a medical device.
text: He then carefully attaches the eyelid locking to Alex's eyes.
speaker_heading: ALEX (V.0.)
dialog: And viddy films I would. Where I was taken
dialog: to, brothers, was like no cine I'd been in
dialog: before. I was bound up in a straight-
text: jacket and my guliver was strapped to a
text: headrest with like wires running away from
text: it. Then they clamped like lidlocks on my
dialog: eyes so I could not shut them no matter
dialog: how hard I tried. It seemed a bit crazy to
dialog: me, but I let them get on with what they
dialog: wanted to get on with. If I was to be a
text: free young malchick in a fortnight's time,
dialog: I would put up with much in the meantime,
dialog: my brothers.
text: At the back of the auditorium are ten or fifteen solemn medical
text: Professionals in white coats watching the proceedings and
text: occasionally taking notes. A film begins showing on the screen.
text: The Technician drops eyedrops into Alex's eyes.
speaker_heading: VIOLENCE FILM
text: Man being beaten by four toughs wearing white.
text: Punches, kicks, grunts, blood.
speaker_heading: ALEX (V.0.)
dialog: So far the first film was a very good
dialog: professional piece of cine, looked like it
dialog: was done in Hollywood.
text: Screams, moans, kicks, punches.
speaker_heading: ALEX (V.0.)
dialog: The sounds were real horroshow. You could
text: slooshy the screams and moans very
dialog: realistic and you could even get the heavy
text: breathing and panting of the tolchocking
dialog: malchicks at the same time. And then, what
dialog: do you know, soon our dear old friend, the
text: red, red vino on tap. The same in all
text: places like it's put out by the same big
text: firm, began to flow. It was beautiful.
dialog: It's funny how the colors of the real
dialog: world only seem really real when you viddy
text: them on a screen.
text: More kicks, punches, groans, thumps.
text: Girl being beaten, raped by six toughs.
text: Screams, music, laughing, grunts, heavy breathing.
speaker_heading: ALEX (V.0.)
dialog: Now all the time I was watching this, I
dialog: was beginning to get very aware of like
dialog: not feeling all that well, but I tried to
dialog: forget this, concentrating on the next
text: film, which jumped right away on a young
dialog: devotchka, who was being given the old in-
text: out, in-out, first by one malchick, then
dialog: another, then another. This seemed real,
dialog: very real, though if you thought about it
dialog: properly you couldn't imagine lewdies
dialog: actually agreeing to having all this done
dialog: to them in a film, and if these films were
dialog: made by the good, or the State, you
dialog: couldn't imagine them being allowed to
dialog: take these films, without like interfering
dialog: with what was going on.
text: Girl being raped.
speaker_heading: ALEX (V.0.)
dialog: When it came to the sixth or seventh
text: malchick, leering and smecking and then
dialog: going into it, I began to feel really
dialog: sick. But I could not shut my glazzies and
dialog: even if I tried to move my glazballs about
dialog: I still not get out of the line of fire of
dialog: this picture.
text: Alex squirming and retching.
text: Dr. Brodsky clears his throat and quietly addresses his collegues
text: seated in the back of the room.
scene_heading: DR. BRODSKY
dialog: Very soon now the drug will cause the
text: subject to experience a death-like
text: paralysis together with deep feelings of
dialog: terror and helplessness. One of our
dialog: earlier test subjects described it as
text: being like death, a sense of stifling and
dialog: drowning, and it is during this period we
dialog: have found the subject will make his most
dialog: rewarding associations between his
dialog: catastrophic experience and environment
text: and the violence he sees.
text: Alex retching violently and struggling against his strait jacket.
scene_heading: INT. ALEX'S
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Let me be sick... I want to get up. Get me
dialog: something to be sick in... Stop the

dialog: any more. Stop it please... please.
scene_heading: ROOM - LUDOVICO - DAY
speaker_heading: DR. BRANOM
dialog: Well, that was a very promising start. By
dialog: my calculations, you should be starting to
dialog: feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's
dialog: pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be
dialog: two sessions, of course, morning and
dialog: afternoon.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in
dialog: one day?
speaker_heading: DR. BRANOM
dialog: I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit
dialog: limp by the end of the day. But we have to
dialog: be hard on you. You have to be cured.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: But it was horrible.
speaker_heading: DR. BRANOM
dialog: Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence
dialog: is a very horrible thing. That's what
dialog: you're learning now. Your body is learning
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I just don't understand about feeling sick
dialog: the way I did. I never used to feel sick
dialog: before. I used to feel like the very
dialog: opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it,
dialog: I used to feel real horrorshow. I just
dialog: don't understand why, how or what.
speaker_heading: DR. BRANOM
dialog: You felt ill this afternoon because you're
dialog: getting better. You see, when we're
dialog: healthy we respond to the presence of the
dialog: hateful with fear and nausea. You're
dialog: becoming healthy that's all. By this time
dialog: tomorrow you'll be healthier still.
scene_heading: INT. AUDIO VISUAL LUDOVICO CENTRE - DAY
text: Alex retching and screaming - restrained again by a straight-
dialog: jacket.
speaker_heading: ALEX (V.0.)
dialog: It was the next day, brothers, and I had
dialog: truly done my best, morning and afternoon,
dialog: to play it their way and sit like a
dialog: horrorshow co-operative malchick in the
text: chair of torture, while they flashed nasty
text: bits of ultra-violence on the screen.;
dialog: though not on the soundtrack, my brothers.
text: The only sound being music. Then I noticed
dialog: in all my pain and sickness what music it
text: was that like cracked and boomed. It was
dialog: Ludwig van - 9th symphony, 4th movement.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Stop it... stop it, please!!! I beg of
dialog: you!!! It's a sin!!! It's a sin!!! It's a
dialog: sin, please!!!
text: Brodsky leans forward and turns down the sound.
scene_heading: DR. BRODSKY
dialog: What's all this about sin?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: That!... Using Ludwig van like that! He
dialog: did no harm to anyone. Beethoven just
dialog: wrote music.
speaker_heading: DR. BRANOM
dialog: Are you referring to the background score?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yes!!!
speaker_heading: DR. BRANOM
dialog: You've heard Beethoven before?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yes!!!
scene_heading: DR. BRODSKY
dialog: You're keen on music?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yes!!!
speaker_heading: DR. BRANOM
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: What do you think about that, Dr. Brodsky?
scene_heading: DR. BRODSKY
dialog: (softly)
dialog: It can't be helped. Here's your punishment
dialog: element perhaps. The Governor ought to be
dialog: pleased... I'm sorry, Alex, this is for
dialog: your own good, you'll have to bear with us
dialog: for a while.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You needn't take it any further, sir.
dialog: You've proved to me that all this ultra-
dialog: violence and killing is wrong and terribly
dialog: wrong. I've learned my lesson, sir. I see
dialog: now what I've never seen before I'm cured,
dialog: praise Bog!
scene_heading: DR. BRODSKY
dialog: You're not cured yet, my boy.
scene_heading: DR. BRODSKY
dialog: You must take your chance boy. The choice
dialog: has been all yours.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's
dialog: wrong! It's wrong because it's like
dialog: against like society. It's wrong because
dialog: everybody has the right to live and be
text: happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
scene_heading: DR. BRODSKY
dialog: No, no, boy. You really must leave it to
dialog: us, but be cheerful about it. In less than

speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: Ladies and Gentlemen, at this point, we
dialog: introduce the subject himself. He is, as
dialog: you will perceive, fit and well nourished.
text: He comes straight from as night's sleep
text: and a good breakfast, undrugged,
text: unhypnotized. Tomorrow, we send him with
text: confidence out into the world again, as
dialog: decent a lad as you would meet on a May
dialog: morning. What a change is here, Ladies and
dialog: Gentlemen, from the wretched hoodlum the
dialog: state committed to unprofitable punishment
dialog: some two years ago, unchanged after two
dialog: years. Unchanged, do I say - not quite.
dialog: Prison taught him a false smile, the
text: rubbed hands of hypocrisy, the fawning,
text: greased, obsequious leer. Other vices
dialog: prison taught him as well as confirming
dialog: him in those he had long practiced before.
dialog: Our party promised to restore law and
dialog: order and to make the streets safe for the
dialog: ordinary peace loving citizen. This pledge
text: is now about to become a reality. Ladies
dialog: and Gentlemen, this is an historic moment.
dialog: The problem of criminal violence is soon
dialog: to be a thing of the past. But enough of
dialog: words - actions speak louder than. Action
dialog: now. Observe all.
text: He returns to his seat and leans close to his Junior Minister.
scene_heading: JUNIOR MINISTER
dialog: Our necks are out a long way on this,

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Why do you say that, brother? I had a

speaker_heading: LARDFACE

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No, brother. What d'you want?
speaker_heading: LARDFACE
dialog: What do I want?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
speaker_heading: LARDFACE
dialog: Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you
dialog: must think I'm awfully stupid.
text: He slaps Alex in the face.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Why did you do that, brither? I've never
dialog: done wrong to you.
speaker_heading: LARDFACE
dialog: You want to know why I did that, well you
dialog: see - I do that...
text: He stamps on Alex's foot.
speaker_heading: LARDFACE
dialog: and this...
text: He pulls Alex's nose.
speaker_heading: LARDFACE
dialog: and that...
text: He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on
text: his chest.
speaker_heading: LARDFACE
dialog: because I don't like you horrible
dialog: type, do I, and if you want to start
dialog: something... if you want to start... go
dialog: on... well, you just start. Please do.
text: Alex retching.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I'm gonna be sick.
speaker_heading: LARDFACE
dialog: You're gonna be sick are you?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I wanna be sick.
speaker_heading: LARDFACE
dialog: You wanna be sick?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Let me get up.
speaker_heading: LARDFACE
dialog: You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you
dialog: see... well I want you to lick it. Go
dialog: on... Lick it.

speaker_heading: LARDFACE
dialog: ... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a
dialog: good boy.
speaker_heading: ALEX (V.0.)
dialog: And, O my brothers, would you believe your
dialog: faithful friend and long suffering
text: narrator pushed out his red yahzik a mile
dialog: and a half to lick the grahzny, vonny
dialog: boots. The horrible killing sickness had
text: wooshed up and turned the like joy of
dialog: battle into a feeling I was going to snuff
dialog: it.

speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: Enough! That will do very well. Thank you.

speaker_heading: LARDFACE

text: A beautiful nude Girl enters.
text: Alex looks up slowly.
speaker_heading: ALEX (V.0.)
text: She came towards me with the light like it
dialog: was the like light of heavenly grace, and
dialog: the first thing that flashed into my
dialog: gulliver was that I would like to have her
text: right down there on the floor with the old
text: in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot
dialog: came the sickness, like a detective that
text: had been watching around the corner and
text: now followed to make his arrest.
text: Alex retching. Minister rises.
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: Thank you very much. Thank you my dear.
text: Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: Not feeling too bad now are you?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (pullimg himself
dialog: together)
dialog: No, sir, I feel really great.
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: Fine. Absolutely fine. You see, Ladies and
dialog: Gentlemen our subject is, you see,
text: impelled towards good by paradoxically
text: being impelled toward evil. The intention
text: to act violently is accompanied by strong
dialog: feelings of physical distress. To counter
dialog: these, the subject has to switch to a
dialog: diametrically opposed attitude. Any
dialog: questions?
text: Priest rises and moves to Alex.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Choice! The boy has no real choice, has
dialog: he? Self interest, fear of physical pain
dialog: drove him to that grotesque act of self
text: abasement. Its insincerity was clearly to
text: be seen. He ceases also to be a creature
dialog: capable of moral choice.
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: Padre, these are subtleties. We are not
dialog: concerned with motive, with the higher
dialog: ethics; we are concerned only with cutting
dialog: down crime. And with relieving the ghastly
dialog: congestion in our prisons... He will be
dialog: your true Christian, ready to turn the
text: other cheek. Ready to be crucified rather
text: than crucify, sick to the very heart at
text: the thought even of killing a fly.
dialog: Reclamation, joy before the angels of God.
dialog: The point is that it works!

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: PEE

speaker_heading: EM

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No thanks, Mum. It'll pass in a minute...

speaker_heading: PEE

dialog: well, whatever we do in the future, we
dialog: cant just say to Joe to get out, now can
dialog: we?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No, there's much more than that, though. I
dialog: mean I've got you two to think of. I mean
dialog: you're more like a mother and father to
dialog: me. Well, it wouldn't be fair now, would
dialog: it, for me to go off and leave you two to
dialog: the tender mercies of this young monster
dialog: who's been like no real son at all. Look,
text: let him go off and find a room somewhere.
dialog: Let him learn the errors of his way, and

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Alright. I see how things are now. I've
dialog: suffered and I've suffered, and I've
dialog: suffered and everybody wants me to go on
dialog: suffering.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You've made others suffer. It's only fair
dialog: that you should suffer proper. You know
dialog: I've been told everything you've done,
dialog: sitting here at night round the family
dialog: table, pretty shocking it was to listen
dialog: to. It made me real sick, a lot of it did.

dialog: the film.
speaker_heading: TRAMP
dialog: Can you spare me some cutter, me brother?
dialog: Can you spare some cutter, me brother?
text: Alex, without looking at him, reaches in his pocket and gives him
dialog: some money.
speaker_heading: TRAMP
dialog: Oh, thankyou, your honour.
text: The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.
speaker_heading: TRAMP
dialog: Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother
dialog: of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed
dialog: saints in Heaven preserve us.
text: Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
speaker_heading: TRAMP
dialog: I never forget a face! I never forget any
dialog: face, be God!
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Leave me alone, brother. I've never seen
dialog: you before.
text: Tramp shouts to other Meths drinkers and Tramps.
speaker_heading: TRAMP
text: This is the poisonous young swine that
dialog: near done me in. Him and his friends beat
text: me and kicked me and thumped me.
text: Alex breaks away again.
speaker_heading: TRAMP
dialog: Stop him! Stop him!
text: A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: TRAMP
dialog: They laughed at me blood and me moans.
text: This murderous young pig is a prize
text: specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He
dialog: is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it
dialog: to him. That's it.
text: Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex.
speaker_heading: ALEX (V.0.)
text: Then there was like a sea of dirty, smelly
dialog: old men trying to get at your humble
text: Narrator, with their feeble rookers and
text: horny old claws. It was Old Age having a
dialog: go at Youth and I daren't do a single
dialog: solitary thing, 0 my brothers, it being
dialog: better to be hit at like that, than want
dialog: to be sick and feel that horrible pain.
text: The Tramp crowd round Alex, shouting.
speaker_heading: TRAMPS
text: Young hooligan... Vagabound... Kill him...
dialog: Villain... Toad... Bastard... Kick his
dialog: teeth in... Near killed poor old Jack, he
dialog: did.
text: Police move in and push off crowd.
speaker_heading: FIRST POLICEMAN
dialog: Alright, stop it now.
speaker_heading: SECOND POLICEMAN
dialog: Alright, stop it now. Alright! Come on.
dialog: Stop breaking the State peace. You naughty
dialog: boys. Alright, that's enough.
text: Alex looks up.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Oh, no.
speaker_heading: DIM
dialog: Well, well, well, well, well, well, well,
dialog: if it isn't little Alex. Long time no
dialog: viddy, droog. How goes? Surprised are you?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Impossible... I don't believe it.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
text: Evidence of the old glazzies. Nothing up
dialog: our sleeves. No magic, little Alex? A job

dialog: police.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
text: Police Landrover drives up.
text: Alex is pulled out by Georgie and Dim and hustled up a deserted
dialog: lane.
speaker_heading: DIM
dialog: Come on, Alex. Come for walkies.
dialog: Hahahahaha.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Come, come, my little droogies. I just
dialog: don't get this at all. The old days are
dialog: dead and gone. For what I did in the past
dialog: I've been punished.
speaker_heading: DIM
dialog: Been punished, yeah?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I've been cured.
speaker_heading: DIM
dialog: Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us.
dialog: The Inspector read all that out to us. He
dialog: said it was a very good way.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I just don't get this all. It was them
dialog: that went for me, brothers. You're not on
dialog: their side and can't be. You can't be Dim.
dialog: It was someone we fillied with back in the
dialog: old days... Trying to get his own malenky
dialog: bit of revenge after all this time. You
dialog: remember, Dim?
speaker_heading: DIM
dialog: Long time, is right. I don't remember them
dialog: days too horrorshow. Don't call me Dim no
dialog: more, either. Officer, call me.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Enough is remembered though, little Alex.
text: Dim and Georgie laugh.
text: They drag Alex to a low water through.
speaker_heading: DIM
dialog: This is to make sure you stay cured.
text: Georgie hits Alex in the stomach with his blackjack. Then, they
text: push his head under the water and methodically start to beat him
text: with their blackjacks.
text: After a full minute of this, they drag him out, halt-drowned,
speaker_heading: DIM
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Be viddying you some more, some time Alex.
scene_heading: EXT. "HOME" - NIGHT - HEAVY RAIN
text: Alex stumbles up the road to the entrance gate.
speaker_heading: ALEX (V.0.)
dialog: Where was I to go, who had no home and no
dialog: money. I cried for meself, Home, Home,
dialog: Home. It was Home I was wanting and it was
dialog: Home I came to, brothers, not realising in
dialog: the state I was in, where I was and had
dialog: been before.
text: Alex stumbles and crawls to the door.
scene_heading: INT. "HOME" - NIGHT
text: Mr. Alexander at his typewriter.
text: Julian a 6'4" - heavyweight weight-lifter lies across an exercise
text: bench working with bar-bells.
text: The door bell rings.
speaker_heading: MR. ALEXANDER
dialog: Who on earth could that be?
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: I'll see who it is.
text: He goes to the door.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Yes, what is it?
text: No reply. He opens the door. Alex falls into the hall.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (barely audible)
dialog: Help. Help me... Help me... Police.
text: Julian picks him up like a child and carries him into the living
dialog: room.
scene_heading: INT. "HOME" - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: ALEX (V.0.)
dialog: And would you believe it, O my brothers
dialog: and only friends, there was your faithful
text: Narrator being held helpless, like a babe
dialog: in arms, and suddenly realising where I
dialog: was and why HOME on the gate had looked so
dialog: familiar. But I knew I was safe. I knew he
dialog: would not rememeber me for, in those
dialog: carefree days, I and my so-called droogs
dialog: wore our maskies which were like real
text: horrorshow disguises.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Frank, I think this young man needs help.
speaker_heading: MR. ALEXANDER
dialog: Dear, dear, dear. Whatever happened to
dialog: you, my boy?
text: Mr. Alexander, now confined to a wheelchair, pushes himself away
text: from his desk, and rolls up to Julian. The water drips off Alex's
text: clothes. They look at each other.
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: The police... The horrible ghastly Police.
dialog: They beat me up, sir. The Police beat me
dialog: up, sir.
text: Mr. Alexander stares at him. It becomes aparent he is insane.
speaker_heading: MR. ALEXANDER
dialog: I know who you are! Isn't it your picture
dialog: in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this
dialog: morning on the video? Are you not the poor
dialog: victim of this horrible new technique?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir...
dialog: and what I am... a victim, sir.
text: Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.
speaker_heading: MR. ALEXANDER
dialog: Then, by God, you have been sent here by
text: providence. Tortured in prison, then
text: thrown out to be tortured by the Police.
dialog: My heart goes out to you, poor, poor boy.
dialog: Oh, you are not the first to come here in
text: distress. The Police are fond of bringing
dialog: their victims to the outskirts of this
dialog: village. But it is providential that you,
dialog: who are also another kind of victim,
dialog: should come here. But you're cold and
dialog: shivering. Julian, draw a bath for this
text: young man.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Certainly, Frank.
text: He carries Alex off.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Thank you very much, sir. God bless you,
dialog: sir.
text: Alexander bites his hand.
scene_heading: INT. "HOME" - BATHROOM
text: Alex soaks, eyes closed, in a hot tub.
text: After a while he begins softly singing to himself: "Singin' in the
dialog: Rain".
scene_heading: INT. "HOME" - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Mr. Alexander is hunched over the phone, talking in hoarse
text: whipsers. The door to the bathroom is right behind him. While he
text: speaks Mr. Alexander throws nervous glances over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: MR. ALEXANDER
dialog: I tell you, sir, they have turned this
text: young man into something other than a
dialog: human being. He has no power of choice any
dialog: more. He's committed to socially
dialog: acceptable acts, a little machine capable
dialog: only of good... He can be the most potent
dialog: weapon imaginable to ensure that the
dialog: Government is not returned at the next
dialog: election. The Government's great boast, as
dialog: you know sir, is the way they have dealt
dialog: with crime in the last few months.
text: Recruiting brutal young roughs into the
dialog: police, proposing debilitation and will-
dialog: sapping techniques of conditioning. Oh,
dialog: we've seen it all before in other
dialog: countries The thin end of the wedge.
dialog: Before we know where we are we shall have
text: the full apparatus of totalitarianism.
text: This young boy is a living witness to
dialog: these diabolical proposals. The people -
dialog: the common people - must know... must see!
dialog: There are rare traditions of liberty to
dialog: defend. The tradition of liberty means
dialog: all. The common people will let it go! Oh,
dialog: yes - they will sell liberty for a quieter
dialog: life. That is why they must be led, sir,
dialog: driven... pushed!!! Thank you very much,
dialog: sir. He'll be here.
text: Trembling with excitement and madness, Mr. Alexander hangs up the
text: phone. His eyes, shiny with anticipation. Then, suddenly, he
text: becomes aware of Alex's voice coming from the other side of the
scene_heading: - BATHROOM
text: Alex in bath, singing.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I'm singing in the rain,
dialog: Just singing in the rain...
speaker_heading: MR. ALEXANDER
text: His face horribly distorted in a Homeric rage.
speaker_heading: - NIGHT
text: Alex, alone, in complete silence. Eating a large plate of
text: spaghetti. The giant, Julian, appears, carrying Mr. Alexander in
text: his wheelchair. He deposits him at the table.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Good evening, sir.
speaker_heading: MR. ALEXANDER
dialog: (very weird)
dialog: Good evening.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: It was very kind of you to leave this out
dialog: for me, sir. There was no-one around when
dialog: I finished my bath, so I started. I hope
dialog: that's alright, sir.
speaker_heading: MR. ALEXANDER
dialog: (too loud - voice out
dialog: of control)
dialog: Of course. Food alright?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Great, sir. Great.
speaker_heading: MR. ALEXANDER
dialog: Try the wine!
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Thank you very much, sir. Cheers
text: Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged
dialog: or poisoned.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Won't you join me, sir?
speaker_heading: MR. ALEXANDER
dialog: No, my health doesn't allow it.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (to Julian)
dialog: And you, sir?
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: No thank you.
text: Alex, stalling for time, reaches for bottle and reads the label.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: 1960, Chateau, Saint Estephe, Medoc, very
dialog: good brand, sir.
text: He doesn't get a penny's change for his remarks from Alexander and
dialog: Julian.
text: He holds the glass up to the light.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Very good colour, sir. Smells mice,
dialog: too.Very good number, sir. Very good.
dialog: Here's to it.
text: He downs the glass.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Very refreshing, sir, very refreshing.
speaker_heading: MR. ALEXANDER
dialog: (very arch)
dialog: I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine.
dialog: Have another glass!
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Thank you, sir.
speaker_heading: MR. ALEXANDER
dialog: My wife...
text: Alex freezes.
speaker_heading: MR. ALEXANDER
dialog: used to do everything for me and leave
dialog: me to my writing.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
speaker_heading: MR. ALEXANDER
dialog: No. She's dead!
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I'm sorry to hear about that, sir.
text: His face contorted in rage.
speaker_heading: MR. ALEXANDER
dialog: She was very badly raped, you see. We were
text: assaulted by a gang of vicious young
dialog: hooligans in this house, in this very room
dialog: you're sitting in now. I was left a
dialog: helpless cripple. The doctors said it was
dialog: Pneumonia, because it happened some months
dialog: later during the 'flu epidemic. The
dialog: doctors told me it was Pneumonia, but I
dialog: knew what it was. A victim of the modern
text: age, poor, poor girl.
text: Suddenly his mood changes. He wheels right up to Alex.
speaker_heading: MR. ALEXANDER
dialog: And now you, another victim of the modern
dialog: age. But you can be helped. I phoned some
dialog: friends while you were having a bath.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Phoned some friends, sir?
speaker_heading: MR. ALEXANDER
dialog: Yes. They want to help.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Help me, sir?
speaker_heading: MR. ALEXANDER
dialog: Help you.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Who are they, sir?
speaker_heading: MR. ALEXANDER
dialog: They're very, very important people and
dialog: they're interested in you.
text: Bell rings. Julian rises,
speaker_heading: MR. ALEXANDER
dialog: Julian. This will be these people now.
text: Alex gets up.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Look, sir. I'm sorry to have troubled you.
dialog: I think I ought to be going, sir.
text: Julian bars the way.
speaker_heading: MR. ALEXANDER
dialog: No, no my boy. No trouble at all.
text: Alex slowly sits.
speaker_heading: MR. ALEXANDER
dialog: Have another glass of wine.
text: He pours. Alex picks up glass and takes a drink.
scene_heading: INT. "HOME" - NIGHT
text: Dolin and Rubinstein enter with Julian.
speaker_heading: DOLIN
dialog: (genial)
dialog: Hullo, Frank.
speaker_heading: MR. ALEXANDER
dialog: Good evening, sir.
speaker_heading: RUBINSTEIN
dialog: Frank.
speaker_heading: DOLIN
dialog: So this is the young man?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: How do you do, sir?
speaker_heading: DOLIN
dialog: Hullo.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Missus. Very pleased to meet you.
speaker_heading: RUBINSTEIN
dialog: Hullo.
speaker_heading: DOLIN
dialog: I hope you forgive us for coming over at
dialog: this ungodly hour, but we heard from Frank
dialog: that you were in some trouble so we came
dialog: over to see if we could be of any help.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: DOLIN
dialog: I understand that you had a rather
text: unfortunate encounter with the Police
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it
dialog: that, sir.
speaker_heading: DOLIN
dialog: Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Much better, thank you, sir.
speaker_heading: DOLIN
dialog: Feel like talking to us. Answering a few
dialog: questions?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Fine, sir, fine.
speaker_heading: DOLIN
dialog: Well, as I've said, we've heard about you.
dialog: We are interested in your case. We want to
dialog: help you.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Thank you very much, sir.
speaker_heading: DOLIN
dialog: But first we'd like to find out a few
dialog: things about you.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What would you like to know, sir?
speaker_heading: DOLIN
dialog: Well, shall we get down to it?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Rubinstein takes out a notebook.
speaker_heading: RUBINSTEIN
dialog: The newspapers mentioned that in addition
dialog: to your being conditioned against acts of
dialog: sex and violence, you've inadvertently
dialog: been conditioned against music.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Well, er, I think that was something that
dialog: they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus,
dialog: I'm very fond of music and always have
dialog: been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van...
dialog: Beethoven. B... E... E...
text: He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
speaker_heading: RUBINSTEIN
dialog: It's alright, thank you.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: And it just so happened that while they
dialog: were showing me a particularly bad film,
dialog: of like a concentration camp, the
text: background music was playing Beethoven.
speaker_heading: RUBINSTEIN
dialog: So now you have the same reaction to music
dialog: as you do to sex and violence?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Oh well, it's... it's not all music you
dialog: see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
speaker_heading: RUBINSTEIN
dialog: You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: That's right. Er... I can't listen to the
dialog: 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th,
dialog: I get like this funny feeling.
speaker_heading: RUBINSTEIN
dialog: When you say this funny feeling, you mean
dialog: the state of mind brought on by the
dialog: treatment they gave you?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: That is correct, sir. And then all I can
dialog: think about is like trying to snuff it.
speaker_heading: RUBINSTEIN
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean,
dialog: missus... Er... I just want to die
text: peacefully like with no... pain.
speaker_heading: RUBINSTEIN
dialog: Do you feel that way now?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still
dialog: feel very miserable, very much down in
dialog: spirits.
speaker_heading: RUBINSTEIN
dialog: Do you still feel suicidal?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Um... well, put it this way... I feel very
dialog: low in myself. I can't see much in the
dialog: future, and I feel that any second
dialog: something terrible is going to happen to
dialog: me.
text: He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
speaker_heading: RUBINSTEIN
dialog: Well done, Frank. Julian, get the car,
dialog: will you please?
scene_heading: INT. HI-FI ROOM - DAWN
text: Alexander sits looking up. Rubinstein, Julian and Dolin also
text: listening to Beethoven played loudly on tape recorder.
scene_heading: INT. DOLIN'S HOUSE - PRISONER BEDROOM - DAY
text: The 9th Symphony booming up through the floor.
text: Alex slowly regains consciousness.
speaker_heading: ALEX (V.0.)
dialog: I woke up. The pain and sickness all over
dialog: me like an animal. Then I realised what it
text: was. The music coming up from the floor
dialog: was our old friend, Ludwig van and the
text: dreaded 9th Symphony.
text: He staggers to the door. It is locked. He kicks and tugs the door.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Open the door... turn it off... turn it
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE BILLIARD ROOM BELOW
text: Hi-Fi gear laid out on the table. Large speakers facing upwards.
text: Mr. Alexander trembles and twitches. He is now completely mad. The
text: others merely wait, coolly.
scene_heading: INT. DOLIN'S HOUSE - PRISONER BEDROOM - DAY
text: Alex on his knees. His hands cupped over his ears, banging his
text: head on the floor.
text: Then he stops and slowly straightens up, staring at the window.
speaker_heading: ALEX (V.0.)
dialog: Suddenly I viddied what I had to do, and
dialog: what I had wanted to do - and that was to
dialog: do myself in, to snuff it, to blast off
dialog: forever out of this wicked cruel world.
text: One moment of pain perhaps and then sleep
dialog: - forever and ever and ever.
scene_heading: EXT. WINDOW - DAWC
text: Alex leaps out of the window.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL WARD
text: Alex in bed. Camera slowly tracks along length of his body.
text: Everything is bandages and plaster splints, wire cages, blood
text: drips.
speaker_heading: ALEX (V.0.)
dialog: I jumped, O my brothers, and I fell hard
dialog: but I did not snuff it, oh no. if I had
dialog: snuffed it, I would not be here to tell
dialog: what I have told. I came back to life,
text: after a long, black, black gap of what
dialog: might have been a million years.
text: We hear Alex moan, and then another moan. Alex and the other - a
dialog: few times.
text: Suddenly, some curtains which have been drawn around another bed
text: in the ward are parted, and a nurse hurries to Alex, hastily
text: buttoning up her uniform. She is trailed by a young Intern
text: fumbling with his trousers.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Oh, he's recovered conscienceness, Doctor.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
text: Em and Pee sitting around the bed.
speaker_heading: PEE

speaker_heading: EM
dialog: Hullo, son, how are you?
speaker_heading: PEE
dialog: Are you feeling better?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What gives, O myee P and Em, what makes
dialog: you think you are welcome?
text: Em sobs. Pee comforts her.
text: Em sobs.
speaker_heading: PEE
dialog: There, there mother, it's alright. He
dialog: doesn't mean it. You were in the papers
dialog: again, son. It said they had done great
dialog: wrong to you. It said how the Government
dialog: drove you to try and do yourself in... and
dialog: when you think about it, son... maybe it
dialog: was our fault too in a way... your home's
dialog: your home when it's all said and done,
dialog: son.

scene_heading: DR. TAYLOR
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Well, when I was all like ashamed up and
dialog: half awake and unconscious like, I kept
dialog: having this dream like all these doctors
dialog: were playing around with me gulliver. You
dialog: know... like the inside of me brain. I
dialog: seemed to have this dream over and over
dialog: again. D'you think it means anything?
scene_heading: DR. TAYLOR
dialog: Patients who've sustained the kind of
dialog: injuries you have often have dreams of
dialog: this sort. It's all part of the recovery
dialog: process.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Oh.
scene_heading: DR. TAYLOR
dialog: Now then, each of these slides needs a
dialog: reply from one of the people in the
dialog: picture. You'll tell me what you think the
dialog: person would say. Alright?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Righty, right.
text: The doctor reads aloud the dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon
dialog: - a peacock.
text: Alex laughs.
scene_heading: DR. TAYLOR
dialog: Isn't the plumage beautiful?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I just say what the other person would
dialog: say?
scene_heading: DR. TAYLOR

scene_heading: DR. TAYLOR

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I was quite enjoying that.
scene_heading: DR. TAYLOR
dialog: Good. I'm glad
speaker_heading: ALEX

scene_heading: DR. TAYLOR

dialog: I've suffered the tortures of the damned.
dialog: The tortures of the damned, sir.
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for
dialog: you, shall I?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Thank you, sir.
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: I can tell you that I... and the
dialog: Government of which I am a member are
dialog: deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply
dialog: sorry. We tried to help you. We followed
dialog: recommendations had been made to us that
dialog: turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will
dialog: place the responsibility where it belongs.
dialog: We want you to regard us as friends. We've
dialog: put you right, you're getting the best of
dialog: treatments. We never wished you harm, but
dialog: there are some that did and do, and I
dialog: think you know who those are. There are
dialog: certain people who wanted to use you for
dialog: political ends. People who would have been
dialog: glad to have you dead because then they
dialog: would have been able to blame it all on
dialog: the Governement. I think you know who
dialog: those are. There is also a certain man - a
dialog: writer of subversive literature - who has
dialog: been howling for your blood. He's been mad
dialog: with desire to stick a knife into you, but
dialog: you're safe from him now, we've put him
dialog: away. He found out that you had done wrong
dialog: to him - at least he believed you had done
dialog: wrong. He had formed this idea in his head
dialog: that you had been responsible for the
dialog: death of someone near and dear to him. We
dialog: put him away for his own protection... I'm
dialog: sorry, I thought you were ready.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Where is he now, sir?
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: We put him away where he can do you no
dialog: harm. You see we are looking after your
dialog: interests. We are interested in you, and
dialog: when you leave here you will have no
dialog: further worries. We shall see to
dialog: everything... a good job on a good salary.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What job and how much?
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: You must have an interesting job at a
dialog: salary which you would regard as adequate.
dialog: Not only for the job which you are going
dialog: to do and in compensation for what you
dialog: believe you have suffered, but also
dialog: because you are helping us.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Helping you, sir?
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: We always help our friends, don't we?
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: It is no secret that the Government has
dialog: lost a lot of popularity because of you,
dialog: my boy. There are some that think that at
dialog: the next election we shall be out. The
dialog: press has chosen to take a very
dialog: unfavorable view
dialog: of what we tried to do.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Well, who can bame them, sir?
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion
dialog: has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I
dialog: may call you, Alex?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Certainly, sir. What do they call you at
dialog: home?
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: My name is Frederick. As I was saying,
dialog: Alex, you can be instrumental in changing
dialog: the public verdict. Do you understand,
dialog: Alex? Have I made myself clear?
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an
dialog: azurw sky of deepest summer. You can rely
dialog: on me, Fred.
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand
dialog: you're fond of music. I have arranged a
dialog: little surprise for you.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Surprise?
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: One I think you will like... as a, how
dialog: shall I put it, as a symbol of our new
text: understanding. An understanding between
text: two friends.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Thank you, Fred. Thank you.
text: Minister turns and signals.
text: Door opens and a crowd of cameramen and reporters rush in.
text: Aides push two 6-foot loudspeakers and a Hi-Fi on a trolley.
speaker_heading: ALEX (V.0.)
dialog: And what do you know, my brothers and only
dialog: friends, it was the 9th, the glorious 9th
dialog: of Ludwig van. Oh, it was gorgeosity and
dialog: yummy yum yum. I was cured.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT ALEX
speaker_heading: THE END
speaker_heading: ALEX (V.0.)
dialog: As the music came to ist climax, I could
dialog: viddy myself very clear, running and
text: running on like very light and mysterious
text: feet, carving the whole face of the
text: creeching world with my cut throat britva.
dialog: I was cured all right.
