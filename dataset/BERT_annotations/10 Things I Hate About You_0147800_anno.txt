scene_heading: PADUA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
dialog: 
dialog: Welcome to Padua High School,, your typical urban-suburban
dialog: high school in Portland, Oregon. Smarties, Skids, Preppies,
text: Granolas. Loners, Lovers, the In and the Out Crowd rub sleep
text: out of their eyes and head for the main building.
dialog: 
scene_heading: PADUA HIGH PARKING LOT - DAY
dialog: 
text: KAT STRATFORD, eighteen, pretty -- but trying hard not to be
text: -- in a baggy granny dress and glasses, balances a cup of
text: coffee and a backpack as she climbs out of her battered,
text: baby blue '75 Dodge Dart.
dialog: 
text: A stray SKATEBOARD clips her, causing her to stumble and
text: spill her coffee, as well as the contents of her backpack.
dialog: 
text: The young RIDER dashes over to help, trembling when he sees
text: who his board has hit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RIDER
dialog: Hey -- sorry.
dialog: 
text: Cowering in fear, he attempts to scoop up her scattered
dialog: belongings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Leave it
dialog: 
text: He persists.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAT (continuing)
dialog: I said, leave it!
dialog: 
text: She grabs his skateboard and uses it to SHOVE him against a
text: car, skateboard tip to his throat. He whimpers pitifully
text: and she lets him go. A path clears for her as she marches
text: through a pack of fearful students and SLAMS open the door,
dialog: entering school.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GIRLS' ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: BIANCA STRATFORD, a beautiful sophomore, stands facing the
text: mirror, applying lipstick. Her less extraordinary, but
text: still cute friend, CHASTITY stands next to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Did you change your hair?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: You might wanna think about it
dialog: 
text: Leave the girls' room and enter the hallway.
dialog: 
scene_heading: HALLWAY - DAY- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Bianca is immediately greeted by an admiring crowd, both
dialog: boys
dialog: and girls alike.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: (adoring)
dialog: Hey, Bianca.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Awesome shoes.
dialog: 
text: The greetings continue as Chastity remains wordless and
text: unaddressed by her side. Bianca smiles proudly,
text: acknowledging her fans.
dialog: 
scene_heading: GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY
dialog: 
text: CAMERON JAMES, a clean-cut, easy-going senior with an open,
text: farm-boy face, sits facing Miss Perky, an impossibly cheery
dialog: guidance counselor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISS PERKY
dialog: I'm sure you won't find Padua any
dialog: different than your old school. Same
dialog: little asswipe mother-fuckers
dialog: everywhere.
dialog: 
text: Her plastic smile never leaves her face. Cameron fidgets in
text: his chair uncomfortably.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISS PERKY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Any questions?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: I don't think so, ma'am
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISS PERKY
dialog: Then go forth. Scoot I've got
dialog: deviants to see.
dialog: 
text: Cameron rises to leave and makes eye contact with PATRICK
text: VERONA, a sullen-looking bad ass senior who waits outside Ms
text: Perky's door. His slouch and smirk let us know how cool he
dialog: is.
dialog: 
text: Miss Perky looks down at her file and up at Patrick
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISS PERKY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Patrick Verona. I see we're making our
text: visits a weekly ritual.
dialog: 
text: She gives him a withering glance. He answers with a charming
dialog: smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I missed you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISS PERKY
dialog: It says here you exposed yourself to a
text: group of freshmen girls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: It was a bratwurst. I was eating
dialog: lunch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISS PERKY
dialog: With the teeth of your zipper?
dialog: 
text: She motions for Patrick to enter her office and Cameron
text: shuffles out the door, bumping into MICHAEL ECKMAN, a lanky,
text: brainy senior who will either end up a politician or game
dialog: show host.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You the new guy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: So they tell me...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: C'mon. I'm supposed to give you the
dialog: tour.
dialog: 
text: They head out of the office
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: So -- which Dakota you from?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: North, actually. How'd you ?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I was kidding. People actually live
dialog: there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Yeah. A couple. We're outnumbered by
dialog: the cows, though.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: How many people were in your old
dialog: school?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Thirty-two.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Get out!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: How many people go here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Couple thousand. Most of them evil
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Prom posters adorn the wall. Michael steers Cameron through
text: the crowd as he points to various cliques.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: We've got your basic beautiful people.
dialog: Unless they talk to you first, don't
dialog: bother.
dialog: 
text: The beautiful people pass, in full jock/cheerleader
text: splendor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Those 're your cowboys.
dialog: 
text: Several Stetson-wearing, big belt buckle. Wrangler guys
dialog: walk by.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: That I'm used to.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yeah, but these guys have never seen a
text: horse. They just jack off to Clint
dialog: Eastwood.
dialog: 
text: They pass an espresso cart with a group of teens huddled
text: around it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: To the right, we have the Coffee Kids.
dialog: Very edgy. Don't make any sudden
text: movements around them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - DAY
dialog: 
text: Michael continues the tour
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: And these delusionals are the White
dialog: Rastae.
dialog: 
text: Several white boys in dreadlocks and Jamaican knit berets
text: lounge on the grass. A cloud of pot smoke hovers above them
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Big Marley fans. Think they're black.
text: Semi-political, but mostly, they watch a
dialog: lot of Wild Kingdom, if you know what I
dialog: mean.
dialog: 
text: Michael waves to DEREK, the one with the longest dreads.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Derek - save some for after lunch, bub?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: (very stoned)
dialog: Michael, my brother, peace
dialog: 
text: Cameron turns to follow Michael as they walk into the
dialog: cafeteria.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: So where do you fit in all this?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAFETERIA - DAY - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Loud music and loud students. Michael sits with a group of
text: studious-looking teens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Future MBAs- We're all Ivy League,
dialog: already accepted. Someday I'll be
dialog: sipping Merlot while those guys --
dialog: 
text: He points to the table of jocks, as they torture various
text: passers-by.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: are fixing my Saab. Yuppie greed is
dialog: back, my friend.
dialog: 
text: He points proudly to the ALLIGATOR on his shirt.
dialog: 
text: Cameron stops listening as BIANCA walks by, and we go SLO
text: MO. Pure and perfect, she passes Cameron and Michael
text: without a look.
dialog: 
text: Cameron is smitten
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: That girl -- I --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You burn, you pine, you perish?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Who is she?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Bianca Stratford. Sophomore. Don't
dialog: even think about it
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I could start with your haircut, but it
dialog: doesn't matter. She's not allowed to
dialog: date until her older sister does. And
dialog: that's an impossibility.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
dialog: 
text: A room full of bored seniors doodle and scare off into space
text: MS. BLAISE, the one-step-away-from-medication English
text: Teacher, tries to remember what she's talking about.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. BLAISE
dialog: Well, then. Oh, yes. I guess that
dialog: does it for our analysis of The Old Man
dialog: and the Sea. Any other comments?
dialog: (with dread)
dialog: Kat?
dialog: 
text: Kat, the girl we saw as we entered the school, slowly cakes
text: off her glasses and speaks up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Why didn't we just read the Hardy Boys?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. BLAISE
dialog: I'm sorry?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: This book is about a guy and his
dialog: fishing habit. Not exactly a crucial
dialog: topic.
dialog: 
text: The other students roll their eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Frankly, I'm baffled as to why we still
dialog: revere Hemingway. He was an abusive,
dialog: alcoholic misogynist who had a lot of
dialog: cats.
dialog: 
text: JOEY DORSEY, a well-muscled jock with great cheekbones,
text: makes fun of her from his row.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: As opposed to a bitter self-righteous
dialog: hag who has no friends?
dialog: 
text: A few giggles. Kat ignores him. A practiced gesture
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. BLAISE
dialog: That's enough, Mr. Dorsey.
dialog: 
dialog: Really gets fired up now
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: I guess the school board thinks because
dialog: Hemingway's male and an asshole, he's
dialog: worthy of our time
dialog: 
text: She looks up at Ms. Blaise, who is now fighting with her
dialog: pill box.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What about Colette? Charlotte Bronte?
dialog: Simone de Beauvoir?
dialog: 
text: Patrick, lounging in his seat in the back row, elbows a
text: crusty-looking crony, identified by the name SCURVY,
text: embroidered on his workshirt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Mother Goose?
dialog: 
text: The class titters. Kat wears an expression of intolerance
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Kat now sits before Miss Perky.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISS PERKY
dialog: Katarina Stratford. My, my. You've
text: been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Expressing my opinion is not a
dialog: terrorist action.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISS PERKY
dialog: Well, yes, compared to your other
dialog: choices of expression this year, today's
dialog: events are quite mild. By the way,
text: Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation
dialog: went quite well, in case you're
dialog: interested.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: I still maintain that he kicked himself
dialog: in the balls. I was merely a spectator.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISS PERKY
dialog: The point is Kat -- people perceive you
dialog: as somewhat ...
dialog: 
text: Kat smiles at her, daring her to say it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Tempestuous?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISS PERKY
dialog: No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the
dialog: term used most often.
dialog: 
text: She grimaces, as if she's referring to a medical condition.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISS PERKY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You might want to work on that
dialog: 
text: Kat rises from her chair with a plastic smile matching the
dialog: counselor's.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: As always, thank you for your excellent
dialog: guidance.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SOPHOMORE ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
dialog: 
text: Bianca ignores the droning teacher as she writes a note in
text: big flowing handwriting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEACHER (0.S.)
dialog: I realize the language of Mr.
text: Shakespeare makes him a bit daunting,
dialog: but I'm sure you're all doing your best.
dialog: 
text: Bianca folds the note and passes it behind her with a flip
text: of her hair to CHASTITY. Chastity opens the note and reads:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INSERT - "JOEY DORSEY SAID HI TO ME IN THE HALL! OH! MY
dialog: GOD!"
dialog: 
text: Chastity frowns to herself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEACHER (0.S.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Ms. Stratford, do you care to comment
dialog: on what you've read so far?
dialog: 
text: Bianca looks up and smiles the smile of Daddy's little girl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Not really.
dialog: 
text: The teacher shakes her head, but lets it go.
dialog: 
text: MANDELLA. a waif-like senior girl who sits off to the side
text: trying to slit her wrist with the plastic spiral on her
text: notebook, looks up and raises her hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Mandella -- since you're assisting us,
dialog: you might as well comment. I'm assuming
dialog: you read the assignment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANDELLA
dialog: Uh, yeah, I read it all
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: The whole play^
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANDELIA
dialog: The whole folio. All the plays.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: (disbelieving)
dialog: You've read every play by William
dialog: Shakespeare?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANDELLA
dialog: Haven't you?
dialog: 
text: She raises a challenging eyebrow. The stunned teacher
text: doesn't answer and goes to call on the next student.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - DAY
dialog: 
text: Mandella and Kat sit down in the quiet corner. They are
text: eating a carton of yogurt with gusto.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANDELLA
dialog: 
dialog: Your sister is so amazingly without. She'll never read him.
text: She has no idea.
dialog: 
dialog: Kat attacks
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: The fact that you're cutting gym so you
dialog: can T.A. Sophomore English just to hear
dialog: his name, is a little without in itself
dialog: if you ask me.
dialog: 
text: Kat's attention is caught by Patrick as he walks by with his
text: friends, lighting up a cigarette. Mandella notices her
text: staring.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANDELLA
dialog: Who's that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Patrick Verona Random skid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANDELLA
dialog: That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone
dialog: for a year? I heard he was doing porn
dialog: movies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: I'm sure he's completely incapable of
dialog: doing anything that interesting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANDELLA
dialog: He always look so
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Block E?
dialog: 
text: Kat turns back to face Mandella and forces her yogurt into
text: Mandella's hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Mandella, eat. Starving yourself is a
dialog: very slow way to die.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANDELLA
dialog: Just a little.
dialog: 
text: She eats. Kat sees her wrist
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: What's this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANDELLA
text: An attempted slit.
dialog: 
text: Kat stares at her, expressionless.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: I realize that the men of this fine
dialog: institution are severely lacking, but
dialog: killing yourself so you can be with
dialog: William Shakespeare is beyond the scope
dialog: of normal teenage obsessions. You're
text: venturing far past daytime talk show
dialog: fodder and entering the world of those
dialog: who need very expensive therapy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANDELLA
dialog: But imagine the things he'd say during
dialog: sex.
dialog: 
dialog: Thinks a minute
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Okay, say you do it. You kill
dialog: yourself, you end up in wherever you end
dialog: up and he's there. Do you really think
dialog: he's gonna wanna dace a ninety pound
dialog: compulsive who failed volleyball?
dialog: 
text: Mandella's attention is struck by Bianca
dialog: 
scene_heading: ACROSS THE COURTYARD
dialog: 
text: As she and Chastity parade by Joey and his COHORTS One of
text: the cohorts elbows Joey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COHORT
dialog: Virgin alert.
dialog: 
text: Joey looks up and smiles at Bianca.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Lookin' good, ladies.
dialog: 
text: Bianca smiles her coyest of smiles.
dialog: 
text: BACK TO KAT AND MANDELLA Still watching.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANDELLA
dialog: Tragic.
dialog: 
dialog: Doesn't respond
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
dialog: 
text: Michael and Cameron observe Joey's leers at Bianca from
text: their bench in another corner. Cowboys eating cue of a can
text: of beans linger on the grass behind them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Why do girls like that always like guys
dialog: like that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Because they're bred to. Their mothers
dialog: liked guys like that, and their
dialog: grandmothers before them. Their gene
dialog: pool is rarely diluted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: He always have that shit-eating grin?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Joey Dorsey? Perma-shit-grin. I wish
dialog: I could say he's a moron, but he's
dialog: number twelve in the class. And a
dialog: model. Mostly regional stuff, but he's
dialog: rumored to have a big tube sock ad
text: coming out.
dialog: 
text: The BELL rings, and the cowboys stand and spit into their
text: empty bean cans. Cameron and Michael rise as Cameron tries
text: to catch a glimpse of Bianca as she walks back inside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You know French?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: You mean I'd get a chance to talk to
dialog: her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You could consecrate with her, my
dialog: friend.
dialog: 
text: Cameron watches as Bianca flounces back into the building.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY
dialog: 
text: Kat and Mandella walk toward Kat's car. Joey pulls up
text: beside her in his Viper.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: (re her dress)
dialog: The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't
dialog: you been reading your Sassy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Yeah, and I noticed the only part of
dialog: you featured in your big Kmart spread
dialog: was your elbow. Tough break.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: (practically
dialog: spitting)
dialog: They're running the rest of me next
dialog: month.
dialog: 
text: He zooms away as Kat yanks open the door of her Dart.
text: Mandella ties a silk scarf around her head, as if they're in
text: a convertible.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: The people at this school are so
dialog: incredibly foul.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANDELLA
dialog: You could always go with me. I'm sure
dialog: William has some friends.
dialog: 
text: They watch Joey's car as he slows next to Bianca and
text: Chastity as they walk toward the school bus.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON BIANCA AND CHASTITY
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Need a ride, ladies?
dialog: 
text: Bianca and Chastity can't get in Joey's car fast enough. He
text: pulls away with a smile.
dialog: 
text: BACK TO KAT AND MANDELLA
dialog: 
text: Mandella lowers her sunglasses to watch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANDELLA
dialog: That's a charming new development
dialog: 
text: Kat doesn't answer, but reaches over and puts a tape in the
text: tape deck. The sounds of JOYFUL PUNK ROCK fill the car.
dialog: 
text: As they pull out, Michael crosses in front of them on his
text: moped. Kat has to SLAM the brakes to keep from hitting him
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Remove head from sphincter! Then
dialog: pedal!
dialog: 
text: Michael begins fearfully, pedaling as Kat PEELS out, angry
text: at the delay.
dialog: 
text: Cameron rushes over
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: You all right?
dialog: 
text: He slows to a stop
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yeah, just a minor encounter with the
dialog: shrew.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: That's her? Bianca's sister?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
dialog: 
text: Michael putters off, leaving Cameron dodging Patrick's
text: grimy, grey Jeep -- a vehicle several years and many paint
text: jobs away from its former glory as a REGULATION MAIL TRUCK -

scene_heading: INT. STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY
dialog: 
text: SHARON STRATFORD, attractive and focused, sits in front of

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: 
dialog: I hope dinner's ready because I only have ten minutes before

speaker_heading: WALTER

speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: How touching.

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What's this? It says Sarah Lawrence?
dialog: 
text: Snatches it away from him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: I guess I got in
dialog: 
text: Sharon looks up from her computer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: What's a synonym for throbbing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of
dialog: the country.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: I know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I thought we decided you were going to
dialog: school here. At U of 0.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: You decided.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Is there even a question that we want
dialog: her to stay?
dialog: 
text: Kat gives Bianca an evil look then smiles sweetly at

speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Ask Bianca who drove her home
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHARON
text: Swollen...turgid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (to Bianca; upset)
dialog: Who drove you home?
dialog: 
text: Bianca glares at Kat then turns to Walter
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's
dialog: this boy... and I think he might ask...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: No! You're not dating until your sister
text: starts dating. End of discussion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: What if she never starts dating?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Then neither will you. And I'll get to

speaker_heading: BIANCA

speaker_heading: KAT

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Enough!

speaker_heading: WALTER

scene_heading: BIANCA AND WALTER
dialog: (in unison, by
dialog: rote)
text: The sound of a fifteen-year-old in

speaker_heading: BIANCA

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Can we make this quick? Roxanne

text: on the quad. Again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Well, I thought we'd start with
dialog: pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part. Please.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (looking down)
dialog: Okay... then how 'bout we try out some
dialog: French cuisine. Saturday? Night?
dialog: 
text: Bianca smiles slowly
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: You're asking me out. That's so cute.
dialog: What's your name again?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Forget it.
dialog: 
text: Bianca seizes an opportunity.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have
dialog: a proper introduction ---
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Cameron.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the
dialog: mercy of a particularly hideous breed of
dialog: loser. My sister. I can't date until
text: she does.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Seems like she could get a date easy
dialog: enough...
dialog: 
text: She fingers a lock of her hair. He looks on, dazzled.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: 
dialog: The problem is, she's completely anti-social.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIANCA
text: Unsolved mystery. She used to be
dialog: really popular when she started high
dialog: school, then it was just like she got
dialog: sick of it or something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: That's a shame.
dialog: 
text: She reaches out and touches his arm
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIANCA

speaker_heading: CAMERON

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You're in school for one day and you
dialog: ask out the most beautiful girl? Do you
dialog: have no concept of the high school

dialog: 
text: Cameron grins away
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: I teach her French, get to know her,

dialog: love with me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: Unlikely, but even so, she still can't
dialog: go out with you. So what's the
dialog: point?
dialog: 
text: Cameron motions with his head toward Patrick, a few lab

text: as he tries to revive his frog.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: What about him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (confused)
dialog: You wanna go out with him?
dialog: 
text: The others at the lab table raise their eyebrows

speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (impatient)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What makes you think he'll do it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
text: He seems like he thrives on danger
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No kidding. He's a criminal. I heard

dialog: got out of Alcatraz...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: They always let felons sit in on Honors
dialog: Biology?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'm serious, man, he's whacked. He

dialog: so he could buy new speakers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Forget his reputation. Do you think
dialog: we've got a plan or not?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Did she actually say she'd go out with
dialog: you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: That's what I just said
dialog: 
text: Michael processes this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You know, if you do go out with Bianca,

dialog: Strictly A-list. With me by your side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: I thought you hated those people.

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients

dialog: 
text: A cowboy flicks the frog's heart into one of the Coffee

speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: So now all we gotta do is talk to him.

speaker_heading: PEPE
dialog: Some people like the Colombian, but it

speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: We don't chat.

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Well, actually, I thought I'd run an
dialog: idea by you. You know, just to see if
dialog: you're interested.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: We're not.
dialog: 
text: He grabs Michael by the side of the head, and proceeds to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (grimacing)
dialog: Hear me out. You want Bianca don't
dialog: you?
dialog: 
text: Joey sits back and cackles at his drawing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: But she can't go out with you because
dialog: her sister is this insane head case and
dialog: no one will go out with her. right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Does this conversation have a purpose?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: So what you need to do is recruit a guy

dialog: up for the job.
dialog: 
text: Michael points to Patrick, who makes a disgusted face at his

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Like we had a choice? Besides -- when
dialog: you let the enemy think he's
dialog: orchestrating the battle, you're in a
dialog: position of power. We let him pretend
text: he's calling the shots, and while he's

speaker_heading: CAMERON

speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: What's to discuss?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISS PERKY
dialog: You weren't abused, you aren't stupid,

speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Where?

speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Yeah

speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: What do you think?

speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: How much?

speaker_heading: JOEY

speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I got her under control. She just acts

dialog: 
text: Joey sees through the bluff
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Let me put it to you this way, if you

speaker_heading: PATRICK

speaker_heading: JOEY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: A hundred bucks a date.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Forget it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Forget her sister, then.
dialog:

speaker_heading: JOEY

speaker_heading: CAMERON

speaker_heading: PATRICK

dialog: 
text: Cameron starts to object, but Michael holds up a hand.

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: So Dorsey can get the girl?

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: KAT

speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: You know who The Raincoats are?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATRICK

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I watched you out there I've never
dialog: seen you look like that

dialog: What'd he say?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAT
dialog: Who cares?

text: Kat glances sharply at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANDELLA
dialog: (continuing; off

dialog: Don't be Cruella with me. I'm in favor

speaker_heading: CAMERON

speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew
dialog: you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria

dialog: 
text: She points to Kat -- Walkman blaring -- who comes

speaker_heading: KAT

speaker_heading: PATRICK

dialog:

dialog: These.
