text: mental case's idea of a Tyrannosaurus Rex is situated in
text: front of the office. A sign reads “Rooms $24.98 and up!”
text: The door to one of the units opens and LELAND, a reedy
text: looking guy, almost made out of beef jerky, steps out, small
text: suitcase in hand and takes in the morning. A voice calls out
text: from inside.

text: starts. Billy kicks it into gear and slowly pulls out.
text: He drives the car up to the office and slows down, leaving
text: the engine idling. He slides a casette tane - Johnny Cash ~
text: into the player and leans back, waiting patiently for his
dialog: friend.
text: A long beat, and then Leland walks out of the office.

text: He hears a noise and freezes. He turns to see the bathroom
text: door against the far wall open, and a LITTLE GIRL steps ont.
text: She sees the tableau in front of her and gasps.

speaker_heading: JACK
text: Hmnm. Shadow monsters. They look pretty scary. But

scene_heading: EXT. MCKENNA HOUSE
text: A large, sturdy farmhouse in the middle of a huge corn field ~ the
text: house is at least a hundred years old, and well kept up. An old

text: A small, dilapidated two bedroom house on the side of the

scene_heading: INT. HANK QUIGLEY’S BEDROOM
text: A small room, sparsely furnished. A small dresser in the corner with a
text: dirty, cracked mirror. A dozen different vials of prescription

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Oh, really?
text: She nods.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: But I think there's something he doesn‘t
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: EDIE
dialog: What's that, honey?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I think shadow monsters aren‘t as bad as
dialog: other monsters. And I think when other
text: monsters come, the shadow monsters beat
dialog: them up.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Sort of protector monsters, then.
text: She nods and eats a spoonful of cereal. Edie smiles, then
text: looks Over at the empty space on the table and frowns.

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I remember reading a book in high school

speaker_heading: EDIE (cont‘d)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: TOM

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: When I was growing up, we didn’t talk a
dialog: lot about how to be a man. It was just
dialog: something your daddy was supposed to pass
dialog: on to you. The things my daddy passed on
dialog: to me... Well, I guess it wasn’t enough.
dialog: Sure, it helped me make it through that
dialog: war, but nothing he taught me helped me
dialog: know how to make it back home. Your momma
dialog: did her best, Edie. She stood by me when
dialog: she should have taken you and just gone,
dialog: and I paid her back by treating her worse
dialog: than a dog. I can blame the booze, and I
dialog: can blame the war, but you want to know
dialog: the truth, it’s this - it ain’t none of
dialog: those things made me what I was. They
dialog: just opened the doors, and it was easier
dialog: to go through them than close ‘em. If I’d

speaker_heading: HANK (cont'd)

text: Edie and Tom flinch at the sound of the shot.

text: The circle of fire where the tank was is expanding. The field
text: is starting to burn.
text: Charlie and Torrino crouch down. Torrino nods towards Aldo,

text: Charlie shakes his head - “no.” Torrino grimaces. He points

text: Behind the house, Tom straightens up, back to the wall, and
text: slides towards the other side of the house.
text: He creeps around the corner, alongside the porch, and looks
text: up. The shotgun’s gone.
text: Charlie creeps around the side of the porch and bumps right
text: into Tom. The two men scramble to bring their guns up, but
text: they‘re in too tight. Tom drops the rifle and goes for
text: Charlie‘s throat.
text: The two men roll on the ground, pounding the shit out of each
text: other. Tom bites Charlie’s hand hard, until blood squirts
text: out. Charlie screams in pain. Tom rolls on top of him and
text: punches his throat hard, over and over.
text: Charlie chokes and gurgles and dies. Tom keeps pounding.
text: Tom cries out in pain as a bullet tears through his shoulder,

dialog: and it becomes the truth. I don’t know if
dialog: I can do that, but I want to try, because
dialog: I guess it beats the alternative. Right
dialog: now, I don't know who you are. I don’t
dialog: know if I'm talking to Tom McKenna or
dialog: Joey Behan, or some monstrous thing that
dialog: isn’t even a man to begin with. Remember
