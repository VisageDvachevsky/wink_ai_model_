dialog: put that Sputnik into outer space,
dialog: the Dodgers played their last game
dialog: at Ebbets Field, 'that guy' shot
text: Frank Costello in the head, and
dialog: missed, and the Gallo brothers
dialog: whacked Albert Anastasia in that

scene_heading: 4 EXT. RURAL GAS STATION - DAY 4
text: A local state police deputy is gassing up his motorcycle

speaker_heading: MANETTA (V.O.)
dialog: Turns out the local cops were
text: watching Joe Babara like a hawk.
dialog: So now you got about fifty Caddies
text: and Lincolns pullin' into Apalachin

text: They finish eating.
speaker_heading: MANETTA
dialog: The '57 meeting was about how we
dialog: were going to divide up the whole
dialog: country. This meeting is about
dialog: how we're gonna survive. You got
dialog: 'made' guys informing for the
dialog: Feds; bosses going to jail;
dialog: everybody's dealing drugs; people
dialog: are getting whacked without
dialog: permission. And on top of
dialog: everything, now we got the Chinese
dialog: Triads and these crazy Russians to

dialog: We need a leader. Someone with

speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: What are we gonna get, a fuckin'

speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Wait a second. I'm just gonna

dialog: Did she say anything about me

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: SINDONE
dialog: Detained? What kind of bullshit

speaker_heading: JELLY

speaker_heading: VITTI
