text: Still-life tableaus. Lawford, N.H., a town of fifty buildings
text: on a glacial ridge, neither mountain nor plateau. Developed
text: as 1880's forestland, discarded in the Depression. Winter
text: has set in. Halloween day. Snowy fields yield to overcast
text: skies: oppressive, horizonless, flourescent.
text: -- Wickham's Restaurant. Where Route 29 bends. 24-hour diner.
text: Margie Fogg works here.
dialog: -- Trailer park in shadow of Parker Mountain. Home of Wade
dialog: Whitehouse.
text: -- Toby's Inn. Roadhouse three miles from town on the river
text: side of Route 29. Everything not tied down ends up here.
text: -- Glen Whitehouse farm. White clapboard.
dialog: -- First Congregational Church. North on the Common from

speaker_heading: ROLFE (V.O.)
dialog: This is the story of my older
dialog: brother's strange criminal behavior
dialog: and disappearance. We who loved him
text: no longer speak of Wade. It's as if
dialog: he never existed. By telling his
dialog: story like this, as his brother, I
dialog: separate myself from his family and
dialog: those who loved him. Everything of
dialog: importance -- that is, everything
dialog: that gives rise to the telling of
dialog: this story -- occurred during a single
text: deer-hunting season in a small town
dialog: in upstate New Hampshire where Wade
dialog: was raised and so was I. One night
dialog: something changed and my relation to
dialog: Wade's story was different from what
dialog: it had been since childhood. I mark
dialog: this change by Wade's tone of voice
dialog: during a phone call two nights after
dialog: Halloween. Something I had not heard
dialog: before. Let us imagine that around
dialog: eight o'clock on Halloween Eve,
text: speeding past Toby's, Route 29, comes
text: a pale green eight-year-old Ford
text: Fairlane with a police bubble on
text: top. A square-faced man wearing a
text: trooper's cap is driving the vehicle.
text: Beside him sits a child, a little
text: girl with a plastic tiger mask
text: covering her face. The man is driving
dialog: fast --

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I
dialog: couldn't help it it's too late to go
dialog: trick-or-treating now. I couldn't
dialog: help it I had to stop at Penny's for
dialog: the costume. And you were hungry,
dialog: remember.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Who's fault is it then if it's not
dialog: yours? You're the one in charge,

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: (shakes cigarette

dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Look. Those kids are still trick-or-

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Those are the Hoyts.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I don't care. They're out.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Can't you see... look out there.
dialog: Nobody's got their porch lights on
dialog: anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt
text: kids are just out to get in trouble.
dialog: See, they put shaving cream all over
dialog: that mailbox there. They chopped
text: down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little
dialog: bastards. Jesus H. Christ.
text: Wade grimaces, holds his jaw. The Fairlane swerves around
text: broken pumpkins under a caution light.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Why do they do that?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Do what?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: You know.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Break stuff?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Yeah. It's stupid.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I guess they're stupid.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Did you do that when you were a kid?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really
dialog: mean. Me and my pals, me and my
dialog: brothers. It was kind of funny then.
text: Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows.
dialog: Stuff like that.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Was it funny?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: To us it was.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: But it's not funny now.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I
dialog: gotta listen to all the complaints
dialog: people make. I'm not a kid anymore.
dialog: You change.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I bet you did lots of bad things.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I just think you used to be bad.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir.
dialog: Where do you get this stuff? From
dialog: your mother?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: No. She doesn't talk about you

text: Clowns, tramps, angels and vampires fill the brightly lit

text: costume contest. Wade nods to various townspeople.
speaker_heading: LARIVIERE
dialog: We're looking for the funniest
dialog: costume! And the scariest! And the
dialog: most imaginative! And the best costume
dialog: of all!
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: (nudges Jill)
dialog: Got here just in time. Go ahead.
dialog: Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a
dialog: prize.
text: Jill steps forward, retreats. Wade looks at her flaxen hair,
text: her blue sneakers protruding from her pathetic costume. His
text: heart aches he loves her so.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you
dialog: still know.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I don't want to.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Why? Why not? You know these kids
dialog: from when you went to school here.
dialog: It hasn't been that long.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: It's not that.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: What then?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: It's stupid.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: It's fun.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (voice breaking)
dialog: I want to go home.
dialog: (Wade kneels down)
dialog: I don't like it here.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't
dialog: mess this up anymore than it's already
dialog: been messed up. Join the other kids.
dialog: Do that and before you know it you'll
dialog: be as happy as a goddamned clam.
text: Wade inches her toward the circle of children. Gordon spots
dialog: them:
speaker_heading: LARIVIERE
dialog: Wade! And who's that tiger? Is that
dialog: Jill? Come and join us.
text: Jill in the spotlight, joins the costumed children. A former

scene_heading: EXT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT
text: Wade steps outside, lights a cigarette. JACK HEWITT, 23,

dialog: LACOY, local boys.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: What are you boys up to?
speaker_heading: CHICK
dialog: Same old shit.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: You see the damage these little sons-

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: You're going to have to move your

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: CHICK
dialog: (offers whiskey pint)
dialog: Take a bite.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Don't mind if I do.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: LaRiviere's having a hell of a time
dialog: in there. Master of fucking
dialog: ceremonies.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Where's that gun you were bragging
dialog: on today?
text: Jack stops over to his double-parked burgandy pickup, removes
text: a Browning BAR .30/06 with a scope, hands it to Wade.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No brag. Just fact.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: (admires gun)
dialog: Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks?
dialog: (passes it to Frankie)
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Nice.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to Wade)
dialog: See you got Jill tonight. How'd you

scene_heading: INT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT
text: On stage, LaRiviere arranges the contest winners. A fairy
text: godmother with a wand beams while, nearby, a hobo writhes in
text: his mother's grip -- a hard loser.
text: Wade looks for Jill, first among the winners, then among the
text: losers; she's nowhere to be found. He heads toward a hall
text: leading to the restrooms.
text: Jill stands alone in the corner next to the pay phone, tiny,
text: forlorn. Wade realizes at once he was wrong to leave her
dialog: before she had found a friend.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight
dialog: of you. I had to step outside for a
dialog: smoke. You find anybody you know
dialog: here? There must be some kids you
dialog: used to know from school. You want
dialog: to go tomorrow? See your old teachers?
dialog: Be more fun than hanging out with me
dialog: all day.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: No what?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (lifts mask atop head)
dialog: No I didn't see anybody I know. No I
dialog: don't want to go to school here
dialog: tomorrow. I want to go home.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: You are home. There are lots of kids
dialog: you still know here.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I don't want to be here. Don't worry,
dialog: I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want
dialog: to go home.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what.
dialog: Tomorrow morning, you still want to
dialog: go home, I'll drive you down. I'll
dialog: get off work or something.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I called Mommy.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: What? You called Mommy? Just now?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Jesus, why?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I... because I want to go home. She
dialog: said she'd come and get me.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn
dialog: half hour drive each way. Why didn't
dialog: you talk to me about it first?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: See, I knew you'd be mad.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd
dialog: you tell her, for Christ sake?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I told her I wanted to come home.
dialog: Daddy, don't be mad at me.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Well, I guess I am. I planned this,
dialog: I planned all this, you know. I mean,
dialog: it's sort of pathetic, but I planned
dialog: it. You shouldn't have called your
dialog: mother.
dialog: (takes her arm)
dialog: C'mon, we're gonna call her before
text: she leaves.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Wade leads her to a frosted-glass door reading "POLICE",
text: enters. Inside, he flips on flourescent light, dials the
text: desk phone. More utility room than office.
text: He waits. There's no answer. Jill looks down.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: She's gone already!
dialog: (hangs up)
dialog: Gone already! Couldn't wait.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: That's all you got to say? "Yes".
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: She won't be here for a half hour.
dialog: Think you can stand it that long?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Where do you expect to wait for her?
text: Obviously downstairs with the other
dialog: kids isn't good enough.
text: Jill sits in a chair facing the dark window pane.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Sit right there by yourself if you
dialog: want. Wait for her by yourself. That's
dialog: fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going
text: downstairs.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: That's fine with me too. When Mommy
dialog: comes, tell her I'm up here.
text: Wade Whitehouse stalks out.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT
text: Wade steps outside, notices Jack Hewitt and his kewpie-doll
text: girlfriend HETTIE, 20, sitting in the cab of his double-parked
text: pickup, sharing a joint, talking to LaCoy alongside.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I thought I told you to move that
dialog: truck!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You
dialog: wanna toke?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: (steps over)
dialog: You gotta be more careful about that
dialog: shit. Gordon or one of those guys
dialog: sees you smoking that wacky tabacky
dialog: around me they'll expect me to bust
dialog: you. And I'll be outta a job.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be
dialog: such a hardass. I know you got
dialog: problems, but everybody's got
dialog: problems.
dialog: (offers joint)
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Not here.
text: LaCoy laughs: that Jack Hewitt, some guy. Wade holds his
text: aching jaw. He looks at Jack's young athletic body, his pretty
text: girlfriend, envies him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, c'mon, then. Get in and we'll
dialog: take a little ride, my man.
text: Wade looks up to the window where Jill waits, walks around
text: the front of the truck, gets in.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT./EXT. JACK'S TRUCK - NIGHT
text: Jack's high-bodied pickup growls in low gear as it drives
text: past Merritt's Shell station toward Saddleback Ridge. Jack
text: lowers the radio as Wade asks him about deer season; Hettie
text: leans forward to hear the music.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Got a job first thing in the morning,
dialog: first day of season. Saturday I'll
dialog: hunt for myself. Twombley something. -
dialog: Er --
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official
dialog: from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't know about lucky. The guy's a
dialog: full-blown asshole. Pay's good,
dialog: though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee
dialog: a kill, of course. Which I can do.
dialog: There's some monster bucks hiding
dialog: out up there.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: How'd you get the job?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Gordon, he's always got some angle
dialog: working. He wants to keep Twombley
dialog: happy, I'm his boy.
text: Wade grimaces as he passes the joint back.
speaker_heading: HETTIE
dialog: What's wrong with you?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Toothache.
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: You should get close to him. Make
dialog: yourself irreplaceable. Guy's loaded.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Like you and Gordon?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get
dialog: along without me.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you
dialog: quit him.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Right!
text: A car flashes past.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Bastard's got his high beams on.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: (watching)
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: HETTIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: My ex-wife Lillian and her husband.
dialog: That was them in the Audi that just
dialog: passed us.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Audi's a good car.
speaker_heading: HETTIE
dialog: What's she up here for?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me
text: and Jill had a little argument. Jack,
dialog: I got to get back, get back to town.
dialog: Move this thing, will you? See if
dialog: you can get back to the Town Hall
dialog: before they get there, okay?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Piece of fucking cake.
text: Jack brakes, wheels the 4x4 around, heads back to town.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT
text: Most parents have left or are leaving with their costumed

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Lillian!
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: Where's Jill?
text: LILLIAN, 40, attractive in an ankle-length hooded coat.
text: Whatever pose Wade strikes, she strikes the opposite. Her
text: dress and demeanor set her apart.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Me and Jill, we just had a little
dialog: spat. She felt kind of left out, I
dialog: guess, from not knowing some of the
dialog: new kids --
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: Where is she now? Is she in the truck
dialog: with your friends?
text: Jack and Hettie neck inside the cab.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: She told me she wanted to wait for
dialog: you. Inside.
text: Jill at the window in her tiger mask. Lillian waves; Jill
dialog: motions she'll be down.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: While you went off for a few beers
dialog: with your friends? Is that Hettie
dialog: Rodgers there, with whatzizname?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: She's grown up some, hasn't she?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It
dialog: looks like you've won this fucking
dialog: round already, so lay off a little,
dialog: for Christ's sake.
text: HORNER, 45, Lillian's new husband, thin with thinning hair
text: and a Tyrolean hat, sees Jill at the entrance and heads toward
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Horner! Leave her be. This's got
dialog: nothing to do with you, so just act
dialog: like the chauffeur. Got it?
speaker_heading: HORNER
dialog: Wade. Nobody wants any trouble.
text: Horner greets Jill, walks her to the silver Audi. Passing
text: parents, listening, give Wade a wide berth.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I don't want her to go, Lillian.
speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: Don't cause a scene. No one's trying
dialog: to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it
dialog: any worse.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I'm not making it any worse. You
dialog: are. Me and Jill could've worked
dialog: this thing out. It's normal, it's
dialog: even normal for me to get a little
dialog: touchy about it. Believe it or not.
dialog: How do you think this makes me look,
dialog: treating her like some tragic victim
dialog: or something?
text: Horner opens the car door for Jill, shuts it. Wade shoves
dialog: him:
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Just wait till we're through,
dialog: goddamnit!
text: Horner's hat falls. Lillian, icy, stares at Wade. He backs
dialog: off. Wade sometimes wonders: how'd Lillian Pittman of Lawford,
dialog: N.H., get so much class?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Don't you say a word. I didn't hit
dialog: him. I'm not going to hit anybody.
text: Horner sits behind the wheel. Lillian silently stares Wade
text: up and down, gets in the car beside Jill. The automatic locks
text: latch as the Audi drives away. Its taillights merge with
text: vanishing traffic.
text: Wade looks down, picks up Horner's dark green Tyrolean hat,
text: examines it, as if unsure of its function.
text: Wade walks toward Town Hall. MARGIE FOGG, exiting, greets
dialog: him:
speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: New hat?
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: Jill's up, I see.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: (vague)
dialog: For a while.
speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: How's she doing?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Okay. She's fine.
speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: You two want to do anything tomorrow
dialog: and need a third party, give me a
dialog: call, okay? I'm off.
text: NICK WICKHAM, 45, Marg's boss, passes by:
speaker_heading: WICKHAM
dialog: Like hell you are. Tomorrow's first
dialog: day of deer season. I'll need you at
dialog: least in the morning.
speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Well, that's that.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (walks off)
dialog: Take care, Wade.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: You be careful of that little bastard.
dialog: He's dying to get in your pants, you
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Don't worry. I can protect my virtue.
dialog: I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: See you tomorrow, maybe.
speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Yeah.
text: Wade, lost in thought, continues toward Town Hall. At the
text: door, LaRiviere, one of the last to leave, eyes him. Wade
text: tosses Horner's hat inside.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Tomorrow, Gordon.
speaker_heading: LARIVIERE
dialog: Watch this snow. It's coming down

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: Lugene? Wade. Hoya doin?
dialog: (fumbles for cigarette)
dialog: Look, I was wondering, with the snow
dialog: and all, if you got school today?
dialog: (lights cigarette)
dialog: How the hell do I know? You're the

text: direct traffic from 7:30 to 8:30.
dialog: (listens)
dialog: Yeah, okay, I'm sorry -- I only just
dialog: now saw it was snowing, that's all.
dialog: My whole day is fucked. I gotta plow
dialog: all day. If I don't get over to
dialog: LaRiviere's early enough, I'm stuck
dialog: with the grader. I was just hoping
dialog: you'd have called school off.

text: He feeds on the misfortunes of others.
speaker_heading: TWOMBLEY
dialog: It's not enough snow, not for tracking
dialog: the bastards. No advantage there,
dialog: kid.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know
dialog: where those suckers are. Rain or
dialog: shine, snow or no snow. I know deer.
dialog: We'll kill us a buck today.
text: Guaranteed. Before ten.
speaker_heading: TWOMBLEY
dialog: Guaranteed, eh?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yep. Right about now the does are
text: holing up in the brush piles. The
dialog: bucks are right behind them and we're
text: right behind the bucks.
dialog: (gestures to gun rack)
text: This gun gets fired before ten
text: o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or
dialog: not is more less up to you. I'll put
dialog: you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck
text: the first four hours of the season.
dialog: That's what you're paying me for,
dialog: ain't it?
speaker_heading: TWOMBLEY
dialog: Damn straight!
text: Hewitt looks at Twombley's rifle: a Winchester M-94 pump-
dialog: action, custom carved stock and not a scratch on it. Never
text: fired, at least not by Twombley.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Done much shooting with that rifle
dialog: yet?
speaker_heading: TWOMBLEY
dialog: (eyes him)
dialog: Tell you what. You get me close to a
dialog: big buck by ten, kid, there's another
dialog: hundred bucks in it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: If you get it?
speaker_heading: TWOMBLEY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You might not kill it.
speaker_heading: TWOMBLEY
dialog: You think so.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You might gut-shoot it or cripple it
dialog: for somebody else to find and tag.
dialog: Can't guarantee that won't happen,
dialog: especially with a new gun. I may
dialog: have to shoot it.
speaker_heading: TWOMBLEY
dialog: You take care of your end, kid, I'll
dialog: take care of mine.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Mmm.
speaker_heading: TWOMBLEY
dialog: You understand what I'm saying? I
dialog: want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple
dialog: or whatthefuck.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I get it.
dialog: (disdain)

text: Wade, daydreaming, seems oblivious to the commotion. Oblivious --

text: A shiny black BMW approaches, speeding, passing traffic on
text: the shoulder. A man and a woman in a fur coat sit in front,

text: The BMW accelerates through the intersection, ignoring Wade
text: and the traffic. It whizzes past, spinning Wade, and is

speaker_heading: ROLFE (O.S.)
dialog: Wade, it's late. I know you're

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm

speaker_heading: ROLFE (O.S.)
dialog: You think Jack shot him?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Well, it was an accident.
speaker_heading: ROLFE (O.S.)

speaker_heading: WADE

speaker_heading: ROLFE (O.S.)

speaker_heading: ROLFE (O.S.)

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Jill. I was thinking of getting a

speaker_heading: MEL GORDON

speaker_heading: WADE

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: There's something funny about that

speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: I heard he was drunk at Toby's last

speaker_heading: WADE

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I've been wondering if maybe Jack

speaker_heading: WADE

speaker_heading: MARGIE

speaker_heading: WADE

speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: You wouldn't have done anything like

speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: You knew me as a kid.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Yeah, but never what you looked like.
dialog: Not really. Never really studied

dialog: were a kid until now, this way.
speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: What way?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: After making love. I like it. It's

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I'm her father -- supposed to be,

speaker_heading: WADE

text: They grab snow shovels propped against the porch, walk to

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BARN - DAY
text: Shafts of light filter through the ramshackle structure. A
text: snow drift nearly buries Glen's red truck. Wade and Rolfe
text: break away the packed snow.
speaker_heading: ROLFE
dialog: What about Margie?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: What about her?
speaker_heading: ROLFE
dialog: Well, do you still plan to get
dialog: married?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Yeah. She'll probably quit her job
dialog: and stay out here with Pop. We can't
dialog: leave him alone here, he'll set the
dialog: damn place on fire. With Jill here a
dialog: lot, it'll be good to have Margie
dialog: around. Things are going to change
dialog: in that department, by the way. I
dialog: got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm
dialog: gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's
dialog: gonna break loose, but it's worth
dialog: it.
text: They finish clearing the snow. Wade gets in the truck, starts
text: the engine. Rolfe waits for Wade.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I want to let the gas run out. I
dialog: don't want the bastard driving drunk,
dialog: and he's always drunk now. After,
dialog: we'll hide the keys.
speaker_heading: ROLFE
dialog: Anything new about the shooting?
dialog: Twombley?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: (reluctant)
dialog: I guess it was an accident, like
dialog: everybody thinks.
speaker_heading: ROLFE
dialog: Want to know what I think happened?
text: Wade opens the glove compartment, finds a bottle of Canadian
text: Club. He unscrews the cap.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Find them everywhere.
dialog: (swigs)
speaker_heading: ROLFE
dialog: I think your first response to the
dialog: Twombley shooting was the correct
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Which is?
speaker_heading: ROLFE
dialog: That it wasn't an accident.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Then who shot him?
speaker_heading: ROLFE
dialog: Well, your friend, I think. Jack
dialog: Hewitt.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Motive. You gotta have a motive.
speaker_heading: ROLFE
dialog: Money.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Who'd pay him that kind of money?
dialog: Not the mob. They got their own guys.
dialog: Specialists.
speaker_heading: ROLFE
dialog: (agreeing)
dialog: They wouldn't deal with a guy like
dialog: Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley
dialog: is suddenly dead?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: (swigs)
dialog: I don't know. You tell me.
speaker_heading: ROLFE
dialog: Okay. It's likely there are people
dialog: in the union who don't want Twombley
dialog: to testify. They probably include
dialog: his son-in-law who's vice-president
dialog: and will probably be the next
dialog: president. I read that in the papers.
dialog: What's his name, Mel Gordon?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told
dialog: you about. I did, didn't I?
speaker_heading: ROLFE
dialog: Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware
dialog: of illegal union loans or whatever,
text: starts nosing around cause of the
text: investigation and finds out. Finds
text: out his son-in-law is involved.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a
dialog: professional hit. That'd make the
text: feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
speaker_heading: ROLFE
text: A hunting accident is perfect.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Shit, around here, you shoot somebody
dialog: in the woods, you say it was an
dialog: accident, you get fined fifty bucks
dialog: and your hunting license lifted.
dialog: Jack's probably saying the guy shot
dialog: himself cause he ain't got his deer
dialog: yet and don't want his license pulled.
text: The truck sputters, stops. Wade pulls the keys.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: It's too neat. Things ain't that
dialog: neat. It makes me mad. That somebody
dialog: can pay to kill somebody, his own
dialog: father-in-law, and not be punished
dialog: for it. Don't that piss you off?
speaker_heading: ROLFE
dialog: Not particularly.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you
dialog: care what's right?
speaker_heading: ROLFE
dialog: I care about what happened. The truth.
dialog: I'm a student of history, remember?
text: The sun is down. Wade tucks the keys in a knotted board.
speaker_heading: ROLFE
dialog: I was thinking about that story you
dialog: told me, about Pop and chopping the
text: firewood out of the ice and after.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ROLFE
dialog: I hate to disappoint you, but I don't
dialog: think it happened.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Of course it happened. Why would I
dialog: lie about it?
speaker_heading: ROLFE
dialog: It may have happened, but not the
dialog: way you said.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: You think I wouldn't remember a thing
dialog: like that?
speaker_heading: ROLFE
dialog: It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I
dialog: heard about it. When I heard about
dialog: it, it was about Elbourne.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: We'd have to go digging in Vietnam
dialog: to ask him.
speaker_heading: ROLFE
dialog: And Elbourne and Mom took you to the
dialog: doctor and told him you fell from
text: the hay loft.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Well, I never heard that one.
speaker_heading: ROLFE
dialog: I remember clearly cause when I heard
dialog: I became real careful around Pop. I
dialog: was a careful child and I became a
dialog: careful adult, but at least I wasn't
text: afflicted by that man's violence.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: (laughs again)
dialog: That's what you think.

speaker_heading: ROLFE

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: WADE

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Open the door. We're late.
speaker_heading: WADE

dialog: Tunes!
text: The drilling truck pulls out the garage, onto the road. From

text: Wade, all eyes and ears, watches. Mel Gordon parks in front

speaker_heading: ELAINE (O.S.)

speaker_heading: MEL GORDON

speaker_heading: HAND

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I plan to. Soon.
speaker_heading: HAND
dialog: How soon?
speaker_heading: WADE

speaker_heading: HAND
dialog: Good. It would help if there were

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
speaker_heading: HAND
dialog: No, not exactly. I'll look at the

dialog: Jill, right?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HAND
dialog: Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You
dialog: can mail it.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Jesus. How much... how much will the
dialog: whole thing cost?
speaker_heading: HAND
dialog: Hard to say. If we go for custody,
dialog: depositions, psychiatric evaluations,
dialog: it could drag on. Ten or twelve
dialog: thousand dollars. She could win on

speaker_heading: LARIVIERE

speaker_heading: LARIVIERE

text: Hewitt is driving fast. Wade keeps up.
text: Jack, far ahead, approaches the accident scene. Stops. Night

text: Silence. Footsteps in the snow. Wade watches, listens. What's
dialog: he doing? Looking for evidence?
text: The burgundy pickup engine suddenly ROARS -- Jack's back and
text: at the wheel -- the tires squeal, spit snow as he spins past
dialog: Wade.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. POND - NIGHT

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You crazy sonofabitch! You'll sink
dialog: us both! Get off the fucking ice!
dialog: Get off!
text: Wade doesn't budge. Jack backs away; Wade inches forward.

text: Jacks grabs his rifle, points it:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'll shoot you, Wade, I swear it!

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't move! I'll shoot you dead if

text: Jack gets back in his pickup, maneuvers it slowly around the

text: Wade stands in darkness. The only sound his idling truck,
text: the wind. Then a third sound -- the snap of ice. Ice cracks
text: ripple from the middle of the pond. Ice planes tip around
dialog: the truck.
text: LaRiviere's snazzy Dodge slips, descends, disappears.
text: Headlights glow under water, then go out. "Our Business Is

dialog: No shit, Rolfe, I glanced up and

dialog: nail those sonsofbitches, the Two
dialog: Gordons. That's what Alma calls them.
dialog: Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
speaker_heading: ROLFE (O.S.)
dialog: Take care of the little things first,
dialog: the things that are distracting you
dialog: from taking care of the big things.
dialog: Call Chub Merritt, get your car back,
dialog: call a dentist, for God's sake, and
dialog: get your tooth pulled, don't trust
dialog: the locals, get your facts straight
dialog: and go straight to the state police.
dialog: Let them work on this.
text: CHICK WARD, 30, Chub Merritt's mechanic, greets Wade outside

speaker_heading: CHICK
dialog: The good news is we haven't got to
dialog: your car yet. The bad news --
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Just tell me when you'll have it
dialog: fixed.
speaker_heading: CHICK
dialog: -- the bad news is there's a problem
dialog: with Gordon's truck what somebody
dialog: drove through the ice last night.
dialog: Figured you'd know something about
dialog: that, Wade.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Yeah. I know about that.
speaker_heading: CHICK
dialog: LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay
dialog: for the fixin' of your car. A couple
dialog: hundred for the clutch. I got some
dialog: more bad news. Wanna hear it?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Tell me.
speaker_heading: CHICK
dialog: Chub says you're fired.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: He can't fire me. LaRiviere already
dialog: did that this morning.
speaker_heading: CHICK
dialog: He's a Selectman. The town. He said
dialog: to tell you to turn your badge in
dialog: and clean out your office. I'm
dialog: supposed to pull the CB and police
dialog: light out of your car. They're town
dialog: property.

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: What do you mean, you can't take me
dialog: today? I told you --
text: The other party has hung up. Margie stands, upset. Wade slams

speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: What on earth is happening to you?
dialog: Why are you acting this way?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I

dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: I heard you talking. You got fired

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Look, that's temporary, believe me.
dialog: There's so much shit gonna hit the

text: fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't

text: Pop enters from outside with firewood, passes.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I'll get another job. People are
dialog: going to need me. After this is over,
dialog: they'll make me into a Goddamned
dialog: hero. You wait: you'll see, I'll
dialog: deliver. I'll be the best father who
dialog: ever lived. You need me, even Pop,

dialog: they can send me howling into a corner
dialog: like a kicked dog, but my God, it'll
dialog: be different soon.
text: Margie's face falls. She retreats from the room as he speaks,
text: taking her coat and pocketbook. Wade and his old man, she
dialog: thinks: just the same.
text: Wade looks out the window and she gets in her car, drives
dialog: off.
text: Wade holds his inflamed jaw; he can hardly see straight. Pop
text: turns on the TV in the living room, boosts the volume.
text: Pop comes back in the room, gets the Canadian Club, pours
text: himself a drink.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Leave the bottle out!
text: Pop growls, goes back to wrestling on the TV. Wade walks to
text: the cabinet, removes a pair of pliers from the tool drawer,
text: goes toward the bathroom.
text: In the BATHROOM, Wade opens his mouth -- it hurts -- takes a
text: bite of whisky, sets the bottle on the toilet tank.
text: He looks at the stranger in the mirror, reaches inside his
text: mouth with the pliers. Prying his mouth open, Wade Whitehouse
text: locks the pliers onto a large molar in the back, squeezes
text: and pulls.
text: He steadies himself, pulls again, yanking the pliers from
text: his mouth. The bloody rotted tooth clatters in the sink. He
text: takes another bite of whisky.
text: Rolfe's voice plays over:
speaker_heading: ROLFE (V.O.)
dialog: You will say I should have known
dialog: terrible things were about to happen,
dialog: and perhaps I should have. But even
dialog: so, what could I have done by then?
dialog: Wade never went inside. He lived
text: almost wholly out there on his skin,
dialog: with no interior space to retreat
text: to, even in a crisis.
text: Wade takes another swig, sets the whisky bottle in the LIVING
text: ROOM beside the TV set. Wade and Pop exchange looks.

speaker_heading: LILLIAN

speaker_heading: LILLIAN

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Low as what? What have I done? It's

speaker_heading: LILLIAN
dialog: You know what I'm talking about. For

speaker_heading: WADE

speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WADE

speaker_heading: JILL

speaker_heading: WADE

speaker_heading: JILL

dialog: What do you want?

speaker_heading: WADE

speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (looking ahead)

speaker_heading: WADE

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Oh, Jesus, Jill, I'm sorry. What's

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Please don't cry. Please, honey.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (regains composure)
dialog: What are you sorry for?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I don't know. For the food business.

speaker_heading: JILL

speaker_heading: WADE

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It's called a grilled cheese sandwich,

text: The diner goes silent. Hunters look up. Jill's face is white;
text: she starts to cry.
text: Wade looks over -- it takes him a moment to react -- bends
text: down, comforting her. He wipes her nose with a napkin.
speaker_heading: WADE

speaker_heading: JILL

speaker_heading: WADE

speaker_heading: WADE

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
speaker_heading: WADE

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN HALL - DAY

text: Wade and Jill get out, approach:
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Going somewhere, Margie?
speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: I'm just cleaning out some of this

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Don't lie to me. You're leaving me,
dialog: I can see that.
speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
text: Jill, suitcase in hand, looking pathetic, tries to smile. A
text: sadness passes over Wade's face.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: (hurt)
dialog: Marg.
text: Margie, watching him, quivers, starts to cry. She drops her
text: suitcase, out of nowhere bawling like a baby.
text: Wade goes over, puts his arms around her, pats her back. His
text: face is racked. He, too, seems about to cry -- if he could.
text: In his arms Margie feels trapped, overwhelmed by Wade's
text: circumstances and terrible sadness. She pushes:
speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: (crying)
dialog: Leave me alone! Leave me alone!
text: She struggles in Wade's grasp. Jill, frightened, wildly hits
text: him from behind:
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Leave her alone! Leave her alone!
text: Wade moves back like a bear, covering his face and arms.
text: Jill, near hysterical, keeps after him, arms and fists flying.
text: Wade stumbles backwards into the snow. Jill still swings.
text: Margie dashes to intervene as Wade swings his arms wide.
text: Jill flies into Marg. Her nose is bleeding. Wade's caught
text: her across the mouth and nose. She takes cover behind Margie,
text: crying.
text: Margie and Jill stand side by side, saying nothing. Wade
text: looks up stunned, as if hit by a rock. Marg slowly backs
text: away, her arms behind her holding Jill.
speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: (to Jill)
dialog: Get in.
text: Marg eases Jill into the front seat, closes the door, edges
text: around the car slamming the trunk and gets into the driver's
text: seat. Wade stands.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I want to go home. Will you take me
dialog: home?
speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: Yes.
text: She closes the front door, starts the car. She backs out the
dialog: drive.
text: In her rear view mirror she sees the image of Wade receding,
text: standing frozen, staring down at the snow. Pop emerges from
text: the house, looks at his son, grinning.
text: Wade looks at his old man, that dumb devilish grin plastered
text: on his father's face. Glen Whitehouse holds an empty whiskey
text: bottle like a pistol.
text: Hunters' gunshots echo in the distance.
speaker_heading: POP

scene_heading: INT. BARN - DAY

text: Suddenly! A whiskey bottle SLAMS against the back of his
text: head. He drops to his knees, the guns scatter. He looks up
text: with child's fear and guilt at his father.
text: Glen Whitehouse hovers over him, huge and ferocious: a
text: colossus, lifting the bottle like a jawbone.
text: Wade cringes, scrambles for the dropped rifle. He grabs it
text: by the barrel and, twisting around, swings it in a slow motion
text: arc, smashing the edge of the wood stock against his father's
text: head. A cold hard CRACK of bone.
text: Glen Whitehouse -- shriveled again, no longer mythic -- flies
text: back like a stuffed dummy. He collapses beside the empty
dialog: C.C. bottle.
text: Wade, bleeding from the head, stands, staggers off Pop's
text: inert body, aims his rifle at the old man's face.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I know you now. I love you too.
text: Wade bolts the rifle, flicks off the safety, fires -- a loud
text: CLICK. The gun's empty.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Joke. You scared me.
text: He kneels down, lovingly touches the old man's face, caresses
text: his lips, cheeks, nose, brows, smoothes back his stiff gray
dialog: hair.
text: Pop's eyes are clouded. Blood suddenly drips from his ear to
dialog: the ground.
text: Wade rests the rifle against the truck. He bends over, slips
text: his hands under his father's body, lifts him up. He carries
text: Pop over to the workbench, lays him out.
text: Groping beneath the bench, Wade finds the kerosene lamp. He
text: unscrews it, pours kerosene the length of Pop's body.
text: Wade takes out his cigarette lighter, ignites it, holds it
text: for a moment, places it to Glen Whitehouse.
text: Fire spreads the length of Pop's body, bursting like a shroud
