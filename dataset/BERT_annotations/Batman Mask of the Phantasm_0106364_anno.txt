speaker_heading: ON JOKER
text: His movement comes to an abrupt halt. He looks down 0.S., reacts.
speaker_heading: HIS POV - BATMAN
text: Anchored to the railing, pulling on the rope.
speaker_heading: WIDE ANGLE
text: The Joker has drifted somewhat, so he and the rope are now at a
text: slight angle to the vertical thrust of the ROCKET EXHAUST -- which
text: means Batman can reel him in without winding up barbequed. The
text: Joker reacts in horror to this.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What are you doing?!
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: The Joker frantically maneuvers, trying to aim the EXHAUST so as
text: to fry Batman. This is not easy, since he has to keep himself

speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: In another minute this whole
dialog: place will be toast!
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Batman has pulled the Joker as close as he can without being

text: leaps for the Joker.
speaker_heading: DRAMATIC ANGLE
text: Batman grabs the Joker, ripping at the latter’s rocket harness as
text: the two weave above the fairgrounds far below, drifting away from
text: the spaceship sculpture. The Joker fights back, trying to push
dialog: Batman off.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: You’re crazy! I’m your only
dialog: chance to get out of here! Let
dialog: me go or we’ll both die!
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Then 1/11 see you in hell!
speaker_heading: CLOSER
text: He manages to KICK one of the twin jets of the rocket pack,

text: go. into a spin.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (cry of fear)
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: The Joker goes into a nose dive, spiraling down spectacularly as
text: Batman leaps from him for the railing.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (trailing cry)
speaker_heading: ON BATMAN

scene_heading: ON MOON STRUCTURE
text: The Joker falls and HITS the rusted arc of the moon structure,
text: BREAKING through it.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (cry of pain)
text: Most of the covering CRACKS and falls in with him, revealing the
text: skeletal frame of the structure.
text: ON BASE OF SPACESHIP STRUCTURE
text: The rocket pack HITS the base of the structure and EXPLODES.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - SPACESHIP STRUCTURE
text: For an instant it looks like we have ignition as FLAMES BILLOW
text: from the base of the spaceship structure. But the structure,
text: instead of rising, begins to COLLAPSE as the weakened fins give
dialog: way.
scene_heading: ON OBSERVATION DECK - BATMAN
text: The Dark Knight leaps from the deck once again as the structure
speaker_heading: COLLAPSES.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - SPACESHIP AND MOON
text: The spaceship topples onto the moon structure, CRUSHING it.
scene_heading: ON BATMAN - FALLING
text: Out of batarangs and grappling guns. He grabs the protruding
text: horizontal spire of another sculpture and swings around it,
text: partially breaking the force of his fall.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: It’s still a punishing drop to the pavement. He lands hard,
text: twisting one leg beneath him.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: (cry of pain)
speaker_heading: ON JOKER
text: Still alive, but trapped beneath the rubble. He shields himself
text: as best he can as more wreckage RAINS INTO SHOT.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BATMAN HOME VIDEO "Masks" / Final Draft 12/21/92 125.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Batman staggers INTO SHOT not far from where the Joker lies,
text: presumably with multiple injuries. Batman’s not looking much
text: better himself: Costume torn and ragged, blood streaking his face
text: and body, one leg injured or broken. He limps forward. The Joker
text: looks up and sees him. He grins, a ghastly rictus.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: Okay. I give up.
speaker_heading: FAVOR BATMAN
text: He hobbles toward the Joker; whether to help or finish it is hard
text: to say at this point. Pieces of FLAMING RUBBLE are still FALLING
text: from the spaceship structure.
scene_heading: ANGLE INCLUDES JOKER
text: As Andrea suddenly materializes out of the night beside him. He
text: reacts, looks up at her.
speaker_heading: JOKER

text: He starts forward, surprise and fear on his face.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Andrea! You’ve got to get
dialog: out of here! The place is
dialog: wired to explode!
text: As if to underscore his words, a SERIES OF EXPLOSIONS begin in the
text: distance, growing closer.
scene_heading: ANGLE INCLUDES ANDREA AND JOKER
text: A large piece of the structure CRASHES down between them, the
text: FLAMES driving Batman back. Through the dancing heat we can see
text: Andrea. She is calm as only one who embraces death can be. If
text: there is an emotion in her face and voice, it is sadness. During
text: the next few shots we can hear the STRING OF EXPLOSIONS GROWING
text: LOUDER, even see them in the distance.
speaker_heading: ANDREA
dialog: No. One way or another, it
dialog: ends tonight.
scene_heading: BATMAN HOME VIDEO "Masks" / Final Draft 12/21/92 126.

speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (as he struggles)
dialog: For once I’m stuck without
text: a punchline.
dialog: (weak laughter)
speaker_heading: WIDE ANGLE
text: Andrea TRIGGERS the canister. Black mist obliterates our view of
dialog: her and the Joker.
speaker_heading: JOKER (0.S.)
dialog: (laughter grows
dialog: stronger, more manic)
speaker_heading: ON BATMAN
text: He realizes what she plans to do. He tries to reach her.

dialog: NOOO <-!!!
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: An EXPLOSION close by hurls him 0O.S.
speaker_heading: ON STREET
text: Batman is hurled INTO SHOT next to a grating that is partially
text: askew. FLAMING DEBRIS RAINS down around him. He can barely move,
text: but he tries to crawl back through the flames to the only woman he
text: ever really loved. If he can’t save her, at least he can die with
dialog: her. ‘
speaker_heading: JOKER (0.S.)
dialog: (crazy laughter)
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Another 0.S. EXPLOSION -- really close -- causes the street to

scene_heading: INT. SEWER
text: Batman, along with a SHOWER OF DEBRIS, falls into the swiftly
text: RUNNING WATER and is carried into darkness. A moment later
text: another EXPLOSION causes the street to completely COLLAPSE,

dialog: curt TO:
scene_heading: PANORAMIC ANGLE - THE FAIRGROUNDS
text: The whole place is going UP IN FLAMES as the EXPLOSIONS tear the
text: grounds apart... The Joker’s WILD LAUGHTER CONTINUES.
speaker_heading: JOKER (0.S.)
dialog: (mad laughter)
text: In the center, at the base of the moon structure, is a small blot
text: of black mist. But not for long -- the MOTHER OF ALL EXPLOSIONS

dialog: its peak, and we...

scene_heading: INT. THE BATCAVE - ON THRONE CHAIR
text: Batman sits, shell-shocked. His costume is ripped and blackened

text: steps IN with a tray of bandages and medicinals.
speaker_heading: FAVOR BRUCE
text: He looks at his fist, clinches it, then lets it fall limply. He

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I couldn’t save her, Alfred.

speaker_heading: FAVOR ALFRED
text: o~ He hurts for him. He puts a hand on Bruce’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: ALFRED (CONT’D)
dialog: Vengeance blackens the soul,
dialog: Bruce. I always feared you
dialog: would become that which you
dialog: fought against. You walk the
dialog: edge of that abyss every night,
dialog: but you haven’t fallen in. And
dialog: I thank heaven for that.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But Andrea fell into that pit
dialog: years ago. And no one -=- not
dialog: even you -- could have pulled
dialog: her back.
speaker_heading: FAVOR BRUCE
text: He knows the truth of what Alfred says, but it’s of small comfort.
text: As he looks away in sad reflection...
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON BRUCE
text: A sparkle of light cast from 0.S. dances on his eye, interrupting
text: him. He looks 0.S. to find the source.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: He stands, walks forward. -Alfred watches him, puzzled.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: What is it, Master Bruce?
speaker_heading: ON STALACTITE
text: A limestone fang descending from the ceiling, narrowing to a point
text: in f.g. Bruce steps up to it. RACK FOCUS to show Andrea’s locket
text: hanging from the tip of the formation.
speaker_heading: ON BRUCE

scene_heading: CLOSER - PROMENADE DECK
text: PARTY NOISES can be heard in b.g. A WOMAN IN BLACK, whom we see
text: from the back with a scarf around her head, steps up to the rail
text: to gaze at the city she’s leaving behind.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Still not showing us the Woman’s face. A lively MIDDLE-AGED
dialog: PASSENGER, (think Ned Beatty) not unlike the salesman we met in
text: the plane, crosses behind her with a drink in his hand. He sees
text: the Woman and sidles up to the rail beside her.
speaker_heading: PASSENGER
dialog: Hey, you’re missing the party.
dialog: (re: the skyline)
dialog: Quite a sight.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (distantly)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: FAVOR PASSENGER

dialog: Have you -- lost someone?
speaker_heading: ON WOMAN
text: Except for her wistful eyes, her face is in shadows.
