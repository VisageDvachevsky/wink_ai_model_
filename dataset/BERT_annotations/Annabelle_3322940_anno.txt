text: A series of shots.
text: Blue sky through shabby windows.
text: Run down walls. A paint splashed pine floor. Tens of paint
text: brushes soaking in stained jars.
text: An artisan's hands - weather-worn, swirling a paint brush
text: in dirty water that sways at the bottom of one of the jars.
text: A canvas - the sketched face of a woman - blonde, blue eyed
text: as the artisan strokes paint into her features - a poster
dialog: girl for 18th century portraiture. (We will later

scene_heading: 2 EXT/INT. DOCKS/SLUM ROOM. ENGLAND - DAY. 2 2 *
text: A swallow cuts across a red tinged sky. SOUND of footsteps
text: trudging through mud.
text: EXTREME CLOSE UP: a small figure being dressed by someone -
text: a shoulder, an arm, little hands. We do not see a face.
text: CLOSE: heavy naval boots move at sombre pace through slums.
text: Against a stone floor, a child's feet are laced into boots.
text: A starving dog barks , darts between tradesmen, sailors.
text: Hold this image as Handel comes to an END.
scene_heading: 3 INT. SLUM ROOM - DAY. 2 3 *
text: A CHILD'S POV as the door opens. We see a gentleman in
scene_heading: ceremonial naval dress - CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY,
text: aristocratic, handsome...alarmed at the sight before him.
text: His eyes close with some sad, internal pain and as they re-
dialog: open...We see what he sees...
text: A fragile girl...around six years old stands in shabby
text: surroundings. Her terrified eyes stare back, leaving
text: LINDSAY at a loss. He takes in her features - delicate
text: with a full mouth that underlines her ethnicity.
text: She is DIDO ELIZABETH BELLE...part black, part white.
dialog: 2.
text: He speaks quietly- words almost as fragile as she is.
scene_heading: CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY
dialog: Hello little girl...Little Dido.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I am your father.
text: Silence. Then a tear rises to the surface and as her
text: confused tears spill, so too do LINDSAY'S.
text: His POV: a POOR BLACK WOMAN oversees DIDO from afar.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)
dialog: (re. Dido)
dialog: How lovely she is. So much of her
dialog: mother.
dialog: (his eyes sting)
dialog: I tried...but how...how could I
dialog: separate a mother from her child?
dialog: (he restrains tears)
dialog: And now nature has deprived me of
dialog: such a dilemma.
text: He composes himself - feeling futile...
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you..for taking her.
text: He reaches into his pocket, holds out money to the woman.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)
dialog: You may leave us.
text: The WOMAN hesitates, scurries to DIDO, placing her lips to
text: the child's head in a prolonged kiss. Then she is gone.
text: DIDO is left frightened and stunned!
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Do not be afraid sweet thing. I
dialog: am to take you to a good life.
dialog: The life you were born to.
text: He takes out a cube of chocolate, shows it to her. She is
text: reluctant. He takes a bite - delicious! DIDO moves
text: forward. He puts the chocolate in her hand. She tastes
text: it. Sweet cocoa and sugar..and now her tiny mouth is
text: filled. It makes LINDSAY laugh out loud.
scene_heading: 4 EXT. DOCKS - DAY. 2 4 *
text: A driver, HARRY - seated at a fine carriage.
text: As HARRY becomes alarmed - from his POV LINDSAY moves
text: towards us - the mulatto child in arms.
dialog: 3.
scene_heading: 5 EXT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LAWNS. DAY. 2 5 *
text: Silence, except bird song - the splendor of the English
text: countryside - A neoclassical estate stretches before us.
text: The figure of a LITTLE GIRL running across the lawns - her
text: giggle fills the air, her outline faded by the sun.
text: At French doors to the nursery, a furious greying woman -
text: LADY MARY MURRAY (40s), waves a wooden spoon and yells...
speaker_heading: LADY MARY
dialog: Elizabeth Murray, bring yourself
dialog: back here this very moment!
text: The child crashes to the grass in fits of laughter. She is
dialog: no more than 6 years old - Hair the colour of bleached hay
text: and delicate pale skin.
text: She rolls on to her back, squinting at the sunlight as...
text: The SOUND of horse and carriage at the front of the house.
text: ELIZABETH bolts upright. Her POV: As CAPTAIN SIR JOHN
text: LINDSAY guides DIDO from the carriage.
text: WIMBRIDGE, the butler, steps out to receive them.
scene_heading: 6 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. DAY. 2 6 *
dialog: LADY MANSFIELD (40s), the years have been kind. She is
text: beautiful, regal - stares ahead in shock...
text: LORD MANSFIELD (50's) - a majestic man, white wigged and
text: low brows, is incandescent, his sister, LADY MARY, frozen.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: What in God's name have you done!!
text: Their POV - LINDSAY and little DIDO stand.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: She...she is black.
text: LINDSAY is pained.
scene_heading: CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY
dialog: She is my blood.
speaker_heading: LADY MARY
dialog: But she IS black!
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: A detail you chose NOT to share.
scene_heading: CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY
dialog: Uncle? You assured me!
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: (fury)
dialog: Captain Sir John Lindsay, do you
dialog: find me a fool? She is a MULATTO!
text: LORD MANSFIELD'S blood boils, he rages towards LINDSAY. LADY
text: MANSFIELD restrains him. LINDSAY is red with humiliation.
scene_heading: CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY
dialog: I have no wife to take her...In a
dialog: few hours I am to captain a
dialog: voyage to the Indies on a
dialog: longitude experiment.
dialog: (strained)
dialog: From there, who knows!!! It is
dialog: not in my gift to question the
dialog: King and his Royal Navy.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: You keep in mind my position..?
dialog: My reputation...?
scene_heading: CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY
dialog: Sir...
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Then have some sense of propriety
dialog: boy...and understand what you are
dialog: asking.
text: LINDSAY lowers his voice, shielding DIDO.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN LINDSAY
dialog: Her mother is dead! My wishes may
dialog: not be orthodox but they ARE
dialog: necessary!
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: How do we raise her...?
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN LINDSAY
dialog: I beg you, uncle...love her - as
dialog: I would, were I here.
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: And ensure that she is in receipt
dialog: of all that is due to her as a
dialog: child of mine.
text: LADY MARY gasps, under...
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: That is simply impossible.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN LINDSAY
dialog: What is right can never be
dialog: impossible.
dialog: 5.
text: His firm gaze holds his aunt and uncle to account. A long
text: beat. LADY MANSFIELD stands conflicted.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: What has she been named?
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN LINDSAY
dialog: She is Belle...after her mother.
dialog: Dido Elizabeth Belle...Lindsay.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: She takes your name?
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN LINDSAY
dialog: I am not ashamed.
text: LINDSAY stands his ground.
speaker_heading: LADY MARY
dialog: We cannot have another
text: Elizabeth in the household.
text: LADY MANSFIELD regards the child, then looks to her
text: husband, gravely. He turns his back - aggrieved.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: We...we will call her Dido.
dialog: (off Lindsay's nod)
dialog: Good Lord, she is thin. Mary,
dialog: find her something to eat.
text: LORD MANSFIELD storms from the room. LADY MANSFIELD
text: follows. LINDSAY kneels, choked with emotion.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN LINDSAY
dialog: Little Belle - sweet child...
dialog: (weak smile)
dialog: My wish is to keep you...keep you
dialog: with me...but a ship...it is no
dialog: place for one so precious as you.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: In these walls, yours will be a
dialog: life equal to my blood.
text: A beat. Through eyes that brim...he catches his breath.
text: LADY MARY is both stunned and moved - she has to turn away.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)
dialog: You will not understand in this
dialog: moment, but hold this in your
dialog: heart...you are loved...Just as
dialog: I loved your mother.
text: A tear spills and DIDO's little fingers come up to wipe it
text: from his cheek. He presses his lips to her hand, sobbing a
dialog: moment, and then he is gone - to stay any longer would be
dialog: too much to bare.
dialog: 6.
scene_heading: 7 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. STAIRS/ENTRANCE HALL/GALLERY - DAY. 2 7 *
text: ON ELIZABETH seated at the grand staircase as LADY MARY and
text: DIDO emerge. Like ELIZABETH, DIDO is now freshly dressed in
text: rich silks, an adorable sight as they move through corridors
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Are you...a nee-gro?
text: ELIZABETH makes her way across...taking her aunt's hand as
text: all three walk. DIDO is silent.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you what they call `a negro?'
dialog: I heard them talking.
speaker_heading: LADY MARY
dialog: Questions, questions, Elizabeth!
dialog: Tis a most irritating trait you
dialog: and your father share.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Papaa M?
speaker_heading: LADY MARY
dialog: No your blood papaa. Sir David
dialog: Murray. You should not insist on
dialog: always speaking your mind, you
dialog: know. You will end up an old maid
dialog: with only your own company for
dialog: entertainment!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Like you, Aunt Mary? That is what
dialog: the maids say?
speaker_heading: LADY MARY
dialog: You little....
text: ELIZABETH takes off. LADY MARY rushes after her.
text: DIDO is left alone - through the doorway of the gallery, a
text: portrait of LINDSAY stares at her. She gazes at it.
text: LORD MANSFIELD approaches, arrested at the sight of DIDO,
text: newly tidied. He follows her gaze to LINDSAY'S image. The
text: sight affects him, unexpectedly.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Captain Sir John Lindsay.
dialog: (off her reaction)
dialog: Do you recognise him?
text: She nods. A beat as conflict fills him.
dialog: 7.
scene_heading: 8 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. GALLERY. CONTINUOUS. DAY 2 8 *
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: D'you see here...? This..this is
dialog: your grandfather, Sir Alexander
dialog: Lindsay of Evelick.
text: DIDO examines the painting. LORD MANSFIELD watches her.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: I am here too....do you see?
text: Her eyes search the long line of her aristocratic heritage,
text: until her gaze settles. He chuckles, reluctantly charmed as
text: she points to his likeness.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes...I am William Murray, First
dialog: Earl of Mansfield.
text: A beat as he looks to her, affected by this little person.
text: Gently, he leads her to a final portrait.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: Now...do you see this man? He is
dialog: my nephew...do you understand...?
dialog: (off Dido's nod)
dialog: ...your uncle - Sir David Murray.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Elizabeth's papa.
dialog: He pauses
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: You are a sharp little one. He is
dialog: The Seventh Viscount Stormont...
dialog: (beat. Almost to himself)
dialog: ...to inherit everything that we
dialog: are standing on when I am gone.
text: She nods, bites her lip - that much has gone over her
text: head...he can see. He closes his eyes. The enormity of this
text: new responsibility weighing heavy.
scene_heading: 9 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LADIES PARLOUR/LAWNS - DAY. 2 9 *
scene_heading: LORD MANSFIELD's POV: through window - The lawns. ELIZABETH
text: gently takes DIDO'S hand in hers, leads her off to run
text: between the trees. As their delighted screams filter...
text: LADY MANSFIELD enters - observes LORD Mansfield, a moment.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: Born on English soil?
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Indeed. He discovered her mother
dialog: aboard a captured Spanish slave
dialog: ship. He was charged with
dialog: conveying it back to these
dialog: shores, he tells me.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: Evidently he had some...`feeling'
dialog: for the woman.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: (dry)
dialog: And there I was believing it was
dialog: sheer lack of `self control'.
dialog: (scathing)
dialog: He has been at sea, six years.
dialog: All of this child's life!
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: Well, he clearly saw to their
dialog: wellbeing. The child is not
dialog: altogether uncivilized.
dialog: (she breathes deeply)
dialog: So...now we have two nieces in
dialog: our guardianship.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: (reticent)
dialog: Elizabeth was much in need of a
dialog: companion.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: And that is what we shall say
dialog: when questions are asked of us?
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: We shall say that in accordance
text: with her birthright, she is
dialog: entitled to live beneath this roof.
dialog: (with irony)
dialog: Such...is the nature of `order'.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: And where in this `order' should
dialog: her colour be placed? Below or
dialog: above her Murray bloodline?
dialog: (off his silence)
dialog: May she dine with us?
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: She may...(pause)...NOT...in
dialog: company. We cannot escape
dialog: society's confines on etiquette
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: Marriage?
dialog: 9.
text: He shakes his head at the complexity of it all.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Impossible. Any match her..'other
dialog: origins' may attract would surely
text: disgrace her and the family rank.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: And when we are no longer here? No
dialog: husband - who will take care of her?
text: He rubs his eyebrows, perturbed, turns back to the lawns.
scene_heading: 10 EXT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LAWNS - CONTINUOUS. DAY.2/3 10 *
text: A view across the idyllic estate. SOUNDS of children's
text: shrieks have become adult.
speaker_heading: CAPTION: 1781
text: A twenty year old DIDO darts between trees.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Bette! No...no surprises Bette!
text: ELIZABETH, also twenty now, suddenly jumps from behind the
text: willows, causing DIDO to wail hysterically.
text: LADY MARY stands at the doorway of the old nursery.
speaker_heading: LADY MARY
dialog: (shrieking)
dialog: Girls! Will you refrain from
text: shrieking like the...bless-ed
dialog: French!
text: The girls race towards the house.
text: ELIZABETH'S blonde colouring remains, whilst DIDO'S looks
text: have become dramatic - her dark hair, thick and long, wrapped
text: in a bun, and black lashes that frame her dark eyes.
scene_heading: 11 EXT. HAMPSTEAD. CHURCH - DAY.3 11 *
text: Church bells - parishioners make their way into the
text: beautiful sixteenth century chapel, in lush green fields.
scene_heading: 12 INT. CHURCH - DAY.3 12 *
text: REVEREND DAVINIER, white wigged, stands at the pulpit.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: REVEREND DAVINIER
dialog: ...for it is the power of God
dialog: unto salvation to every one that
dialog: believeth. So saith Christ the
dialog: Lord. Amen.
speaker_heading: CONGREGATION
dialog: Amen.
text: A FLAME as a YOUNG MAN lights a candle by the altar. He sings,
text: choir-like, the word `amen' rather than simply saying it.
speaker_heading: REVEREND DAVINIER
dialog: Hymn no. 76.
text: ON the MANSFIELDS as the congregation begins to sing.
scene_heading: 13 INT. CHURCH - DAY. 3 13 *
text: The YOUNG MAN stands collecting bibles as the congregation
text: file out. DIDO hands him hers.
text: He is chaotically handsome with deeply set, expressive eyes
text: that lock with hers for a moment, stirring her. Then his
text: gaze moves suddenly to LORD MANSFIELD - intense, as he
text: watches him drift from the church, the family in tow.
scene_heading: 14 EXT. KENWOOD ESTATE. HEATH - DAY.3 14 *
text: Pure, lush, green. The Mansfield carriage on the horizon.
scene_heading: 15 INT. MANSFIELD CARRIAGE - DAY.3 15 *
text: LORD and LADY MANSFIELD sit together, ELIZABETH beside
text: them. DIDO and LADY MARY ride backwards.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: I have reason to speak with you
dialog: alone, Dido.
text: DIDO is quietly alarmed.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Have I wronged you, Papaa?
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: You have done no such thing.
scene_heading: 16 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LORD MANSFIELD'S STUDY - DAY.3 16 *
text: LORD MANSFIELD is grave. DIDO stands before him.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: I have not past experience in the
dialog: ways of breaking grave news to you.
text: He hands her a letter and she reads. A beat, as the news
text: resonates through her, silently. Her pained gaze slowly
text: rises to meet LORD MANSFIELD'S.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: (quiet, shock)
dialog: I thought I should one day have
dialog: the opportunity to make his
dialog: better acquaintance.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Yes. I know.
scene_heading: 17 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. DIDO AND ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - DAY.3 17 *
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Two thousand pounds a year?
text: ELIZABETH sits at the edge of the bed in day clothes. DIDO
text: nods, her back to us as she stares out through the window.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Then you are an heiress! He has
dialog: left you your fortune!
scene_heading: 18 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. DIDO AND ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 3 18 *
text: Darkness. DIDO and ELIZABETH lie in separate beds. Only a
text: shaft of moonlight illuminates their faces.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: He must have loved you, Dido.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: He did not know me.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: My father's new wife wishes him
dialog: to leave me not a thing, and he
text: obliges her.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Then it is her cruelty you should
text: lament, Bette, not his stupidity.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I think he might have loved me
dialog: more if Mamaa had not died.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: (pained)
dialog: I...I think love must be a very
dialog: complicated thing.
text: ELIZABETH lifts her head to look across at DIDO.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Dido - with such a dowry you may
dialog: marry into any good family you wish.
text: OFF DIDO as she stares at the ceiling, daunted.
scene_heading: 19 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LADIES PARLOUR - DAY.4 19 *
text: Soft sunlight filters. LADY MARY sits engrossed in her
text: needle-work. The two girls persevere with theirs.
speaker_heading: LADY MARY
dialog: We shall receive visitors for dinner.
text: The two girls exchange a glance and whisper.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Visitors? Who ever bothers to
dialog: visit us here?
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Or leave... except the dead!
text: ELIZABETH'S titters escape. LADY MARY looks up, abruptly.
speaker_heading: LADY MARY
dialog: Once again, Dido?
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Beds...Aunt Mary. We should
dialog: prepare some extra beds... in
dialog: case our visitors are to stay...
text: She trails off - LADY MARY raises an eyebrow.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: May we wear the new silks?
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: I will do your hair, Bette. Oh
dialog: say we may wear them, Aunt Mary.
speaker_heading: LADY MARY
dialog: You will not be dining with us, Dido.
text: The room falls silent and the girls' energy is killed.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: (hurt)
dialog: Yes of course. But I may join
dialog: after dinner, may I not?
speaker_heading: LADY MARY
dialog: Yes. Such are the rules, and you
dialog: know them well.
scene_heading: 20 EXT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LAKE - DAY.4 20 *
text: A blaze of rhododendron, azaleas. DIDO strolls with LORD
text: MANSFIELD, along Kenwood's lake, orange sunlight glistens.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: She is a most disagreeable...
dialog: hideous, old maid - I hate her!
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: You do not! She is only managing
dialog: the dictates of the household
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Papaa...how...how may I be too high
dialog: in rank to dine with the servants
dialog: and too low to dine with my family?
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Dinner with guests is a formal
dialog: proceeding, Dido - we simply
dialog: cannot impose the disregard of
dialog: those formalities upon visitors.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: But...Papaa, am I not..'wealthy',
dialog: now...an heiress? Surely that
dialog: changes matters...
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: (softly)
dialog: My dear...I wish it were so
dialog: simple. Finances may go some way -
dialog: but Society has a habit of
dialog: disregarding even one of their
dialog: own, when opportunity provides.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: (stung)
dialog: Of course...(trailing off)
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: BUT after dinner...when formality
dialog: is of less consequence...well
dialog: your presence can raise no
dialog: defendable objections.
dialog: (off her sadness)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: Dido, you know the rules of
dialog: propriety. Far better than
dialog: Elizabeth, if I am frank.
text: His loving gaze elicits a smile from her, weary. Propriety
dialog: is everything, after all.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: As you wish, sir.
scene_heading: 21 EXT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LAWNS. CONTINUOUS. DAY 4 21 *
text: LADY MANSFIELD sits in the shade - a maid prepares a seat
text: for LADY MARY, as DIDO heads for the house, pensive.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: Dido!...
text: ELIZABETH emerges from the house, breathless.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: There you are. I have been
dialog: searching for you!
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: (to Dido)
dialog: What a wretched countenance!
speaker_heading: LADY MARY
dialog: She deplores my authority. What
dialog: am I in this household, if not
dialog: the `observer of rules'?!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I would rather dine with Dido!
text: She links arms with DIDO in solidarity.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: What a great pity
text: LADY MANSFIELD and LADY MARY feign nonchalance.
speaker_heading: LADY MARY
dialog: Indeed.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: Our young gentlemen guests shall
dialog: miss you, Elizabeth.
text: Both girls' eyes widen - DIDO's with disappointment.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH/DIDO
dialog: Young gentlemen?
speaker_heading: LADY MARY
dialog: Very good connections.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: And most agreeable by all accounts!
text: ELIZABETH'S mouth falls open. LADY MARY leans toward her.
speaker_heading: LADY MARY
dialog: Close your mouth and understand:
dialog: There shall be no discussions
dialog: tonight in any languages other
dialog: than English! No whisperings in
dialog: gentlemen's ears - not in Latin,
dialog: Italian...and certainly not French!
text: OFF ELIZABETH'S mischief and Dido sunk.
scene_heading: 22 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. DINING ROOM - NIGHT. 4 22 *
text: Candles sprinkle a delicate light. An imposing dining table
text: stretches before us, laden with exquisite foods. LADY
text: ASHFORD 40's - a pale porcelain skinned woman, sits with
text: her sons - JAMES (25) and OLIVER (22). She is beautiful and
dialog: both have inherited her striking looks.
text: ELIZABETH whispers in JAMES' ear. LADY MARY glares!
speaker_heading: JAMES ASHFORD
dialog: What excellent French! Though I
dialog: have not an idea of what you said.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I said...`Your hands have the
dialog: suggestion of a sensitive man'.
text: She wrinkles her nose, minxish. Across the table...
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: I must say, the entire country
dialog: barely breathes awaiting your
dialog: judgement on this appeal.
dialog: Terrified you shall destroy
dialog: England, no doubt. I know Lord A
dialog: is. He does wonder though, what
dialog: can be taking you...so long?
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: (mild condescension)
dialog: The law, Lady Ashford. It is to be
dialog: interpreted - not merely administered.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: Your husband of all people knows this.
speaker_heading: LADY MARY
dialog: My brother is not a man of rash instinct.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: For that we are all grateful.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: What a lot of fuss over dead cargo.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
text: It is a fuss over the bread and
dialog: butter of a great many in these
dialog: isles. A great many, Lady Ashford.
text: OFF LORD MANSFIELD'S distaste....
scene_heading: 23 EXT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LAWNS - NIGHT. 4 23 *
text: The windows glint with candlelight, DIDO sits at a bench
text: alone. Laughter from the house carries in the breeze.
text: A rustle in the branches behind her. She stands, startled.
text: A beat, then she turns on her heels and sprints - fast.
scene_heading: 24 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. ENTRANCE HALL. NIGHT. 4 24 *
text: Breathless, DIDO races inside as WIMBRIDGE appears.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Wimbridge!
speaker_heading: WIMBRIDGE
dialog: Miss Lindsay?
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: There are poachers wandering...!
text: The sound of the echoing doorbell, jolting DIDO. Her eyes
text: dart to the door. WIMBRIDGE hesitates, then answers.
text: A YOUNG MAN stands, damp brow, and as breathless as DIDO.
text: We recognise him as the YOUNG MAN seen earlier in the
text: church. He is JOHN DAVINIER, son of REVEREND DAVINIER.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Good evening to you. I am John
dialog: Davinier, I..I believe I may have
dialog: disturbed a lady of this house...
text: He sets eyes on DIDO, peering from the great staircase.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ah...she is there.
dialog: (calling out to her)
dialog: Please forgive me...though you
dialog: barely gave me a chance...
text: DIDO turns her back, horrified. How dare he address her
dialog: without formal introduction?!
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Sir, I do not believe we have
dialog: been introduced!
text: JOHN takes hold of himself, half mortified, half irritated.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Indeed. I...I...
dialog: (to Wimbridge, feeling
dialog: foolish)
dialog: Please inform the lady of my
dialog: apologies for startling her. I
dialog: took advantage of the back
text: fields, by way of a short-cut to
dialog: deliver this to Lord Mansfield...
dialog: from my father.

dialog: Sir?
text: He hands WIMBRIDGE an envelope.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Reverend Davinier.
speaker_heading: WIMBRIDGE
dialog: Of course, sir. I will see that
dialog: he gets it immediately...
text: DIDO can't help but interfere. She calls over her shoulder.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: You shall not interrupt him at
dialog: dinner, Wimbridge!
speaker_heading: WIMBRIDGE
dialog: Immediately - after dinner, sir.
text: JOHN resists rolling his eyes - ghastly female!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Yes, of course...thank you.
text: He backs away. DIDO still shows him nothing but her back.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Wimbridge, awkward)
dialog: Good night.
speaker_heading: WIMBRIDGE
dialog: Good night, sir.
text: He moves off, and is gone as DIDO finally turns, stares at
text: the closed door, flushed.
dialog: 18.
scene_heading: 25 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. CONTINUOUS - NIGHT. 4. 25 *
text: A single figure - at the farthest end of the crimson
text: drawing room...DIDO'S heart skips a beat at the SOUND of
text: the approaching dinner party...Suddenly the doors open
text: ...DIDO stands quickly - nervous.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Dido...my dear.
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: (whispers to her sons)
dialog: Good Lord - the negro! She really is...
speaker_heading: JAMES ASHFORD
dialog: (quietly disturbed)
dialog: ...a lady.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Capital!
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: I hadn't expected her to look
dialog: so...black.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Mamaa, did you not listen to the
dialog: rumours when you were spreading
dialog: them?
text: DIDO curtseys respectfully to LORD MANSFIELD.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: May I present to you the second
dialog: of my nieces - Miss Dido Lindsay.
text: DIDO curtseys. LADY ASHFORD nods graciously. OLIVER bows -
text: has to nudge his troubled brother do the same.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: A pleasure, Miss Lindsay.
text: She curtseys once again, then moves to sit with ELIZABETH.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (sotto - re. James)
dialog: He is the eldest - to inherit the
dialog: entire Ashford fortune. He is
dialog: also to inherit from his uncle -
text: a healthy man, who shows little
text: sign of departure.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: How do you know?
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Lady Ashford herself. She seems
text: rather despondent at her
dialog: brother's robust constitution.
text: JAMES catches DIDO'S soft brown eyes resting on him.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: He has much to recommend him. And
dialog: a second fortune in life should
dialog: please any wife.
text: ELIZABETH clocks the gaze between DIDO and JAMES.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Dido! You are not to be a
dialog: coquette with him! You already
dialog: have your fortune!
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Are you suggesting I now
dialog: condescend to a gentleman without
dialog: means, Bette?! What should good
dialog: society think of us!
text: OLIVER moves to his brother, follows his gaze to DIDO.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: She is intriguing, is she not?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I find her repulsive.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I suppose she is...if you find a
dialog: most rare and exotic flower so.
dialog: She is quite something to behold.
text: ON DIDO as she falters under the brothers' stares.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (flustered, to DIDO)
dialog: Good Lord! They are appraising me!
text: ELIZABETH composes herself. JAMES' eyes remain on DIDO,
text: swallowing hard at her undeniable beauty.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: One does not make a wife of the
dialog: rare and exotic, Oliver. One
dialog: samples it on the cotton fields
dialog: of the Indies...
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: So far, when it is right at my door?
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: JAMES
text: ...Then finds a pure ENGLISH rose
dialog: to decorate one's home.
text: OLIVER smiles. OFF both men - trained on DIDO.
scene_heading: 26 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT 4. 26 *
text: ELIZABETH is at the pianoforte. She sings, plays hard, for
text: JAMES' attention, gazing up at him as he stands beside her.
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: Is she `OUT'??
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Not quite.
speaker_heading: LADY MARY
dialog: (awkward)
dialog: Any day now.
text: LADY ASHFORD raises an amused eyebrow - precocious creature!
text: OLIVER offers DIDO a discreet smile, as she sits beside
text: LORD MANSFIELD. His mother quietly moves across to him.
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: You will refrain from any
dialog: intercourse with the negress.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Lord and Lady Mansfield may find
dialog: it fascinating to have a Lady
dialog: Mulatto running around their
dialog: household, but I will not have
dialog: one running around mine!
speaker_heading: OLIVER
text: She is an heiress.
text: A seamless change of heart for LADY ASHFORD.
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: Although exceptions can be made.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: It is said that her father left
dialog: her a rather vast fortune.
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: I mean to say, if that is your
dialog: inclination.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: She is rather soft on the eye - I
dialog: have thought no further Mamaa.
dialog: 21.
text: LADY ASHFORD stares across at DIDO.
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: From where did you receive your
dialog: information?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Her sister-cousin has a rather
dialog: fast tongue.
text: ON LADY ASHFORD as she studies DIDO. ELIZABETH finishes,
text: amid a smattering of polite applause led by JAMES.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: And what of you Miss Lindsay?
dialog: Are we to hear you play tonight?
text: DIDO looks up to find OLIVER smiling across at her.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Well...
dialog: (deferring to her father)
dialog: Papaa...?
text: LORD MANSFIELD hesitates. DIDO is embarrassed.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Oh do not be selfish with your
dialog: good fortune, m'lord!
text: A beat...then put on the spot, LORD MANSFIELD caves,
text: throwing up his hands, helplessly.
text: DIDO is tentative, ELIZABETH less pleased.
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: This will be most interesting!
text: DIDO moves to the pianoforte settles her fingers on the
text: keys. A beat, then Handel's Suite No.9 fills the room.
text: LORD MANSFIELD closes his eyes, irritated with himself.
text: LADY MARY whispers to LADY MANSFIELD.
speaker_heading: LADY MARY
dialog: She has never played in company!
text: LADY MANSFIELD is silent - stiff with anxiety.
text: DIDO is raising a beautiful and fluent sound - as skillful
dialog: as the most gifted of Georgian young ladies.
text: LORD MANSFIELD'S eyes spring open - sees all held hostage.
text: OLIVER moves forward, utterly fascinated.
text: Relief floods LADY MANSFIELD - she sighs with pride as LADY
text: MARY lends LADY ASHFORD a smug look.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: (conceding)
dialog: She is...most accomplished.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: (with deep satisfaction)
dialog: Hers was a most diligent governess.
scene_heading: 27 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. UPSTAIRS CORRIDORS - NIGHT. 4 27 *
text: Echoing footsteps. LORD and LADY MANSFIELD move toward
text: their rooms, each with a lamp to light their way.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: The liberty of asking her to
dialog: play! And when he can have no
text: better intentions towards her.
text: She stops in her tracks briefly, suddenly unsure...
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: Can he??
text: They round a corner.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: ...His family name will, no doubt,
text: entice her to take him seriously.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: She must not delude herself. Such
dialog: decisions are not hers to make.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: Then spell it out to her! Before
dialog: she renders herself...sport to
dialog: some `gent' of cruel promises!!!
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: She has no reason. Hers is an
dialog: inheritance that renders her free
dialog: of the usual inducements to marry.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: Well, that, at least, is true,
dialog: (burdened, grave)
dialog: Indeed, it is Elizabeth who needs
dialog: to secure her bread and butter.
scene_heading: 28 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. GROUND FLOOR CORRIDORS/STUDIO. DAY. 5 28 *
text: Feminine feet move along the corridor. REVEAL DIDO making
text: her way to LORD MANSFIELD'S study.
text: Her POV: through the doorway to the studio.
dialog: 23.
text: An UNFAMILIAR FACE mixing paints, engrossed. His weather-
text: worn hands are recognisable from the opening credits. His
text: stare meets DIDO's, calmly moved by her beauty as she
text: stands, frozen - her full lips parted in astonishment.
scene_heading: 29 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. DIDO AND ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - DAY. 5 29 *
text: ELIZABETH stands at the mirror - a maid dressing her.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: A portrait? Are you sure?
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Yes...Aunt Mary has confirmed it.
text: DIDO sits, light headed, anxiety running through her.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Good Lord. How...truly wonderful.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: But...but...
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (becoming exasperated)
dialog: But what, Dido?
scene_heading: 30 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LORD MANSFIELD'S STUDY. DAY. 5 30 *
text: DIDO hurls herself into the room, utterly panicked.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Papaa...should he not have wished
dialog: to SEE me before deciding?
text: She throws her hands up woefully, and finds another face
text: staring back at her - It is JOHN DAVINIER. He regards her
text: from a huge law book. She stands mortified.
speaker_heading: DIDO (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Lord M)
dialog: I am sorry...I did not know you...
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: (dry)
dialog: Mr Davinier, I believe you have
dialog: already had the pleasure.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (ironic)
dialog: In...some way - yes.
speaker_heading: (to DIDO)
dialog: Miss Lindsay.
text: She curtseys, brief and stiff - a smile to match.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Decide what?
text: She is hesitant now, awkward in JOHN'S presence.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: If he should...should WANT to
dialog: paint me!
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: The man is to be paid a fortune.
dialog: What is there to decide?
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Dido, you are to simply sit
dialog: still. Not a challenging task!
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: (anxious)
dialog: Next...next to Elizabeth...?
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: As you always are - right beside
dialog: one another.
text: DIDO's chest heaves with distress.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Should...should not any lady be
dialog: flattered to be such a subject?
text: His tone is impatient, irritating her.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: How should any male know the ways
dialog: of a lady when he has not even
dialog: mastered the ways of a gentleman?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Quite! Though one should be
dialog: forgiven for thinking he was in
dialog: the presence of a lady - when she
dialog: is, in fact, still a juvenile!
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Papaa, may we do this in private!
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Not now, no! You may return the
dialog: books to the library.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Papaa...!
dialog: 25.
text: LORD MANSFIELD casts her a stare and she is silenced.
text: DIDO begins collecting giant hardbacks, exasperated.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Upon her husband's death a widow
dialog: may receive....
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: ...her marriage portion and
dialog: inheritance at once. She has forty
dialog: days to leave her husband's home...
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Hummm...
dialog: (contemplation)
dialog: Yours are grand ambitions.
text: JOHN says nothing - swallows hard. DIDO steals a glance.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: What is the purpose of the law in
dialog: your eyes, Mr Davinier?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: To... to provide certainty where
dialog: there might otherwise be none.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Example.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: The Zong ship and those drowned.
text: LORD MANSFIELD stiffens. He looks uncomfortably at DIDO
text: piling books. JOHN'S eyes follow.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: It is one of the few trades
dialog: acceptable to a gentleman.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I am no member of the nobility -
dialog: I have little, but...where my
dialog: father relies on the bible, I...I
dialog: wish to rely on the law courts.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: You aspire to the judiciary?
text: LORD MANSFIELD laughs at him. DIDO stares at the ground -
text: cringing on JOHN'S behalf. John asserts himself.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: One day...yes...m'lord. I wish to
dialog: make the laws not only administer
dialog: them - for that...that is how I may
dialog: truly change this world. I mean to
dialog: say, make it... a better place.
dialog: 26.
text: A beat. His words force DIDO to look up, affected.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Noble if not pompous! A country
dialog: lawyer, you may make - perhaps! If
dialog: you pay every regard to what you
dialog: are taught - but you have neither
dialog: the rank nor finances for any more!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (tentative)
dialog: If I may, m'lord - neither did you!
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Well...as a fourth son, you had
dialog: rank but not the income to pay for
dialog: your qualification to the Inns.
text: DIDO's wide eyes take in JOHN, astonished by his chuzpah.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Without the sponsorship of Lord
dialog: Foley and William Hamilton...the
dialog: English courts may not have
dialog: benefited from your brilliance -
dialog: and the title, Lord Chief Justice
dialog: could not be yours today...M'lord.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: You believe you are worthy of
dialog: such considerations? Such are
dialog: your capabilities?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That I do not know, M'lord. I
dialog: have not yet been afforded those
dialog: considerations...but I know a
dialog: country life does not suit me.
text: LORD MANSFIELD's gaze is trained on JOHN. DIDO has finished
text: gathering the books and is quietly slipping from the room.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: The Reverend has requested I take
dialog: his son into my tutorage, Dido.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: What do you think?
text: DIDO freezes, in the doorway - all eyes locked on her.
scene_heading: 31 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. GALLERY - NIGHT. 5 31 *
text: DIDO moves along the hallway, lined with enormous artists' *
text: interpretations, communicating a certain lifestyle.
dialog: 27.
text: She slows, caught by one of the paintings - an English rose
text: stares out, as a black domestic submissively fastens a
text: priceless bracelet around her lady-master's wrist.
text: DIDO's POV: CLOSE on the domestic. Suddenly...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Thank you for your gracious
dialog: support.
text: DIDO jumps - finds JOHN standing beside her.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: I neither spoke for or against
dialog: you - since neither is my place.
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: Silence speaks volumes.
text: Elizabeth approaches, calls out, as she curtseys.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Papaa's new student.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Indeed!
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Mr Davinier, my cousin, Elizabeth.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: A pleasure.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: (to John)
dialog: Papaa has never taken a pupil,
dialog: you realise?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Someone to keep you company while
dialog: you take Papaa's dictation, Dido.
dialog: (to John)
dialog: Truth is, there have been more of
dialog: your sex at Kenwood this week,
dialog: than I've previously seen in all
dialog: my entire life!
text: DIDO flushes.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Hopefully we have not disappointed!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: On the contrary!
text: She raises a minxish eyebrow and moves off. Awkward silence.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Mr Davinier, what...what is the
dialog: importance of the Zong... why is
dialog: the case before Papaa's court,
dialog: the supreme court...?
text: He searches her, taken aback. Why is she asking him?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Well...
dialog: (he struggles, tentative)
text: It is a cargo ship.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: I...I am aware of that.
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: A human-cargo ship.
text: DIDO hesitates, tentative.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Oh. You said those who were
dialog: drowned.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It lost most of its slaves before
text: arriving at its destination.
dialog: (hesitant)
dialog: Drowned - by the crew on the
dialog: captain's order.
text: JOHN watches as DIDO falters.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: But...why?
text: The SOUND of the MANSFIELDS gathering with the ASHFORDS. A
text: maid approaches hurrying about her duties.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: Miss, your supper is served
text: now in the ladies' parlour.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Thank you.
text: JOHN hesitates, struck with confusion at the maid's words.
text: DIDO becomes awkward. LADY MANSFIELD emerges, disappearing
text: into the dining room.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: Mr Davinier, will you be joining
dialog: us for dinner?
text: JOHN's eyes dart to DIDO - sees her unease. It pierces him.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I..er...I thank you, Madam, but I
dialog: am promised to the company of my
dialog: aunt this evening. She has recently
dialog: moved to the cottage at Belsize.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: Of course - as you wish.
text: She moves off, and DIDO and JOHN are left in tense silence.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Permit me to ask, why you do not
dialog: dine with your family - ever?
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: That is not correct.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Forgive me...but twice now I have
dialog: seen...I have seen you separated
text: from the gathering.
text: DIDO's cheeks begin to burn.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: I am confounded.
text: DIDO snaps, her shame over-spilling...
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: And well you might be - when the
dialog: son of clergy is permitted to the
text: table before a lady of the house.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Is that a reminder of my place,
dialog: Miss Lindsay?
text: She holds back frustrated tears, pained.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: No. It's a statement of mine!
text: Both of them are smarting. JOHN moves off, stung.
scene_heading: 32 EXT. KENWOOD HOUSE. DIDO AND ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.5 32 *
text: DIDO steps into the room, expressionless. She sits on the
text: chaise longue, allows her gaze to settle on her reflection.
text: Something terrible resonates through her - some awful
dialog: thought or feeling, that leaves her breathless with
text: emotion. And then her fingers come up to the skin on her
text: chest...and she begins to pinch and pull with self-hatred,
text: rubbing the heel of her palm across her cheek, her
text: forehead, as her face crumples and she begins to cry.
dialog: 30.
scene_heading: 33 EXT. HAMPSTEAD. HEATH. DAY. 6 33 *
text: New day. LORD MANSFIELD and JOHN ride through Kenwood's
text: lands on horseback, slowing under the shade of trees.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (he pats his animal)
dialog: There is much speculation on your
dialog: decision. Anticipation seems to
dialog: be turning to panic, m'lord.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: I cannot disagree.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: One hundred and thirty two drowned
dialog: on route from Africa to the West
dialog: Indies. Your ruling could bring
dialog: the slave trade to its knees -
dialog: entirely destroy an economic
dialog: foundation of these lands.
dialog: (off Mansfield)
dialog: Is that pressure not maddening,
dialog: m'lord?
text: LORD MANSFIELD reigns in his horse. He quotes in Latin.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Justitia fiat, ruat coelum, Mr
dialog: Davinier - Let justice be done,
dialog: though the heavens may fall.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: The insurance claim states, the
dialog: slaves were thrown overboard for
dialog: the safety of the ship - that
dialog: there wasn't sufficient water for
dialog: the cargo and crew to survive the
dialog: rest of the voyage.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: It does.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Then, if I am correct, the case
dialog: hangs on...
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: ...IT HANGS on `Absolute
dialog: necessity'. If the cargo was
dialog: spoiled...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Cargo?
text: LORD MANSFIELD adjusts his language.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: If the killing of the..'negros' was
dialog: truly `necessary' in order to save
text: the ship - as the captain contends.
text: A difficult silence. JOHN is careful, but sceptical.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: But...is that where it hinges?
text: LORD MANSFIELD does not welcome the challenge.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
text: The ship's journey was thwarted
dialog: by impossible weather conditions -
dialog: what should have been weeks
dialog: became months! What once appeared
dialog: enough water, may not have been!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I am sensible of this, m'lord...
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Then do you know what a hundred
dialog: thirsty slaves are capable of? I
dialog: can tell you no man happily
text: disposes of his cargo, even in
dialog: the face of rebellion!
dialog: (Off John's silence)
dialog: So now tell me - were you to
text: dock at port with barely a piece
dialog: of merchandise left to trade -
dialog: what would you do? Swallow
dialog: financial ruin - or claim your
dialog: due from the insurers.
dialog: John is conflicted - to speak up, or not?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: With due respect... I should
dialog: question, whether 'human' life
dialog: should have been insurable as
dialog: cargo - at all.
text: The air turns cold.
scene_heading: 34 EXT. KENWOOD GARDENS. DAY. 6 34 *
text: LADY MARY clips flowers from a bush of sunset pink Dahlias.
text: DIDO holds a basket, collecting them. LADY MANSFIELD and
text: ELIZABETH stroll beneath parasols.
text: LORD MANSFIELD and JOHN can be seen approaching the stables
text: on horseback - JOHN trailing.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: LADY MARY
dialog: A gentleman rather like him once
dialog: paid me much interest.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Mr Davinier?
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: (matter of fact.)
dialog: Really, Mary?
text: DIDO lays each Dahlia carefully.
speaker_heading: LADY MARY
dialog: Do not look at me like that! It was
dialog: my Mamaa who intervened. I thought
dialog: he had a very great sense of duty.
dialog: Overly kind at times but...
text: LADY MANSFIELD watches as though she knows the rest.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: (gently)
dialog: But...what, Aunt Mary?
text: LADY MARY hesitates and LADY MANSFIELD cuts in, saving her.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: HE is engaged, you know?
text: DIDO follows her gaze to JOHN, as he climbs from the horse,
text: hands it to a STABLEMAN.
speaker_heading: LADY MARY
dialog: Engaged!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Is he?
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: Mr Beresford's daughter.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: The carriage-maker! He might have
dialog: set his sights a little higher!
text: AS JOHN marches toward the back entrance of the house. He
text: nods to the ladies. A self-conscious beat between he and
text: DIDO, her back to him - as he disappears inside.
dialog: OFF her reaction.
scene_heading: 35 INT. KENWOOD STUDIO. DAY. 7 35 *
text: CLOSE ON: the soft curls around DIDO'S hairline, a single
text: eye, her nose, cheek. HOLD on her lips.
dialog: 33.
text: ON the painter's canvas...a sketch emerging - he brings
text: DIDO'S mouth to life. We see an outline of ELIZABETH with
text: some detail, already been created.
text: REVEAL ELIZABETH beside DIDO. As her hand slides over to
text: DIDO'S and she squeezes it tight.
text: ON their clasped hands.
speaker_heading: ZOFFANY
dialog: To the window, Miss Lindsay
text: DIDO favours the window a little more...Soft sunlight pours
text: onto her skin.
scene_heading: 36 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. CORRIDORS/STUDIO. DAY. 7 36 *
text: JOHN moves through corridors - hat under his arm. ELIZABETH
text: emerges from the studio, drawing his attention to...
text: Through a half open doorway, his POV: DIDO sits on stool
text: before ZOFFANY. The sight draws JOHN to a halt.
text: He attempts to move off - but cant! He observes DIDO
text: quietly. She is somehow tranquil under Zoffany's gaze.
text: A beat before her eyes fall on JOHN'S outline in the
text: doorway - his stare, penetrating and compelling.
text: ON ZOFFANY - he follows DIDO'S gaze to JOHN. Then he
text: sketches madly, filling in DIDO'S eyes in great detail.
text: ON JOHN, embarrassed - he moves away quickly. DIDO is
text: affected. She jumps up! Goes after him!
text: As ELIZABETH'S eyes follow, uncertain.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Wait...
text: She is upon him in the CORRIDOR! They stand silent, awkward.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I...I was curious...
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Quite a task - to sit for so many *
dialog: hours...(beat)...
dialog: Congratulations! I learned of
dialog: your..your match..yesterday. *
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Thank you.
text: He falters slightly, swallows hard - not all is well.
dialog: 34.
text: Her eyes hone in on a pamphlet under his arm. JOHN shifts
text: uneasy at what it shows - the last few letters of THE ZONG
text: can be seen, and LORD MANSFIELD depicted with large butt.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: I appear the only one to have
dialog: just learned of this affair?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Perhaps yours is a life less
dialog: concerned with such matters.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Why do you judge me so?
text: He studies her. She is tentative.
speaker_heading: DIDO (CONT'D)
dialog: It is a fact that I have
dialog: contemplated on the matter for
dialog: many hours, and I...I do not
dialog: think the slaves could have been
dialog: drowned in the way you say.
text: ON his disbelief - irritation slowly turns to dawning.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Are you at utter disconnect from
dialog: everything?!
text: He searches her, making her feel very small and ashamed. As
text: he moves off, she stares after him, distressed.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Mr Davinier...please. Tell me.
dialog: Tell me what you know!
text: He stops, stares back at her. What to do?
speaker_heading: DIDO (CONT'D)
dialog: (earnest)
dialog: Do not render me your amusement.
text: He traces her vulnerability. It roots him.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I can only tell you what I believe.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: (trying to understand)
dialog: And what...what is that?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: The slaves were intentionally
dialog: drowned, that is not in question.
dialog: Chained! Thrown into the waters -
text: chained together as one.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: They were diseased - worth more as
dialog: dead insured merchandise, than as
dialog: alive spoiled goods.
dialog: (stark)
dialog: The captain hoped it would `pay'
dialog: to kill them.
text: ON DIDO as colour drains from her face. Nausea rises...
text: His eyes try to read hers, becoming sensitive. As he moves
text: back towards her. She struggles to take it in.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Miss Lindsay....?
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: But the insurers are appealing.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Yes. They are challenging the
dialog: decision of the lower court -
dialog: refusing to pay for murdered
dialog: slaves.
text: Her eyes sting. JOHN can see she is having difficulty - he
text: touches her hand absentmindedly, startling her, but their
text: eyes remain locked. She attempts, weakly, to return self-
text: possession. Then almost a whisper...
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: That is, thank you for telling me what nobody else has!
text: She turns, walks away. ON DIDO, as her pace quickens.
scene_heading: 37 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LORD MANSFIELD'S STUDY. DAY. 7 37 *
text: ON DIDO, urgently rifling through files, shelves - chaotic.
text: She moves to a desk, pulls open drawers - REVEAL volumes
text: and volumes of news pamphlets. A set of them bound, LORD
text: MANSFIELD'S wax seal hanging from the cord. She unties the
text: cord, wax seal all over her hands. She fingers her way
text: through the pile - legal headlines...all referring to Lord
text: Mansfield. She stops dead...
text: POV - pamphlet cover...image of LORD MANSFIELD, drooping
text: bottom lip touching the ground - foolish and dithering,
text: whilst beside him a `Negro' slave wields a judge's' gavel.
text: A headline - `Slave Cargo Deliberately Drowned to save ship
text: - Mansfield Dithers on Zong Insurance'. DIDO stares hard...
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Papaa.
dialog: 36.
text: She runs her fingers across the caricature, pained - then
text: moves urgently to the next pamphlet, and the next...
text: More MANSFIELD caricatures - a big nose, fat lips, all with
dialog: Zong headlines:'Mansfield to Rule on "Disposable Slaves" `
text: The library door suddenly opens, jolting DIDO.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: There you are!
text: DIDO is frozen, says nothing. ELIZABETH stares from the
dialog: doorway - why does DIDO look so strange?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: We are requested. You - drawing room.
dialog: I, relegated to the ladies' Palour!
text: She disappears leaving DIDO bewildered.
scene_heading: 38 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LADIES' PARLOUR. DAY. 7 38 *
text: ELIZABETH stands before LADY MANSFIELD.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: We are to attend London for the

text: ELIZABETH'S eyes are wide.
scene_heading: 39 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM - DAY. 7 39 *
text: DIDO mirrors ELIZABETH.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: We are to finally `come out'??
text: LORD MANSFIELD stares back at her.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: (clarifying)
dialog: Elizabeth is to come out.
scene_heading: 40 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LADIES' PARLOUR - DAY. 7 40 *
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: Dido is not.
text: ELIZABETH'S face falls.
scene_heading: 41 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM - CONTINUOUS. DAY. 7 41 *
text: LORD MANSFIELD stares solemnly at DIDO.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: But why?
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: You understand the ways of this
dialog: world for a female, Dido.
dialog: Elizabeth has no income. When all
dialog: this is gone to her father, I
dialog: have nothing to leave her.
scene_heading: 42 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LADIES PARLOUR - DAY. 7 42 *
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: You are to meet as many gentlemen as

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Oh!
scene_heading: 43 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. DAY. 7 43 *
text: DIDO is speechless.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: And me?
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Dido, you are well taken care of -
dialog: Of this, you are well aware.
scene_heading: 44 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LADIES' PARLOUR - DAY.7 44 *
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: A gentleman of good breeding is
dialog: unlikely to form any serious
dialog: attachment to Dido, and a man
dialog: without, will lower her position
dialog: in society.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: But she is not merely my cousin,
dialog: Mamaa, she is my sister. I
dialog: cannot attend London without her!
scene_heading: 45 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM - DAY.7 45 *
text: DIDO'S gaze is pained.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: You may attend London together to

dialog: pain of a few weeks separation.
dialog: 38.
scene_heading: 46 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LADIES' PARLOUR. DAY.7 46 *

scene_heading: 47 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM - DAY.7 47 *
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Papaa...
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: You are not to be denied, Dido.
text: He looks down. DIDO'S eyes follow to a large bunch of keys.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Papaa, please!
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: These are the keys to the house.
dialog: They have hung at the waist of your
dialog: aunt for the last thirty years.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: (horrified)
dialog: No! I am not Lady Mary. I am not
dialog: an unwanted maid!
text: LORD MANSFIELD feels no choice but to go on.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Lady Mary is too old to continue
dialog: in charge of the house.
text: He places the keys in her hand and closes her fingers.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: You may assume her duties on your
dialog: return. A most respectable position
dialog: for an unmarried Mansfield Lady.
text: She stares at him, disbelieving, bereft...
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Are...are you punishing me?
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Punishing you!! Dido, you are
dialog: most cherished. Most loved. Why
dialog: ...why would you say such a thing?
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Because...
dialog: 39.
text: She tries to find courage to speak. LORD MANSFIELD waits.
speaker_heading: DIDO (CONT'D)
dialog: Because ...
text: She swallows hard...loses courage...
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Because what?
text: A moment. He looks down, sees the bright red wax from his
text: seal on her fingers. ON his slow dawning. Ominous beat.
scene_heading: 48 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. GROUND FLOOR CORRIDORS - DAY.7 48 *
text: ELIZABETH steps from the ladies' parlour - DIDO from the
text: drawing room, winded with emotion. As they fall into each
text: other's arms, weeping...
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I am sorry, Dido. So very sorry.
scene_heading: 49 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. DAY. 7 49 *
text: LORD MANSFIELD stands alone restraining his tears.
scene_heading: 50 INT. KENWOOD. LORD MANSFIELD'S STUDY. DAY. 8 50 *
text: LORD MANSFIELD's eyes are wild. JOHN stands before him.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: You told her they were wantonly
dialog: drowned.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Because they were! Those slaves
dialog: were diseased - some were already
dialog: dying - yes. But it was essential
dialog: they die ON the journey or they
dialog: would not come under insurance
dialog: consideration! Neither too, if
dialog: they had expired of their diseases
dialog: - That is why they were killed -
dialog: this we all know!
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: You have entered my home and
dialog: utterly taken advantage of the
dialog: confidential matters afforded you.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: These `matters' have been for
dialog: public consumption for months.
dialog: Miss Lindsay is no child...no..
dialog: fool!
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: (incandescent)
dialog: Her precious care is in my hands
dialog: and I will decide when she is
dialog: ready for such realities. Not the
dialog: son of a vicar! A vicar who,
dialog: incidently purchased his living
dialog: from me!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I shall gather my belongings.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Do so!
text: LORD MANSFIELD turns his back on JOHN to glare at the lawns
text: JOHN calmly collects his books, jacket, hat. He hesitates.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Your Lordship, a question?
text: LORD MANSFIELD swings round ready to bite..
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: WHAT, Mr Davinier!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: As the mere son of a vicar - I
dialog: wonder whether the value you
dialog: extend to your very precious
dialog: mulatto niece - well I wonder if
dialog: it amounts to MORE...or LESS than
dialog: the thirty pounds insurance the
dialog: traders are asking for each life
dialog: they murdered?
text: ON LORD MANSFIELD'S cold stare. He swallows hard.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Good day, M'lord.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Mr Davinier.
text: JOHN stops, turns to LORD MANSFIELD.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: A word to the wise. Find yourself
dialog: in her vicinity again, and you will
dialog: rue the day you cast eyes on me.
text: JOHN hesitates a beat. Then he is gone.
scene_heading: 51 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LADIES PARLOUR. DAY. 8 51 *
text: ELIZABETH catches sight of JOHN riding across the heath.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: John Davinier is leaving very
dialog: early today!
text: DIDO moves to the window. Her POV: JOHN on horseback as he
text: disappears over the brow.
text: ELIZABETH, LADIES MANSFIELD and MARY watch as LORD
text: MANSFIELD storms past the doorway.- all is not well, they
dialog: can tell.
text: LORD MANSFIELD's gaze locks with DIDO through the doorway -
text: he falters, moves on.
text: OFF DIDO's realisation - JOHN is not coming back .
scene_heading: 52 EXT. HAMPSTEAD - DAY 9 52 *
text: CLOSE ON hooves - the Mansfield carriage is on the move to
text: London. The familiar lush horizon provides the backdrop.
text: ON the luggage-laden carriage - the girls whisper.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (OOV)
dialog: Do you think I may see Mr James
dialog: in town?
speaker_heading: DIDO (O.C.)
dialog: Perhaps.
scene_heading: 53 INT. MANSFIELD CARRIAGE. CONTINUOUS DAY. 9 53 *
text: ELIZABETH whispers to DIDO, completely matter of fact.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I could fall in love with such a
dialog: man, Dido.
speaker_heading: LADY MARY
dialog: Love?
text: The two girls are startled. LADY MARY smiles to herself.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Bette, you could feel no such
dialog: sentiment for you should either
dialog: end poor or... broken hearted.
scene_heading: 54 EXT. LONDON STREETS. DAY. 9 54 *
text: The carriage rounds a corner, weaves through the bustle of
text: markets, peasants, guided by HARRY, the MANSFIELD driver.
text: ON DIDO's face, staring from the moving carriage.
dialog: 42.
scene_heading: 55 EXT. LONDON STREETS. DAY. 9 55 *
text: Bloomsbury Square opens before us. As the carriage halts...
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (O.C)
dialog: Aren't you quietly relieved?
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Relieved?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: That you shan't be at the caprice
dialog: of some silly Sir and his fortune!
dialog: (off Dido's silence)
dialog: The rest of us haven't the choice!
dialog: Not a chance of inheritance if
dialog: we have brothers and forbidden
dialog: from any activity that allows us to
dialog: support ourselves.
text: ELIZABETH sighs.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: (c'est la vie)
dialog: We are but their property.
speaker_heading: OFF DIDO, affected.
scene_heading: 56 INT./EXT. BLOOMSBURY SQUARE ENTRANCE HALL - DAY. 9 56 *
text: LIBBY, the housekeeper and THOMAS, the butler stand on

text: ON DIDO as her gaze falls on MABEL (20), a black maid
text: helping ELIZABETH with her hat. A beat as DIDO stiffens.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: Light the fires for dinner, will
dialog: you, Thomas.
text: ON MABEL as she catches DIDO'S stare, forcing DIDO to avert
text: her gaze quickly, turning her back to distance herself.
scene_heading: 57 INT. BLOOMSBURY SQ. DIDO AND ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.9 57 *
text: The soft light of oil lamps.
text: DIDO, in night-clothes, drags a brush through tight
text: ringlets. She stops, observes, a moment as ELIZABETH runs a
text: comb through her own silken hair.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: You are so beautiful, Bette.
dialog: I hope your match is the most
dialog: wonderful of all gentlemen.
dialog: 43.
text: ON ELIZABETH wide eyed, then moved as her eyes brim.
text: A tentative knock and MABEL enters - DIDO becomes tense.
text: MABEL speaks gently - strong Welsh accent.
speaker_heading: MABEL
dialog: Some bed socks for you, Miss
dialog: Murray, Miss Lindsay. It's not as
dialog: warm as we hoped tonight
text: She hands a pair each to the girls.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH,
dialog: Thank you Mabel...How kind.
text: MABEL pauses as DIDO struggles with her hair.
speaker_heading: MABEL
dialog: Can I help you with that, Miss
dialog: Lindsay?
text: ON DIDO, self-conscious under MABEL'S stare.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Mabel, I am fine - thank you!
text: She struggles once again, wrenching the brush.
speaker_heading: MABEL
dialog: You must start from the ends, miss.
text: DIDO stares at her - a long beat.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Candle lit faces... DIDO's reflection in the mirror - her
text: hair separated into four sections.
text: In the reflection BG, ELIZABETH sits serenely watching
text: MABEL brushing through each section from ends to roots.
speaker_heading: MABEL (CONT'D)
dialog: My Mam taught me, see?
text: DIDO stares at her a moment, some kind of pain resonates in
text: her eyes as her face softens and she begins to relax.
scene_heading: 58 EXT. MAYFAIR. ASHFORD HOME. DAY.10 58 *
text: The four MANSFIELD ladies step from the carriage. Before
text: them, a huge Georgian home. All four take it in.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: Promise me you will change that
dialog: vulgar teal paint, if you ever
dialog: become lady of this home. It is
text: positively wanting, Elizabeth.
dialog: 44.
scene_heading: 59 EXT. MAYFAIR. ASHFORD HOME. GARDENS. DAY.10 59 *
text: A sophisticated landscape, very much in keeping with LADY
text: ASHFORD'S sense of style.
text: A maid steps out - LADY MANSFIELD follows with the four
text: Mansfield women. ELIZABETH beams.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: Lady Mansfield, LADY MARY and
dialog: their nieces, Madam.
text: LADY ASHFORD moves towards them, face bright with ambition.
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: Ladies.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: Lady Ashford.
text: The girls curtsey.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: And the gentlemen? Mr James?
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: (reassuring)
dialog: Here, of course. Very little could
dialog: have prevented him, knowing that
dialog: Miss Murray would visit today.
text: ELIZABETH could burst. She looks up to see JAMES and
text: OLIVER approach from the North side of the gardens.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The ladies sip drinks as LORD ASHFORD appears from the
text: house, a man with presence (50s) cultivated and astute.
text: He moves to OLIVER, observing DIDO, under a nearby tree.
speaker_heading: LORD ASHFORD
dialog: Lord Mansfield's infamous Mulatto.
dialog: No wonder our `Lord Chief Justice
dialog: knows not whether he is coming or
dialog: going! Not your usual game, Oliver.
text: OLIVER examines his father.
speaker_heading: LORD ASHFORD (CONT'D)
dialog: She can not know your thoughts
dialog: unless you offer them to her.
text: He moves off, leaving OLIVER pensive.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: LORD ASHFORD (CONT'D)
dialog: The ladies Mansfield! As sweet on
dialog: the eye as the freshest flowers
dialog: in bloom....
dialog: (off Lady M's laughter)
dialog: What is in those glasses?
text: ON OLIVER as he moves to the pond. In the BG...
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: Grenadine syrup...
speaker_heading: LADY MARY
dialog: And port!!
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: Which has gone to my head already!
text: ELIZABETH is knelt at the pond's edge with JAMES - a paper
text: boat floats on the water, toppling over to a unanimous cry.
text: OLIVER watches as DIDO approaches. His eyes light up.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Oh Dido look - Mr James has made
dialog: me a boat and it has capsized.
text: JAMES stretches a branch into the lake to rescue the boat.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: What a dreadful shame.
text: OLIVER collects paper from the grass. CLOSE on his hands as
text: he folds it into a boat under DIDO'S nose.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (to DIDO, earnest)
dialog: For you.
text: She smiles, can't help being charmed.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Thank you.
text: He places it in the water, stands and examines DIDO. From
text: afar, LADY MANSFIELD watches.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Miss Lindsay, would you do me the
dialog: honour of taking some air with
dialog: me, some time?
text: DIDO is dumbstruck - what to say? JAMES is halted.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Don't you care what people will say
dialog: 46.
text: DIDO is jolted by the antangonism in JAMES' tone -
text: ELIZABETH too - it pierces her and she speaks up.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: What is that to mean Mr James?
dialog: What should anyone say?!
text: JAMES hesitates, then...
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: That he should compromise a
dialog: lady's reputation by stepping out
dialog: with her - scarcely having made
dialog: her acquaintance!
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I think you are a great deal too
dialog: anxious, brother. We should merely
text: take a turn around Vauxhall.
text: DIDO observes JAMES - His protestation is bitter. She
text: traces OLIVER'S features, warmly.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: I should be delighted, Mr Oliver!
dialog: Most delighted.
scene_heading: 60 INT. MANSFIELD CARRIAGE. LONDON STREETS. DAY.10 60 *
text: On the move through London streets. LADIES MANSFIELD and

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Are you really to defy Papaa?
text: DIDO says nothing, turns to stare out of the window.
scene_heading: 61 EXT. VAUXHALL PLEASURE GARDENS. DUSK/NIGHT.11 61 *
text: Teaming with parasols, fountains, and hidden pathways.
text: 61.1: JAMES and ELIZABETH stroll, followed by DIDO and
text: OLIVER, then, LADIES MANSFIELD, MARY, and ASHFORD.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: (re. Dido with Oliver)
dialog: I am not at ease with this.
dialog: Lord Mansfield would be most
dialog: aggrieved.
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: Oh it can do no harm. This is
text: simply two families, enjoying a
dialog: day together.
text: LADY MANSFIELD takes an unhappy breath, burdened.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD (CONT'D)
dialog: Though surely...IF a desirable
dialog: match were a ... certain...
dialog: possibility your dear husband could
dialog: have no objections, could he?
text: LADY MANSFIELD, turns slowly to regard LADY ASHFORD,
text: aroused by the insinuation and alarmed at the same time.
text: She looks back to DIDO and OLIVER, wide eyed.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Well I did not think I would ever
dialog: find a lady who was not to be
dialog: conquered or ignored...Until you.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Ah now how do I know this is not
dialog: just another tactic in your
dialog: battle to conquer?
text: He stops, takes her hand and places it on in his chest.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: See how my heart beats.
text: She lets her hand rest a moment.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: I am utterly taken with you, Miss
dialog: Lindsay.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Despite...such pronounced
dialog: protestations from your brother?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: He cannot overlook your mother's
dialog: origins, as I do. Foolish. Why
dialog: should anyone even pay her regard
dialog: when your better half has equipped
dialog: you so well with loveliness and
dialog: privilege.
text: Dido is stung. OLIVER shrugs, oblivious. The sound of Handel
text: filters from a nearby concert. DIDO tries hard to recover.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: What a lovely sound.
text: He smiles at her, studies her...mischievous...
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: You are unrelentingly cultured.
dialog: Come, let's find it!
text: He takes her waist spinning her round with him into another
text: pathway, disappearing from the others, giggling as they go.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: People will think she has no family!
scene_heading: LADY ASHFORD.
dialog: People will think they are courting!
text: LADY MANSFIELD and LADY MARY exchange a look. LADY MARY is
text: somehow softened - her eyes appeal to LADY MANSFIELD...
speaker_heading: LADY MARY
dialog: Let her enjoy his society.
text: LADY MANSFIELD is effected - reads MARY'S emotion.
text: 61.2: An open pavilion with classical concert. ON OLIVER
text: and DIDO watching.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I might only have dreamed of
dialog: these moments, at one time.
text: DIDO smiles - allows herself to be flattered.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Really? You are much of the
dialog: conqueror Mr Oliver.
text: He chuckles, brings his hand up to brush her cheek, gently.
text: She smiles just as her eyes fall on the back of a gentleman's
text: head, shoulders - his movement somehow familiar.
text: The sight roots her, uncertain of what she sees. And then
text: he turns to address another, and his profile becomes clear.
speaker_heading: It is JOHN DAVINIER.
text: In that moment, he flicks his head round and his gaze falls
text: on her - a beat between them then his eyes fall on OLIVER.
text: JOHN excuses himself from others and makes his way across.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Miss Lindsay.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: (flushed)
dialog: Mr Davinier. How...how nice to
dialog: see you.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: And you, Miss Lindsay.
text: He looks to OLIVER.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Forgive me - Mr Ashford, may I
dialog: present to you...Mr Davinier.
dialog: (She smiles awkward)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: DIDO (CONT'D)
dialog: He is the son of our Vicar at
dialog: Hampstead, and was..well,
dialog: almost father's pupil...
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: A clergyman!
dialog: (an `off' smile)
dialog: Good day, to you...sir.
text: OLIVER bows, manfully, asserting his greater status.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Sir. (beat) My regards to
dialog: your family, Miss Lindsay.
text: Unexpected hope fills her.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Elizabeth and Mamaa are here...
dialog: in fact.
text: DIDO watches as JOHN nods politely and moves off, returning
text: to his company - male and all of a similar type to him.
text: ON OLIVER, as he takes in JOHN'S effect on DIDO.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: 61.3. The spit and bang of spectacular fireworks. OLIVER
text: stands engrossed as the sky lights up. DIDO looks up at
text: him. She wavers. Then...slowly she backs away from the crowd
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: 61.4 DIDO walks quickly - follows the sound of the concert
text: to find her way back to JOHN.
text: Her POV: JOHN listening diligently to the music. He double
text: takes at the sight of her hovering at the edge of the
text: concert. He stands alarmed, negotiates his way to her.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (dismayed)
dialog: Miss Lindsay, you are alone!!
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: I did not have the chance to see
dialog: you before you left...Mr Davinier
dialog: ...to convey my apologies.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Apologies...?
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Your pupilage. Father would
dialog: never have ended it...you...you
dialog: never would have had to leave
dialog: Kenwood were it not...
dialog: 50.
text: His eyes soften as he looks at her...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: He would make mine a living hell,
dialog: were he to know of us speaking.
text: DIDO tugs him into a quiet lane, away from the concert and
text: promenading.
text: Hardly a breath and BAM!! She is slammed against a walled
text: maze, suddenly!! JOHN pressed against her tightly!
text: Confused, her gaze darts around her, finds LADY MANSFIELD
text: and LADY ASHFORD ambling past along a cross path, oblivious.
text: DIDO freezes - held tightly against JOHN. She stares
text: panicked into his eyes and he into hers.
text: 61.5:CUTAWAY So they do not see ELIZABETH as she strolls by
text: with JAMES - Her gaze falling on JOHN and DIDO, instantly.
text: ELIZABETH is stunned!!!! But doesn't falter.
text: 61.4 CONT'D: As DIDO and JOHN look back - nothing but
text: anonymous strangers, leaving them none the wiser to being
text: discovered. JOHN pulls away, embarrassed...
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Forgive me.
text: She nods, equally bashful. They regard each other.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: What are you doing here in London
dialog: Mr Davinier?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I am under a third cousin - a
dialog: solicitor, here. Nothing more
dialog: than petty disputes between
text: unsavoury landlords and debauched
dialog: tenants, but I cannot discount it.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Not what you wished for.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I haven't given up on The Inns.
dialog: Nothing worth having in life
dialog: comes easily.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: (flushed)
dialog: Where are my manners? I trust
dialog: the future Mrs Davinier is well.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Very well...thank you.
dialog: 51.
text: DIDO is unexpectedly struck - recovers herself.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: I have tried to keep up - with
dialog: the Zong. These past weeks.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (agitated)
dialog: Tis pitiful! Such inability to
dialog: simply know what value to put on
dialog: another's life.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: What price, a worthless Negro.
speaker_heading: JOHN

dialog: You utterly misunderstand me.
dialog: I am saying that no man may have
dialog: the value of that of cargo!!!
dialog: Human beings cannot be priced,
dialog: since we are priceless!! Freemen
dialog: and slaves alike!
text: Her eyes begin to sting at the `integrity' in his words.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: (enthused)
dialog: I am with others here. We are
dialog: all students in law - applying
dialog: pressure on the insurance companies
dialog: to refuse from here on to insure
dialog: slaves on any ship. A simple clause.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: But that would require a change
dialog: of law. I know nothing but...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: A change in law - something the
dialog: insurance companies can lobby for
dialog: IF they can be persuaded to band
dialog: together.
dialog: (softly,)
dialog: We may only be students,
dialog: but...change is most always
text: precipitated by the young.
dialog: (shrugs - poignant)
dialog: Someone has to have the courage.
dialog: How can we expect to be civilised
dialog: if we live in a barbaric world.
text: His words wind her as JOHN shakes his head, frustrated. She
dialog: takes him in - he is so very handsome!
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: It is the utter injustice...the
dialog: industrial slaughter of so many.
text: DIDO stares at him earnestly.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: No. It is more than that. It's
dialog: the shame of a law that would
dialog: uphold a financial transaction
dialog: upon that atrocity.
text: She is scathing and accepting all at once, affecting him.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That is indeed the truth.
text: Their eyes are locked. An intimate beat that perturbs her.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: I have never heard anyone speak
dialog: like you.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Nor I, you, Miss Lindsay.
text: He is emotional, it perturbs him too, now.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: You must return. They will be
dialog: anxious. Should I follow to see
dialog: you safely.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: No we cannot risk it.
text: He nods - studies her....
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Good bye, Miss Lindsay.
dialog: (he pauses)
dialog: I suspect, we will never see each
dialog: other again.
text: The thought strikes DIDO, uneasily.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Good bye, Mr Davinier.
text: She turns, preparing herself.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Miss Lindsay?!!
dialog: (tentative)
dialog: We...commune at the Coaching
dialog: Inn - Kentish Town...most
dialog: evenings..
dialog: 53.
text: He trails off awkwardly. She falters.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Quite.
text: A beat as they regard each other - then she moves off.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 61.6: The whirl of the pleasure gardens...DIDO alone -
text: searching hard for OLIVER or the others. Her pace quickens as
text: a hand comes down on her shoulder, taking her breath away.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I did not dare return to Lady
dialog: Mansfield without you.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: I..I am terribly sorry. I thought
dialog: I saw the others, I went after
dialog: them....and found myself lost.
dialog: OLIVER studies her - she is so nervous...what is she
text: hiding? A moment - then his eyes become forgiving.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: 61.7 ON LADIES MANSFIELD, MARY, ASHFORD, seated on a bench.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: It's almost dark!
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: Look, here are James and Miss Murray.
text: ELIZABETH and JAMES approach, sit on the bench opposite.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I do hope you know how well I
dialog: think of you.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: As I do you.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Then I hope, Sir, you plan to honour
dialog: your attentions...as not to would
dialog: leave me looking... quite foolish.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: And I should not call myself a
dialog: gentleman!
text: Satisfaction washes over her. As DIDO and OLIVER appear, LADY *
text: MANSFIELD lets our a cry of relief, goes to say something - *
text: LADY ASHFORD lays a finger across LADY MANSFIELD's lips. *
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: Say nothing! This has all been
dialog: for the good of the future, I
dialog: assure you!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: 61.8: The two couples and ladies stroll back to the carriages.
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD (CONT'D)
dialog: Elizabeth is a determined spirit.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: She is.
text: They stare at the couple ahead.
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: She will need a gentleman who
dialog: can temper her. Quite a task.
text: She fixes on LADY MANSFIELD, lets her eyes do the talking...
text: LADY MANSFIELD exchanges a look with LADY MARY.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: (to Lady Ashford)
dialog: Do I sense that an address is
dialog: finally to be made?
text: LADY ASHFORD goes carefully...
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: She is an exquisite girl...
dialog: (with relish)
dialog: And...since there is no male heir
dialog: and...it will therefore fall upon
dialog: Elizabeth and her husband to
dialog: eventually inherit all of Kenwood
dialog: and its lands...
text: Colour drains from LADY MANSFIELD. LADY MARY closes her
text: eyes, dismayed.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: Lady Ashford, may I...
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: ...I realise there will be no end
dialog: of worthy addresses to consider.
text: ON LADY MANSFIELD as she too closes her eyes at the strain.
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD (CONT'D)
dialog: My dear? Lady Mansfield, what is it?
dialog: 55.
scene_heading: 62 INT. ASHFORD CARRIAGE - NIGHT.11 62 *
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Penniless?
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: (disgusted)
dialog: Without an inch of property, or
dialog: shilling to her name!
text: OLIVER chuckles. LADY ASHFORD rests her hand on JAMES' knee.
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD (CONT'D)
dialog: Your situation can attract so
dialog: much better, James. She brings
dialog: nothing but name. A real lady is
dialog: blessed with SO much more.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (sardonic)
dialog: Do you hear that, James? A lady's
dialog: good breeding alone will not do!
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: (to Oliver)
dialog: Your brother needs a wife who
dialog: will bring him further land!
dialog: LOTS!... if he is ever to exert
dialog: more political influence than your
dialog: father has.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: But what of her own father?
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: The Seventh Viscount Stormont is a
text: scoundrel. Ensconced in Vienna
dialog: with the girl's vicious step-mamaa
dialog: and his new offspring - who I am
dialog: told is to inherit EVERYTHING.
text: She shakes her head, stares through the carriage window.
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD (CONT'D)
dialog: I must say, pen-ni-less!
text: Thankfully her cousin is not.
dialog: It is true that on each occasion
dialog: I lay eyes upon that girl, she
text: becomes more beautiful.
text: OLIVER shifts, perturbed - DIDO, indeed, on his mind.
speaker_heading: JAMES
text: She has the colouring of a farmer.
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: James, we do not talk about that,
dialog: any longer.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Is this really the very best you
dialog: aspire to, Oliver? To introduce
dialog: some woman of obscure birth into
dialog: the family lineage?
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: James - you are my first boy -
dialog: blessed by law to inherit your
dialog: father's wealth. Be sympathetic
dialog: to your brother. Like the
dialog: unfortunate Miss Murray - a good
dialog: family name and empty pockets
dialog: will only get him so far!!
text: OLIVER closes his eyes, privately humiliated.
scene_heading: 63 INT/EXT. BLOOMSBURY SQ. DRAWING ROOM - DAY.12 63 *

speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: Good heavens, Lord Mansfield has
dialog: arrived a day early!

text: MABEL smiles privately at DIDO as she lays some bread on

text: DIDO looks to the newly arrived LORD MANSFIELD, as he sits.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: (facetious)
dialog: Is Mabel a slave?
text: LADY MANSFIELD almost chokes on her porridge.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: I beg your pardon?
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Is-Mabel-a-slave!
text: LORD MANSFIELD swallows hard, his jaw tightens.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: She is free and under our protection.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: (twice as facetious)
dialog: O! Like me!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Hardly, Dido!
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: And paid a very respectable wage.
text: DIDO takes a mouthful of breakfast, goads her father further.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: How is the fraud appeal Papaa?
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Fraud?
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: The marine insurance. It is a
dialog: Fraud case, is it not?
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: That would depend on to whom you
dialog: may speak.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: To cull your `cargo'? To do it
dialog: solely to claim insurance because
dialog: it was too diseased to achieve a
dialog: good price at market? If not
dialog: fraud, then what?
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Do you speak on my behalf, Dido?
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: Oh will you please stop!
text: She slams down her napkin.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: This is a vulgar subject to be
dialog: discussing at breakfast
text: DIDO and LORD MANSFIELD are locked in a stand-off.
text: A bitter silence. LADY MARY ventures to change the subject.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: LADY MARY
dialog: I learned yesterday that Mr
text: Davinier is in town.
text: DIDO stiffens. ELIZABETH stares across at her, privately.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
text: Makes sense. Dido is beginning
dialog: to sound very much like him.
text: DIDO has lost her appetite.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Excuse me.
text: She gets up and is gone.
scene_heading: 66 INT. LORD MANSFIELD'S LONDON CHAMBERS. HALLWAYS DAY.13 66 *
text: LORD MANSFIELD moves through hallways, robed, wigged, his
text: full authority apparent. LORD ASHFORD walks beside him.
speaker_heading: LORD ASHFORD
dialog: I had the pleasure of laying eyes
dialog: on your adopted girl.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: (facetious)
dialog: Which one?
speaker_heading: LORD ASHFORD
dialog: You have raised a lovely young
dialog: lady...And, though I understand she
dialog: is kept under interesting rules,
text: She raises questions.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Spit it out.
speaker_heading: LORD ASHFORD
dialog: Her introduction to society comes
dialog: at a key time in the insurance
dialog: appeal. Parliament is nervous that
dialog: your `family situation' will
dialog: colour your judgement.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: I will neither be pressured from
dialog: the inside - or the outside.
text: LORD ASHFORD comes to a stop.
speaker_heading: LORD ASHFORD
dialog: (calm)
dialog: You are the highest judge in the
dialog: land.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: LORD ASHFORD (CONT'D)
dialog: In you, they see a man who is of
dialog: the persuasion and position to
dialog: bring down the major trade of our
dialog: time and the commercial health of
dialog: this country. Some will say, next
dialog: to our king, you are the most
dialog: powerful man in England. And the
dialog: same will ask how you, our Chief
dialog: Justice can be fair?
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: How? RULES are in place to
dialog: dictate how we live - were that
dialog: not the case, I would not have
dialog: had the mandate to give shelter
dialog: to my nephew's child.
text: He struggles with his emotion.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: She is his blood - MINE! And
dialog: rightfully had entitlement to
text: grow up on the family estate.
dialog: (aggrieved)
dialog: The parliamentarians may challenge
dialog: me - let them! I can tell you all,
dialog: if the law supports the Zong's
dialog: slave owners as strongly as Murray
text: blood runs through Dido Belle's
dialog: veins - make no mistake - the
dialog: insurers will be forced to pay up!
text: LORD ASHFORD is affected. He regards LORD MANSFIELD.
speaker_heading: LORD ASHFORD
dialog: (softly)
dialog: I believe you.
text: He raises an eyebrow. Then...
speaker_heading: LORD ASHFORD (CONT'D)
dialog: I have reason to speak with you
dialog: on another matter.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Oh?
speaker_heading: LORD ASHFORD
dialog: (tentative)
dialog: I have a wish to seal the bond
dialog: between the Ashford and Mansfield
dialog: names. It would, however, require
dialog: some relaxing of your most
dialog: stringent rules, I must add!
text: LORD MANSFIELD comes to a halt again.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Is that so?
scene_heading: 67 INT. BLOOMSBURY SQ. DRAWING ROOM. NIGHT.13 67 *

dialog: And I to Lady Ashford.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Are we in agreement?
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: We are.
dialog: (long beat)
dialog: You once asked me, who would
dialog: look after her when we are gone.
dialog: Money is no substitute for a

speaker_heading: LADY MARY
dialog: He never married. Cousin Marjorie
dialog: wrote me last year, that he had
dialog: died after a long illness.
text: She looks down and continues to sew. DIDO fights tears,
text: unexpectedly affected. ELIZABETH takes her Aunt's hand.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Oh Aunt Mary...
speaker_heading: MABEL
dialog: Pardon me. Mr Ashford is here for
dialog: you, miss.

dialog: Mr Oliver.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I do hope my reason for being

text: In the DRAWING ROOM - OLIVER moves closer to DIDO.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: I think...well, I know...that we
dialog: make a rather good match.
dialog: (he pauses)
dialog: Father has purchased me a
dialog: commission in the navy - as
dialog: colonel - Is that not the rank
dialog: your blood father first purchased?
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: (anxious)
dialog: Yes. Indeed it is.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: So I feel my career is now set.
dialog: All that remains...

speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: I can not offer you a title, Miss

dialog: fall to my brother's wife...
dialog: (huge,nervous breath)
dialog: What I am trying to say is, I can
dialog: without doubt, offer you ALL that
dialog: is due to `Mrs Oliver Ashford'
dialog: and...and I trust that this would
dialog: be acceptable to you.
dialog: (he hesitates)
dialog: Since...it would very much be my
dialog: privilege...my honour, if you
dialog: would agree to become my wife.

speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD

speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: No...It would be dangerous.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (feeling foolish)
dialog: Yes. Indeed.
speaker_heading: DIDO

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: No. We've achieved little....

dialog: but...here...I found these in

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What are they?
speaker_heading: DIDO
text: Papaa's notes on the ship's log.
dialog: It seems the First Mate has come
dialog: forward with it - one Mr Stubbs. I

dialog: look at Papaa's markings - See the
dialog: map positions - From December
dialog: 29th, Captain Collingwood and
dialog: his men directed the ship past no
dialog: less than eight ports where, you
dialog: see....
dialog: (she points to map)
dialog: ...there was every opportunity to

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Good Lord!
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: And they did not! They either

dialog: they were never in need.
text: JOHN'S gaze darts from notes to the map, absorbed.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: This...This is remarkable.
text: He looks up from the papers. DIDO is still tentative.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Is it? Perhaps if you made these

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: But this places you in an
dialog: impossible position with Lord
dialog: Mansfield.

speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: What is the alternative?

speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Well is she, or isn't she?
text: MABEL wavers, attempts to sound convincing.
speaker_heading: MABEL
dialog: Yes. She is, M'lord.
text: LORD MANSFIELD watches as she stiffly moves from the room.
text: He goes to ask something more...then thinks better of it.
scene_heading: 80 EXT. KENTISH TOWN. CANAL SIDE. LOW SUN:LAST EMBERS.EVE.15 80 *
text: The sun is almost down. A hooded DIDO walks beside JOHN.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Papaa would rather I see no ill,
dialog: as though by ignoring it, it some
dialog: how escapes me - perhaps by
dialog: position but not...not by blood
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (conciliatory)
dialog: The fault was never with you.
text: He stops a beat as he catches her gaze on a painted metal
text: sign swinging from the back of an inn. It shows a gent,
text: hat in hand, his black servant bowing behind him.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: (unsure)
dialog: Miss Lindsay?
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Just as in life, we are no better
dialog: in paintings...
text: He follows her gaze back to the image and realisation hits.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You were afraid.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Afraid?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: To be painted - to be painted
dialog: beside Miss Murray
dialog: (off her discomfort )
dialog: And I ridiculed you.
dialog: (swallows hard)
dialog: I feel ashamed.
text: She looks back at him earnestly...
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Do not feel ashamed.
dialog: (she observes him)
dialog: Elizabeth said something when we
dialog: arrived in London. She said:
dialog: (recounting)
dialog: we are but their property.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Whose?
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Gentlemen's. We women are but
dialog: the property of gentlemen. That
dialog: is the way it is, in law and in
dialog: life, is it not?
text: JOHN nods, uneasily. DIDO thinks aloud.
speaker_heading: DIDO (CONT'D)
dialog: And it came into my head that I
dialog: have been blessed with freedom
dialog: twice over? As a negro and as a
dialog: woman?
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I suppose you have, yes!
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Or have I?
dialog: ((her mind ticks over)
dialog: Must not a lady marry, even if
dialog: she is financially secure? For
dialog: who is she, without a husband of
dialog: consequence?
dialog: (she ponders)
dialog: It seems silly - like a free
dialog: negro who begs for a master!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Unless she marries her equal. Her
dialog: true equal - A man who respects her.
text: DIDO is silent. She steals a glance at him.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: I remember my Papaa's eyes. They
dialog: were kind, gentle... a little
dialog: like yours...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Mine?
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: I mean...in colour. Grey.
dialog: (long beat)
dialog: He showed me much love, though
dialog: I knew him only a few hours.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That is terribly moving.
dialog: (off her reaction)
dialog: What of your mother?
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: She is a ghost in my life -
dialog: present in my reflection,
dialog: in each scowl I receive, yet I
dialog: know very little of her than the
dialog: colour she has given me.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (moved)
dialog: Then at the least, you know she
dialog: was beautiful.
text: They come to a halt. DIDO's eyes begin to sting.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: I had never felt it.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Had?
text: They observe each other a moment. Will they kiss? Dido
text: pulls back, nervous of the intimacy.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: I am to marry, shortly - Mr Ashford.
text: JOHN falters but tries to recover.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Oh!
text: She begins to walk again - composing herself.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: He is amiable and of good family.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Is it...what you want?
text: She stops. The question strikes her.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: The alternative is to replace
dialog: Lady Mary in her responsibilities
dialog: at Kenwood.
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: But she is a spinster.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Papaa did not trust I could
dialog: achieve a match that might raise
dialog: my rank - or even equal it.
text: JOHN searches her, then gently...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You...are above reducing yourself
dialog: for the sake of rank.
text: She stares at him, frozen - his words bury somewhere deep.
text: She studies him, harder. He moves towards her, letting his
text: breath settle on her face. They are both deadly nervous.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: I pray he would marry you without
dialog: a penny to your name - for that is
dialog: a man who will truly treasure you!
text: DIDO searches him. He takes her hand, brings it to his lips,
text: kissing it gently sending a shiver through her.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: I will take you back to your coach.
dialog: 72.
text: OFF DIDO reeling, from the moment.

speaker_heading: MABEL
dialog: Lord Mansfield.

dialog: I said you were out with Lady

scene_heading: 82 INT. BLOOMSBURY SQ. DIDO/ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - EVE.15 82 *
text: ELIZABETH falls back onto her bed, frustrated.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Urghhh! What if I shall never
dialog: find someone so...so incomparably
dialog: suitable...and wealthy?!
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: What if he is suitable but you do
dialog: not feel...`yourself' with him?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Oh Dido! He understood me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And whenever...whenever...
dialog: he looked at me...I somehow
dialog: felt better in this world...
text: ELIZABETH'S voice trails. Her words force DIDO to turn away.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: I am convinced his affections
dialog: were growing...and I feel
dialog: certain of my own love.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Oh Bette, stop it! It is NOT love!!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Dido! You stop it, won't you?
dialog: You know no more of love than I
dialog: myself, do you?!
dialog: (deliberately pointed)
dialog: Do you Dido?
dialog: 73.
text: She holds her to account - willing DIDO to open up to her.
text: DIDO stares daunted, then...
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: No.
text: Beat. ELIZABETH swallows hard, disappointed.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Then what better right do you have
dialog: to name what I am feeling than me?
speaker_heading: OFF DIDO affected.
scene_heading: 83 EXT. LONDON. THAMES RIVER BANKSIDE. DAY.16 83 *
text: Decandence personified...a beautiful picnic, shaded by trees.

speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: How charming. Is that not
dialog: charming, Elizabeth? And tell me,
dialog: are you an only son?
speaker_heading: GENTLEMAN 1
dialog: I have six brothers, madam.

speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: SIX! Goodness!...all..?
dialog: He knows where this is going...defeated...
speaker_heading: GENTLEMAN 1
dialog: ...all older, madam, yes.
text: Her smile falls away.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: Is that not a most fascinating display?
text: He turns to look at the bush of flowers behind him. When
text: he turns back, LADY MANSFIELD and ELIZABETH are gone.
text: ON BARONESS VERNON (50s) who passes on a punt, utterly
text: captivated as she waves. Her eyes are on DIDO, stunningly
text: beautiful in fuchsia, beside OLIVER.
speaker_heading: BARONESS VERNON
dialog: Oh how dreadfully wonderful Lady M.
dialog: Your girl is a picture...an utter
dialog: picture! With her...'intended'?
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: Indeed, Baroness Vernon.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: BARONESS VERNON
speaker_heading: (re. ELIZABETH)
dialog: AND I see the other does not give
dialog: up...so terribly endearing!
text: She stares across at ELIZABETH - ON BETTE'S contempt.
speaker_heading: BARONESS VERNON (CONT'D)
dialog: Now has she met Mr Willoughby...
text: She points to a gent and leans into the bankside...
speaker_heading: BARONESS VERNON (CONT'D)
dialog: A very eligible widower - Three
dialog: thousand yearly and no heir...yet!
text: Her punt moves off as she waves gauche to two gentlemen
text: passing in another.
speaker_heading: BARONESS VERNON (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr Francis, Mr Smith...!!! You
dialog: must meet the Mansfield girl!
dialog: (She mouths)
dialog: Still available!!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (anxious)
text: Mamaa, Mr Vaughan approaches.
text: A slender, dapper gent moves towards us on the river bank.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: Now I have checked and he has no

dialog: information he achieves an income
dialog: no less than four thousand a year!
text: ELIZABETH's mouth falls open....
speaker_heading: MR VAUGHAN
dialog: Miss Murray. Lady Mansfield.
text: ELIZABETH curtseys.
speaker_heading: MR VAUGHAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I trust your stay in London is
dialog: proving pleasant, Miss Murray.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (earnest)
dialog: Oh most certainly.
speaker_heading: MR VAUGHAN
dialog: Miss Murray, I wonder, if you
dialog: might permit me to call upon you
dialog: at home, sometime?
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Oh!
text: She looks to her mother, stunned, his gaze follows...
speaker_heading: MR VAUGHAN
dialog: With her Ladyship's permission?
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: I shall make arrangements.
text: ON DIDO, as OLIVER chats to others. She moves past as...
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: A pity Lady Mansfield and I could not
dialog: do business on James and Miss Murray.
speaker_heading: LADY MARY
dialog: A greater pity you rejected her.
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: Let us not dwell on the
dialog: unfortunate. Oliver and Miss
text: Lindsay are a blissful match.
dialog: Tell me, when exactly does she
dialog: receive her inheritance?
text: As DIDO observes her reflection in waters - easy laughter
text: floats by - a group of gentleman josh.
text: A figure beside her turns - icy blue stare takes her in as
text: she meets his gaze and finds herself staring into the eyes
text: of JAMES ASHFORD.
speaker_heading: JAMES ASHFORD.
dialog: Miss Lindsay. Not Husband
dialog: hunting, are we?
dialog: (off Dido's disdain)
dialog: Good Lord, I forgot - you have
dialog: ensnared my brother. Now is he to
dialog: share his dining room with you, as
dialog: well as his bed??
text: His words bury deep and painful.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Oh, Mr James, your manners are as
dialog: poor as your brother's finances.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: And you are foolish enough to marry
dialog: him. I on the other have no better
dialog: use for your impoverished
dialog: cousin!...(beat)...Though she does
dialog: make for rather amusing sport!
dialog: 76.
text: She follows his gaze through trees to ELIZABETH breathing
text: in the scent of the azaleas beside MR VAUGHAN. The joshing
text: gentlemen trickle away leaving only DIDO and JAMES.
text: She goes to move off. JAMES grabs her arm, spitefully.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: That is painful, sir.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Have you never been manhandled?
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: It is not in my repertoire to
dialog: keep company with beasts.
text: He regards her - her disdain reflected in his eyes. His
text: free hand comes up, fingers rest on her lips, then spread,
text: as he crushes her beauty in his hand.
text: Her eyes fill as he brings her close. So close. She is
text: afraid, angry. She struggles desperately, spirited, both
text: arousing and alarming him. As she tears herself from him
speaker_heading: DIDO (CONT'D)
dialog: How dare you? HOW DARE YOU!
text: He stares at her - takes her in, calmly. Then...
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: With ease.
text: DIDO wavers nauseous with contempt. JAMES moves off. She
text: watches, incensed, humiliated.
text: ELIZABETH strolls with MR VAUGHAN, as JAMES passes OLIVER,
text: he whispers to his brother.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: You will destroy us. You will destroy
dialog: the entire order of our family.
text: Nearby, DIDO emerges from the trees...
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD
dialog: Oliver has been searching for you!
text: LADY MANSFIELD notes DIDO'S odd demeanour, LADY MARY too.
text: Her eyes dart suspiciously to JAMES as he approaches.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: Are you unwell, my dear?
text: DIDO's affected eyes come up to meet her mother's. She goes
text: to answer...interrupted as...ELIZABETH gasps overwhelmed...
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Oh!..Mr James!
dialog: 77.
text: A distressed DIDO follows her gaze back to JAMES.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Is she not terribly disappointed that
dialog: you will not return to Hampstead?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (ironic)
dialog: my Aunt?
text: They begin to laugh...it's good to see DIDO laughing.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)JOHN
dialog: I doubt Miss Beresford has

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It is quite extraordinary ...but I
dialog: fear...I fear despite persuasive

dialog: moved.
dialog: (despondent)
dialog: I am not certain he is ready to
dialog: go against the traders - they are
dialog: some of the most powerful in
dialog: these Isles - theirs are the
dialog: finances that hold up England,
dialog: after all. The enemies of any man
dialog: who stood against the trade would
dialog: be vicious.
text: DIDO stops, turns JOHN to face her. She is intense...
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: And yet if he does...stand
dialog: up...IF he speaks the words and
dialog: condemns the trade...The Lord
dialog: Chief Justice of England...it may
dialog: be impossible for the slave laws
dialog: of England and its colonies to
dialog: remain absolute. Is that correct?

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I have heard nothing from him,
dialog: since Vauxhall, Dido. I was
dialog: certain an announcement was
dialog: to be made any day...that he

speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Then he is not a man of his word.

speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: No?
text: DIDO gets up too, now.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: James Ashford is not kind. He is
dialog: not a man to give your life or
dialog: dowry to.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Then your gift comes with conditions.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: What then?
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: I am trying...trying to make you
dialog: see. He is not... appropriate!

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Appropriate? The brother of the

speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: He does not desire you, Bette!
dialog: At least, even if he does, you
dialog: would regret such a mistake.
dialog: (off Bette's silence)
dialog: He...he laid his hands on me,

speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: My mother and father never married
dialog: - you are correct. But my father
dialog: acknowledged me as his child.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It is yours who refuses to
dialog: legitimise your position, Bette -
dialog: that is why you are poor! And that
dialog: is why it is not me who is beneath

speaker_heading: DIDO

dialog: Papaa...?

text: LORD MANSFIELD is puffed with fury as he paces the room.
text: He knocks the table again, jolting LADY MANSFIELD.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: He is laughing at us! His

dialog: my already rampant ridicule in

dialog: As though he were some kind

speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: You said something identical, once.
text: LORD MANSFIELD stops in his tracks.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: Desperate to seal your position

dialog: a little too radical for them.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: I never broke the rules.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD
dialog: Did you not? You simply became
dialog: powerful enough to make new ones.
dialog: (off his silence)
dialog: I always felt you already loved
dialog: me when I gave you my hand. Not
dialog: that you said it but... something
dialog: in the way you looked at me.
text: LORD MANSFIELD'S face softens slightly, struck by his
dialog: wife's words - of course he loved her! He adored her!
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: That we were a good match - that
dialog: was of no doubt...But I am not
dialog: sure I could have married a
dialog: gentleman without that...`thing'
dialog: in his eye...without knowing -
dialog: privately - that my heart stopped
dialog: a moment each time he looked at me
text: Their eyes are locked. She speaks carefully.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: It is possible that even you
dialog: cannot fight change, my darling...
dialog: And sometimes you cannot fight it
dialog: because you are a part of it.
text: Her words resonate, shifting him into thought.
speaker_heading: LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you love her?
text: His eyes fill. What he says next is deeply heartfelt...
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD

speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: (burdened)
dialog: Lady Ashford there is little
dialog: point in repetition...
speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD

speaker_heading: LADY ASHFORD

text: ON LADY MANSFIELD stung by the thought.
speaker_heading: DIDO (CONT'D)
dialog: My greatest misfortune would be

text: LORD MANSFIELD swallows hard. LADY MANSFIELD's gaze falls.
speaker_heading: DIDO (CONT'D)
dialog: Her apparent crime, to be born

dialog: (beat)
dialog: Since I wish to deny her no more

dialog: will pardon me for wanting a

text: POV: THROUGH THE WINDOW, as DIDO feels their gaze. She
text: falters. Her eyes dart through the glass, beyond LORD
text: MANSFIELD, to the canvas....The sight causes her to stand -
text: drawn to the window to see more clearly.
text: The camera, too, draws in on the portrait, now. And as it
text: is revealed to DIDO, so too, is it finally revealed to us.

speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Why should it not?
text: LORD MANSFIELD says nothing, observes her, curious.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: What are you reading?
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Poetry. A gentleman named Thomas
text: Day. He speaks of a slave who
dialog: agreed to marry a free woman.
dialog: A voice to people...people like
dialog: my mother - who do not have one.
text: People like the drowned slaves. He takes her point.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: You find yourself in such writing?
text: The camera tracks, capturing them taking in the canvas.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: I don't know that I find myself
dialog: anywhere. I have no place that I
dialog: may claim.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: What is it that you want, Dido?
dialog: What precisely are you searching
dialog: for? I enabled every rule of
dialog: heritage so that you could know
dialog: exactly where you belong. Yet
dialog: little appears enough for you!
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: Papaa, you enabled every rule,
dialog: but you had to overlook just as
dialog: many to raise me within good
dialog: society. And what if there were
dialog: not a rule Papaa? What if that
dialog: rule that allowed you to take me
dialog: did not exist? Would you have
dialog: returned me to the slums?
text: The air is poignant with the question.
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: DIDO (CONT'D)
dialog: You are courageous. When it
dialog: comes to the matters you believe
dialog: in, society is inconsequential.
dialog: You break EVERY rule when it
dialog: matters enough. Papaa, I am the
dialog: evidence.
dialog: (OFF the painting)
dialog: This painting...is the evidence.

speaker_heading: LORD MAYOR
dialog: Look at them - For and against at

speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: You did not become Lord Mayor

speaker_heading: LORD MAYOR
dialog: Finally you are to speak, then.
dialog: If England is destroyed we shall

text: He slaps LORD MANSFIELD's back, playfully, but is deadly

speaker_heading: JOHN (OOV)
dialog: ...But religion cannot be the

speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN 1
dialog: Of course not - there is self-

text: LORD MANSFIELD'S POV: we make out JOHN debating intensely.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: And failing that does the law not
dialog: have a duty?
text: ON LORD MANSFIELD - his own group continue in conversation,
text: but all his attention is on JOHN.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Do the bench and parliament not
dialog: have a duty to uphold and create
dialog: the laws, to set the precedents
dialog: that progress our morality, not
dialog: retard it! If not to protect us
dialog: from others, then to protect us
dialog: from ourselves! Laws that allow
dialog: us to diminish the humanity of
dialog: anybody, are not laws - they are
dialog: frameworks for crime.
text: ON LORD MANSFIELD - something going on behind the eyes. The
text: rest of the room fades - making JOHN clear and crisp.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: A constitution can never be finite
dialog: - surely as humanity evolves so
dialog: too must its laws. And frankly I
dialog: really do not care if you as an
dialog: individual are without character
dialog: or conscience - But a land whose
dialog: laws contain neither - whose laws

dialog: That is correct!...(to his

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Then know that when you are gone,

dialog: she may be worth more dead, than
dialog: alive.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
text: She is not a slave.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: By the very grace of God!
text: The words provoke LORD MANSFIELD. He stands, slamming his

text: JOHN stands at the carriage window, breathless. LORD
text: MANSFIELD looks down at him furious, suddenly disarmed by
text: the emotion in JOHN'S eyes.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: This is not about Miss Lindsay.
text: JOHN is confused, flustered.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Of course it is! It's about all
dialog: of us. It's about everything...
dialog: everything that is important!
dialog: 95.
text: LORD MANSFIELD searches JOHN, palpably affected now. He
dialog: doesn't want to show JOHN his empathy, fights it - but for
text: a split second it escapes in the profound silence.
text: He recovers himself - considers his words before he speaks
text: quietly - as though from personal experience...
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Mr Davinier, the world is a
dialog: devastating place. You must learn
dialog: to protect your emotions if you
dialog: are to prevent matters of both

speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Silence in the court!
text: DIDO's hand slides to JOHN'S.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Whether the `jettison clause' of
dialog: Marine Insurance Law may be brought
dialog: to bear in this appeal. This is
dialog: the question. That is, first:
dialog: whether the slaves were drowned
dialog: as an anticipatory act. An act to
dialog: avoid the disease caused by their
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: journey, killing them once on shore,
text: and at their destination...depriving
dialog: the slave owners of any compensation.
text: He takes in the gaze of a free black man in the gallery.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: Or secondly: whether they were
dialog: `jettisoned' as cargo! To save
dialog: captain and crew from certain death,
dialog: when the extended journey threatened
dialog: shortage of drinking-water.
dialog: (steely eyed)
dialog: Let me be clear, loss of water on a
dialog: ship constitutes a singularly
dialog: dangerous affair - insurrection of
dialog: thirsty and hostile slaves at its
dialog: extreme - and an impossible task to
dialog: share diminished water reserve, among
dialog: all those living, at best. Each
dialog: implies severe threat to the lives of
dialog: the seamen. In such circumstances our
dialog: law is transparent and equivocal -
dialog: the jettisoning of enslaved cargo
dialog: ...IS legal!
dialog: (he spells it out)
dialog: And in these circumstances, combined
dialog: with unavoidable loss of water, our
dialog: laws leave the ship-owners securely
dialog: within their rights to make a claim
dialog: ...and behoves the insurers to pay
dialog: losses.
speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: No!
text: Gasps from around the room...gasps that turn into cries,
text: including DIDO'S own. JOHN is rigid, anger rising.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: The ship's owners chose a tight
dialog: `packing fashion' to transport
dialog: the slaves...A popular fashion of
dialog: transportation that is known for
dialog: causing death and disease.
text: His voice is raised over the sounds of a chaotic court.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: This choice of laying the slaves
dialog: tightly together is undertaken at
dialog: the Captain's own risk. In the
dialog: event that over packing renders
dialog: an avoidable lack of drinking water
text: on board a protracted journey,
dialog: such a decision may be viewed as
dialog: simple `bad management' on a
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: Captain's part, and further, weigh
text: as his own risk. An extended journey
dialog: - one in which the destination is
dialog: overshot may also be viewed as
text: the captain's own mismanagement.
text: The noise lowers to silence. LORD MANSFIELD settles on JOHN.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: It is not legal...to discharge lives
dialog: from a ship into the waters, to
dialog: prevent those lives dying on land,
dialog: and to facilitate insurance
dialog: compensation. Whether they be the
dialog: lives of horses... or human beings
dialog: ...slaves or otherwise - It is
dialog: not legal, neither is it right.
text: DIDO lets out a gasp - breathless relief.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: Further, the claim of shortage of
dialog: water is illegitimate shown by the
dialog: evidence put forward. To my
dialog: mind, it is clear a fraud has been
dialog: committed in claiming insurance on
dialog: slaves who were...drowned solely
dialog: for financial gain.
text: He looks around the room - sees LORD ASHFORD's acceptance.
text: His eyes fall on DIDO now and here they remain.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: It is my opinion, that the state of
dialog: slavery is so odious a position that
dialog: nothing may support it. This case
text: has displayed with searing clarity
dialog: the depravity of any such nation
dialog: whose choice is to practice it. You
dialog: may be certain that I have laboured
dialog: over my judgement and statements
dialog: today and am in full understanding
dialog: of all of the ramifications. Justice
dialog: be done,though the heavens may fall.
text: JOHN'S eyes brim at the realisation of those words.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: I find in favour of the insurers
dialog: and overturn the decision of the
dialog: lower court. I order a retrial.
text: Stunned confusion in the courtroom. Then, all kinds of
text: commotion - anger, cheers amid shock. LORD MANSFIELD stands.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: All rise!

dialog: You may not blame Mr Davinier
dialog: ...My attendance today is

speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: I am fully aware, Dido.

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I am trying to be.
speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD
dialog: Then your efforts are not in vain.
text: DIDO moves to JOHN'S side, taking his hand. LORD

speaker_heading: LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: I have not changed my mind. She

speaker_heading: DIDO
dialog: And Mr Davinier is not a gentleman?

dialog: And that is why he ought to have
dialog: a job befitting one.
speaker_heading: DIDO

dialog: My affections are with him, Papaa.
dialog: I wish for nothing...
