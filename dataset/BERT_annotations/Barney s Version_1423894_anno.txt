scene_heading: INT. DEN - BARNEY AND MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: A tumbler of Scotch. A half empty bottle of Macallan's. A
text: burning Montecristo cigar in an ashtray.
text: A hand picks up a telephone and dials.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: I'd like to speak with my wife.
speaker_heading: BLAIR (V.0.)
dialog: (groggy) ; ;
dialog: Barney...? It's three in the morning.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Put my wife on the phone.
speaker_heading: BLAIR (V.0.)
dialog: She's not your wife and I'm not waking
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Then just ask her what she wants me to
dialog: do with these nude photos I have of
dialog: her. Come to think of it, you might
dialog: actually want them if only to see what
text: Miriam looked like in her prime.
dialog: Click. Dial tone.
text: Barney hangs up, puffs on his cigar. Feeling good. Photos
text: of him and Miriam strewn over the table. None of them nudes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DEN - BARNEY AND MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - MORNING
text: The bottle of Macallan's now empty. The cigar burned to the nub.
text: An ALARM CLOCK DRONES on and on from the bedroom. It finally
text: gets turned off.
text: BARNEY PANOFSKY (64), hung over and in his robe, lumbers
text: down the hallway and to the front door.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE BARNEY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: He picks up the morning newspaper. Scans the front page.
text: Something he reads upsets him.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Fuck.
text: A SOCCER BALL rolls and stops at Barney's feet.
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 2.
text: JUSTIN (8) runs up and grabs the ball. He stares up at
text: Barney. Barney stares back
speaker_heading: NEIGHBOR (0.S.)
dialog: Justin, come on, we're late.
speaker_heading: JUSTIN
dialog: Hi Barney.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Good morning.
text: Justin runs off. Barney turns back inside.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - BARNEY AND MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - LATER
text: Now dressed, Barney reads the paper as he finishes his bagel
text: and lox. He looks at his watch -- shit, he's late. Drops
text: the paper on the table. Puts the dishes in the sink.
scene_heading: INSERT - NEWSPAPER BLURB - FRONT PAGE
text: "BOOK REVIEW: Detective Sean O'Hearne writes his own account
dialog: of the scandal that rocked the city 30 years ago..."
text: Beside the blurb is an old picture of BARNEY IN HANDCUFFS.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - BARNEY AND MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: He grabs his cell phone and turns it on, then notices the
text: answering machine.
scene_heading: INSERT - BLINKING ANSWERING MACHINE: 10 MESSAGES.
text: He presses PLAY, but only listens to the first few words of

scene_heading: ANSWERING MACHINE
dialog: (female voice)
dialog: Hi dad, I know it's early... hi dad,

text: The next few messages from an angry MALE VOICE.
speaker_heading: ANSWERING MACHINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Dad, its Michael.... Dad, I know
dialog: you're there... Are you screening?...
text: Barney turns the machine OFF. Now he can't find his keys.
text: Scours the house for them. His cell phone RINGS.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Hello?
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - MORNING
text: INTERCUT WITH KATE (24), Barney's daughter. Walking to her
text: job as a grade school teacher, carrying a bag and thermos.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Daddy, where were you? I've been
dialog: calling all morning.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
text: The ringer was off.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Blair had a heart attack last night.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: How bad?
speaker_heading: KATE
text: Minor. He thought it was indigestion.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Putz.
text: He finds his keys. Rushes out the door
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Dad, it's still a heart attack.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Barney hurries down the hallway to the elevator.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: That's true. The long term effects
dialog: of these things don't often show up
text: until later. Impotence is still on
dialog: the table.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Are you not at all concerned that
dialog: you might have caused this?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Why would I be?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Mom told me about the phone call
dialog: last night.
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 4.
text: That triggers a distant alcohol fogged memory. DING. The
text: elevator arrives. He steps in.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: I'll call you back. I'm stepping in
dialog: the elevator.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You better.
text: Barney grins from ear to ear, filled with glee at this news.
text: On the elevator doors closing we...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DRIVING - MORNING
text: Barney driving his Mercedes, back on the phone with Kate who
text: is approaching the school she teaches at.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: I may have accidentally dialed their
dialog: number.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Sure, dad. But you do have an out -
dialog: it seems that Blair was already having
dialog: chest pains when you called but he
dialog: didn't want to bother mom with it.
dialog: It was your call that woke her, and
dialog: she then insisted on taking him to
dialog: the hospital.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: So I saved his life.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: My hero.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Did you see the paper today?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I did. Are you okay?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Yeah, I'm fine.
dialog: (beat)

scene_heading: EXT. TOTALLY UNNECESSARY PRODUCTIONS - DAY
text: Barney drives up to the offices of TOTALLY UNNECESSARY
text: PRODUCTIONS and pulls into his personal parking spot.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. TV SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
text: We drop right into a scene of Barney's TV show, the long
text: running soap - "O'MALLEY OF THE NORTH".
text: The CONSTABLE, O'MALLEY, mid-50's and still handsome, is
text: being tended to by a female NURSE played by SOLANGE (52),
text: making a "house call" to the local bar.
speaker_heading: SOLANGE
dialog: (wrapping a bandage)
dialog: How does that feel, O'Malley?
speaker_heading: O'MALLEY
text: Warm and tight.
text: SOLANGE, originally cast as the "sexpot" of the show, her
text: uniform is inappropriately low cut and tight for a woman her
text: age, but she works it like she's still the cat's meow.
text: Barney quietly walks onto the sound stage, and sits in his
text: producers chair. The scene is painful for him watch. He
text: pulls over a WARDROBE GIRL.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Can we do something about her outfit?
speaker_heading: WARDROBE GIRL
dialog: I tried. She has them altered
dialog: herself.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
speaker_heading: CUT!
dialog: (to Barney)
dialog: How was that?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
text: Appallingly bad.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
text: Great. MOVING ON.
text: Solange's bright smile instantly sours as she eyes Barney.
speaker_heading: SOLANGE
dialog: I want to talk to you!
text: Barney immediately hustles himself away.
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09
speaker_heading: SOLANGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't you run away from me!
text: She tries to go after him but is stopped by the sound guy
dialog: who needs to remove her mic.
text: FOUR EXECUTIVES descend upon him, struggling to keep pace,
text: including MARK (40). Everyone talking over each other
speaker_heading: MARK EXECUTIVE
dialog: Did you see today's We need to go over the
dialog: paper? opening for next week's
dialog: episode.
speaker_heading: MARK EXECUTIVE
dialog: The teaser is a minute And we lost the location
dialog: long- - so we have to rewrite it
dialog: for the studio--
text: Barney pushes through a door, leading everyone into --
scene_heading: INT. TOTALLY UNNECESSARY PRODUCTIONS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Rows of desks occupied by accountants, story editors
text: assistants. Barney whisks through the aisles - everyone
text: still hot on his tail.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: (announcing to entire
dialog: office)
dialog: Good morning everyone. Yes I've
dialog: seen today's paper, no I don't give
dialog: a flying fuck and neither should
dialog: you, let that be the end of it.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Barney, the network wants to make a
dialog: really big deal about the 30th season.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: That's in a year.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: They're looking ahead, and they're
dialog: open to renewing for two more seasons.
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: But they have a few suggestions.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: How long have you worked for me?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Eighteen years.
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: So why do you still act like a girl
dialog: asking permission for a sleepover?
dialog: Tell me what the hell it is.
dialog: Barney heads into --
scene_heading: INT. BARNEY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: The exec's all follow inside and stand in silence.
dialog: Mark
text: steps forward as Barney flips through mail on his desk.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: They want to bring in a new face.
dialog: Someone young. Maybe give Solange a
text: sexy, young niece who comes to live
dialog: with her--
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: They want to fire Solange?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: They want us to write her down in
dialog: favor of a new character
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: No. No way.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: We'll do it in a classy way--
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: I won't humiliate her like that.
dialog: She's been on the show since day
dialog: one. I'll give her your job before
dialog: that happens.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: They're not asking.
dialog: If we don't do it, this is our last
dialog: season. No one under fifty watches
dialog: the show.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: So they want to bring in some tits
dialog: and ass?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Isn't that why you first hired her?
text: Solange suddenly bursts through the crowd of Exec's and slams
text: a FOLDER down on Barney's desk.
speaker_heading: SOLANGE
dialog: I want a word with you NOW.
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09
text: Barney opens the folder and scans the papers inside.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: What language is this?
speaker_heading: SOLANGE
dialog: They're from Bulgaria. Press
dialog: clippings about me and they just
dialog: keep coming. They love me over there.
dialog: This proves what I'm really worth to
dialog: the foreign market.
text: Barney tosses the folder aside.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: I'll give it my utmost attention.
speaker_heading: SOLANGE
dialog: I hired a new lawyer, a real shark
dialog: and he says--
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Whoa, whoa, Solange, why do we need
dialog: to bring lawyers into this?
text: Solange turns around and pushes the Exec's out.
speaker_heading: SOLANGE
dialog: Out! I want to talk Barney alone.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Barney, we have to discuss--
speaker_heading: SOLANGE
dialog: OUT!
text: She slams the door on them and turns to Barney.
text: instantly softens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLANGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I feel like everyone is laughing at
dialog: me. Tell me honestly, how do I look?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: You look like the reason we're still
text: on the air. Sexy as hell.
speaker_heading: SOLANGE
dialog: (teary)
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But you're still going to pay me
dialog: what I deserve.
dialog: Her tone
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 9.
text: She stops just before exiting.
speaker_heading: SOLANGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I saw the paper. How are you doing?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Fine.
text: Not wanting to get into it, Barney busies himself with moving
text: around papers. Solange takes the cue, then takes a deep
text: breath, puts her game face on and storms out, slamming the
text: door behind her for effect.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT/EXT. BARNEY'S CAR - DRIVING - DAY
text: Barney drives through downtown Montreal, eventually parking
text: in front of Grumpy's Bar
scene_heading: INT. GRUMPY'S BAR - DAY
text: Barney walks into his regular watering hole - GRUMPY'S BAR.
text: The bar spotted with regulars who mumble hello to him.
text: JILL THE BARTENDER serves him his usual.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: You get home okay last night?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: I got home.
text: With a glance, Jill directs Barney down the bar.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: He's had more than a few already.
text: DETECTIVE SEAN O'HEARNE, around 60, slides off his barstool.
text: Grossly overweight, blotchy salmon red complexion.
speaker_heading: O' HEARNE
dialog: You see that review in the paper
dialog: today? Not bad.
text: Barney ignores him. O'Hearne places a copy of the infamous
text: book he's written "WITH FRIENDS LIKE THESE" on the bar
speaker_heading: O'HEARNE (CONT'D)
dialog: That's for you. I even signed it.
text: Barney opens the book - dumps a handful of peanuts on the
text: page, POUNDS it shut with his fist, then flips it back open
text: and starts eating from the cracked nuts.
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 10.
speaker_heading: O'HEARNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Why do you have to be like that? I
dialog: wrote a nice little note to you.
text: O'Hearne slides the book back over to himself and clumsily
text: flips to his hand written inscription. He's very drunk.
speaker_heading: O'HEARNE (CONT'D)
dialog: "To Barney, none of this would have
dialog: been possible without you. All the
dialog: best, Detective Sean O'Hearne".
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: What the hell are you doing here?
speaker_heading: O' HEARNE
dialog: This is a big day. I thought I'd
dialog: buy you a drink, share in the moment,
dialog: be a "mensch", like you might say.
text: Barney looks at O'Hearne. Marvelling at his idiocy.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: For someone who professes to hate me
dialog: so much, you sure do go out of your
dialog: way to come around here a lot.
speaker_heading: O' HEARNE
dialog: I just want to know what you did
text: with the body already.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: You really want to know? Fine. I
text: carved him up with a chainsaw, dumped
dialog: the parts in the St. Lawrence river
speaker_heading: O' HEARNE
dialog: Chainsaw, my ass. You'd never have
dialog: the guts to cut him up. If you won't
dialog: tell me now, promise you'll at least
dialog: leave me a note in your will.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: C'mon O'Hearne, you're bound to go
dialog: first. Look at you - prick you with
dialog: a fork on a hot summer day and you'd
text: explode like a pan fried sausage.
speaker_heading: O' HEARNE
dialog: This heart will still be pumping
dialog: strong when your prostate turns to
dialog: marble, Panofsky.
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 11.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Why don't you just leave him alone
dialog: already?
speaker_heading: O' HEARNE
dialog: Because he got away with murder,
dialog: sweetie.
dialog: (looking at Barney)
dialog: You screwed over everyone you ever
dialog: knew or cared about, and now the
dialog: whole world is going to know what a
dialog: cocksucking murderer you really are.
text: O'Hearne is right up in his face. INTENSE stare.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Your breath stinks.
text: O'Hearne has to tear himself away before he tries to kill
text: Barney. He slides the book back over to him.
speaker_heading: O' HEARNE
dialog: It's a real page turner.
text: O'Hearne marches out. Barney's eyes reluctantly drift to
text: the COVER PHOTO of the book
text: INSERT - BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO CIRCA 1974, Barney with his
text: arm around his best friend BOOGIE.
scene_heading: FLASHBACK TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RESTAURANT - TRASTAVERE, ROME - NIGHT - PAST
speaker_heading: TITLE: ROME, 1974
text: Barney is out cavorting with his crew - over educated
text: contemporaries living the bohemian life in Rome.
text: Barney's Algonquin Round Table.
text: Copious amounts of food and drink. Lively conversations
text: overlap, as we move around a crowded table. Locals, ex-pats
text: and plenty of girls. A few of Barney's standout friends being:
text: CEDRIC RICHARDSON, African American, actor, extremely handsome,
text: three fawning girls with him. LEO FASOLI, Italian bearded
text: artist, his pants and t-shirt speckled with paint.
speaker_heading: CEDRIC
dialog: ...I know that I can't just sit around
dialog: and wait for something to happen.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 12.
speaker_heading: CEDRIC (CONT'D)
dialog: So I call up the director and tell
dialog: him: "I've been offered Othello for
dialog: the third straight year and I'm not
dialog: going to pass it up just to play the
dialog: fucking Chuck Wagon cook again. Who
dialog: do I look like, Roscoe Lee Brown?
dialog: "But that's how it's written" he
dialog: answers. So I tell him - "Roberto,
dialog: the time has come for the black man
dialog: to hold a gun instead of a spatula".
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Amen!
speaker_heading: CEDRIC
dialog: And he had the role rewritten for
dialog: me. I am now posse member number 4.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: To Cedric, living the lessons of the
dialog: Bard: "be as great in act, as you
dialog: have in thought".
text: Everyone toasts. Barney's eyes light up as he leaps from
dialog: his chair to greet --
speaker_heading: BARNEY
speaker_heading: BOOGIE!
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: Boogie/Welcome back! !
text: BOOGIE, Barney's best and most cherished friend. Tall and
text: lean, he possesses a physical and intellectual magnetism
text: that enchants everyone who meets him. He has a stunning girl
text: (THE COUNTESS) on his arm.
text: Boogie is greeted by all and handed some wine. Cedric makes
text: it a point to introduce himself to The Countess.
speaker_heading: CEDRIC
dialog: I'm Cedric.
speaker_heading: COUNTESS/MARIA
dialog: Maria.
dialog: (flirtatious)
dialog: You look familiar to me.
speaker_heading: CEDRIC
dialog: I'm an actor.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I knew it. You look like a movie
dialog: star.
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 13.
text: The Countess then slides up to Boogie, whispers something in
text: his ear, kisses him deeply, then walks off to the bathroom.
text: Her exquisite beauty silences them all.
speaker_heading: CEDRIC
dialog: Who is that?
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: Ah, the Countess. A descendant of
dialog: Giuseppe Garibaldi, no less.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Where did you meet her?
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: Somewhere between my blackout in
dialog: Lake Como and my hangover in Ste-
dialog: Maxime. If you could find out AND
dialog: get her name, that would be great.
dialog: But enough about that, I want to
dialog: hear about all of you. Leo, how was
dialog: your showing at Galerie Des Points?
text: The silence around the table indicates - "not so good".
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: His work is too bold for that crowd.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: The show was a bust. I only sold
dialog: one piece - to Barney.
text: Barney holds up the painting to show Boogie.
speaker_heading: CEDRIC
dialog: Barney - our very own patron of the
dialog: arts. Otherwise known as our only
dialog: friend with a real job.
text: Everyone toasts.
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: (to Barney)
dialog: And so, my High Priest, did you get
dialog: through those books I sent you?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
text: A few of them.
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: Only a few? I sent them months ago.
dialog: What have you been doing with yourself?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Well, actually, I'm getting married.
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 14.
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: What?! To who?
speaker_heading: CLARA (0.S.)
dialog: To me.
text: Boogie turns around to find CLARA CHAMBERS (26), tall, skinny,
text: pale and beautiful, gypsy shawl and skirt. Three months
text: pregnant, and slightly showing at her belly. She downs a
text: shot of Grappa and lights a cigarette as she sits.
speaker_heading: CLARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Prince Charmingbaum here knocked me
text: up by way of a magical thirty seconds
dialog: of friction.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Where have you been? You didn't
dialog: come home last night.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Who remembers?
dialog: (to Boogie)
dialog: Has he told you what he's doing now?
dialog: Exporting olive oil to some guy,
dialog: Hymie back in Montreal. It's like a
dialog: bad Jewish sitcom.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Someone needs to make a living.
speaker_heading: CLARA
text: He comes to Europe and sells oil.
dialog: It's fucking humiliating. You're
dialog: not one of us. You're a voyeur--
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: Okay, A toast to the newlyweds! To
dialog: your health, your happiness- -
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (at Barney)
text: And a three inch prick
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
speaker_heading: L'CHAIM!
text: Everyone drinks. Barney scowls at Clara. She instantly
text: switches gears to soft and loving.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I'm sorry, baby. You're still my
dialog: yummy yid.
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 15.
text: She gets on his lap, curling herself around him like a cat.
text: He starts to soften, the party around them continues on....
scene_heading: EXT. ROME STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Closing down the bar, the whole gang pours out into the
text: street. Barney and Boogie lead the way, sharing a flask
text: Barney shlepping Leo's painting with him.
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: Why did you agree to marry her?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: I got her pregnant.
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: So? Clara's crazy. She's a
dialog: conversation piece, not a wife. And
dialog: how do you even know it's yours?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: It's mine.
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: If you say so.
text: Boogie turns to the gang: Leo pulling up the rear with his
text: girl. Cedric walking with one arm around Clara and the other
text: around the Countess, who is quite smitten with him.
speaker_heading: BOOGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: So what's the plan everyone? What
dialog: are we doing?
speaker_heading: CEDRIC
dialog: I have an early call time tomorrow.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Yeah, I'm exhausted.
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: Oh, come on. TI don't believe what
dialog: I'm seeing.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (lighting a cigarette)
dialog: Count me out. I'm already hung over
dialog: and I'm not even done being drunk
dialog: yet. Oh, yeah, and I'm fucking
dialog: pregnant too. C'mon, Barney.
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: He's coming with me.
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 16.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: Taking him out for a proper bachelor
dialog: party.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Oh no, you're not.
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: You don't own him just yet.
text: Boogie drags Barney down a side street.
speaker_heading: BOOGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Got any money?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Some. Why?
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: Provisions.
scene_heading: INT. BOOGIE'S ROOM - HOTEL CISTERNA - LATER
text: Laid out on the table in Boogie's hotel room:
text: A bottle of Scotch, two packs of Gauloises, a pack of rolling
text: papers, a small ball of TINFOIL.
text: Barney finds two clean glasses in the messy room and pours
text: them each a drink. Boogie unwraps the tinfoil to reveal a
text: ball of OPIUM inside. Then gathers his drug paraphernalia.
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: We have to do it all, Barney. Opium,
dialog: Horse, Hash - everything under and
text: behind the sun, on and off the table.
dialog: We only go around once.
text: They toast and drink. Boogie then hands Barney a thick
text: MANUSCRIPT off the floor
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: You finished it?!
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: Not quite yet. But you can read it
dialog: so far.
text: Barney drops onto the mattress and starts right away.
text: 3/4 OF A BOTTLE OF SCOTCH LATER
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 17.
dialog: Barney has gone through a hundred pages so far
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Boogie, this is brilliant. Absolutely
dialog: brilliant. When are they publishing it?
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: They're not.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: I didn't submit it.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Why the hell not?
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: I told you, it's not finished yet.
dialog: And anyway, I'm never giving it to
dialog: that feckless editor.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: What about the advance they paid you?
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: I wrote him another one.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Which?
text: Boogie reaches over and tosses Barney a manuscript.
scene_heading: INSERT - MANUSCRIPT: "VANESSA'S PUSSY"
speaker_heading: BARNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: What's it about?
text: While Boogie weaves his tale, he heats up and crumbles some
text: of the Opium, preparing to smoke it in a pipe.
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: It's a new interpretation of the
text: Book of Job, as told through Vanessa's
text: vaginal lips. Pious and pristine
text: Vanessa's Pussy is a pillar of
dialog: religious devotion. Then one day,
dialog: without warning or reason, Vanessa's

scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 35.

speaker_heading: IZZY
dialog: What do you think? Let me give you
dialog: an example: One of my first shifts

dialog: for a rookie. I call for backup
dialog: "cuz the rules say you can only put

scene_heading: FATHER- IN-LAW
dialog: Most? Did you ever consider that

speaker_heading: IZZY

speaker_heading: IZZY

speaker_heading: IZZY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: IZZY

speaker_heading: BARTENDER

text: Barney grabs a bottle himself and refills their glasses.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Where is that asshole?
speaker_heading: IZZY
dialog: Barney, don't embarrass me.

speaker_heading: BARNEY POV
scene_heading: ACROSS THE ROOM - MIRIAM GRANT (28), Gorgeous, classy,

speaker_heading: FATHER IN LAW (0.S.)

speaker_heading: BARNEY

speaker_heading: BARNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't ever tell my father what he
dialog: can or cannot do again.
scene_heading: FATHER IN LAW
dialog: He traumatized the Rabbi's wife--
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: I don't care if he fingered her under

dialog: have your respect.
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 42.
text: Father-In-Law is speechless.
text: And Barney sets out again for Miriam.
scene_heading: INT. RECEPTION HALL - RITZ CARLTON HOTEL - NIGHT

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: We haven't met yet. I'm Barney.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM

dialog: Are you alright?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Fine. Perfect.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: I understand you're in television.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Totally Unnecessary Productions.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: That's a little harsh.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: That's the name of my company.

speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: Your cigar is out.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Oh, that's okay, I wouldn't want it
dialog: to bother you.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: Please, It's a Montecristo.
text: She grabs a box of matches from the table. As she lights

scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 43.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you know why they're called
dialog: Montecristo's?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Not a clue.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
text: Fine cigars are all still rolled by

dialog: task are called "torcedores", and
dialog: they all chip in from their own wages
dialog: to employ 'lectors' - people who
dialog: read them stories as they work.
dialog: Entertainment to make the day pass
dialog: better. At the factory which produces
dialog: this Montecristo, the workers favorite

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Lectors.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: Nice touch, don't you think?

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: YES.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
text: Nothing. The hockey game.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Habs just tied it up. You follow

speaker_heading: MIRIAM

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Are you doing anything later? Wwe

dialog: Lunch at Dal Bolognese on the Piazza

scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 44.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: The bride may take issue with that.
dialog: Anyway, I have to catch my train
dialog: back to New York later
text: She nods, and with perfect manners, rises and extends her hand.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Congratulations again.
text: He stands, takes her hand and would never let go if she didn't
text: take it back. He stares at her walking away until--
speaker_heading: SECOND MRS. P (0.S.)
dialog: Barney?
text: The Second Mrs. P directly behind him.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: SECOND MRS. P
dialog: I see you met Miriam. She's sucha
dialog: snob that one, don't you find?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Yeah - sure - no - why?
speaker_heading: SECOND MRS. P
dialog: She went to McGill with me, works in
dialog: radio now. The kind who subscribes to

dialog: Leon that you don't make pornography.
scene_heading: INT. RECEPTION HALL - RITZ CARLTON HOTEL - NIGHT
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Barney downs yet another Scotch. His tie loose around his

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Thanks for being here, Boogie.
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: I'll never miss any of your weddings.

speaker_heading: BOOGIE (CONT'D)

scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 45.
speaker_heading: BOOGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Classy dame. Smart as a whip too.
speaker_heading: BARNEY

scene_heading: EXT. RITZ CARLTON HOTEL - NIGHT
text: Barney darts out of the Ritz Hotel and jumps into a taxi.

dialog: by foot.
scene_heading: INT. CENTRAL TRAIN STATION - NIGHT
text: Barney, soaking wet, sprints down the stairs into the station.
text: He sees the FLASHING LIGHT indicating the entrance to the

text: UPWARD rolling escalator to sneak onto the platform.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - NIGHT
text: Barney makes his way through the train, passing from car to
text: car, looking for Miriam... whom he finally spots.
text: She's wearing her reading glasses, engrossed in a novel.
text: Barney takes a moment just to watch her. Just being able to
text: look at her makes him feel good.
text: He drops into the seat next to her. She's stunned.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: I like you with glasses.
text: She takes them off. Shuts her book - Herzog by Saul Bellow.
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 46.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: What are you doing here?!
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Run away with me.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Run away with me, or stay with me,
dialog: or I'll go with you--
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: Are you out of your mind?!
speaker_heading: BARNEY
text: I'm heels over head, bent over
dialog: backwards in love with you--
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR (0.S.)
dialog: Leaving Montreal in two minutes!
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: How can you say you're in love with
dialog: me? We just met - on your WEDDING NIGHT.
text: Barney grins from ear to ear, overtaken by an unfamiliar
text: sense of euphoria.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM (CONT'D)
dialog: This isn't funny! Get off this train
dialog: right now.
dialog: Every word he says - every breath between every word -
text: completely sincere and sober:
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: I can't believe this really happens.
dialog: It really does, just like that. And
dialog: I don't care if it happened on my
dialog: wedding night, at a funeral, on my
dialog: death bed. It's happened.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR (0.S.)
dialog: I.D., tickets.
text: Miriam hands over her documents to the conductor
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: I don't have I.D. or a ticket.
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 47.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: Then you'll have to get off the train.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: Go home, Barney. Among other things,
dialog: sobriety and regret are anxiously
dialog: waiting up for you.
text: Barney finally concedes. He stands - the train LURCHES
text: forward as it begins to pull out.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: You look fantastic in that dress.
text: Barney gets off the train.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN PLATFORM - NIGHT
text: Barney runs along with the train as it picks up speed. Miriam
text: sits at the window, but won't look at him.
text: But then her eyes turn to Barney, watching him still chasing
text: after her, unconcerned with how utterly foolish he appears --
text: and she smiles at him.
text: That smile is enough to melt his heart. He runs faster -
text: into a flat-out sprint trying to get back on and then--
text: TRIPS and falls HARD onto the concrete platform.
scene_heading: INT. THE SECOND MRS. P'S PARENTS MANSION - NIGHT
text: The door opens revealing Barney - he's a mess. Ripped pants,
text: bloody knee and palms.
scene_heading: FATHER IN LAW
dialog: We thought you were dead.

dialog: Oh my God, are you okay? We thought

speaker_heading: SECOND MRS. P

speaker_heading: BARNEY

speaker_heading: SECOND MRS. P

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: You didn't have to ask the concierge.

speaker_heading: SECOND MRS. P
dialog: Do you have a Masters degree?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SECOND MRS. P
dialog: Am I embarrassed?
text: She stares him down for a moment.
speaker_heading: SECOND MRS. P (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: To tell you the truth - perplexed.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: By what?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: By you.
dialog: (to cashier)
text: Two double espressos.
dialog: (to Barney)
dialog: You do something awful, but instead

dialog: for something infinitely worse.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: What are you talking about?
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 52.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Are you kidding?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: I'm really not.
speaker_heading: ORGANI -GIRL
dialog: (leaning in)
dialog: My father does the same thing.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Doesn't it make you crazy?
speaker_heading: ORGANI-GIRL
dialog: They just don't listen to anything--
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: (to Organi-Girl)
dialog: Hey, flaxseed - this - is not going
dialog: to happen. No crazies today.
dialog: (to Kate)
dialog: Continue.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Dad, before the recent phone incident
dialog: you got Blair a subscription to "Boy
dialog: Toy" monthly using his work address.
dialog: Before that, you signed him up to an
dialog: Al-Queda website. The man still
dialog: can't fly out of the country.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: I've upset Claire, haven't I?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You've upset Mom. Blair is too much
dialog: of a chicken shit to say anything.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: (kissing her cheek)
dialog: You are truly my proudest achievement.
text: They get their coffees and walk to the door.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: My point is, it's time to lay off

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: He stole her from me.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No he didn't. You got divorced.

scene_heading: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: There was no one rooting for a

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: They're married. Stick to the facts.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: An apology wouldn't hurt either.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Apologize to who?
text: Kate gives up.
speaker_heading: BARNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Why don't you come up to the cottage
dialog: this weekend?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Actually, I have a date.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Nice boy?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No, he's a nasty piece of work.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Funny.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: He's very nice. We'll see. It's
dialog: our third date and I'm not bored
dialog: silly or madly in love. I like him.
dialog: I think that's a sign of maturity.
text: Barney stops walking. Looks around. Confused.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)

text: Something RUSTLES again, this time a little closer. Barney
text: stands, leans on the wood railing, trying to see through the
text: darkness. Waiting for something to appear. Hoping.

scene_heading: FLASHBACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. TV SOUNDSTAGE - DAY - PAST (1978)
text: A young Solange is acting in a scene staged in an obviously

speaker_heading: O'MALLEY

speaker_heading: SOLANGE

speaker_heading: BARNEY

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM

scene_heading: EXT. FLEABAG HOTEL - DAY

speaker_heading: SECOND MRS. P
dialog: Stop. I called the florist. While

dialog: What's her name?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Can we talk about this in the morning?
speaker_heading: SECOND MRS. P
dialog: No. I don't understand what you
dialog: want anymore. Before we got married
dialog: you couldn't keep your hands off me.
dialog: Now it's been months since we made
dialog: love. You say you've never been
dialog: unfaithful, so what is it then?
dialog: (softer)
dialog: On our wedding night I came up behind
dialog: you and you were saying how hopelessly
dialog: in love you were. It was the happiest
dialog: moment of my life. I keep going
dialog: back to that just to have something
dialog: to hold onto.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What happened? Why did you even marry me?
text: He can't bring himself to answer her. It hurts her like

dialog: I'm so ashamed. And you are such a
dialog: liar. Fuck you.

dialog: want from me?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Some paternal wisdom.
speaker_heading: IZZY
dialog: Boychick, listen. I know how hard

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: IZZY
dialog: Maybe you just need to take a step
dialog: back before you do anything rash.
dialog: Let's take a good, hard look at the
dialog: situation. You're married to a well-
dialog: bred woman who's loaded, makes a
dialog: nice, flaky kugel and has a great
dialog: rack. Many successful marriages
dialog: were built on far less.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Can we drop this? Just forget I
dialog: ever said anything.
speaker_heading: IZZY
dialog: She's a tough cookie. If you divorce

dialog: cleaners.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: You know how rich her father is.
dialog: She's going to inherit a shitload of
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: IZZY
dialog: And you think that'll stop her from

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: I don't care.

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: How could you do that to me?
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 67.
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: She did it to me. It was innocent

speaker_heading: BARNEY

speaker_heading: BOOGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you say? Duel at high noon?
dialog: But I don't think we have enough

speaker_heading: BOOGIE

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Both.
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: I'm still working on it.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: You're a fraud.
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: Oh, have I let poor Barney down?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Yeah, you have.
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: Too fucking bad. You know what,

text: A TV hustler, married to a rich man's

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Not so vulgar that you wouldn't bang her.
speaker_heading: BOOGIE

scene_heading: EXT. COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: FUCK YOU.

text: winded and woozy.
speaker_heading: BARNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: What happened to you?
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 70.
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: Nothing. Absolutely nothing happened
dialog: to me; and that's what you take as a
dialog: personal offense. I am not your pet
dialog: project. Not your vicarious life.
dialog: Not your hope.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Not my friend?
text: Boogie doesn't even think to answer. He just swigs from the
text: bottle again.
speaker_heading: BARNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you realize you haven't come close
dialog: to giving me an apology?
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: Let me recommend another book to stock
dialog: your shelf with; "The Life of Heinrich
dialog: Heine", who upon his death bed was
dialog: begged by his loved ones to ask for
dialog: God's forgiveness before he passed.
dialog: But good old Heinrich had only this
dialog: to say: "God will surely forgive me -
dialog: after all, that's his fucking job".
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Don't count on it.
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: I'm going for a swim.
text: Boogie slips on the flippers, waddles onto the dock
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Boogie, stop! You're too drunk and
dialog: you can barely swim anyway. I'll
dialog: shoot, you prick, I will!
text: Barney fires a WARNING SHOT straight up into the air.
speaker_heading: BOOGIE
dialog: There you go!
dialog: But this time shoot it at me you
dialog: fucking coward! See for yourself
dialog: what's really inside this mossy,
dialog: dampened cavity you think is a heart.
dialog: C'mon, do it!
text: Barney stares him down. A silent rage boiling inside. Boogie
text: grins, snaps on the goggles and the snorkel, spreads his
text: arms wide, tilts his head back...
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 71.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Don't you fucking move.
text: Barney drunkenly staggers forward, pointing the gun at Boogie --
text: AND THIS ALL HAPPENS IN HAZY FLASH: Barney TRIPS -- the gun
text: FIRES -- Boogie lets himself FALL backward into the lake.
text: It appears the gun fired into the air, but he could have easily
text: fired in Boogie's direction. We can't be sure.
text: Barney turns and heads back up into the house. We DO NOT

speaker_heading: BARNEY

speaker_heading: O' HEARNE

speaker_heading: BARNEY

speaker_heading: O' HEARNE
dialog: Yeah, you did. So why didn't you

speaker_heading: BARNEY

speaker_heading: BARNEY

speaker_heading: O' HEARNE

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Boogie and I were horsing around.
speaker_heading: O' HEARNE
dialog: By shooting off rounds?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: We were drunk.
speaker_heading: O' HEARNE
dialog: This was after you caught him fucking
dialog: your wife?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: It wasn't like that.
speaker_heading: O' HEARNE
dialog: You shot off the rounds before you

speaker_heading: BARNEY

speaker_heading: O' HEARNE
dialog: After.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 74.

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Yeah, right through his fucking heart,
dialog: Jesus Christ--
speaker_heading: O' HEARNE
dialog: (take notes)
dialog: Now we're getting somewhere.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Are you a complete idiot? Why are
dialog: you wasting your time here? Go find
dialog: him! Have you thought that he might
dialog: be hurt somewhere?
speaker_heading: O' HEARNE
dialog: And what about this piece of ass you're
dialog: keeping in New York - the florist
dialog: gave us her name - Miriam Grant...
dialog: Barney grabs O'Hearne --
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: You keep her out of this--
text: O'Hearne drives a knee into his groin, then lays one into
text: Barney's face, sending him to the floor
speaker_heading: O' HEARNE
dialog: Two bullets shot from your gun just
dialog: after you caught your best friend
dialog: banging your wife. You threatened
dialog: to kill them both, and now he's
dialog: missing. Unless you ate him, we'll
dialog: find the body before sundown. So
dialog: tell me where the body is and I'll
dialog: say you were cooperative and
dialog: remorseful, you'll get yourself a

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Go to hell.

speaker_heading: O' HEARNE

scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 75.
speaker_heading: IZZY
dialog: I got a call from my son.
speaker_heading: O' HEARNE
dialog: Very sweet, but he attacked an officer

speaker_heading: IZZY
dialog: From where I'm standing this looks

speaker_heading: O' HEARNE
dialog: Like you're one to talk.
speaker_heading: IZZY
dialog: You leave your hands off him.
speaker_heading: O' HEARNE
dialog: He's goin' down for murder.
speaker_heading: IZZY
dialog: Really? It seems those razor-sharp

speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY

speaker_heading: MIRIAM

dialog: You hardly know me.

speaker_heading: BARNEY

dialog: Alphonse Daudet - nice reference, by
dialog: the way.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: I'm an idiot.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: Don't be so modest. You obviously

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Never.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: So the champagne and roses are for
dialog: another woman?
text: Barney lifts his throbbing head to see for himself. Sure
text: enough there's two bottles of champagne and two dozen roses.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Oh God...
text: He covers his face and begins to MOAN. Miriam finds it all
text: utterly amusing. She pries his hands from his face.

speaker_heading: BARNEY

speaker_heading: MIRIAM

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Anything.
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 83.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: See, that's what scares me about
dialog: you. Don't answer ‘anything’. That's
dialog: not real, and life is real. It's
dialog: made up of little things - minutes
dialog: and hours and errands and naps and
dialog: routine, and that has to be enough.
dialog: After all you've done to pursue me,

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: That's a reasonable question.
text: Barney thinks hard. He knows he needs to come up with

speaker_heading: BARNEY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BLAIR
dialog: Really? Where?
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
text: At WZAJ. It's a little jazz station.
speaker_heading: BLAIR

speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: You're kidding? He gave me my first

speaker_heading: BLAIR
dialog: Isn't that coincidence. The universe

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: I was going to throw some burgers on

speaker_heading: BLAIR
dialog: I'm a vegan, but thank you.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: A what? Is that treatable?
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: I could make a salad.
speaker_heading: BLAIR

dialog: It was just a loose distributor wire.

scene_heading: INT. MICHAEL'S LOFT - BROOKLYN - NIGHT

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: (yelling at TV)
dialog: Useless goddamn pansy ref, get your

text: Caroline enters - business suit, briefcase. A belligerent

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 90.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: What? The woman hates me.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Maybe she wouldn't hate you if you
dialog: didn't behave like a child.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Chicken and the egg.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No, dad, it's not. You can't keep
dialog: acting this way. Not with us, or
dialog: Mom and Blair.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: So you're speaking for your mother now?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Just leave them alone already. She's
dialog: not coming back to you.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: If that's what you're so angry about,
dialog: then fine. Tell your mother from this
text: moment on she is forgotten. Erased.
text: Nothing but a wisp of gray on the
dialog: otherwise full, dark mane of my life.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'm sure she'll appreciate the sentiment
dialog: if not the poetry. Good-night.
text: Michael starts to walk out--
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Michael...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: What have you told her about me?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I tell her everything. That's what
dialog: couples do.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Spare me the sermon. I see the way
text: she looks at me.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What are you talking about?
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 91.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: I saw O'Hearne's book on her night
text: table. She can't even be bothered
dialog: to hide it from me. How could you
dialog: let her read that? She even has all
text: these pages dog-eared in it...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: When she asks about Boogie, what do
dialog: you tell her?
text: Michael doesn't answer
dialog: Barney readies himself for one of the hardest things he's
dialog: ever had to ask.
speaker_heading: BARNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you think I could have possibly
dialog: done that?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Only you really know.
text: Michael exits. That devastates Barney. He simply deflates.

speaker_heading: MIRIAM

dialog: That's Taylor Gates.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: (re: honey)
dialog: Tell me if this is still good.
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 92.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: She was my intern before we got
dialog: married. She could barely string
text: two words together.
text: Miriam drips the honey into her tea without smelling it. She
text: passes it to Barney who is still not convinced it's edible.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Honey doesn't go bad.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Ever?
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: Archeologists found honey in Egyptian
dialog: tombs thousands of years old and it
dialog: was still edible.
text: Barney shrugs, uses the honey. Miriam curls herself into
text: the corner of the sofa, feeling depressed.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Everyone seems to be doing pretty
dialog: interesting things nowadays.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Giving birth and raising two amazing

speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: But it doesn't command much respect
dialog: now does it?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Miriam- -
speaker_heading: MIRIAM

speaker_heading: BARNEY

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: BARNEY

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: He had to move out eventually.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: I know. That's not it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I want to go back to work. I've been
dialog: thinking about this for a while.
dialog: Blair said he can get me freelance
dialog: work. It's just research and writing
dialog: for now but it could lead to other
text: things. Maybe even on air.
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 94.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: And I'm sure Blair will do everything
dialog: he can for you.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: Stop that.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Are you unhappy?
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: No. Not in the way you're trying to
dialog: get at.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Then in which way?
text: JEAN THE MAITRE'D comes over.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: How is everything?
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: Excellent, as always.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: May I get you anything else?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: We're fine. Thank you, Jean.
text: Jean leaves. Barney sulks, polishing off his wine.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: I knew how you would take this.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: It's just that I've worked this hard
dialog: so you wouldn't ever have to. So you
dialog: could be here with the kids and me.
dialog: We both agreed that was important.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: It was important. But Michael's
dialog: gone, soon Kate will be too, and
dialog: you're as grown up as you'll ever
dialog: be. Where does that leave me? I
dialog: need more stimulation in my life. I
dialog: have to believe I can be something
text: other than just a wife and mother.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: I'll quit working.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 95.
speaker_heading: BARNEY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: You can't just fix this like you do
dialog: everything else. I don't want you to.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I need to do this. Can you try and
dialog: understand?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Of course. Whatever you want to do,
dialog: I'm behind it. A hundred percent.

speaker_heading: BLAIR

speaker_heading: MIRIAM

scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 98.
speaker_heading: IZZY
dialog: Thanks, but no thanks.
speaker_heading: BARNEY

speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: Barney, please don't smoke that.
dialog: You know it irritates Blair's asthma.

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Just because you're gay, doesn't
dialog: mean you can't be assertive.
speaker_heading: BLAIR
dialog: I'm not gay.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: I didn't think so, but Miriam--
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 105.
speaker_heading: BLAIR

speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: What's with you? And don't say
dialog: "what?". Let's just skip that whole
dialog: part, okay?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: I was giving him a few life lessons.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: By telling him I think he's gay?
dialog: And who even jokes about that anymore?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: I don't want to fight about Cher
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: We're not fighting about Blair.
dialog: We're fighting about you.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Why?
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 106.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: Getting Leo to come in doesn't negate
dialog: all the other interviews you've missed
dialog: to get drunk and watch the game, or
dialog: all the dinners you've ruined because
dialog: you're incorrigible with my friends.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: It doesn't?
dialog: Miriam is NOT amused.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: I'm going to visit Michael for a

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: What? When?
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: Next weekend.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Okay, I'll take the week off.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: No. I think a little time apart will
dialog: do us both good.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: What? Where is this coming from?
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: We've hardly been away from each
dialog: other since we've been married.
dialog: It'll be good for us to circulate
dialog: the air in here a little. It's only
dialog: a week - okay?
text: Barney nods but he's not happy about this. Actually, he's

scene_heading: INT/EXT. TAXI CAB - MORNING - PRESENT DAY

scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - TOTALLY UNNECESSARY PRODUCTIONS - MORNING
text: Barney enters the office in a foul mood. The RECEPTIONIST

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: My car was stolen. Find out what I

speaker_heading: O'MALLEY

speaker_heading: SOLANGE (0.S.)

text: revealing, tight outfit her character would have worn.
speaker_heading: SOLANGE (CONT'D)
dialog: And that everyone, completes the
dialog: first episode of our 30th season! !
text: The whole crew bursts into applause.
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 108.
text: Even though it's Barney's show, the merriment around him
text: seems to only make him more lonely and bitter. He ducks out.
scene_heading: INT. BARNEY'S OFFICE - LATER
text: Barney's rifling through drawers and shelves looking for
text: something. He's frustrated, angry. SOLANGE enters.
speaker_heading: SOLANGE
dialog: Why did you leave the set? I thought
dialog: you might want to give a speech.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Nope.
text: Solange stands there grinning from ear to ear, eager to tell
text: him something. Barney continues his searching.
speaker_heading: BARNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm not interested.
speaker_heading: SOLANGE
dialog: You don't even know what I'm going
dialog: to say.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: I'm not interested in what you're
dialog: going to say. That's the point.
speaker_heading: SOLANGE
dialog: What if it were something really
dialog: interesting?
text: This is annoying the hell out of him.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Right now, I'm in a state of complete
dialog: disinterest to all things. Is that
dialog: clear or should I have someone
dialog: translate?
text: Solange drops an AIRPLANE TICKET in front of Barney.
speaker_heading: SOLANGE
dialog: I'm going to Bulgaria. First Class.
text: Barney looks at the ticket.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: You haven't flown in thirty years.

text: Solange follows...
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 109.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Barney goes to the coffee machine. One of those automatic
dialog: ones where you press a button and it makes you a latte
text: He makes his choice. The machine REVS and GRINDS, forcing
text: them to raise their voices.
speaker_heading: SOLANGE
dialog: I've been in systematic
dialog: desensitization therapy to get over
dialog: my fear of flying.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Are you out of your mind? Some idiots
dialog: keep printing thirty year old pictures
dialog: of you in bikinis so old Bolsheviks
dialog: can have something to jerk off to and
dialog: you're going to fly half way around
dialog: the world because of it? What do you
dialog: imagine it will be like - that you'll
text: step off the plane right onto the
dialog: tarmac, Chanel glasses, Hermes scarf
dialog: wrapped around your new 'do', a gaggle
dialog: of paparazzi awaiting your arrival?
dialog: You're a hundred and eighty years old
dialog: Solange, get over it.
text: The coffee machine stops. Dead silence. The entire office
text: watching them. Solange fights back tears.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What the hell is wrong with you?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: With me? My friend Leo just died!

speaker_heading: BARNEY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: I've learned my lesson. Come back

speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: I wasn't punishing you. And you
dialog: shouldn't have done that without talking

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: What does that mean? You're not sure?
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: Why is everything all or nothing

text: Miriam slices through the moist, warm chocolate sponge.
text: Carries it past her lips and savors... Mmmm. Heaven.
text: She opens her eyes to see--
text: BARNEY'S HAND hovering above his cutlery. He can't remember
dialog: which one he is supposed to use.
text: Miriam hands him his fork.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: And they eat cake.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM

scene_heading: INT. RITZ CARLTON HOTEL GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER
text: Miriam returns from the washroom and is panicked when Barney
text: is missing from the table. She races over to Jean.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: Jean, did you see Barney?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: No, Madame, he paid the bill, but
text: forgot his wallet on the table.
text: Jean hands her Barney's old, beat up WALLET.
text: A SMALL PIECE OF PAPER is sticking out of the wallet. Without
text: thinking why - she pulls it out. The paper old and cracked.
text: She carefully unfolds it--
scene_heading: INSERT - THE PAPER
scene_heading: "CANADIENS 2 BRUINS 1 IN OVERTIME. CONGRATULATIONS. MIRIAM"
text: It's the note she passed to him the night they first met.
dialog: He's carried this on him all these years. Seeing it literally
text: takes her breath away.
scene_heading: INT. RECEPTION HALL - RITZ CARLTON HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER
text: She enters the same hall where she and Barney first met.
text: Barney is standing there, grinning from ear to ear as if
dialog: nothing is wrong.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: I couldn't find you, I got so scared.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: It's beautiful in here isn't it?
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: You forgot your wallet at the table.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Look at you, you're practically
dialog: shaking.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: I thought I lost you.
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 124.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Lost me? Hey, the kids are gone,
dialog: why don't we go home, curl up in
dialog: bed, watch a movie...
text: Miriam cocks her head, wondering why he said that.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: The kids...?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Yeah, the kids. You're the one who
dialog: dropped them off at school. Are you
dialog: okay?
dialog: (off her crying)
dialog: Oh my love, don't cry.
text: He pulls her close. She falls into his embrace, having
text: realized he's forgotten they ever split up.
speaker_heading: BARNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Have I not loved you enough today?
text: She buries her face in his neck to stop from completely
text: breaking down.
speaker_heading: BARNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: So what do you say? Can we play hooky?
text: She can't bring herself to shatter his fragile reality.
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: Let's get you home.
text: He takes her by the arm and walks her out of the lobby, as
dialog: happy as he's ever been.

text: It was in a ravine on Mount Orford

speaker_heading: (MORE )
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 125.
speaker_heading: REPORTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Moscovitch, who went missing over
dialog: thirty years ago. His friend, Barney
dialog: Panofsky, producer of the long running
dialog: soap "O'Malley Of The North", was
text: the only suspect in the case.
text: IDENTIFIED ON SCREEN, A PATHOLOGIST RESPONDS TO REPORTERS.
speaker_heading: PATHOLOGIST
dialog: Our findings show that Mr. Moscovitch
dialog: died from either being severely beaten
text: with a blunt instrument or had fallen
text: from a considerable height. There
dialog: were NO gunshot wounds whatsoever.
text: O'HEARNE IS MOBBED BY A THRONG OF REPORTERS ON THE STREET.
speaker_heading: O' HEARNE
dialog: Just because he didn't shoot him,
dialog: doesn't mean he didn't kill him.
dialog: This just brings us one step closer
dialog: to proving the truth.
text: A LONG SHOT OF THE HILLSIDE WHERE THE REMAINS WERE FOUND.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Police say the pathologist's findings
dialog: don't shed any new light onto who

dialog: death --
text: As the report continues we PULL OUT from the TV into--
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: (on TV)
dialog: But at least one part of a thirty
text: year mystery has finally been solved.
text: Where Kate is pouring them each a tea. Michael has a thick
text: DOCUMENT in his hands that he's looking over
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Okay, what is this regular payment
dialog: out of the company?
text: Kate takes the document.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Oh, that. For years now, Daddy has
dialog: been paying some guy to make up those
text: fake tabloid items about Solange.
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 126.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I don't know. To make her feel good.
dialog: He even had them faxed from Bulgaria,
dialog: just in case she checked the number.
dialog: Daddy asked me to keep it going.
text: Kate drips honey into her tea. Hands it to Michael.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (smelling honey)
dialog: Is this honey still good?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Honey doesn't go bad.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Ever?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Ever.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Where did you hear that?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I don't remember, but it's true.
text: Michael uses the honey and follows Kate out to the --
scene_heading: INT. DEN - COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS
text: Where they pass the well known sketch by Clara.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I can't believe he's leaving that to
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: KATE
text: As if running out on their wedding
dialog: to chase mom wasn't enough of a rub.
dialog: You know she hated that thing?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: She's not gonna hate it when she
dialog: finds out how much it's worth.
dialog: They continue out to the --
scene_heading: INT. SUNROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: MOUNDS OF PAPERWORK everywhere. Michael and Kate sit. He
text: passes her a flagged contract from one of the paper piles.
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 127.
text: While she signs the pages, Michael looks out onto the lake.
dialog: It's a picture perfect day.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What do you want to do about the
dialog: cottage?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: We're never selling this cottage.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yeah. I agree.
text: She finishes signing the agreement. Hands it back.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Okay, done. What's next?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "To my wife, Miriam Grant Panofsky,
dialog: I leave our city condo, the original
dialog: painting by my late friend, Leo
dialog: Fasoli, and the adjoining plot to my
dialog: own in Mount Royal cemetery where my
dialog: wish is for her to buried along side
dialog: me"
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He shouldn't have included that.
dialog: It's not fair to her. She's married
dialog: to Blair.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Only until death do them part.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: There's one last thing, but it's not
dialog: relevant anymore. He left Boogie
dialog: money to publish any original writings
dialog: of his choosing when he should return.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: See? He always hoped Boogie would
dialog: come back.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: That doesn't mean anything.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Of course it does. Why would he
dialog: leave Boogie money if he killed him?
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 128.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: So no one would think he did.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Stop it. He didn't do it. Why can't
dialog: you let go of this already?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You brought it up. I'm just saying
dialog: that we'll never really know what
dialog: happened.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: He's our father. What else do you
dialog: need to know?
dialog: It's a touchy subject he'd rather not get into. Michael
text: stares out at the lake --
speaker_heading: MICHAEL POV
text: BARNEY sitting on a lawn chair by the lake.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'm going to go down to the lake.
text: Michael exits.
scene_heading: EXT. COTTAGE - DAY
text: Michael walks to the lake and sits beside BARNEY.
text: Barney's mind is now almost completely gone. He doesn't
text: even react to Michael's presence.
text: Barney is slowly trying to peel a BANANA from the WRONG END.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Try it this way.
text: Michael turns the Banana over for him. Barney looks at it
text: oddly. Turns it back over again.
text: Michael and Barney look out ACROSS THE LAKE where a young
text: family with two children play with a BEACH BALL in the water
text: From here they look much like Barney's family did years ago.
text: Michael takes out a cigar from his breast pocket. Clips and
text: lights it.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Here, just don't tell Kate.
text: He exchanges the banana for the cigar. Barney is able to
dialog: smoke it just fine.
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 129.
text: Michael hears a RUMBLING in the distance. He spots a WATER
text: PLANE approaching. His eyes light up with excitement.
text: The plane descends toward the lake. Floating in the middle
text: of the lake is the BEACH BALL, having gotten away from the
dialog: young family previously.
text: The plane's HULL opens and SWALLOWS up water, ALONG WITH THE
text: BEACH BALL. It pulls back up into the sky, the hull closes.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you remember how much we loved
dialog: that when we were kids?
text: The WATER PLANE is still in the air and has begun to swing
text: back around.
text: It opens its hull and drops its water load - along with the
text: BEACH BALL onto the side of a MOUNTAIN which we can easily
text: identify as the spot where they found Boogie's remains.
text: Watching this, it suddenly comes together for Michael.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Boogie... Oh my God... dad, did you
dialog: see that?
text: He turns to Barney who, much to his surprise, is watching
dialog: the plane too.
text: Barney continues to puff on his cigar, but his thoughts, if
dialog: any, are a mystery to all.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry, dad... I'm so sorry...
text: Michael takes his father's hand, holding it, then pressing
text: it to his forehead just as Barney did with Izzy when he died.
speaker_heading: KATE
text: Standing on the deck, watching them. Tears in her eyes.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
text: Bright, green leaves on a tree moving with a gentle breeze.
text: A perfect blue sky behind them.
text: Blades of thick, green grass flutter.
text: The sounds of footsteps on a rocky path.
text: MOVING WITH MIRIAM - as she slowly walks uphill carrying
text: fresh flowers.
scene_heading: WHITE 10-23-09 130.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - GRAVE SITE - DAY
text: She reaches the highest peak on the only hillside in the
text: cemetery. A view of the entire city. Maybe the most
dialog: picturesque spot ever.
text: She mutters a silent prayer before laying the flowers down.
text: Her eyes moist with tears, she grazes the tombstone with her
text: fingertips, then starts back down the hill.
text: We remain on the hillside and move toward the grave.... the
