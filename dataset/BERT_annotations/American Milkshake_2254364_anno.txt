speaker_heading: COACH DALE

speaker_heading: COACH DALE
dialog: OK, we're gonna come out in a

speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: Starting at point guard. Number

dialog: 
text: Jolie trots the isle of his teammates. Wendel stoically slaps
text: fives and gives pounds as he takes center floor.
dialog: 
text: He takes in the experience - looking at the huge crowd in the

dialog: 
text: Jolie's smile fades, and we see he has spotted Henrietta in

scene_heading: INT. BLAZERS GYM - GAME TIME

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COACH DALE
dialog: Jolie! Get back in the game! Take
dialog: Pistol.
dialog: 
text: Jolie barrels toward check-in ripping off his warm-ups (top
text: and bottom), squats at mid court - the buzzer sounds - he
text: taps Pistol an underhand five.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOLIE
dialog: Who you got?
dialog: 
text: Pistol points at a huge BLOND DUDE who pounds his chest
text: ferociously.
dialog: 
text: A buzzer indicating a substitution.
dialog: 
text: Jolie is passed the ball - he puts a quick move on his man,
text: jab step and cross, slicing through the lane. He fakes a pass
text: behind his back and goes up for a lay up when his shot is
text: blocked and he is slammed violently by a help-side defender.
dialog: 
text: The ref blows his whistle hard and gestures - calls a foul.
dialog: 
text: Jolie is on the ground in pain, holding his hand, wincing.

dialog:

speaker_heading: MR. AARONSON

speaker_heading: ELLIOTT

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOLIE
dialog: Really? Dang.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLIOTT
dialog: Well she's not literally on a

speaker_heading: MR. AARONSON

speaker_heading: JOLIE

dialog:

speaker_heading: JOLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: You just gotta learn to distribute.

speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
dialog: You really think I don't know how
dialog: to do that shit?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOLIE
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
dialog: That test isn't why I was so mad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOLIE
dialog: What is it then? You can talk to
dialog: me. You can tell me anything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
dialog: I wasn't invited with you guys to
dialog: the Tyson fight tomorrow. The one
dialog: on pay TV. I heard everyone was

dialog: mean what's the deal?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOLIE
dialog: What? You mean the Bowe fight?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
dialog: Yeah. Bowe, Tyson, whatever. The
dialog: point is the whole team's going.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOLIE
dialog: Yeah. It's pretty much just a team
dialog: thing though.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
dialog: No it's not. Wendel, Arius, and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOLIE
dialog: Oh. I didn't know that. Well, why
dialog: don't I just call you when I figure

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
dialog: Well the fight is at eight, right?
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOLIE
dialog: Is it?

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
dialog: Yeah. And everyone's going to

speaker_heading: JOLIE
dialog: Oh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
dialog: Yeah.

speaker_heading: JOLIE

dialog: together anymore.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
speaker_heading: (SUDDENLY ANGRY)
dialog: You know Spud Web only gets a
dialog: roster spot because he's a circus
dialog: freak. He shouldn't be there, and
dialog: that's why he sells tickets. Don't
dialog: you get it. He's not good, he's
dialog: just a draw. Is that what you want
dialog: to be, a circus freak?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOLIE
text: He won the dunk contest. The guy's
dialog: a beast. You're way out of your
dialog: league.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
dialog: The league is about making money.
dialog: Jolie, the only reason you even got
dialog: on varsity is because your Dad paid
dialog: for the new uniforms. You never
dialog: would have made it even with
dialog: Francisco getting arrested. Don't
dialog: you realize that?
dialog: 73.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOLIE
dialog: No he didn't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
dialog: Yes he did. They cost over two
dialog: thousand dollars. How could you not
dialog: know that? I mean you made Varsity
dialog: at Blair after being cut from JV
dialog: last year. When have you ever seen
dialog: that happen?
dialog: 
text: The news hits Jolie hard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOLIE
dialog: That's not true. Where did you hear
dialog: that?

speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
dialog: My Dad talking to your dad on the

dialog: 
text: Jolie looks at his bandaged hand - lost in deep depressing
dialog: thought.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
dialog: I still love you, though. None of
dialog: that matters to me.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOLIE
speaker_heading: (VOICE OVER)
dialog: It must have been good for
dialog: Henrietta too, because afterwords,
dialog: she didn't mention joining the team
dialog: to the Bowe fight, she didn't
dialog: mention Christine, she didnt
dialog: mention nothing.
dialog: 
text: As they drive off Jolie looks back at Henrietta's home
text: getting smaller and smaller. A speed hump sign in the
text: foreground, and a basketball hoop set up on the street.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOLIE
speaker_heading: (VOICE OVER)
dialog: Still though, I was worried she'd

dialog: didn't invite her to this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOLIE
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAROON
dialog: But it sounds like she was really

speaker_heading: JOLIE
dialog: Yeah, when I first got there she

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAROON (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, she's pregnant and it

speaker_heading: JOLIE
dialog: Yeah - the need for something.
dialog: 
text: They cackle.

speaker_heading: HAROON

speaker_heading: HAROON
dialog: Ah man. Ah man. That is crazy.

dialog: Muhammad Ali in his prime.
dialog: 76.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: B &amp; W Muhammad Ali posters fill the walls. Ali stands in
text: glory over his unconscious opponents, or lays blows to their
text: faces, sweat frozen in the air as it flies from their bodies.
dialog: 
text: The food is laid out cafeteria style. The tables and booths
text: are a step above any fast food joint. Televisions hang from
text: every angle, some even face the streets to attract

dialog: 
text: On every television, without exception: a boxing match. Bowe
text: versus a large white guy, Golota.
dialog: 
text: Watching are about a hundred and fifty black people of all

dialog: 
text: The crowd subdued by the early rounds.

dialog: 
text: We see the fight itself, close up on the television:
dialog: 
text: Bowe has Golota cornered.
dialog: 
text: A couple of blows are deflected and Golota, the lug, clinches
text: Bowe in a bear hug.
dialog: 
text: Disappointment from the crowd.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WENDEL
text: A sucker move.
dialog: 
text: The crowd roars again, but this time they rush to the windows

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT/EXT. MUHAMMAD ALI'S CHICKEN
dialog: 
text: Two black kids wrestle on the sidewalk.
dialog: 
text: We see Haroon behind them on the pay-phone, watching.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: In the windows everyone cheers them on, pounding the
text: Plexiglas. Including Jolie and Christine.
dialog: 
text: Above them in the windows are two televisions of the fight,
text: that face the street. In the TV, the boxers and the referee
text: shuffle aimlessly around the ring.
dialog: 
text: The kids on the sidewalk are scrappy; they grab and stretch
text: at shirts; neither can escape the others' grasp.
dialog: 
text: They reach a stalemate, knotted awkwardly and exhausted; fury
text: replaced by heavy breathing; one has a bloody nose and a huge
text: scratch on the cheek
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FIGHT KID 1
dialog: You ripped my Polo shit,
dialog: motherfucker! You ripped my Polo
dialog: shit!

speaker_heading: FIGHT KID 2

text: mellows, slowly they bore, returning to their seats.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly on the television there is a whirlwind of action and
text: punches are chaotically thrown by both fighters.
dialog: 78.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The crowd erupts at the televisions.
dialog: 
text: The kids on the sidewalk remain tangled, breathing hard.
dialog: 
text: On television Golota throws a combo of blows below the belt
text: and Bowe tumbles to the mat. The referee jumps and waves
text: furiously at the penalty which he reports to the judges in a
text: series of arm waves and animated hand signals.
dialog: 
text: We see the people in the front rows at the boxing match,
text: almost all white, and wearing glamorous suits and dresses.
dialog: 
text: The patrons go berserk.
dialog: 
text: Extreme close-up on the replay: Golota pounding Bowe in the

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOLIE
speaker_heading: (VOICE OVER)
dialog: Strangely Henrietta never showed. I

speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
dialog: Oh yeah. Let him in.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOLIE
dialog: Hey. What's up? Uh. I brought over

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
dialog: Did Jaguar 64 finally come out?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOLIE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
dialog: Jolie. Thank you.
speaker_heading: (SMELLS IT)
dialog: It smells like you. Someday little
dialog: Benny will wear it. That's what
dialog: I've decided to name him, Benny.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOLIE
dialog: Oh. Wow. Well. Uh, before you name
dialog: him, I was kinda thinking maybe we
dialog: could discuss, uh,
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOLIE
dialog: Well,
dialog: (Jolie sits next to her)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 99.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I was also thinking maybe we could
dialog: talk about the possibility of you
dialog: giving up your baby for adoption?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
dialog: Jolie. How could you even say that?
dialog: I've wanted a family of my own, a
dialog: real family, since as long as I can
dialog: remember. There is no way I could
dialog: ever give little Benny away. Ever.
dialog: In a million years. Do you
dialog: understand that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOLIE
dialog: Well. Yeah. I guess so. But at the
dialog: same time, it just doesn't seem
dialog: like the smartest thing. I've
dialog: already found a really wealthy,
dialog: well educated, good meaning couple
dialog: who'd like to meet up with you
dialog: about it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
dialog: Never. No way Jolie. End of
dialog: discussion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOLIE
dialog: Don't you even want to think it
dialog: over for a few days? I mean, look
dialog: how lucky your parents are to have
dialog: you. You'd be making some couple
dialog: just as happy. And your child would
dialog: have more opportunities. I mean
dialog: you're still in High School, know
dialog: what I mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
dialog: Jolie, I can't even believe you're
dialog: suggesting that? Dont you see how
dialog: racist that is?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOLIE
dialog: What?
dialog: 
text: Jolie is silent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
dialog: Now do something to cheer me up. I
dialog: am totally offended you wanted to
dialog: give away my baby.
dialog: 
text: Jolie sits in silence for a moment, pondering his situation.
dialog: 
text: He stands up and heads to the door, demoralized.
dialog: 100.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Then he turns and looks at Henrietta on the bed.
dialog: 
text: Jolie looks at her bulging belly, much of it exposed.
