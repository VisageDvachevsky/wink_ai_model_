scene_heading: INT. OLD RAIGE APARTMENT - DAY
text: THE SOUND OF THE AIR RAID ALARM IS REVERBERATING THROUGH THE
text: AIR. NINE-YEAR-OLD KITAI has stopped playing in his room. He
text: moves the hair from his eyes. He looks out and sees the
text: walkway outside. This is an apartment only two floors from
dialog: the ground.
text: He sees his sister SENSHI, 19, running along the walkway -
text: moving people hurriedly.
text: Nine-year-old Kitai sits frightened. Senshi returns to the
text: apartment. She is a young Ranger. She is in uniform, holding
text: a cutlass. She looks to her little brother.
speaker_heading: SENSHI
dialog: Kit, we have to go. Right now.
scene_heading: SUDDENLY THERE IS A LOUD TERRIFYING SCREECHING SOUND - A
text: CREATURE SOUND. Nine-year-old Kitai covers his ears.
speaker_heading: KITAL
dialog: Is that..?
speaker_heading: SENSHI
dialog: They surprised us. Sent ships.
dialog: Dropped those things. You’re not
dialog: afraid, are you?
speaker_heading: KITAL
dialog: No... Yes.
text: ANOTHER SHRIEK. CLOSER. No way he’s not afraid of that sound.
speaker_heading: SENSHI
dialog: Kit, get under the bed.
text: Nine-year-old Kitai does as his sister says. Senshi’s eyes
text: search her little brother’s room. She sees a rectangular
text: glass box with plants in it. It is covered. She finds a
text: remote on the table. She presses a button. The lid opens and
dialog: closes.
text: Senshi straps her cutlass expertly to her back. It
text: magnetically sticks. She pulls all the plants out of the
text: glass case. She pulls the case across the floor and turns it
text: on its side. She shoves it under the bed with Kitai.
speaker_heading: SENSHI
dialog: Climb in here, okay? It won’t be
dialog: able to smell you.
text: Nine-year-old Kitai does as he’s told. She hands him the
text: remote. She hands him an extra cutlass from her bag.
scene_heading: AFTER EARTH Revised Yellow 2/24/12 2.
text: Senshi grabs her little brother's face. Her beautiful eyes
dialog: are emotional and dead serious.
speaker_heading: SENSHI
dialog: Don’t come out. No matter what.
dialog: That’s an order.
text: Nine-year-old Kitai nods, eyes filling with water.
speaker_heading: KITAL
dialog: Sens--
scene_heading: ANOTHER SCREECH, THIS TIME MUCH CLOSER.
text: Senshi hits the remote in Kitai’s hands. The glass box
text: closes. Nine-year-old Kitai watches his sister stand. She
text: pulls the cutlass from her back. Her fingers tap a pattern on
text: the cutlass’s handle that reads, “Cutlass C-6.” The cutlass’s
text: thousands of steel-like fibers extend on either side into
text: razor-sharp points. The cutlass is now six feet long.
text: THERE IS A SHADOW THAT PASSES OVER THE OTHER ROOM OF THE
speaker_heading: APARTMENT.
text: Senshi moves into the other room. She spins the cutlass in
dialog: her hand.
text: Senshi is partially obscured by our view from under the bed.
text: WE SEE THE CREATURE ENTER OFF THE WALKWAY.
text: We just get a glimpse of its enormous, six-legged body as it
text: enters the apartment.
text: We get a glimpse of Senshi nervously moving around in the
text: room, staring at it. Senshi moves forward bravely. Tries to
dialog: strike it.
text: Furniture gets thrown in the room. Senshi expertly wields her
text: cutlass. She gets hidden momentarily from our view through
text: the doorway. WE SEE THE CREATURE’S ARM REACH OUT. Senshi
text: parkours off the corner of the room away from it.
text: And then we see Senshi get struck.
text: Nine-year-old Kitai’s face contorts in terror.
text: Senshi is thrown across the room. Senshi is dazed. She tries
text: to stand. She screams as the creature descends on her. She is
text: obscured from sight by its huge body.
text: Kitai taps a pattern on the handle of the cutlass in his
text: hands. It extends, razor-sharp at the ends.
scene_heading: AFTER EARTH Revised Yellow 2/24/12 3.
text: He is terrified as he clutches the weapon. He doesn’t move
text: from his hiding place. Tears stream down Kitai’s face.
text: The creature POUNCES AGAIN, then it’s on her, and Kitai hears
text: her VOICE, no longer a Ranger, but a girl --
speaker_heading: SENSHI (0.S.)
dialog: Dad...
text: When the creature moves, we see Senshi’s bloodied, still body
text: in the corner of the room.
text: There is the movement of people outside on the walkway. The
text: creature strangely grabs Senshi’s lifeless body and holds it
text: up against the window of the apartment. We hear the group
text: outside the apartment start screaming in terror.
text: The creature looks around and moves after the people outside.
text: Nine-year-old Kitai stares at the body of his sister. Her
text: mangled face stares back at him.

text: He looks at a holographic picture on his desk. It is a family
text: picture. A nine-year-old Kitai, his father, mother, and the
text: fifteen-year-old Senshi.
text: Kitai gets up. He touches his hand to the figure of Senshi.

text: THERE IS SILENCE. The Rangers look at each other, surprised

text: AND THEN THE POD EXPLODES WITH VIOLENT SOUNDS AND MOVEMENT.
text: THE ORGANIC POD MOVES UNDER THE TENSION WIRES HOLDING IT.
text: Kitai sees the whitish skin of the creature UN-CAMOUFLAGE

speaker_heading: CYPHER
dialog: That's headed in our direction.
speaker_heading: NAVIGATOR
dialog: Yes, sir, but at that distance-
speaker_heading: CYPHER
dialog: I detected graviton vibrations in

dialog: enough to generate its own

speaker_heading: NAVIGATOR
dialog: Yes, sir, but... You detected...
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: CYPHER
dialog: Graviton build-up could be a

text: DIFFICULT to breathe. A digital readout on the mask blinks -
dialog: Low Oxygen 15% - Caution.
text: He brings the mask back up to his face and takes a deep gulp
text: of oxygen. He then tightens his mask and moves into the
dialog: aisle.
text: He sees a body tangled between seats in impossible

text: terrified. He moves up the aisle - another body crushed under
text: a section of ship.
scene_heading: AFTER EARTH Revised Green 3/19/12 44,

text: BEEEEEP! BEEEEP! BANG! BZZZZZZ!
text: KITAI SPINS STARTLED - THERE IS A LOUD GRINDING SOUND AS TWO
text: SETS OF AIRLOCK DOORS BEGIN CLOSING IN THE PASSENGER SECTION.
text: THE BODY OF A DEAD RANGER is pushed by the heavy doors
text: beginning to close. Kitai watches as the lifeless corpse is
text: shoved outside the cabin, but the arm gets stuck in the doors
text: preventing them from closing. There is a tattoo on the man’s
text: hand with the name “Anna” on it. The doors beep and buzz
text: incessantly. He is transfixed and horrified.
text: A computer voice repeats, “Remove Obstruction.”
text: Kitai slowly approaches the dead man's arm. Kitai bends down
text: and picks up a cutlass, extends it to full-out, then uses it
text: to shove the hand outside the cabin.
text: THE DOORS CLOSE WITH A THUD AND A SUCTION SOUND. WE HEAR AIR
text: BEING BLOWN HARD THROUGH VENTS.
scene_heading: Computer Voice: “REPRESSURIZING COMPLETE.”

dialog: *
text: HE SEES HIS FATHER'S HAND ON THE GROUND.
text: Kitai rushes through the opening and lifts the first piece of *

text: ground. There is a broken section of the ship lying across
text: his legs. Kitai tries to lift it. It doesn't budge.
text: He looks around. He finds a long metal rod that has fallen
text: from the ceiling. He wedges between the ground and the debris
text: and lifts with all his strength. The broken section of ship
text: lifts off his father's legs. Kitai takes small steps as he
text: lifts the debris until it is vertical and tips over away from
text: his father. IT FALLS WITH A DANGEROUS SLAM. THE SHIP ECHOES
text: WITH THE SOUND AND WEIGHT OF IT.
text: Kitai kneels next to his father. He can see his father’s mask
text: fogging up the slightest bit with his father's breathing.
text: KITAI CURLS UP ON THE FLOOR NEXT TO HIS FATHER'S MOTIONLESS *

speaker_heading: CYPHER (0.S.)
dialog: Go to the control board. In front

text: the ship’s front bow. There is a small ramp that is flipped
text: over. It touches the ground. Kitai hits a button and the ramp
text: starts to move like a conveyor belt. Kitai looks at his

text: Kitai lifts his father’s leg. Places it on the belt. Kitai
text: pauses, noticing that even the slightest touch makes Cypher
text: WINCE. Cypher starts to get dragged. Kitai hurries and lifts
text: the second leg. Cypher jockeys his upper body until he is on
text: the conveyor belt completely. He is slowly deposited on the

speaker_heading: CYPHER
dialog: We need that beacon.
text: Slowly the realization of what Cypher is saying begins to

speaker_heading: CYPHER
dialog: Kitai, my legs are broken. One very
dialog: badly. You are going to retrieve
dialog: that beacon or we are going to die.
dialog: Do you understand?
text: Kitai nods his head, “Yes." Cypher's eyes begin to well as he
text: beats back his raging emotion. Kitai does not falter. He does
text: not waiver. He simply wipes his eyes and like a true Ranger,
text: awaits his orders, but like Kitai, he can’t help sneaking a
text: glance at the blinking RED DOT as a DARK AREA blots it out.
text: Kitai pulls his attention from the map. Cypher has opened a
text: small black medical case marked: UNIVERSAL AIR FILTRATION GEL
text: - EMERGENCY USE ONLY. Inside, six vials are lined up.
speaker_heading: CYPHER
dialog: You have air filtration inhalers.
text: Cypher removes one of the vials.
speaker_heading: CYPHER
dialog: You need to take one now. The fluid
dialog: will coat your lungs, increase your

speaker_heading: CYPHER
dialog: You have six vials. At your weight,
dialog: that should be twenty to twenty-
dialog: four hours each. That's more than

scene_heading: AFTER EARTH Revised Blue (on White) 1/20/12 84.

text: AS THE SKY STROBES, Kitai watches this battle, rapt.
text: The BEE FIGHTS against the binding thread, which also seems

dialog: rests, he makes ANOTHER ASSAULT --
text: The BEE AGAIN FLAILS WILDLY, pulling against its bond. The

text: The bee goes still again, ceasing to fight, and again the
text: spider seems to become confused, backing up, testing the
text: tension on the lines until it locates the bee again.
text: The SEEMINGLY HELPLESS, EXHAUSTED BEE barely struggles,
text: tracking the spider circling across its web. Then the HUGE
text: SPIDER CHARGES for the “kill.”
text: The bee snaps to life, BUZZING UP, snapping the silky thread,
text: flying up and OVER THE SPIDER, sinking its STINGER into the
text: SOFT, EXPOSED BACK of the spider. Stinging AGAIN AND AGAIN
text: then flying up and away, still held by a thread stuck to its
text: leg as if tethered...
text: The POISONED SPIDER moves slowly, sluggishly, drunkenly to

scene_heading: BENEATH US... ONE-HUNDRED-AND-FIFTY FEET BELOW!
text: There is an opening in the structure of branches. Kitai can

scene_heading: BIRD-LIKE CREATURE. THE DESCENDANT OF A CONDOR - IT STANDS

scene_heading: OVER FIFTEEN FEET. ITS BEAK IS RAZOR-SHARP. IT STANDS GUARD

scene_heading: AFTER EARTH Revised Yellow 2/24/12 95A.

text: Clipped to it is his cutlass.
text: Kitai starts moving slowly towards his cutlass. The newborn

text: Kitai looks down below and sees a DARK SHAPE MOVING UP THE

speaker_heading: BRANCH.

scene_heading: LEOPARD-LIKE CREATURES APPEAR ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BRANCH-

dialog: its loss.
text: Kitai can see his breath; the temperature is dropping
