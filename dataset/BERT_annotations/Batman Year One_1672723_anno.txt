text: LIGHTNING SILHOUETTES a menacing POLICE HELICOPTER, ROARING
text: downward like a monster insect.
scene_heading: LIGHTNING... SPARK? SHOWER. WILD.

scene_heading: INT. DARK AREA - NIGHT
text: A sweating, tormented sleeper  BRUCE WAYNE.
text: His eyes hollowed, skin pale, he TOSSES and TURNS. Then
dialog: FLINCHES. 3 more times he 
speaker_heading: FLINCHES
speaker_heading: FLINCHES
dialog: FLINCHES. Then 
speaker_heading: His EYES pop open WIDE
speaker_heading: BRUCE WAYNE SCREAMS
text: It is the sound of INCOMPREHENSIBLE HORROR.
scene_heading: INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Awoken from his NIGHTMARE by the sound of his own scream,
text: disoriented, BRUCE goes to the sink and SPLASHES cold water
text: in his face.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (V.O.)
dialog: Father. WHERE are you? What will I
dialog: DO?
text: His hands tremble. Distant THUNDER sounds.
scene_heading: EXT. EAST END SIDEWALK - MORNING
text: LITTLE AL, a gigantic, early middle-aged black man carries a
text: bag of doughnuts and two coffees.
text: He whistles as he walks through a run-down slum.
text: He stops and inserts a key at a grimy storefront: The sign
dialog: reads, AL and Son, Repair, Service, Salvage.
scene_heading: REVERSE SHOT OF: INT. AL'S GARAGE - MORNING
text: LITTLE AL hits the lights revealing a meticulously clean
dialog: auto repair shop
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL
dialog: Bruce? Bruce? You here?
text: LITTLE AL continues his search in the
scene_heading: EXT. JUNK YARD BEHIND AL'S GARAGE - MORNING
text: It's a dreary, dirty, isolated place.
text: Its sole occupant, BRUCE, loads large car parts onto a
text: flatbed TRUCK bearing the 'AL and Son' logo.
text: He carries the heavy transmissions and engine blocks on his
text: broad, muscular shoulders.
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL
dialog: Morning sunshine.
text: BRUCE says nothing, he just STARES at LITTLE AL with
text: troubled, tired eyes.
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL (CONT'D)
dialog: (Hands BRUCE a coffee)
dialog: OK twinkle toes. Let's take a look
dialog: at the job orders.
text: The two head up a wooden staircase over the garage and enter
scene_heading: INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S APARTMENT - MORNING
text: It's the claustrophobic room of an obsessive compulsive.
text: Neatly organized electronic hobby projects line the walls
text: POLICE SCANNERS, RADIOS and TVs. Their readouts and displays
dialog: provide the only light.
text: LITTLE AL opens the blackout curtains. Sunlight pours in.
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL
dialog: (opens a ledger)
dialog: So the load on the truck is the
dialog: DiMotto order, right?
speaker_heading: (BRUCE nods)
dialog: You finished the rebuild on that
dialog: caddie, and the tranny for Spencer.
dialog: (BRUCE nods some more)
dialog: I guess that's it, huh?
dialog: You know I COULD put in a couple
dialog: days, help you out down here, if
dialog: you want a break.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I'm fine.
text: LITTLE AL looks at BRUCE's pale skin and sunken eyes.
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL
dialog: BIG AL would kick my butt if he
dialog: saw you now. You look terrible.
text: LITTLE AL puts his hand on BRUCE's shoulder.
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL (CONT'D)
dialog: Those pills aren't working, are
dialog: they, son?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: They're fine.
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL
dialog: The nightmares stopped then?
text: BRUCE doesn't speak.
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe you just need to air yourself
dialog: out a little bit. Go the park. Go
dialog: to the beach. Find yourself a
dialog: girlfriend.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL
dialog: (frustrated) )
dialog: Yeah, fine. Right Here.
text: LITTLE AL hands BRUCE a wad of bills
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen, a man can't keep cooped up
dialog: in one place all the time. He's got
dialog: to keep moving, like a shark,
text: moving, moving, moving, or he dies.
dialog: You can't stay stuck in one place,
dialog: Bruce It just ain't HEALTHY.
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL leaves.
text: As BRUCE closes the blackout curtain, his gaze lingers across
text: the street on the girls galore peepshow theater. From the
text: looks of it, the sleazy sex venue was once a GRAND THEATRE.
text: But now, on top of its classic, old-world facade, a pink
text: plastic sign promises 'GIRLS, GIRLS, GIRLS.' Out front,
dialog: prostitutes offer their wares.
text: CHI-CHI, a young PIMP with long, greasy hair and felt bell
text: bottoms, SLAPS a fat whore, she CRIES and APOLOGIZES.
text: Other whores usher men into a brownstone CATHOUSE next door.
text: BRUCE's gaze travels to a window directly across from his.
text: Inside the CATHOUSE, a long, lean black woman, SELINA, puts
text: handcuffs on a skinny man. She wears tight fitting, black
dialog: leather.
text: SELINA notices BRUCE and gives him a playful wave. He closes
dialog: the curtains. Leaving us alone in
scene_heading: INT. BRUCB WAYNE'S APARTMENT - MORNING
text: BRUCE sits and writes a letter.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (V.O.)
dialog: September 4. Dear Father, I am
dialog: still confused. What are you trying
dialog: to tell me? What do you want from
dialog: me? Please, I don't understand.
dialog: Your son, Bruce.
text: Finished, BRUCE puts the letter in an ENVELOPE. Then, gets up
text: and goes back to work.
scene_heading: INT. JAMES GORDON'S APARTMENT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: THUNDER rolls on the night air.
text: In the sweaty palm of JAMES GORDON rest six bullets. GORDON
text: sits in his boxers on the toilet. In his mouth he holds his
scene_heading: SERVICE REVOLVER.
speaker_heading: ANN (O.S.)
dialog: Honey, come to bed.
text: GORDON looks up at the door. He puts the gun, with its wet
text: barrel, into a holster with a badge clipped to the side and
text: leaves the bathroom.
speaker_heading: ANN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Hard time sleeping again, baby?
text: We hear bedsprings sag.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE PRECINCT. SOUADROOM - MORNING
text: GORDON gets off the elevator and walks through the busy
text: precinct room full of COPS.
text: As he passes, CONVERSATIONS STOP.
text: Men with shoulder holsters and badges on their hip watch
text: GORDON with obvious disdain.
text: GORDON puts his lunch in his desk and flips through papers.
text: He lights a MARLBORO.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE PRECINCT. HALL OUTSIDE EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY
text: A sign reads "Evidence Room". A YOUNG COP stares at GORDON
text: with bad intent through a Plexiglas window.
text: GORDON puts papers in the pass-through.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: This is for the Irwin case.
text: The YOUNG COP doesn't say a word.
text: As GORDON leaves, he passes the door to the evidence room.
text: It's half open.
text: We catch a quick glimpse inside
text: two detectives stuff YELLOW ENVELOPES and stack BILLS
text: --before the door SLAMS shut.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM. POLICE PRECINCT - DAY
text: GORDON stands at a URINAL as DETECTIVE FLASS, about 40, blond
dialog: crew cut, enters
speaker_heading: FLASS
dialog: I've got something for you Gordon.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Come on Flass, I told you, I just
dialog: don't want it.
speaker_heading: FLASS
dialog: Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, you're going
dialog: to have to learn what it takes to
dialog: be a cop in this town
speaker_heading: FLASS (CONT'D)
dialog: It makes the guys nervous when
dialog: someone doesn't participate. They
dialog: think you might say something.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: It's not like that, I just don't
dialog: need the money.
dialog: Maybe if I had kids like the other
dialog: guys, or had trouble making ends
dialog: meet it would be different.
speaker_heading: FLASS
dialog: The guys are saying, 'maybe he
dialog: thinks he's better than we are.
dialog: Maybe he thinks he's superior.' Is
dialog: that how it is Jimmy? You think
dialog: you're some kind of saint?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: No, it's nothing like that.
speaker_heading: FLASS
dialog: So you're not a saint, Gordon. Who
dialog: are you?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I'm just a cop
speaker_heading: FLASS
dialog: Yeah, that's right, you're one of
dialog: us
text: FLASS jams a yellow envelope into GORDON'S hand and leaves.
text: GORDON CRUSHES the YELLOW ENVELOPE.
scene_heading: INT. SQUADROOM. POLICE PRECINCT - MOMENTS LATER
text: FLASS jokes around the water cooler with a couple COPS.
text: Then, back at his desk he sees the YELLOW ENVELOPE spiked on
dialog: his message post.
text: FLASS registers a look of concern.
text: FLASS' partner DETECTIVE CAMPBELL, a fat cop in a wrinkled
text: suit, slaps him on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Come on, we'll deal with him later.
dialog: We got to make our rounds.
dialog: Together they leave and we
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: EXT. GIRLS GALORE PEEPSHOW THEATER - EVENING
text: BRUCE carries a brown paper grocery bag in his arms.
text: THE WHORES do their thing: waving at cars, posing, vamping.
text: They see BRUCE in his BLUE JUMPSUIT.
speaker_heading: FRENCH MAID
dialog: Hey there garage boy! Want to look
dialog: under my hood, check my fluid
dialog: levels.
speaker_heading: CHEERLEADER
dialog: You can top me off anytime!
text: The youngest prostitute, HOLLY, joins in.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: I'll show you why they say, "good
dialog: things come in small packages?"
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: HOLLY! GET OVER HERE! He's a
dialog: neighbor, not a John. And the rest
dialog: of you, cut it out. You got nothing
dialog: better to do?
speaker_heading: CHI-CHI (CUTS IN)
dialog: Yeah, like making me some MONEY.
dialog: Get to work.
text: CHI-CHI is interrupted by the honk of a horn.
text: DETECTIVE FLASS sits behind the wheel of an UNMARKED COP CAR
text: with a Ballantine Ale on his lap.
speaker_heading: FLASS
dialog: Hey there CHI-CHI. How's business?
text: Next to him in the car sits DETECTIVE CAMPBELL.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: (laughing, to CHI-CHI)
dialog: Hey, you know what, you're the only
speaker_heading: HIPPY PIMP I ever seen.
speaker_heading: FLASS
dialog: You got something for us
dialog: Greaseball?
speaker_heading: CHI-CHI
dialog: Yeah, sure. Here you guys go.
text: CHI-CHI passes a YELLOW ENVELOPE through the window to FLASS.
text: FLASS flips through the bills inside.
speaker_heading: FLASS
dialog: This it, Flowerpower? Looks kind of
dialog: light to me
speaker_heading: CHI-CHI
dialog: It's the same as last week.
speaker_heading: FLASS
dialog: Yeah? Well, you seem to be doing
dialog: pretty good for yourself. Maybe
dialog: it's time we talk to ESTRADA,
dialog: REEVALUATE our arrangement.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Or maybe SELINA can throw in a
dialog: little dark meat to make up the
dialog: balance. How about that?
speaker_heading: CHI-CHI
dialog: Yeah, sure. SELINA, get over here!
text: SELINA reluctantly approaches the car.
speaker_heading: CHI-CHI (CONT'D)
dialog: Give DETECTIVE CAMPBELL a date on
dialog: the house.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: You can put away the toys, sweet
dialog: thing. I'll show you how a REAL MAN
dialog: does it.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Forget it. You're not coming
dialog: anywhere near me.
text: She turns to walk away but CHI-CHI grabs her arm.
speaker_heading: FLASS (LAUGHS)
dialog: Classic. One can't get his whores
dialog: to screw, the other can't get
dialog: screwed by a whore.
text: FLASS pulls away.
speaker_heading: FLASS (CONT'D)
dialog: We don't have time for this. Got to
dialog: keep moving. More pick-ups to
dialog: make before quitting time. Ta-ta
dialog: ladies.
text: FLASS waves his BEER CAN farewell as he drives off.
speaker_heading: CHI-CHI
dialog: What the hell was that? You made me
dialog: LOOK BAD. I got a REP to maintain.
dialog: I look weak, then scumbag crooked
dialog: cops take advantage, try to push me
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: You know the rules Nothing for
dialog: Free.
text: SELINA jerks her arm free and storms off.
text: But CHI-CHI grabs her again and SPINS HER AROUND.
speaker_heading: CHI-CHI
dialog: Well maybe it's time we RE-EVALUATE
dialog: the rules.
text: Suddenly CHI-CHI is aware that BRUCE stands very close
text: glowering at the pimp.
scene_heading: PURE UNHOLY HATRED.
speaker_heading: CHI-CHI
dialog: What the fuck you want, retard?
text: CHI-CHI flicks open his SWITCH BLADE.
speaker_heading: SELINA
speaker_heading: (to CHI-CHI)
dialog: Leave him alone.
text: CHI-CHI backhands her across the mouth.
text: BRUCE, oblivious to the knife, moves to take out CHI-CHI.
text: But SELINA catches BRUCE's eye and, WITHOUT SAYING A WORD,
text: tells BRUCE to "let it go".
text: BRUCE just turns and walks away an obedient soldier.
speaker_heading: CHI-CHI
dialog: That's what I thought. WIMP!
text: Selina watches BRUCE march back into
scene_heading: INT. AL'S GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
text: BRUCE KICKS open the door
dialog: FLINGS groceries everywhere
dialog: PUNCHES the plaster wall
speaker_heading: BRUCE (V.O.)
dialog: September 17. Father, it takes
dialog: everything I have just to contain
dialog: this fury. I can feel it in my
dialog: chest. It wants to ESCAPE. I'm
dialog: AFRAID of what I might do.
text: LITTLE AL is in the doorway.
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL
dialog: What the hell's going in here. You
dialog: OK?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I'm fine.
text: BRUCE tries to push past LITTLE AL and out of the garage. But
text: LITTLE AL grabs his wrist.
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL
dialog: Bruce.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What do YOU want?
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL
dialog: Don't you give me lip, boy. I know
dialog: what you're going through. You
dialog: can't hide it from me.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: You don't know ANYTHING.
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL
dialog: Come on. I've got something for
dialog: you.
text: LITTLE AL pushes aside a work bench, digs out a key and opens
text: a dirty, disused door.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Your father's office?
text: LITTLE AL says nothing. The two men go inside
scene_heading: INT. BIG AL'S OFFICE - DAY
text: It's like a tomb. Dusty, unused and preserved. LITTLE AL sits
text: at the desk and starts opening drawers.
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL
dialog: (without looking)
dialog: Sit down Bruce.
text: BRUCE sits on a dusty chair.
text: LITTLE AL finds what he's looking for, shoe-box. He turns to
speaker_heading: BRUCE
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL (CONT'D)
dialog: You know, Bruce, BIG AL worked HARD
dialog: to put me through med school. He
dialog: dreamed of giving me more than that
dialog: garage. But he NEVER said a WORD
dialog: after the war.
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL (CONT'D)
dialog: He understood what happens to a man
dialog: who's SEEN too much of this world's
dialog: evil. Do you know what I'm talking
dialog: about Bruce.
text: BRUCE nods.
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL (CONT'D)
dialog: When we found you out in the scrap
dialog: pile you were scared, more of a
dialog: wild animal than a boy, really. And
dialog: you had something with you, do you
dialog: remember that?
text: BRUCE says 'Yes' with his eyes.
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL (CONT'D)
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: You wouldn't let it go... Took BIG
dialog: AL three months to even get a look
dialog: at it. You cried for weeks when he
dialog: took it from you. He said you
dialog: weren't ready to have it. You
dialog: called it your INHERITANCE.
text: LITTLE AL puts a hand on BRUCE's shoulder.
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL (CONT'D)
dialog: When BIG AL was up in that
dialog: hospital, he asked me watch over
dialog: you, made me promise, and I have.
dialog: You're like my boy, Bruce.
text: LITTLE AL gives BRUCE's shoulder a squeeze.
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL (CONT'D)
dialog: But now you're scaring me. There's
dialog: something going on in your head,
dialog: and while I can't say I know
dialog: exactly what it is, I can tell you
dialog: this: A man has got to know who he
text: is before he can confront his
dialog: demons.
text: LITTLE AL open the shoe box and removes a smaller WOODEN BOX
text: with a heavy brass latch
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe your INHERITANCE can help you
dialog: figure it out.
text: LITTLE AL places the WOODEN BOX on BRUCE'S knee.
text: BRUCE just stares at it.
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL (CONT'D)
dialog: Not ready yet, huh' I understand
text: LITTLE AL stands up and waits. After a moment BRUCE stands up
text: and they both walk back into
scene_heading: INT. LITTLE AL'S GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
text: LITTLE AL locks the door behind them.
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL
dialog: You take all the time you want.
dialog: It's late. I'm going home. I hope
dialog: you can find some comfort in this,
dialog: Bruce. Sleep well.
text: LITTLE AL leaves BRUCE staring at the WOODEN BOX.
scene_heading: INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: BRUCE writes another letter.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (V.O.)
dialog: September 22. Dear Father, I almost
dialog: slipped today. God help me if I
dialog: lose control. Little Al gave me
dialog: back my inheritance. What should I
dialog: do with it? Please tell me. I
dialog: don't know how much longer I can go
dialog: without your help. Please send
dialog: instructions. Your loving son,
dialog: Bruce.
text: BRUCE signs the letter and puts it in an ENVELOPE. Puts a
text: stamp on the envelope.
text: BRUCE gets ready for bed and turns in. He doesn't sleep, just
text: stares at the WOODEN BOX from his bed.
scene_heading: INT. SELINA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: SELINA's apartment is painted to look like a dungeon. The
dialog: tools of her trade line the walls WHIPS, CUFFS, A CRICKET
text: BAT FOR SPANKING. CATS lounge all over the place.
text: HOLLY sits cross-legged in an electric chair. She paints her
text: toe nails and watches SELINA pace the cramped room.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: There has to be more to it than
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: This what?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: LIFE! Jesus, there has GOT to be
dialog: more out there than just PIMPS and
dialog: JOHNS. We spend our lives on our
dialog: backs shuttling money from one to
dialog: the other, FOR WHAT?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: I don't know, what?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Nothing! Don't you see, we're being
dialog: used. We're stuck here and for all
dialog: our work, we have nothing. While
dialog: they're getting rich. I'm sick of
dialog: it, I'm not going to take it
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: What are you going to do? Run off?
dialog: Marry a John?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: HA! Have you seen the guys who come
dialog: here for my services? Shit. What
dialog: I'd give to meet a real man.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (rising)
dialog: Got to go. My 10:30 should be here.
dialog: (at the door)
dialog: You know, maybe there are no real
dialog: men. Maybe the whole world IS just
dialog: PIMPS and JOHNS. Ever think of
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: HOLLY leaves.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: (to self)
dialog: Then I'll have to find my own way
dialog: out.
dialog: She closes her door. And we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. A MAGNIFICENT THEATER - NIGHT
dialog: We're on the steps of a magical old-world movie palace. It's
text: bright, clean, hyper-real a dream.
text: A BOY, about 8, leaves a showing of Zorro with his MOTHER and
text: FATHER. He goofs around with an imaginary sword.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: En guard! En guard!
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: (Her best Fay Rae
dialog: imitation.)
dialog: Oh Brave Zorro, Save us!
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Yes, but can Zorro fly?
text: FATHER grabs his BOY and throws him in the air. The BOY
text: freaks out with laughter.
text: The BOY is caught under his arms and again tossed upwards,
dialog: and into a 
speaker_heading: NIGHTMARE
text: The sky darkens. The boy registers FEAR and falls
dialog: - falls -
dialog: - falls -
text: - and SLAMS HARD onto a grimy sidewalk puddled with BLOOD.
text: His parents STRUGGLE with a MUGGER in the alley.
speaker_heading: FATHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Get away from her you monster
text: The MUGGER shoves FATHER back.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
speaker_heading: (slaps at MUGGER)
dialog: No! Get off me. You can't
dialog: have it.
text: MUGGER grabs MOTHER VICIOUSLY by the THROAT and she's
dialog: choking.
text: PEARLS bounce on the pavement.
text: FATHER takes a swing at the MUGGER.
speaker_heading: MUGGER
dialog: Crazy bastards.
dialog: BANG!
text: BOY FLINCHES.
text: Blood sprays on his face.
dialog: BANG!
dialog: BANG!
dialog: BANG!
text: BRUCE WAYNE's body FLINCHES in his cot with each shot.
dialog: We're back in
scene_heading: INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: BRUCE shoots upright in bed.
text: BRUCE WAYNE'S MOUTH SNARLS, in torment.
text: BRUCE WAYNE'S FISTS lay in his lap. The fists QUAKE. UNHOLY
speaker_heading: RAGE.
text: He goes and takes the WOODEN BOX in his shaking, sweaty
text: hands. His thumb is about to open the heavy brass latch BRUCE
text: is interrupted by a clanking sound from the street.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GIRLS GALORE PEEPSHOW THEATER - NIGHT
dialog: The sleazy sex venue was
text: THE GRAND THEATER FROM BRUCE'S NIGHTMARES.
text: Only now, instead of a young BOY walking the sidewalk with
dialog: his parents
text: CAMPBELL, the fat detective, staggers around in the street.
text: DRUNKENLY he throws a RUSTY MUFFLER up at SELINA'S WINDOW.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your
dialog: hair!
text: Her window opens.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: You picked a BAD night to mess with
dialog: me, CAMPBELL!
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Aww, come on darling is that anyway
dialog: to treat a customer?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I'm paid up. You got your damn
dialog: money. That's all you get from me,
dialog: asshole.
text: SELINA SLAMS her window.
text: CAMPBELL takes a PULL from his BOTTLE
text: And goes into the CATHOUSE.
text: A moment later BRUCE crosses the street and follows him
dialog: inside the
scene_heading: INT. CATHOUSE - NIGHT
text: BRUCE cautiously enters. From upstairs
dialog: Bang, bang, bang.
text: He hears the sound of a fist pounding a door. Voices echo
text: down the empty stairwell.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (O.S.)
dialog: Come on honey, you know that's not
dialog: the way things work. It's just part
dialog: of the price of doing business.
speaker_heading: SELINA (O.S.)
dialog: Go away you fat pig.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (O.S.)
dialog: What the hell? Who are you? You're
dialog: a WHORE. This is what you DO.
text: BRUCE puts a foot on the first step up to 
scene_heading: INT. SELINA 'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: CAMPBELL KICKS IN the door CRACK!
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: (backs away)
dialog: You can't do this. I pay you. I've
dialog: always paid you.
text: CAMPBELL grabs SELINA 'S WRIST.
text: SELINA kicks him in the crotch  THWACK.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
speaker_heading: BITCH!
text: CAMPBELL SLAPS HER across the face, HARD.
text: She CRASHES into a table covered with LEATHER BONDS, RUBBER
text: GEAR. MASKS.
text: CATS scamper in all directions.
text: SELINA SCRAMBLES for the door.
text: CAMPBELL JERKS her back into the room and SLAMS her against
dialog: the wall.
text: SELINA punches CAMPBELL  POP  in the face.
text: CAMPBELL'S head snaps back and SELINA makes a break for the
text: door. He puts a hand to his face and feels the blood.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
dialog: You're fucking dead.
text: ENRAGED, CAMPBELL moves to block SELINA's escape. He punches
text: her in the stomach. She collapses.
text: CAMPBELL picks up her CRICKET BAT and starts smashing the
text: place. SMACK  a lamp flies into the wall. BASH  a music box
text: explodes into a million pieces.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
dialog: I've had it up to here with all the
dialog: bitches like you.
text: CAMPBELL is standing over SELINA now, CRICKET BAT in his
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm going to show you once and for
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: SELINA is TERRIFIED!
text: CAMPBELL bends down and GRABS SELINA VICIOUSLY by the THROAT
dialog: and
text: LIFTS HER OFF THE GROUND with one hand.
dialog: She is CHOKING.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
dialog: You're mine to do with as I please,
dialog: you understand that? And now it's
dialog: going to please me to KILL YOU.
text: He cocks the CRICKET BAT back, about to smash her brains out
dialog: when
text: SUDDENLY BRUCE APPEARS IN THE ROOM.
text: HIS FACE: a mask of UNHOLY RAGE.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: What the fuck do you want? Get the
dialog: hell out of here!
text: BRUCE doesn't say a word. He just delivers an upper cut 
text: SMACK  to CAMPBELL'S rib cage. A couple ribs go.
text: A left hook SMACK  to CAMPBELL'S face. The nose shatters.
text: An elbow  SMACK  to CAMPBELL'S head. The jaw breaks.
text: CAMPBELL stumbles back to the wall. FALLS to his knees.
text: BRUCE isn't finished with CAMPBELL. He moves in.
text: SELINA grabs the cricket bat
speaker_heading: CRACK!
dialog: SHE HITS BRUCE!
text: A startled BRUCE staggers.
dialog: Things -
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Sorry about that.
dialog: - go 
speaker_heading: SELINA (CONT'D)
dialog: But he's mine.
speaker_heading: - DARK.
speaker_heading: MUCH LATER:

speaker_heading: COPS(O.S.)
text: That one at the end of the hall.
speaker_heading: GORDON (O.S.)
dialog: You go in yet?
text: BRUCE holds his head, spins circles and looks for a way out.
speaker_heading: COP (O.S.)
dialog: Just got here, only peeked through
dialog: the door. Didn't want to disturb
dialog: the scene.
text: BRUCE tries to squeeze out the bathroom window too small.
scene_heading: INT. CATHOUSE. HALLWAY - DAWN
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: (pulls down yellow police
dialog: tape)
dialog: Who called it in?
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: A guy named CHI-CHI. Claims he's

speaker_heading: PIMP.
text: GORDON steps on his MARLBORO. Just as he touches the knob 
text: FLASS pushes past the uniformed officer. GORDON turns 
scene_heading: INT. SELINA'S APARTMENT - DAWN
text: BRUCE looks out the back window  cops everywhere.
scene_heading: INT. CATHOUSE. HALLWAY - PAWN
dialog: GORDON blocks the doorway--
speaker_heading: FLASS
dialog: What the hell are you doing here?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: It's my collar.
speaker_heading: FLASS
dialog: Like hell it is. Get out of my way.
text: GORDON doesn't move.
text: FLASS muscles past GORDON and opens the door into
scene_heading: INT. SELINA'S APARTMENT - DAWN
text: BRUCE looks out the bedroom window, it's a narrow air-shaft
text: who's bottom opens in a rubbish-filled mini-courtyard.
text: BRUCE looks over 
text: THE FRONT DOOR IS OPENING.
speaker_heading: FLASS (O.S.)
dialog: Jimmy-boy, I ain't kidding around
dialog: now.
text: GORDON backs into the apartment, he's been shoved.
text: BRUCE makes a desperate play and throws himself out the
text: window. He hangs four stories up by his fingers as inside 
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: OK, have it your way.
speaker_heading: GORDON stands aside.
speaker_heading: FLASS
dialog: Yeah, that's what I thought--
text: Then, confronted with the sight of his DEAD PARTNER 
speaker_heading: FLASS (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh Christ!
text: Outside the window BRUCE is slipping. He tries to get his
text: feet on the window sill below while 
speaker_heading: GORDON (TO THE COP)
dialog: I thought you said there were two
dialog: bodies.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: That's what this CHI-CHI guy said.
dialog: And that's what it looked like
dialog: about three minutes ago.
text: BRUCE can't reach the sill with his feet. GORDON squats down
text: and inspects the body. A series of four  DEEP SCRATCHES 
text: line CAMPBELL'S cheeks.
speaker_heading: BEAT COP
speaker_heading: (to GORDON)
dialog: Girl who lives here goes by the
dialog: name of Mistress SELINA. 21, 5'9"
dialog: 120 pounds. Works an S&M dungeon,
dialog: uh, obviously. She hasn't turned up
dialog: yet.
text: FLASS casually tosses the apartment, looks out the back
text: window, opens a wall CLOSET, picks up some handcuffs
text: BRUCE can't hold on any more. HE SLIPS AND FALLS.
text: While FLASS looks at the cuffs,
speaker_heading: GORDON
speaker_heading: (TO FLASS)
dialog: You don't seem all that broken up.
dialog: This IS you partner here, right?
text: FLASS, angry, throws them back and SLAMS the CLOSET DOOR 
text: Just at the moment BRUCE CRASHES into the rat-infested
dialog: rubbish below.
text: GORDON hearing something, takes a look out the window where
text: BRUCE was hanging moments ago.
speaker_heading: FLASS
dialog: This kind of shit happens everyday.
dialog: I've learned to grieve in my own
dialog: way, Jimmy-boy.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: (pulls head back in)
dialog: And what, exactly, does that mean?
speaker_heading: FLASS
dialog: It means I'm going to find her and
dialog: put her in a box
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: It's that simple, huh?
speaker_heading: FLASS
dialog: Yup.
text: In the air-shaft, BRUCE climbs out from under the filth and
text: pushes open a basement window.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Come ON. There's more going on
dialog: here. She didn't do this alone.
dialog: What was it? CAMPBELL wanted his
dialog: graft in trade? That pimp get tired
dialog: of paying you guys off?
speaker_heading: FLASS
dialog: (to the beat cop)
dialog: YOU. Get out.
text: The BEAT COP leaves.
speaker_heading: FLASS (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen Boy Scout, you need to

text: FLASS storms out.
text: GORDON watches him go.
scene_heading: EXT. CATHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Cops loaf around the crime scene eating doughnuts. BRUCE
text: tries to look inconspicuous on the sidewalk, hands in his
text: pockets, head down. FLASS burst out of the building and slams
text: into BRUCE. FLASS shoves BRUCE.
speaker_heading: FLASS
dialog: Watch where you're going. PUNK.
text: They hold eye contact for a tense moment.
scene_heading: SELINA'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

text: She's crying.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Honey, come on. I didn't mean it.

text: The door opens, Gotham's young Assistant District Attorney,

speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: You can't protect him forever.
dialog: ESTRADA will go down and you'll go

speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Commissioner Loeb, there's a

speaker_heading: LOEB (O.S.)

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Sir, I'm Detective James Gordon.
dialog: I'm here about my transfer.
speaker_heading: LOEB
dialog: I know who you are, Gordon. Chief
dialog: Collins has told me all about you.
dialog: Says you're another COWBOY, like
dialog: your friend Dent there. Says you
dialog: don't understand the way things are
dialog: done.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I've never met Assistant D.A. Dent,
dialog: sir. And don't know why Chief
dialog: Collins would say anything like
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: LOEB
dialog: (rubs temples)
dialog: There's no transfer for you,
dialog: Gordon. It's my responsibility to
dialog: train young officers a proper
dialog: respect for tradition, for the
dialog: established order of things. You
dialog: need to learn what it takes to be a
dialog: cop in Gotham.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: If by 'tradition' you mean graft
dialog: and
speaker_heading: LOEB
dialog: (interrupts)
dialog: I suggest you be a little more
dialog: selective in your manner of speech,
dialog: detective. Things could get awfully
dialog: difficult for you around here.
dialog: And you don't want that, not for

text: Then she's at the door 
speaker_heading: ANN (O.S.)
dialog: Jim. Jim, it's a boy.
text: GORDON takes the GUN out of his mouth.

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: A boy. We're going to have a baby

scene_heading: EXT. JUNK YARD BEHIND AL'S GARAGE - DAY
text: BRUCE works like a FIEND. HE'S POSSESSED.
text: Sweat soaks through his clothes as he HEAVES ENGINES into a

text: LITTLE AL watches, then approaches and shuts off the machine.
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL
dialog: This can't go on.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL

speaker_heading: DAVE

speaker_heading: GORDON

scene_heading: EXT. EAST END PARK - NIGHT
text: BRUCE has a tourist map in his hands, he acts lost.
text: A pair of MUGGERS saunter out of the night. They circle.
speaker_heading: MUGGER #I
dialog: Need some help mister. Maybe you're
dialog: lost?
text: BRUCE says nothing, just soaks in the atmosphere of violence.
speaker_heading: MUGGER #1
dialog: You could use a guide to show you
dialog: where the bad places are.
speaker_heading: MUGGER #2
dialog: Yeah, to protect you from the bad
dialog: elements.
text: BRUCE cracks a gentle smile.
speaker_heading: MUGGER #2 (CONT'D)
dialog: We'll take care of you mister. But
dialog: you have to give us a tip.
dialog: (holds out hand)
speaker_heading: NOW! MONEY!
text: One of the assailants becomes impatient and SHOVES BRUCE.
text: There is no delay in cause and effect. The shove sparks an
text: almost ORGASMIC release of RAW, PENT UP VIOLENCE from BRUCE.
text: HE EXPLODES - CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! CRACK!
text: BRUCE PUNCHES MUGGER #1 in the CHEST, rapid-fire brutal, RIBS
speaker_heading: CRUNCH.
text: MUGGER #2 steps into the fray. BRUCE neatly SNAPS HIS ARM -
speaker_heading: CRUNCH
speaker_heading:  and SWINGS an ELBOW 
speaker_heading: POP
scene_heading:  SHATTERING MUGGER #2'S FACE.
text: He SLAMS to the PAVEMENT in sudden, surprised PAIN.
text: BRUCE stands over both the fallen MUGGERS and breathes in a

text: A calm washes over him.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Here's your tip.
text: He delivers a final kick and walks off into the night  A
speaker_heading: CHANGED MAN.
scene_heading: EXT. EAST END ALLEY - NIGHT
text: SKINHEADS divide the contents of a BLOODY PURSE.
text: A BEATEN WOMAN lies sobbing on the ground by some trash cans.
speaker_heading: SKINHEAD #1
dialog: You took the credit cards last

text: Then, suddenly aware of someone else in the alley, they turn
text: to see BRUCE standing over them.
speaker_heading: SKINHEAD #2
dialog: Looks like it's going to be a good
dialog: night, boys.
text: The SKINHEADS descend on BRUCE.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Yes. It does.
text: BRUCE tears into the SKINHEADS with all the joy of a child on
dialog: Christmas.
text: BRUCE punches the SKINHEADS in the face, his father's SIGNET

scene_heading: EXT. EAST END STREET - NIGHT
text: A greasy junky holds a FAKE PEARL NECKLACE up to his DEALER.
speaker_heading: GREASY JUNKY

speaker_heading: DEALER

speaker_heading: DEALER (CONT'D)
dialog: Can't you see I'm doing business

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I'm done waiting.

dialog: BASH! BASH! BASH!
text:  into the METAL PAY-PHONE.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Welcome to my war.
text: The dealer slides to the ground.

scene_heading: INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S APARTMENT - MORNING
text: BRUCE sleeps.
scene_heading: DEEP. SOUND. RESTFUL.

scene_heading: INT. LA BONNE MAISON - EVENING
dialog: ANN and GORDON enjoy a nice dinner together in one of
dialog: Gotham's finest restaurants.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: To my Super Cop.
speaker_heading: GORDON

dialog: Clink.
speaker_heading: GORDON (CONT'D)
dialog: Things are going to be different,
dialog: baby. I feel it.
dialog: (notices something)
dialog: SHIT!
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (worried)
dialog: What it is honey?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I don't believe it.
text: GORDON watches as Commissioner LOEB and Emilio ESTRADA are
text: lead to a private dining room along with several scantily
text: clad, exotic-looking women. ESTRADA hands the waiter a
dialog: hundred dollar bill.
text: His face is an emotionless mask, perfectly smooth and
text: featureless, the result of a compulsive addiction to cosmetic
dialog: surgery.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Who IS that with Commissioner Loeb?
text: He looks like a zombie.
text: GORDON stands up and starts dumping bills on the table.
speaker_heading: ANN (CONT'D)
dialog: JIM? What's the matter, honey?
text: GORDON drags wife from the restaurant.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE LA BONNE MAISON - EVENING
text: GORDON is livid.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I can't believe he's so blatant.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Who? What's the matter?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Christ! Don't you read the papers?
dialog: That was Emilio ESTRADA. "Gotham's
dialog: Golden Pimp". The one Harvey Dent
dialog: had up on charges 6 months ago. And
dialog: now he's eating at La Bonne Maison
dialog: with my Police Commissioner. OK?
dialog: That's what's the MATTER.
text: ANN, hurt, jerks her hand free and walks ahead.
text: GORDON realizes he's crossed the line. He's pissed at himself
text: for scaring his wife. He lashes out and KICKS a nearby trash
dialog: can.
speaker_heading: GORDON (CONT'D)
dialog: Dammit!
text: GORDON jogs to catch up and gently takes ANN'S arm.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I'm your wife, not some rookie cop
dialog: you can treat any old way you want.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I'm sorry I snapped at you.
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Look. Those are BRUTAL and VICIOUS
dialog: men.	And they are making this city
dialog: a bad place to live, to raise OUR
dialog: son. It's just, I don't know what
dialog: to do. I get angry. I get angry
dialog: for US. For the BABY.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (touches his cheek)
dialog: I know. But what can you do? You're
dialog: just one man. You can't carry the
dialog: whole city on you back.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: There is something I CAN do. I can
dialog: go over their heads. I can go to
dialog: the Mayor.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Is that safe?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: (shakes head)
dialog: No.
text: GORDON puts his coat over ANN'S shoulders, they walk off.
dialog: BRUCE writes a letter 
speaker_heading: BRUCB (V.O.)
dialog: October 12. Dear Father, it's
dialog: working. I've engaged the enemy,
dialog: made progress. But I've only struck
text: at their front line, the grunts.
dialog: Tonight, I start climbing their
dialog: chain of command.
text: Then BRUCE opens a binder full of meticulous notes, drawings,
text: charts, and reports. He turns to a STREET MAP marked with
text: red 'x's and scowls at it.
scene_heading: EXT. THE COMET LOUNGE. EAST END GOTHAM - NIGHT
dialog: This is easily the lowest ranking drinking establishments in
text: Gotham. Most of the bar's patrons originate from the Gotham
text: City Corrections Facility located directly across the street.
dialog: Flickering neon sign: "First beer free with release papers."
text: BRUCE watches from a doorway as newly released prisoners make
text: a bee-line from the jail into the COMET LOUNGE.
text: BRUCE steps over a pair of drunks on the sidewalk and into 
scene_heading: INT. THE COMET LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: The place emanates PURE MENACE.
text: The patrons consist of doomed addicts hunkered over their
text: drinks, deflated whores and working-class thugs with overly
text: attentive eyes. MURDER seems an everyday occurrence.
text: BRUCE takes a table away from the sodden trio on the stage,
text: accompanying a floor show of TRANSVESTITE singers and dancers
dialog: who double as waitresses.
text: Once seated, BRUCE is visited by a flock of waitresses and
text: waiters. They sit on his lap, rub up against him, play with
dialog: his hair.
speaker_heading: TRANSVESTITE #L
dialog: And what have we here?
speaker_heading: TRANSVESTITE #2
dialog: Ooh, big.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Honey, you want a private show?
speaker_heading: TRANSVESTITE #L
dialog: Hey, back off. I saw him first.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Can I get you something?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Beer.
speaker_heading: TRANSVESTITE #1
dialog: See those little doors over there?
dialog: For $50 I'll blow your mind.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: He don't want what you got, skank.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: You don't have what I'm looking for
dialog: either.
text: BRUCE stuffs small bills in their sagging bras. The money
dialog: attracts attention.
speaker_heading: TRANSVESTITE #2
dialog: Come on baby, I can cheer you up.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I doubt it.
text: The waitress returns with a beer.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: That will be $2, honey.
text: BRUCE pulls out a HUGE ROLL OF BILLS and peels off a FIFTY.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Keep it.
text: The waitress registers FEAR at the sight of all that money.
text: She barely has her money before more than a dozen THUGS set
text: upon BRUCE from all angles with KNIVES, CLUBS, BOTTLES and
speaker_heading: POOL QUEUES.
text: BRUCE JUMPS TO HIS FEET. The table, chair, and transvestites
text: tumble to the ground.
text: The FIRST GUY swings a POOL QUEUE baseball bat style.
text: BRUCE ducks under it and 
speaker_heading: CRUNCH
text:  comes up with a knee into the guy's groin.
text: The SECOND GUY gets an elbow to the nose.
text: The THIRD, FOURTH and FIFTH GUYS move in together.
text: BRUCE drops those three with a series of vicious rabbit
text: punches to their faces  POP, POP, POP.
text: But it's with numbers six through 16 that he runs into
text: trouble. They work as a team and surround BRUCE.
text: The first one smashes BRUCE with a chair 
text: Then, another clocks him in the head with a whiskey bottle 
text: And a third belts him in the jaw with brass knuckles.
text: BRUCE staggers back. The men descend and beat him to the
dialog: ground.
text: We lose sight of BRUCE under a rain of KICKS, PUNCHES,
text: BOTTLES and SWINGING POOL QUEUES. Then suddenly BRUCE 
speaker_heading: EXPLODES
text:  through the ATTACKERS, line-backer style, sending them
dialog: sprawling.
text: He breaks across the room and through a door marked 'EXIT'.
text: The room goes silent 
dialog: beat
text:  then breaks into laughter.
text: BRUCE has cornered himself inside the 
scene_heading: INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM. THE COMET LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: The small, dirty room has no windows. The only other doors
text: open onto toilet stalls and a cleaning closet full of mops,
text: buckets and CLEANING SUPPLIES.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (V.O.)
dialog: It was almost a stupid death 
text: Then his eyes fall on the CLEANING SUPPLIES.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: - were it not for your birthday
dialog: gifts, those chemistry sets I so
dialog: loved.
text: BRUCE rifles through the chemicals.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Ammonia, borax, bleach, peroxide,
dialog: baking soda. Thank you, Father.
text: BRUCE grabs a PLASTIC JUG and dumps hand fulls of BORAX and
text: BAKING SODA into it, topping it off with a blast of DRY
text: PROPELLANT from a fire extinguisher.
text: Outside the door in 
scene_heading: INT. THE COMET LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: The men taunt him.
speaker_heading: ATTACKER #1
dialog: When you're done powdering your
dialog: nose, can I have a free date?
speaker_heading: ATTACKER #2
dialog: Don't forget to wash your titties.
dialog: Meanwhile, inside 
scene_heading: INT WOMEN'S BATHROOM. THE COMET LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: BRUCE picks the TOILET CAKE out of a filthy toilet and
text: shatters it against the porcelain sink. He drops that into
text: the PLASTIC JUG and starts mixing liquids in an empty BEER
scene_heading: BOTTLE  AMMONIA, BLEACH, PEROXIDE.
text: BRUCE stabs the PLASTIC JUG with a SCREW DRIVER while outside
dialog: the door in 
scene_heading: INT. THE COMET LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: The men, now done with their taunting, approach the door
scene_heading: INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM. THE COMET LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: BRUCE holds the PLASTIC JOG in one hand and the BEER BOTTLE
text: in the other. HE takes a deep breath and dumps the liquid
speaker_heading: into the PLASTIC JOG 
scene_heading: INT. THE COMET LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: Suddenly the door BURSTS OPEN.
text: A tattered and beaten BRUCE stands holding the PLASTIC JUG.
text: He tosses the PLASTIC JUG at a thug but it misses and slides
dialog: under the pool tables 
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: It's over. You people should get
dialog: out of here,
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It isn't safe.
text: The THUG whips out a LONG SCALLOPED KNIFE and comes at BRUCE.
speaker_heading: THUG WITH KNIFE
dialog: Let's see what you had for lunch.
text: Under the pool table the PLASTIC JUG BUBBLES AND STEAMS. The
text: men raise their pool queues and encircle BRUCE.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Have it your way.
text: BRUCE jerks a neon beer advertisement off the wall as he
text: leaps up onto a pool table.
text: The sign shatters.
scene_heading: SPARKS SHOWER DOWN
speaker_heading: WHOOSH!
text: The LOW-LYING GASSES go up in BLUE-HOT FLAMES.
text: Every man standing on the floor collapses in agony  pants on
text: fire, legs scorched.
text: BRUCE casually steps from his pool table onto the bar 
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Gentlemen, thank you for the dance.
text:  walks down the bar and hops out the front door.
scene_heading: INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S APARTMENT - MORNING
text: A badly beaten BRUCE finishes his letter with a bruised fade
text: and a black eye swollen almost shut.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (V.O.)
dialog: Tonight I learned that I am nothing
dialog: more than a LUCKY AMATEUR. To climb
dialog: the ladder of crime, I will need
dialog: protection, weapons, technique. I
dialog: need to cultivate an advantage if
dialog: I'm to take my war up the ladder of
dialog: crime to the bosses, to the
dialog: GENERALS. But what should that
dialog: advantage be, Father. How will I
dialog: find it? Your loving son, Bruce.
text: BRUCE finishes the letter, folds it, puts it into an envelope
text: and stamps it. He looks at it for a moment then adds it to a

scene_heading: INT. MAYOR NOONE'S OFFICE - DAY

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Yes, sir. I'm afraid so.
speaker_heading: NOONE
dialog: First let me say how impressed I am
dialog: that you've come forward. I know
dialog: how hard these situations can be.
dialog: I want you to know I admire your
dialog: bravery and integrity. We need more
dialog: men like you on the force.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Thank you sir. I'm not trying to be
dialog: a hero or anything. It's just
dialog: that... Well, things are out of
dialog: control.
speaker_heading: NOONE
dialog: Of course, I understand. Have a
dialog: seat. Now tell me everything. Why
dialog: did you come to my office? It's not
dialog: the normal route. Why bypass
dialog: internal affairs?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I believe the problem goes beyond
dialog: the East End precinct, far higher.
dialog: I've seen the money, been offered
dialog: bribes  almost forced to take
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: NOONE
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I can name names. I am willing to
dialog: testify. I believe my current
dialog: notoriety with the news media makes
dialog: this the perfect time to bring this
dialog: matter to the public. If we hold a
dialog: press conference...
speaker_heading: NOONE
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Whoah, slow down, Jim. I'm afraid
dialog: it's not as simple as that. We have
dialog: to be very careful how we present
dialog: our case. Now who have you told
dialog: about what you know? Who knows
dialog: you've contacted me?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: No one. I mean besides my wife. I
dialog: don't know what sort of
dialog: repercussions I'd face if they knew
dialog: I was here.
speaker_heading: NOONE
dialog: Good. The fewer people who know the
dialog: better. You may be in serious
dialog: danger if these corrupt officers
dialog: knew we were working together.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Yeah. OK. What do you want me to
dialog: do?
speaker_heading: NOONE
dialog: For now, I'll see what I can do on
dialog: my end. I want you to lay low, act
dialog: normal. I'll contact you when it's
dialog: time for us to make our move.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: But sir, there has to be something
dialog: I can do to help us prepare our
dialog: case. At least I can document what
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: NOONE
dialog: Do nothing to jeopardize your
dialog: safety. Keep clear of the officers
dialog: involved. Let them think it's
dialog: business as usual in Gotham while
dialog: we work up a plan of action.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: (nods)
dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: NOONE
dialog: (stands and offers hand)

speaker_heading: TRANSFORMING.

speaker_heading: GORDON
speaker_heading: Officer CRAMDEN been taking care of

speaker_heading: O'NEIL.
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Think of it as quality control. We

dialog: up to, what, $200 a week now.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: $250 papa, and I still get the

speaker_heading: BRUCE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I will follow his lead.

speaker_heading: Under the words SPECIAL REPORT 
speaker_heading: TV NEWS ANCHOR, BRIAN
dialog: Criminals are a superstitious and

speaker_heading: TV NEWS CO-ANCHOR, JANE
dialog: That's Right BRIAN, the vigilante

text: They show victims with MARKS ON THEIR FACES.
text: BRUCE looks at his father's SIGNET RING and picks something

speaker_heading: MUGGER

speaker_heading: LOEB
dialog: Mayor, sit down.
dialog: (Mayor sits)
dialog: You should leave this to me. Frank.
speaker_heading: MAYOR NOONE
dialog: But Gillian, our operations. He

speaker_heading: LOEB
dialog: (interrupts)
dialog: And maybe you need to remember
dialog: who's running this show. I'll say
dialog: when we slow things down, which
dialog: will be NEVER, AND how we handle
dialog: Gordon.
speaker_heading: MAYOR NOONE
dialog: He was at my office again. Said
dialog: he's making a file documenting what
dialog: he knows. I tried to get it but he
dialog: wouldn't hand it over. He's a loose

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: You wanted to see me, sir?
speaker_heading: LOEB
dialog: Yes, Gordon. I heard about the
dialog: unfortunate incident the other day.
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Funny, you'd think a trained police

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Yes, you would.

speaker_heading: LOEB
dialog: I'm reassigning you.
text: GORDON suppresses a smile, hopeful.
speaker_heading: LOEB (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Honey, can't this wait?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: This file is my only chance. They
dialog: put me on THE BAT-MAN case to get
dialog: rid of me. I can't let Loeb push me
dialog: aside that easily. I've got to
dialog: compile the evidence Noone needs to
dialog: take them down.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: OK, honey. But come to bed soon.
text: She gives him a kiss and leaves. GORDON resumes typing.
speaker_heading: GORDON (V O.)
dialog: Section fourteen: Commissioner
dialog: Loeb. Based on interviews and my
dialog: direct contact with the
dialog: commissioner, I believe it is
dialog: possible the commissioner's
dialog: involvement goes far deeper than
dialog: the kickback slush fund. Loeb may
dialog: be CONTROLLING all organized crime
dialog: in Gotham City. As of now these
dialog: allegations are mere speculation, I
dialog: don't have the resources to pursue
dialog: that line of inquiry.
text: GORDON sighs, lights another MARLBORO and goes back to work.
scene_heading: INT. GOTHAM JUSTICE BUILDING. BASEMENT - MORNING,

text: another hallway with flickering lights, to the door to 
scene_heading: INT. GORDON'S NEW OFFICE - MORNING
text: On the walls hang maps with numbered pins, police sketches of
text: THE BAT-MAN and photos of the MARKS on victims' faces.
text: As GORDON enters, a young police officer, MERKEL, jumps up.
speaker_heading: MERKEL
dialog: Good morning, sir. Three more came
dialog: in last night sir.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Let me guess, we'll find all of
dialog: them in the prison wing at Gotham
dialog: Mercy.
speaker_heading: MERKEL
dialog: Yup. All three, admitted last
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: We better hit the road then. I can

text: GORDON leaves. MERKEL runs after him pulling on his coat.
scene_heading: INT. GOTHAM MEMORIAL HOSPITAL. SECURITY WARD - LATER
text: GORDON and MERKEL meet Dr. Wallace as they pass through

text: Everywhere beaten men lie cuffed to hospital beds. Some in
text: traction, or horrible looking braces. Almost all bear the
text: MARK OF THE BAT.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Morning doctor. I hear you have a
dialog: few more guests for us to talk to.
speaker_heading: DR, WALLACE
dialog: Merkel. Gordon. Your lacerations
dialog: seem to be healing nicely.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: (ignoring the remark)
dialog: So what do you have for us today'
speaker_heading: DR WALLACE
dialog: Couple guys from an electronics
dialog: store heist. Broken clavicle, some
text: ribs, dislocated shoulder,
dialog: concussion and about 12 hours
dialog: surgery between 'em.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: And the other one?
speaker_heading: DR, WALLACE
text: A pusher from Stilmore Heights.
dialog: He'll need some dental work and he
dialog: took about 75 stitches but he's OK.
dialog: We have him in isolation if you
dialog: want to talk to him.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: DR. WALLACE
dialog: Seems he was made to eat his own
dialog: product. We've had to keep him away
dialog: from the general population.
text: The doctor stops to inspect the chart for a man in bandages.
speaker_heading: GORDON
speaker_heading: (to MERKEL)
dialog: Do you notice anything about these
dialog: men?
speaker_heading: MERKEL
dialog: You mean the mark of the bat?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: No, I'm talking about their spirit.
text: These men are broken. Scared.
text: MERKEL looks around. HE'S RIGHT! Some of the criminals are
dialog: even crying.
text: Just then the doctor opens a door for the cops.
speaker_heading: DR. WALLACE
dialog: Here's your drug dealer.
text: In the corner of the padded room cowers the former shell of a
text: once-tough street pusher. His haunted eyes are framed by
text: stitched-up wounds that still very much resemble a bat.
scene_heading: INT. HARVEY DENT'S OFFICE - LATER
text: Harvey DENT opens a door bearing the words, "HARVEY DENT,
scene_heading: ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY" for GORDON.
text: The two men enter together. GORDON carries a note pad.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: You're kidding me! I'm THE BAT-MAN
dialog: vigilante? My wife will love this.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Hey, you're young, you work out.
dialog: And I've seen your record. You have
dialog: no love of organized crime. I saw
text: the ESTRADA trial on TV.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Yeah, well he's still on the
dialog: streets, isn't he. If I was the
dialog: vigilante, ESTRADA would be making
dialog: license plates right now, not
dialog: running Gotham's prostitution
dialog: racket.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Yeah, it must be FRUSTRATING.
dialog: (flipping through notes)
dialog: You know, ESTRADA's operation has
dialog: been hit quite a few times. A
dialog: detective was even killed at one of
dialog: his brothels.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: I heard. Detective CAMPBELL. No big
dialog: loss for the department from what I
dialog: understand.
text: GORDON smiles at that.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Yeah, well I have a list of dates
dialog: and times. I'd like you to account
dialog: for your whereabouts.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: (takes the list)
dialog: Sorry detective, I was in DC at a
dialog: convention for three of these dates
dialog: and my wife will tell you I was
text: home with her for most of the rest.
dialog: I'm not your BAT-MAN. Wish I was
dialog: but I'm not.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: No you don't. He's a dangerous
dialog: psychopath. And when I catch him,
text: he's going down hard.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: I'm surprised to hear you say that
dialog: Gordon. I hear you're one of few
text: remaining good cops on the force.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Oh Christ, not you too. You of all
dialog: people should know, we live in a
dialog: society of laws. This guy isn't a
dialog: hero. He thinks he's above the law.
dialog: He's a terrorist. Plain and simple.

scene_heading: INT. UPHOLSTERY DISTRICT CATHOUSE - NIGHT
text: SELINA and HOLLY now live in a large warehouse divided by

text: Selina wears a blonde wig.
dialog: It's dinner time, SELINA: Tuna from a can, HOLLY: Pizza.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: SELINA, I don't like it here.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Hush. Keep your voice down. I'm

dialog: we are.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Look, I don't like it any better
dialog: than you, OK? But I've got an idea.
dialog: We can change things  for real
dialog: this time.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: What are you going to do?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I'm going to take a little something
dialog: back from those bastards. I'm going
dialog: to make them pay.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Can't we just leave town, go
speaker_heading: somewhere where CHI-CHI and the
dialog: cops can't find us?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Come on HOLLY. If it isn't CHI-CHI,
dialog: it's going to be someone else.
dialog: (moves closer to HOLLY)
dialog: Now, I've been talking to some of
dialog: the girls who work down on Franklin
dialog: street. They say sometimes city
dialog: limos pick up girls down there for
dialog: parties. I figure we get a
dialog: camera...
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: You're SCARING me.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Yeah, well, maybe it's TIME we did

scene_heading: INT. GORDON'S CRAMPED, NEW OFFICE - NIGHT
text: GORDON smokes a cigarette and watches a small monitor set up

text: The security tape, CHOPPY and GRAINY, shows the inside of a
dialog: jewelry store.
text: Four men climb through a broken window and begin stuffing
dialog: their pockets with gems.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Watch this. He scares the crap out
dialog: of them.
text: Suddenly they all jump in surprise.
text: A dark SHADOWY FIGURE enters the frame. It's THE BAT-MAN but
dialog: we can't make out exactly what he looks like. To us he's just
text: a big, black hulk.
text: The men back away, SCARED. THE SHADOWY FIGURE LEAPS ON THEM.
text: There's a fight but it's over very quickly. The SHADOWY
text: FIGURE leaves the thieves TWITCHING on the floor.
speaker_heading: MERKEL
dialog: Jesus. The guy is BRUTAL.
speaker_heading: GORDON
text: Yeah. BRUTAL and VICIOUS.
speaker_heading: MERKEL
dialog: Shouldn't you call it a night?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I've still got a little more work
dialog: to do.
speaker_heading: MERKEL
dialog: All right. Well, good night, sir.

dialog: both.
scene_heading: INT. HARVEY DENT'S OFFICE - DAY
text: GORDON bursts in unannounced.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Harvey, I need a favor
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Good morning to you too, Jim.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I need a search warrant.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: You don't need a warrant to search
dialog: my place, Jim.
dialog: You're always welcome. Come over
dialog: tonight and dig through my
dialog: underwear drawer for a mask and
dialog: cape.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Sorry, you're not a suspect
dialog: anymore, Harvey. You're just not
speaker_heading: BAT-MAN material.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: My wife will be so disappointed.
dialog: She's really into the suit.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Yeah, OK. I didn't need to hear
dialog: that.
dialog: (gets serious)
dialog: It's not a BAT-MAN thing, Harvey.
dialog: I've got a hunch.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: A hunch? Aren't you supposed to
dialog: stick to THE BAT-MAN case?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: That's what I need you for. I can't
dialog: request it myself.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: OK, I'm listening
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: After we spoke, I got to thinking
dialog: about the CAMPBELL murder. He was
dialog: killed INSIDE one of ESTRADA's
dialog: cathouses, just before the
dialog: vigilante appeared. And ESTRADA's
dialog: prostitution ring has been hammered
dialog: by the vigilante.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: So you think ESTRADA can lead you
dialog: to THE BAT-MAN?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Or the other way around. It doesn't
dialog: matter.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: I still don't get it.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Look, I just want to take a look
text: inside one of ESTRADA's warehouses.
dialog: OK?
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Hey. OK. You got it. I'll put the
dialog: request in front of Judge Gillen
dialog: this afternoon. Jim, this BAT-MAN
dialog: thing is really getting to you,
dialog: huh?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: The guy's slippery and he's getting
dialog: better. Doing bigger and bigger
dialog: criminals. He's changing his M.O.,
dialog: using a random pattern so we can't
dialog: catch him. And he's been working on
text: his disguise. It's... TRANSFORMING.
speaker_heading: SMASH CUT:
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT
text: A shadow runs across the gravel toped surface, and leaps to
dialog: the next roof.
text: Seen from below as a fast, fluttering blur against a cloud
text: filled night-sky.
text: He's going from high buildings to lower ones, jumping and
text: rolling into the shadows.
text: A window opens, a confused person looks out .
speaker_heading: CONFUSED PERSON
dialog: You see that Harold?
speaker_heading: HAROLD (O.S.)
dialog: Betty, ferchristsake, close the
dialog: window. You'll catch your death.
text: Betty closes the window and gets back to her life.
text: We follow his progress but have trouble seeing him. We catch
text: a glimpse as he LEAPS from a high building across an alley
text: onto the fire escape on the other side.
text: Then he's gone over the lip of the roof.
dialog: This is THE BAT-MAN's environment, elevator rooms dripping
text: with tar, the water towers, the TV antennas, ABANDONED
text: mattresses, old chairs, cable TV hookup boxes, the crisp
dialog: night air, alone.
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN (V.O.)
dialog: The new identity changes everything,

dialog: fear in their hearts. I HAVE BECOME
speaker_heading: THEIR NIGHTMARE!
text: Then we finally get a good look at THE BAT-MAN decked out in
text: his new threads. He's MASSIVE, TERRIFYING, SPECTACULAR.

scene_heading: EXT. EAST END WAREHOUSE. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Below GORDON and a bunch of UNIFORMED COPS file out of a

scene_heading: INT. EAST END WAREHOUSE  NIGHT
text: CHI-CHI makes his way through rows of stacked cardboard boxes
text: and rolls of carpet.
text: Then it's, slowly and painfully, up a flight of wooden stairs
text: to an office, the kind with glass windows overlooking the
text: warehouse and high glass skylights.
text: In the office, five young men drape themselves over leather
text: sofas, smoking, and throwing potato chips at a group of
text: young, malnourished women who cower on the floor.
text: SANCHEZ, an older, fat man, sits behind a desk on the phone.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: They just left. Yeah, they had a

dialog: them they're house cleaners. Hey,
dialog: what can they do? The girls have
dialog: papers.
text: Nobody greets CHI-CHI as he enters. No one offers him a seat.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, they look good too. No, I got
dialog: the Russian ones. Oh yeah? No shit!
dialog: The shipment from Honk Kong or the
dialog: Mainland? Well I hope they're as
dialog: good as these.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ hangs up.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ (CONT'D)
dialog: So, CHI-CHI. Leg still hurt?
speaker_heading: CHI-CHI
dialog: Well sometimes when it's wet out I
dialog: get this...
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: No one cares. What's our take for
dialog: the week?
speaker_heading: CHI-CHI
dialog: We did OK.
text: CHI-CHI crutches over and puts a yellow paper bag from a

speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: (looks in the bag)
dialog: OK? What the hell is OK? We don't
dialog: pay you for OK. We want good. We
dialog: want great. We want freaking
dialog: excellent out of you!
speaker_heading: CHI-CHI
dialog: There's been problems lately.
dialog: Business is off. This vigilante is

dialog: everyone scared to...
speaker_heading: CRASH!
text: A shower of glass drops from an overhead skylight.
text: THE BAT-MAN lands on SANCHEZ' desk.
text: A terrifying demon of the night. Pure menace.
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN
dialog: Gentlemen, I'm here to ask you a
dialog: few questions.
text: The men are stunned paralyzed by fear until SANCHEZ pulls an
text: UZI from a holster and fires a volley at THE BAT-MAN.
speaker_heading: BUT HE'S GONE.
text: The bullets strike CHI-CHI in the CHEST. HE GOES DOWN.
text: THE BAT-MAN is in the air, he somersaults over the men on the
dialog: sofas.
text: Smoke Bombs fly from his fingers.
scene_heading: POP. POP. POP. POP.
text: Then it's all shadows and confusion.
dialog: Guns fire.
scene_heading: BAM. BAM. BAM.
speaker_heading: Bones CRACK.
dialog: People SCREAM.
scene_heading: Guns - CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. - empty.
text: Finally a body smashes through the plate glass onto the
text: warehouse floor. A chimney effect takes place. The smoke, no

text: leaving THE BAT-MAN and SANCHEZ the lone people on two feet.
text: SANCHEZ, in shock, clicks his empty gun.
text: The women break for the door and scatter into the night.
text: A man clutches his throat and writhes on the desk.
text: Without ever removing his eyes from SANCHEZ, THE BAT-MAN
text: draws a knife and jabs it into the choking man's throat.
dialog: Instant tracheotomy.
text: The man can breathe, he slides, relieved, to the floor.
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN
dialog: Now then, where is your boss.
text: THE BAT-MAN grabs SANCHEZ by the head with both hands
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: Where is ESTRADA?

dialog: Fear clouds their judgement, makes

text: Guys keep pouring down the stairs.
text: THE BAT-MAN throws one OVER THE RAIL. Another goes THROUGH A
speaker_heading: WINDOW.
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: They are like rag dolls to me now.
text: To be thrown aside and forgotten.
text: A third gets CRUSHED UNDERFOOT as THE BAT-MAN continues to
text: climb, floor by floor, to the top.
text: It's been a tough fight. He's sweated through his clothes,
text: lost his cape but the action only makes him stronger. A GLOW
text: OF EXCITEMENT shines off him.
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: There is only one man I am looking
dialog: for tonight. He's the GENERAL!
text: And, now, before him ESTRADA tries to muster some composure.
text: He's run out of men to fight for him and stands surrounded by
text: half-starved Asian women with hate in their eyes.
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ah, ESTRADA. At last we meet face
dialog: to face. Such as it is. You're
dialog: coming with me. I have a lot of
dialog: questions for you.
text: ESTRADA is backing to the wall in pure fear. THE BAT-MAN's
text: gloved hand covers his eyes. Everything goes DARK.
scene_heading: EXT. 6-STORY.WAREHOUSE. NEAR GOTHAM DOCKS - LATER
text: Close up of a syringe.
text: The tip makes a dimple in ESTRADA's neck.
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN
dialog: This is Hydro-strychnine-sulfate,
dialog: you can think of it as a cross
dialog: between truth serum and the worst
dialog: acid trip of your life. Makes the
dialog: stuff they had a Woodstock feel
dialog: like aspirin.
text: THE BAT-MAN presses the sinister syringe into ESTRADA's
dialog: carotid artery.
text: There's an immediate change in ESTRADA's attitude.
scene_heading: EXT. SIX STORY WAREHOUSE - MORNING
text: An obviously drugged ESTRADA, duct taped to a 6th floor flag
text: pole, rants loudly.
text: A few cops stand around looking up at the spectacle.
text: A crowd has gathered. ESTRADA yells to anyone who will
dialog: listen
speaker_heading: ESTRADA
dialog: We get the girls from overseas.
dialog: They work for us. Loeb takes money,
text: he runs the show. The trains run on
dialog: time. Keeps the show on the road.
dialog: Police say, you do your job, we do
dialog: your job. No wait. I do my job you
dialog: pay me. Something like that.
speaker_heading: ESTRADA (CONT'D)
dialog: We go to parties sometimes. I have
dialog: a nice car.
speaker_heading: CORRUPT COP

text: GORDON rages at a desk sergeant.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: This man is a known felon. He's on
dialog: the MOST WANTED LIST. We have
dialog: numerous witnesses who heard him
dialog: confessing to serious racketeering
dialog: and corruption operations. You
dialog: can't just let him go!
speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT
dialog: He walks. I got my orders.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: (kicking the desk, hard)
dialog: Dammit!
text: DENT pulls GORDON off.	.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Jesus, Jim, calm down. What do you
dialog: expect, the man was assaulted,
dialog: drugged, kidnapped. Nothing he says
dialog: is admissible in court. No sane
dialog: person will prosecute.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Bull. It was Loeb who sprung him to
dialog: cover his own butt.
text: GORDON stomps off in a rage.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GOTHAM JUSTICE BUILDING - MORNING
text: THE BAT-MAN sits in his LINCOLN CONTINENTAL across the street
text: from the police station. In the morning light it looks more
text: like a souped-up limo than a demon car - ALMOST.
text: THE BAT-MAN is totally messed up. His clothes hang in
text: tatters. Blood puddles in the foot-well of the car.
text: He listens to the tapes of ESTRADA's 'confession' 
speaker_heading: ESTRADA (V.O.)
dialog: (on tape)
dialog: Loeb runs the whole thing, uses
dialog: cops as bagmen to collect and
dialog: distribute the	money. He's into
dialog: everything, numbers, drugs, girls,
dialog: guns. You name it, he gets a cut.
dialog: Hey, you don't look like my mother.
dialog: Click.
text: THE BAT-MAN turns off the machine and looks out his tinted
dialog: window.
text: GORDON storms out of the precinct house.
text: A dazed and rumpled looking ESTRADA (newly released) and
text: FLASS (his releaser) share a smile at GORDON'S obvious fury.
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN (V.O.)
text: The enemy is everywhere, even HERE.
dialog: These so called policemen nurture
dialog: the cancer, they breed it in men
dialog: like ESTRADA and turn it lose on my
text: streets. It looks like ESTRADA is
dialog: only another soldier. The real
dialog: generals live in there.
text: THE BAT-MAN looks up at the GOTHAM JUSTICE BUILDING and says
dialog: out loud 
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN
dialog: It's your turn Loeb. I'm coming
dialog: after YOU.
text: With a painful effort, THE BAT-MAN puts the car in gear.
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN (V.O.)
dialog: So I must climb higher still. Your
dialog: loving son, Bruce.
speaker_heading: The LINCOLN drives off.

scene_heading: EXT. JUNK YARD BEHIND LITTLE AL'S GARAGE - MORNING

text: been moved. Rearranged.
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL
dialog: Bruce?
text: All around LITTLE AL sees evidence of TARGET PRACTICE,
text: STRANGE DEVICES and SMALL EXPLOSIONS. There's the LINCOLN
text: CONTINENTAL with BLOOD POOLED ON THE SEAT.
text: He follows BLOOD DROPLETS up the wooden stairs that lead to
text: BRUCE's apartment. The door hangs slightly ajar. LITTLE AL
text: pushes it open and enters.
scene_heading: INT. THE BAT-MAM'S LAIR - MORNING
text: BRUCE's apartment has been TRANSFORMED into a crime fighting
dialog: command center.
text: There's a HUGE FLOW chart describing Gotham's crime
dialog: organizations, people's names, rank, jobs and police
dialog: involvement.
text: Pictures of LOEB and ESTRADA hang from the wall with duct
text: tape. Crime fighting gear lays piled on the tables (and is
dialog: that CHI-CHI's paper department store bag of money?).
text: In a series of metal lockers we can see the progression of
text: BRUCE's suits, belts, weapons and disguises. Some broken.
text: Many caked with blood.
text: LITTLE AL finds THE BAT-MAN lying UNCONSCIOUS ON THE FLOOR.
dialog: He's lost a lot of blood.
scene_heading: INT. THE BAT-MAN'S LAIR - HOURS LATER
text: BRUCE comes around in his bed. His eyes flutter and then snap
text: open. He's momentarily confused.
text: LITTLE AL sits nearby drinking a coffee.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: You... didn't call the police?
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL
dialog: Nope.
text: BRUCE looks at his bandages. Not a bad job at all. He tries
dialog: to sit up. Too painful.
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL
dialog: Settle down boy, let me tell you
dialog: something. I seen a lot of people
dialog: get cut all to pieces in the
dialog: jungle. And after, I seen even more
text: come home all cut up on the inside.
dialog: Now, they trained me to heal a man
text: on the outside with bandages and
dialog: thread. But there ain't nothing
dialog: anyone can do for those wounds on
dialog: the inside. You just stay the hell
dialog: out of the way and hope they sort
dialog: it out for themselves. I've been
dialog: wondering when you were going to go
dialog: off. But this? This is something
dialog: else.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You know it's a lucky thing we're
dialog: the same blood type.
text: LITTLE AL holds up his arm. He's got a transfusion hose going
dialog: from it into BRUCE.
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL (CONT'D)
dialog: If we weren't, I'd have HAD to take
dialog: you to the hospital. And they would
dialog: have thrown your ass in Arkham

text: GORDON follows an orderly through the large, time-worn

text: Strange sounds emanate from doors lining the hallways 
scene_heading: WHIMPERING. GIGGLING. SOBBING.
text: A pair of ORDERLIES pass wheeling a young, very pale man in a

speaker_heading: ORDERLY #1
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: You're joking.
text: GORDON watches them go by before knocking on an office door
dialog: marked, "Dr. Patricia Holcomb, MD, Ph.D. Director.'
scene_heading: INT. PATRICIA HOLCOMB'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON.
text: Patricia Holcomb is a handsome woman reaching early middle
dialog: age with all the dignity that could be expected of someone
text: who spends their lives surrounded by the criminally insane.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Thank you for seeing me doctor.
dialog: I'll try not to take up much of
dialog: your time.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR HOLCOMB
dialog: Not at all detective. I've been
dialog: following your vigilante case with
text: some interest. An intriguing mind.
dialog: I look forward to hosting it, if
dialog: that's possible.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: You say that as if you don't think
dialog: we're going to catch him.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR HOLCOMB
dialog: I'm not sure you can, not alive
dialog: anyway. I've read the files you
dialog: sent over. They describe a man who
dialog: inhabits a delusional world of
dialog: great danger and violence.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Danger and violence. Sounds about
dialog: right for the East End.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR HOLCOMB
dialog: Ah, but this mind inhabits a world
dialog: more horrible than the East End.
dialog: A world so threatening and
dialog: dangerous that it's had to create a
text: new persona, a new IDENTITY to
dialog: cope.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: This guy's become a demon in order
dialog: to fight his demons.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR HOLCOMB
dialog: Exactly. Now, normally this kind of
dialog: delusion represents the terminal
text: stage of a suicidal psychosis.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: He's trying to kill himself?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR HOLCOMB
dialog: Yes and no. Something is keeping it
dialog: going. A quest or a mission of some
dialog: sort. Much like the crusaders in
dialog: ancient Europe who were capable of
dialog: great feats by virtue of their
dialog: belief or faith.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: You mean flying? X-ray vision?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR HOLCOMB
dialog: Nothing like that I assure you.
dialog: More like mothers lifting cars off
dialog: children during emergencies. Or
dialog: even monks and Yogis who's faith
dialog: allows them to do incredible things
dialog: with their bodies.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: So how do I catch him before his
dialog: faith does any more "great feats"
dialog: to the citizens of this city?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR HOLCOMB
dialog: I'm afraid that's your problem
dialog: Detective. My job is knowing what
dialog: makes them thick, not what makes
dialog: them run. I will tell you
dialog: this though, that mind is starting
dialog: to enjoy its work. It's capable of
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Come on doctor, what do I DQ? How
dialog: do I stop him before he kills
dialog: someone?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR HOLCOMB
dialog: I suppose you strike at the
dialog: weaknesses. What is this great
dialog: delusion protecting? It didn't just
dialog: come into being over night. It
dialog: started long ago with a young boy
text: being terribly, terribly hurt.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Huh. Interesting. Thank you doctor.
text: GORDON stands to go.
scene_heading: EXT. ARKHAM ASYLUM, PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: JANET SELLING
dialog: Detective Gordon, Detective Gordon.
dialog: Wait up a second. JANET SELLING,
dialog: Channel One News. Can I have a word
dialog: with you?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Sorry, I'm in a rush here.
speaker_heading: JANET SELLING
dialog: It'll only take a second. I want
dialog: to ask about allegations of
dialog: corruption in the precinct. I'm
dialog: hoping you'll corroborate some of
dialog: the rumors I've been hearing.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I really AM in a hurry.
speaker_heading: JANET SELLING
dialog: A hurry to what, chase a mental
dialog: case? Doesn't it ANGER you that
dialog: you've been put out to pasture
dialog: while all through the department
text: corruption is running rampant.
text: GORDON SPINS on her, furious. Then catches himself and

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: OK, what do you want to know?

speaker_heading: MAYOR NOONE
dialog: You see Channel One News? They just
dialog: ran a big police corruption story.
dialog: Someone's talking. It's that damn
dialog: Gordon, I'm telling you.
speaker_heading: LOEB
dialog: We're going to have to take drastic
dialog: measures with that detective. But
dialog: right now we've got bigger
dialog: problems. Our friends on the street
dialog: are making some seriously unhappy
dialog: noises about this vigilante.
speaker_heading: MAYOR NOONE
dialog: For Christ's sake, Gillian! Things
dialog: are slipping into chaos. What's
dialog: going on around here?
speaker_heading: LOEB
dialog: I don't know, exactly. For now, our
dialog: boys on the force are keeping our
dialog: associates calm. But I'd like to
dialog: meet face-to-face, let them air
dialog: their concerns, do a little damage
dialog: control.
speaker_heading: MAYOR NOONE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Sounds like you're talking about
dialog: one of your parties.
speaker_heading: LOEB
dialog: Yeah, I talked to ESTRADA he'll
dialog: bring some girls.
speaker_heading: MAYOR NOONE
dialog: All his girls are so  PRISSY.
speaker_heading: LOEB
dialog: Don't worry, I know you like 'em
dialog: more, umm, assertive. We'll find
dialog: you a party favor. I'll see to it
dialog: myself. And by the way, here.
text: LOEB tosses a yellow envelope like the one FLASS tried to
dialog: give to GORDON, only fatter, at the mayor.
speaker_heading: LOEB (CONT'D)
dialog: The precinct guys wanted you to

text: Wrapped in his cape, THE BAT-MAN remains unmoving in the

speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN
dialog: (to self)
dialog: Oh boy, we've been invited to a
dialog: party.
text: He reels in his contact mic.
scene_heading: INT. HARVEY DENT'S OFFICE - MORNING
text: GORDON bursts in, interrupting. It's becoming a pattern with
dialog: these two.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: What's up Jim. You look terrible.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: (paces the room)
dialog: My office was ransacked. They were
dialog: at my apartment too. Broke the
dialog: locks, tossed the place. They tried
dialog: to make it look like burglars but I
dialog: think it was Flass and his crew
dialog: looking for my file.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: I'm not surprised, after that news
dialog: story, you're likely to be public
dialog: enemy number one to those guys. In
dialog: fact, that file MAY be only thing
dialog: keeping you alive at this point.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Great, because they FOUND it and
dialog: they TOOK it.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Here sit down, have some coffee.
dialog: You got to get out of town,
dialog: disappear for a while.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Right, I'll go up to a cabin in the
dialog: woods and die of multiple,
dialog: accidental hunting gunshot wounds
dialog: to the back.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Jesus, calm down Jim. Just take it
dialog: easy. There has to be something you
dialog: can do.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Nope. It's business as usual for
dialog: me. I play the good soldier, stay
dialog: low and hunt for my BAT-MAN.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: They don't want you to catch the
dialog: vigilante, they would give you some
dialog: manpower if they did. And when you
dialog: capture the guy, they're going to
dialog: crucify you on the news. This guy's
dialog: becoming a saint to some people.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: He's a terrorist, Harvey. A
text: DANGEROUS PSYCHOPATH. Who knows how
dialog: far he'll take his personal war on
dialog: crime.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Yeah, it's really scary to think
dialog: how far a guy will go to rid this

dialog: DENT meant that as a JAB but GORDON missed it.
scene_heading: EXT. FRANKLIN STREET - NIGHT
text: A limo rolls through the darkened streets. As it passes

text: ALL BUT ONE. She's different. Confident and attractive where
text: the others twitch and vamp, PITIFUL and HORRID.
text: IT'S SELINA. She's dressed in knee-high black boots, black
text: leather pants, a leather halter top. She wears her wig and
text: carries a whip.
scene_heading: INT. THE LIMO - NIGHT
speaker_heading: LOEB assesses SELINA.
speaker_heading: LOEB
dialog: (to the driver)
dialog: That one.
dialog: And the next thing you know SELINA is inside 
scene_heading: INT. LOEB'S MANSION. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: LOEB lives in a beautiful, old-world mansion, one of the many
dialog: benefits he's received from his long career of graft.
text: SELINA lies on his FOUR POSTER BED in his tacky mirror-and
dialog: silk bedroom.
speaker_heading: LOEB
dialog: Make yourself at home darling. I
dialog: have some business to attend to,
dialog: then I'll introduce you to a good
dialog: friend of mine. He's eager to meet
dialog: you.
text: The moment LOEB leaves, descending the grand staircase,
text: SELINA dumps her purse on the bed  cuffs, whips, rubber ball
text: and a SMALL CAMERA with a long TRIGGER CORD.
text: She finds a hiding place for the CAMERA and strings the CORD
text: under the headboard.
text: Then she casually begins to case the place  turns over the
text: CERAMICS to read the brand, checks out the SILVER HAIR BRUSH.
text: She grabs a SATIN PILLOW CASE and fills it with loot.
text: She peeks through a gilded door it leads to a staircase.
text: Intrigued, SELINA descends to another door that leads to 

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. LOEB'S MANSION - NIGHT
text: Off-duty cops and gangsters party with ESTRADA's exotic

text: LOEB makes his entrance, followed by Mayor NOONE.
text: LOEB's guests stand as he takes a glass and clinks it.
speaker_heading: LOEB
dialog: Gentlemen I've brought a guest with
dialog: me this evening. Mayor NOONE would
dialog: like to express his gratitude for
dialog: the civil way you've all conducted
dialog: your business these last few years.
dialog: Isn't that right mayor?
speaker_heading: MAYOR NOONE
dialog: Yes, indeed. I am very grateful for
dialog: the restraint you've shown by
dialog: keeping your businesses localized
dialog: to your own, umm, areas of
dialog: expertise and I would like to
dialog: pledge to you all 
speaker_heading: LOEB
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: All right, fine. Down to business.
text: LOEB takes a seat in a big leather club chair by the fire.
text: NOONE looks around for a chair, finds none and wanders over
speaker_heading: towards the BAR.
text: But unbeknownst to the party, one more person is in
dialog: attendance. He's 
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE IN THE BUSHES - NIGHT
text: THE BAT-MAN has his contact microphone attached to the window
text: of the living room. He listens intently to the conversation
dialog: taking place inside -
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. LOEB'S MANSION - NIGHT
text: LOEB holds forth, the center of attention.
speaker_heading: LOEB
dialog: Our topic of discussion this
text: evening: THE BAT-MAN.
text: A MURMUR goes through the gangsters. While nearby in 
scene_heading: INT. LOEB'S STUDY - NIGHT
text: SELINA roots around. She checks out STATUES, lifts CARPETS,
text: tosses the odd GOLD CIGAR CLIPPER into her PILLOW CASE.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. LOEB'S MANSION - NIGHT
speaker_heading: LOEB continues 
speaker_heading: LOEB
dialog: Gentlemen I know THE BAT-MAN has
dialog: caused some problems for our
dialog: operations. But his activities must
dialog: be kept in proper perspective. He
dialog: is an annoyance, nothing more. A
dialog: temporary fly in a very rich
dialog: ointment.
speaker_heading: GANGSTER #1
dialog: Are you CRAZY? Do you know how many
dialog: of my boys that PSYCHO has
dialog: hospitalized?
speaker_heading: GANGSTER #2
dialog: It is absolutely preposterous that
dialog: you would even think about leaving
dialog: this nut case to ruin our
dialog: businesses like this. After what
dialog: he's done to our OPERATIONS.
text: Meanwhile, SELINA continues to rifle through 
scene_heading: INT. LOEB'S STUDY. LOEB'S MANSION - NIGHT
text: She's made her way into the DESK DRAWER.
text: She finds CASH, a SILVER PLATED GUN, a SAFE DEPOSIT BOX KEY.
text: Some PAPERS grab her attention  GORDON'S.
text: She reads a little bit, finally she just dumps the whole
text: drawer, PAPERS and all, into the PILLOW CASE.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. LOEB'S MANSION - NIGHT
text: The arguing continues.
speaker_heading: LOEB
dialog: Think of the big picture. Sooner or
dialog: later, we'll get lucky and someone
dialog: will put a bullet in this nut.
dialog: Until then, the media love him. He
dialog: gives the impression that the city
dialog: is getting safer.
text: The men, starting to catch his drift, nod.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE IN THE BUSHES - NIGHT
text: THE BAT-MAN has heard all he cares to hear.
text: He's about to crash the party with the HAND GRENADE he holds
text: in his fist  two inches from his mouth dangles its circular
dialog: pin.
text: Suddenly his head snaps to the side. He's heard something
dialog: that we haven't. He's not at all pleased.

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. LOEB'S MANSION - NIGHT
text: The conversation continues.
speaker_heading: LOEB
dialog: This 'war on crime' forms the

dialog: We don't want to jeopardize them
dialog: now that the money is really

text: Shouts and stomping feet interrupt LOEB's appeal.
scene_heading: INT. LOEB'S STUDY - NIGHT
text: Three armed security guards burst into the room and catch
text: SELINA, red handed trying to pry open a locked cabinet. She's
dialog: tripped an alarm.
text: SELINA turns and without missing a beat assumes a regal air.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: How DARE you enter without
dialog: knocking.
text: The men look confused as she approaches.
text: Once she is close enough to the guards, she whips off her
dialog: leather belt and 
speaker_heading: CRACKS
text:  the first one across the face with the buckle, knocking his
dialog: gun free.
dialog: Then 
speaker_heading: RIPS

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LOEB'S STUDY - NIGHT
text: Three more guards rush toward the door, GUNS DRAWN.
scene_heading: INT. LOEB'S STUDY - NIGHT
text: They burst in to find SELINA securing the two guards together

speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Hello, my miserable little pets.
dialog: But these guards aren't falling for it 
dialog: BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM!
text:  they open fire.
text: SELINA dives behind the desk. Bullets rips into the antique
dialog: mahogany.
text: The dust settles. The guards LAUGH and move in for the kill.
dialog: When suddenly 
speaker_heading: CRASH!
text: A BLACK LINCOLN CONTINENTAL SMASHES into the study, taking

scene_heading: CHAOS. CONFUSION. GUNFIRE. SHOUTS.

text: inch from SELINA's face.
text: The DOOR of the LINCOLN SWINGS OPEN.
text: SELINA looks up, stunned to see THE BAT-MAN standing up

text: A security guard levels his UZI at the pair but before he can
dialog: get off a shot 
speaker_heading: THANG
text:  he's hit in the chest with two BRASS PARTS attached to THIN
speaker_heading: COPPER WIRES.

speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN
speaker_heading: (to SELINA)
dialog: Get in!

speaker_heading: TIRES SQUEAL.

dialog: This ain't no smoke bomb.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT LAWN. LOEB'S MANSION - NIGHT

text: Behind him stumbles COMMISSIONER LOEB, desperately trying to

dialog: stunned.
text: ONE BULLET cuts a bloody STREAK across BATMAN'S shoulder. He
dialog: pays it no heed.

text: THE BAT-MAN, drives with crude home-made night-vision goggles
text: while SELINA appraises the man next to her.
text: Slowly she makes a hand gesture as if she were picking up the

speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Hello mom. I've met a guy. I think
dialog: I'm in love.
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN

speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN
dialog: Hold on.
text: SELINA braces herself as he wrenches the steering wheel. The

text: Out on the road, both pursuing limos rip past doing lO0 mph.
scene_heading: INT. PURSUING LIMO - NIGHT
text: It's a windy, tree lined road through the forest.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD #1

speaker_heading: SHERIFF

speaker_heading: SECURITY" GUARD #1

speaker_heading: OH SHIT!
text: As the limo rounds the a corner it's greeted by two cop cars
text: forming a ROADBLOCK.
text: The driver desperately CUTS THE WHEEL but it's too late. The
text: big car SKIDS sideways and SMASHES into the cops.
text: The second limo SLAMS into the first.
text: Cops DIVE for cover. GLASS AND HUBCAPS go everywhere.
text: Slowly the doors open and dazed security guards get out of
dialog: the crumpled cars.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD #1
dialog: Where the hell did he go?
text: Everyone stops and turns to look up the road at THE BAT-MAN's
text: Lincoln Continental as it slowly approaches the crash site.
dialog: Suddenly  BAM!
text:  super high-powered KLEIG LIGHTS shine forth from the
dialog: Lincoln.
text: The men cover their eyes, temporarily BLINDED, as the ominous
text: black car accelerates into the wrecked cars.
text: Its heavy bumpers sink into the doors of the cop cars and
text: grind them backwards and out of the way.
text: Some of the cops and security guards regain their wits and
text: open fire with their pump action shotguns and uzis.
scene_heading: INT. THE BAT-MAN'S LINCOLN CONTINENTAL - NIGHT
text: A giant gloved fist pounds a series of heavy-duty switches
text: bolted onto the dashboard.
text: Both sides and the rear of the car erupt  BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
dialog:  road spikes -
dialog: FOOH! FOOH!  smoke -
speaker_heading: SPLASH!  oil -
text: CRACK! CRACK!  and tire-puncturing darts.
text: The gunmen stagger back, punctured, pierces and slimed by the
dialog: cannonade.
text: The Lincoln lays a generous TIRE PATCH as it accelerates,

text: Behind it the stabbed and oil-covered men can do nothing but

scene_heading: INT. THE BAT-MAN'S LINCOLN CONTINENTAL - NIGHT
text: Click. Click. And SELINA is out of the cuffs. THE BAT-MAN,

speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Handcuffs? What were you thinking?
dialog: I'm a handcuff expert.
text: He reaches for her but she's already slipped out the door.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODED ROAD - MOMENT LATER
text: SELINA rolls in the ditch at THE BAT-MOBILE skids to a stop a

text: SELINA takes off into the woods.
text: She runs through with a natural animal grace, leaping fallen
text: trees, ducking branches, moving silently.
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN (O.S.)
speaker_heading: Give it up SELINA.
text: SELINA spins around looking for the source of the voice.
text: Then breaks into a serious sprint.
text: She runs all out through the woods, leaps a stream, scrambles
text: an embankment, then out into a clearing. She's really moving
dialog: when 
speaker_heading: SMASH
text:  she's tackled by THE BAT-MAN. He pins her down in the wet
dialog: grass.
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You didn't really think you could
dialog: run from me, did you?
text: She struggles. Takes a swipe with her claws but he's ready
text: for her and easily dodges.
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm taking you in. I will not allow
dialog: murder, not even for revenge.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Whoa, slow down.
dialog: (starts to have fun with
dialog: the situation)
dialog: I didn't kill that bastard,
dialog: (shows her fingernails)
dialog: I just prettied him up a little.
text: She takes his gloved hand off her shoulder and admires the

speaker_heading: SELINA (CONT'D)
dialog: Nothing you haven't done.
dialog: (pouts, smiles)
dialog: I'm innocent.
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN

speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: (pissed)
dialog: I didn't kill him.
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN
dialog: (deflates)
dialog: Then it was the GARAGE MECHANIC?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: (shakes her head, pities
dialog: him)
dialog: No. CHI-CHI came in as I was
text: marking CAMPBELL. HE killed him.
dialog: Said the scumbag cop had taken
dialog: enough of his money. He was going
dialog: to kill me too.
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: He had me pinned, was trying to cut
dialog: my wrists with that switchblade of
dialog: his. Wanted it to look like murder
dialog: suicide. But HOLLY showed up. We
dialog: fought.
dialog: (gestures to her cheek)
dialog: I gave him a nice little something
dialog: to remember me by and got the hell
dialog: out of there. I figured you could
dialog: take care of yourself

speaker_heading: GARAGE-BOY.
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: How did you...
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Darling, in my whole life, I've
dialog: only met one REAL man. I'm not

scene_heading: EXT. THE WAREHOUSE. UPHOLSTERY DISTRICT - DAWN
text: The mangled LINCOLN pulls to the curb on an empty street.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I have this bad feeling that the
dialog: only way I'm ever going to see you
dialog: again is if I continue my life of
dialog: crime.
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN
dialog: I wouldn't recommend that. You
dialog: didn't do so well on your debut.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: (gets out)
dialog: Yeah, well, practice makes perfect,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN
dialog: (holds the pillowcase)

speaker_heading: LITTLE AL
dialog: Well, if you can take a break from

scene_heading: INT. BIG AL'S OFFICE - DAY

text: The terminus of a rusted train track lies on the floor.
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL
dialog: BIG AL bought this place form the

text: BRUCE walks around, soaking it all in.
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL (CONT'D)
dialog: This place connects to the access

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Good work son.
text: The pair take off. GORDON, alone now, walks back to his car.
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN (O.S.)
dialog: I can help you get what you want.

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: OK. We can talk. How about down at
dialog: the station?
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN
dialog: No. You don't understand.
speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN
dialog: Please. Don't. It doesn't have to

speaker_heading: UNIFORM COP #2
dialog: (into a radio)
dialog: We've got THE BAT-MAN at TRAP
speaker_heading: LOCATION ALPHA.
text: THE BAT-MAN finally heaves GORDON through the air at the

speaker_heading: BAM!
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: (only half conscious)

scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED TENNEMENT - NIGHT

dialog: Too late.
text: THE BAT-MAN throws himself back inside and leaps the railing.
text: FOOM!  the fire bomb goes off behind him.
text: THE BAT-MAN falls just ahead of debris from the explosion. He
text: hits the floor, HARD, and rolls under the staircase as half

speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't pass out.
text: THE BAT-MAN removes a syringe, labelled "stimulant", from his

speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Can't help them. Must find shelter.

speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Steel door, might be enough to

dialog: a lie.
text: He picks the lock and slips through.
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED TENNEMENT - NIGHT
text: The POLICE HELICOPTER lands. LOEB gets out looking pretty

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: That building wasn't cleared. You
dialog: hear that? That's the sound of
dialog: people DYING!
text: Screams emanate from the building. Its upper floors are

speaker_heading: LOEB
dialog: Guess that's the cost of doing

speaker_heading: MERKEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't want to do anything RASH.
speaker_heading: LOEB

speaker_heading: LOEB AND FLASS

speaker_heading: SWAT COMMANDER
dialog: No prisoners, Commissioner's
dialog: orders.
text: The SWAT TEAM enters the lobby. The top floors have collapsed

text: The SWAT TEAM finds the STEEL DOOR. They toss in CONCUSSION
dialog: GRENADES  BOOM! BOOM!
text: Sections of the LOBBY floor jump, then sag and splinter from

speaker_heading: SWAT GUY #1
dialog: This place is barely standing, sir.

speaker_heading: SWAT GUY #1

speaker_heading: SWAT COMMANDER
dialog: Gas masks! Cough, cough.

scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED TENNEMENT. LOBBY - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED TENNEMENT - NIGHT
text: The police have barricaded the area with cars, ambulances,

text: SWAT COMMANDER kicks the steel door open, rips off his mask.
speaker_heading: SWAT COMMANDER

scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED TENNEMENT - NIGHT

speaker_heading: SWAT GUY #2
dialog: You let this man die, I'll have
dialog: your ass.

speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: SWAT GUY #2
dialog: He's an animal  a wild beast.
text: The medics finish with GORDON.
speaker_heading: MEDIC
dialog: I've given you about 35 stitches
dialog: for that gash on your head. Try to

scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED TENNEMENT. LOBBY - LATER
text: Nervous SWAT GUYS open fire into the rubble.
text: THE BAT-MAN uses the noise and confusion to drop through a

text: The whole SWAT TEAM, now aware of THE BAT-MAN, turns and
text: opens fire at the moving cape as it streaks across the LOBBY.
text: Bullets tear through the cape and into old, brass mailboxes.
text: THE BAT-MAN throws himself through the hole where the floor
text: has collapsed and lands in a pile of shattered tile and
dialog: mirror.
text: He digs into his belt and pulls out several ROUND OBJECTS
text: strung together with green cord. Then, holding one end of the

text: Upstairs, the SWAT TEAM, guns poised, peeks over the lip of

dialog: - exploding plumbing.
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED TENNEMENT. BASEMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Outside the BATHROOM door, THE BAT-MAN covers his ears until

speaker_heading: SWAT GUY #2
dialog: Man, it stinks.

speaker_heading: LITTLE AL

text: GORDON and DENT smoke and drink at a back booth.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: He risked his life to get me those
dialog: files.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: He could have mailed them.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Not really his style. I think he
dialog: read my files and wanted to be
dialog: friends, allies, I don't know. He's
dialog: obviously crazy but he's not the
dialog: wild animal I thought.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: So what are you going to do?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: There was more in those files than
dialog: just my report  evidence Harvey,
dialog: it's all laid out.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: What kind of evidence?
text: GORDON looks at his friend, savoring the moment.
speaker_heading: GORDON
text: It's the JACKPOT. It corroborates
dialog: everything we suspected. Loeb is in
dialog: bed with the biggest names in
dialog: Gotham underworld  and we've got
dialog: his accounting books. It's amazing.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: That could never be admissible in
dialog: court.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Probably not. At least not all of
dialog: it. But there should be enough to
dialog: get ESTRADA at least. And who
dialog: knows, if we play our cards
dialog: right...
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: It's dangerous, Jim. Who knows what
dialog: they would do if they knew you had
dialog: those files.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: That's the thing, no one knows. THE
dialog: BAT-MAN slipped them to me in front
dialog: of a half dozen officers.
dialog: No one saw a thing, it was like a
dialog: reverse pick pocketing.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: I think we can make this work.
text: GORDON lights a MARLBORO and nods.
scene_heading: EXT. ESTRADA'S UPSCALE TOWNHOUSE - EVENING
text: GORDON, DENT and a dozen uniformed officers crowd the front

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Is this a bad time for you?
speaker_heading: ESTRADA
dialog: I want to speak with a lawyer.
speaker_heading: GORDON cuffs ESTRADA.

text: In the background on TV -
scene_heading: CHANNEL ONE EYEWITNESS NEWS
text: - local TV news shows a red faced LOEB push through a mob of
text: reporters to get into his office.
speaker_heading: NEWS ANCHOR, BRIAN
dialog: District Attorney Harvey Dent today

dialog: We'll go inside Wayne Corporation

text: LITTLE AL stares at him.
speaker_heading: LITTLE AL
dialog: It's you.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: No, it's not. That little boy is

speaker_heading: LITTLE AL
dialog: But you can't just...
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (interrupts)

speaker_heading: BRUCE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm making the most my inheritance.

scene_heading: INT. ACCESS TUNNEL. SOMEWHERE UNDER GOTHAM CITY - NIGHT
text: THE BAT-MAN guns his motorcycle through shallow puddles. Rats
dialog: scurry.
text: He stops to check a map. A train rattles past behind a steel
text: grate separating his tunnel from the subway.
text: He gets off the bike carrying a crow bar. He picks his target
text: and SMACKS a grimy junction box with it. The lid clanks to
text: the ground exposing an dense tangle of PHONE WIRES.
text: From a saddlebag he removes a TELEPHONE HEADSET. It has
text: alligator clips where the phone should be.
text: He pulls back his mask. He's still bleeding from his wounds.
text: He cradles the phone to his ear and clips a pair of wires.
text: Listens. Clips another. Listens.
scene_heading: EXT. SLUICEWAY - NIGHT

text: It's dark and quiet but something has woken up detective
speaker_heading: GORDON.
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN (O.S.)
dialog: Loeb is up to something.
text: GORDON looks to the window where THE BAT-MAN forms a massive
text: silhouette against the city nightscape.
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Warn Dent. It's going down tonight
dialog: but I don't know what it is yet.
text: GORDON, turns to get his glasses.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I think I know a way to find out.
text: When he turns back the window is empty, except for a small
text: puddle of blood.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Nothing, Hon. I've got to go to
dialog: work. That's all.
text: GORDON gets out of bed and fumbles for his gun.
scene_heading: INT. GORDON'S CRAPPY CAR. EAST END - NIGHT

speaker_heading: HUNTING
scene_heading: EXT. RUNDOWN WAREHOUSE DISTRICT STREET - NIGHT
text: In the rundown warehouse district GORDON puts the car in park
text: and waits in the same spot as before.
text: FLASS finally comes out of the low-slung drug lab and we
text: catch a glimpse of a very white, clean room and some very
dialog: dirty cops.
speaker_heading: FLASS
dialog: Jesus, what are you cutting this
dialog: stuff with? Makes me have to piss
text: like a racehorse. Wait for CRAMDEN
dialog: to get off the CAN and you could do
speaker_heading: yourself some SERIOUS INTERNAL
speaker_heading: DAMAGE.
speaker_heading: IN THE ALLEY
text: FLASS saunters to a DUMPSTER and proceeds to relieve himself.
speaker_heading: GORDON (O.S.)
dialog: I'll try not to do DO any SERIOUS
dialog: damage, Flass.
text: FLASS WHIRLS, reaching for his PISTOL, BUT GORDON has the
text: drop on FLASS, his GUN aimed, his hand steady as a surgeon's.
speaker_heading: GORDON (CONT'D)
dialog: Just enough to keep you out of the
dialog: hospital.
text: FLASS tosses his GUN away.
speaker_heading: FLASS
dialog: What, you gonna SHOOT me, Jiminy?
dialog: Jiminy fricking CRICKET? You gonna
dialog: SHOOT me?
text: GORDON slides his GUN back into its HOLSTER. In his other
text: hand, GORDON casually swings the BLACK AND YELLOW BASEBALL
speaker_heading: BAT.
speaker_heading: GORDON.
dialog: No. I'm not going to shoot you. You
dialog: and me, we're going have a little
dialog: ONE ON ONE.
text: GORDON playfully slaps the BASEBALL BAT into his open hand.
text: FLASS jerks a THUMB in the direction of the HOUSE.
speaker_heading: FLASS
dialog: If I give a SHOUT to the GUYS...
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Well, then, I WILL shoot you.
text: GORDON WHIPS the BASEBALL BAT from hand to hand. Showing off.
text: Pausing, calm as an executioner:
speaker_heading: GORDON (CONT'D)
dialog: Otherwise, it's ONE ON ONE. YOU and
dialog: ME, Flass.
speaker_heading: FLASS
dialog: One on one. Sure. I'll take you on,
dialog: Jiminy.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: We've gotta play fair. I hear you
dialog: were a green beret.
speaker_heading: FLASS
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: So I guess you deserve a HANDICAP.
text: GORDON tosses FLASS the BASEBALL BAT.
text: He CATCHES it easily. FLASS SWAGGERS, SWINGING the BAT from
text: side to side. Belligerent. All grins:
speaker_heading: FLASS
dialog: You gotta be KIDDING. You going all
dialog: KINKY on me, little man?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Sure I am.
speaker_heading: FLASS
dialog: You ready for your PUNISHMENT?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Sure I am.
speaker_heading: FLASS
dialog: THIS is gonna HURT.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Sure it is.
speaker_heading: WHAM!
text: GORDON SMASHES his FIST into FLASS' FACE, then DUCKS, as
text: FLASS swings the BASEBALL BAT, missing by a mile -
speaker_heading: WHAM! WHAM!
text: GORDON delivers vicious blows to FLASS' midsection. THE
text: BASEBALL BAT FLIES through the AIR, end over end. THEN, a
text: SPINNING KICK sends FLASS sprawling. GORDON composes himself.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Now then. Something's going down
dialog: tonight, you're going to tell me
dialog: what it is?
speaker_heading: FLASS
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Forget it Gordon. You were in over
dialog: your head, and now it's over  IT'S
speaker_heading: ALREADY OVER.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Fine. Have it your way. I'd like to
dialog: string you up. But when you took
dialog: your shot at me, you told your
dialog: friends to keep me out of the
dialog: hospital. I suppose I should return
dialog: the favor.
text: GORDON turns to walk away, then spins around 
speaker_heading: GORDON (CONT'D)
dialog: Aww, FUCK it.
text:  and kicks the stricken, laughing FLASS in the ribs
text: producing a sickening crunch.
speaker_heading: GORDON (CONT'D)
dialog: (finally walking away)
dialog: And Flass, thanks for showing me
dialog: what it takes to be a cop in this
dialog: town.
speaker_heading: FLASS
dialog: (now badly hurt)
dialog: Be sure to say 'Hi' to ANN for me.
text: GORDON instantly understands the full meaning of the threat.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Oh god!
text: He breaks into a run for his car, seconds later he's on the -
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF GOTHAM - DAWN
text: The sun is just a pink edge on the skyline as GORDON tears
text: ass across town.
dialog: He's taking horrible risks in traffic.
text: POWER SLIDES THROUGH A CROWDED INTERSECTION  commuters dive
dialog: for the curb.
text: BLOWS THROUGH A RED LIGHT  delivery trucks honk and skid.
text: BUMPS OVER TRAIN TRACKS  muffler sparks and tumbles loose.
dialog: He's on the radio 
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I need backup at 1827 Denny Way.
dialog: He SKIDS ONTO THE SIDEWALK 
text: crushes a MAILBOX into his apartment building and BOLTS from
text: the car into the front door, gun drawn. Meanwhile 
scene_heading: INT. PARKING GARAGE. GORDON'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAWN
text: A very pregnant and very hysterical ANN struggles with four
text: cops as they try to force her into an SUV. She's kicking and
text: screaming. CRYING.
text: In the passenger seat sits a stoic LOEB smoking a cigar.
speaker_heading: LOEB
dialog: Nobody wanted it to be this way. I
dialog: don't want to hurt anyone. It never
dialog: had to go this far. Your husband
dialog: just CANNOT take a hint. No matter
dialog: how hard we BEAT it into him.
text: GORDON bursts into the garage, gun drawn.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Get your FILTHY HANDS off my wife.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Jim!
dialog: The cops go for their guns. GORDON can't shoot, ANN is too
dialog: close.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Baby get down!
text: The cops OPEN FIRE.
speaker_heading: BLAM! BLAM!
text: The shots echo in the garage.
text: ANN throws herself down, as she's told.
speaker_heading: BLAM! BLAM!
text: GORDON ducks for cover  TOO LATE  HE'S HIT! The 9mm slug
text: SLAMS into his stomach and BLOWS HIM OFF HIS FEET.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Oh GOD, JIM! BABY!
text: But he COMES UP SHOOTING
speaker_heading: BLAM! BLAM!
text: DOUBLE HEAD SHOT  blood sprays, one down 
speaker_heading: BLAM! BLAM!
text: TWO CHEST SHOTS  a second cop staggers back, stricken and
dialog: shocked 
speaker_heading: BLAM!
text: ONE IN THE HIP  third cop spins, but manages to keep his
text: feet, until  BLAM! STOMACH SHOT  he crumples.
text: The surviving cop, with the help of LOEB, manages to stuff
text: the pregnant ANN into the SUV.
text: The last COP punches the gas and shoots for the door but THE
text: BAT-MAN stands BLOCKING THE EXIT  in front of his black
dialog: motorcycle.
text: The truck ACCELERATES - HE'S GOING TO CRASH THROUGH.
text: Instead of getting out of the way, THE BAT-MAN VAULTS OVER
text: THE HOOD as the SUV crushes the motorcycle. HE SMASHES feet
text: first through the windshield, DRIVING both SPIKED BOOTS into
text: the driver's face.
text: The SUV careens WILDLY, CRASHES into a parked car and ROLLS
text: OVER AND BACK ONTO ITS WHEELS.
text: Everything goes momentarily black.
dialog: Light returns and we find ourselves -
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE GORDON'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER
text: LOEB pulls ANN down the street by her hair.
text: He's bleeding badly from a huge gash on his forehead and
text: seems a little dazed.
text: BRUCE falls from the SUV's door onto the sidewalk amid a
text: shower of shattered safety glass.
text: His disguise hangs shredded.
dialog: HIS MASK IS GONE.
text: He tries to get his feet but STUMBLES AND FALLS, tries again
text: and rises VERY UNSTEADILY.
dialog: HE'S NEAR THE END.
text: GORDON pulls himself across the street by sheer force of
dialog: will.
text: He bleeds all over the place from his gut wound. His gun, now
text: SLIPPERY FROM BLOOD, is hard to hold.
text: Together BRUCE and GORDON converge on LOEB who seems to be
text: least damaged of the three and now holds a MAGNUM in his
dialog: hand.
text: LOEB stops, turns and fires at his pursuers
speaker_heading: BLAM! BLAM!
text: They throw themselves behind parked cars.
text: Glass rains down.
speaker_heading: BLAM! BLAM!
text: From their positions behind parked cars, GORDON and THE BAT
text: MAN make eye contact.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN
dialog: Striking terror, what else?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I mean the sun's coming up.
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN
dialog: Then we better hurry.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: (holds up his service
dialog: revolver)
dialog: I'm out.
text: THE BAT-MAN draws a nasty looking THROWING KNIFE from his
text: boot. GORDON nods.
text: Both men stand at the same time to face LOEB who holds his
text: gun on one, then the other, momentarily unsure of what to do.
text: THE BAT-MAN pinches the knife by its tip, ready to throw.
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN
dialog: Don' t make me do it. Let her go.
text: He's holding ANN in front of himself as a human shield.
speaker_heading: LOEB
dialog: You won't do it. YOU DON'T KILL.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: (levels his empty gun)
dialog: I have no such reservations Loeb.
speaker_heading: LOEB
dialog: PFFT. You're empty. If you had a
dialog: shot, I'd be dead by now. I WALK.
dialog: LOEB has made it to -
scene_heading: EXT. ENTRANCE TO AN URBAN PARK.
text: GORDON grows irritated.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: TAKE him!
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN
speaker_heading: (to GORDON)
dialog: She's too close.
speaker_heading: LOEB
speaker_heading: (to THE BAT-MAN)
dialog: You've got nothing. I've seen your
dialog: face. I've got the woman. And you
dialog: won't kill me, it's against your
dialog: code.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Do it!
speaker_heading: SWOOSH!
text: THE KNIFE SINKS DEEP INTO LOEB'S EYE.
text: He SCREAMS and falls writhing on the ground.
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN
dialog: I've got a lot of codes.
text: ANN runs over to her husband.
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (to LOEB)
dialog: Here's a little something to
dialog: remember me by.
text: THE BAT-MAN, huddled over the supine LOEB, does  something.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Oh JIM!
dialog: They embrace.
speaker_heading: ANN (CONT'D)
dialog: (pulls away)
dialog: You've been shot!
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: It went right through. I'll be all
dialog: right.
text: GORDON staggers a little. He's weak from his wounds. THE BAT
text: MAN steadies him.
speaker_heading: ANN
speaker_heading: (to THE BAT-MAN)
dialog: Are you OK?
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: You look kind of hurt.
text: She's right. He looks as if he's had a burning building
text: dropped on him. He's scarred, cut, bleeding and bruised.
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN
dialog: I'll be all right 
dialog: (beat)
dialog: - with a little help from my
dialog: friends.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: And WHO ARE your friends?
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN
dialog: I don't know, who are YOU?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I'm a COP. Who are you?
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN
dialog: I'm THE BAT-MAN.
text: GORDON points to LOEB, his cheek carved with a letter "Z".
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: That doesn't look like the mark of
dialog: the bat. What does that mean?
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN
dialog: It's a gift for a kid I used to
dialog: know, a long time ago.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Sirens coming, you better go.
text: THE BAT-MAN turns to go.
speaker_heading: GORDON (CONT'D)
dialog: Just so you know, I'm practically
dialog: blind without my glasses.
text: THE BAT-MAN, tosses the glasses from across the street 
speaker_heading: THE BAT-MAN
dialog: I'll see you around, DETECTIVE.
text:  just as a truck drives in between them. It looks like the
text: AL and Son's Garage TRUCK.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Thanks,
dialog: (realizing he's gone)
speaker_heading: BATMAN.
