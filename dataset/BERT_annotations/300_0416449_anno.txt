dialog: When the boy was born, like all
dialog: Spartans, he was inspected.
dialog: 
text: The newborn is roughly turned and handled like a piece of
dialog: fruit.
speaker_heading: DILIOS (V.0.)
dialog: If he had been small or puny or
dialog: sickly or misshapen, he would have
dialog: been discarded.
text: From an unseen window a wind extinguishes the candle
text: plunging us into darkness.
speaker_heading: DILIOS (V.0.)
dialog: From the time he could stand he
text: was baptized in the fire of
dialog: combat.
text: A boy of three fights his father in mock battle with his
text: mother looking on. They duel with wooden swords, but
text: this is not a game. The boy's father knocks the sword
text: out of the boy's hand with force, then pushes him to the
text: ground. The boy grits his teeth, scrambles in the dusty
text: ground for his sword, then rises ready to fight, his eyes
text: wide and intense.
speaker_heading: DILIOS (V.0.)
dialog: Taught never to retreat, never to
dialog: surrender... Taught that death on
dialog: the battlefield in service to
dialog: Sparta was the greatest glory he
dialog: | could achieve in his life.
text: | The boy, now five, watches his father as he passes his
text: | hand across a three-foot bronze shield. His fingers
text: gently tracing the dents and scars in the hammered metal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DILIOS (V.0.)
dialog: At age 7, as is customary in
text: Sparta, the boy was taken from his
text: mother and plunged into a world of
dialog: ) violence.
text: A woman cries, held by two other women. She weeps
text: uncontrollably as her son is led away. Her body heaving
text: as she watches him go.

scene_heading: EXT. SPARTAN COURTYARD - DAY
text: A Spartan boy of maybe eight is beaten by another boy of
dialog: the same age.
speaker_heading: DILIOS (V.0.) *
dialog: Manufactured by 300 years of
dialog: Spartan warrior society to create
dialog: the finest soldiers the world has
dialog: ever known, the Agoge, as it is
dialog: called, forces the boy to fight...
text: Time slows: Blood sprays from his mouth as he is struck
dialog: again and again and again.
speaker_heading: DILIOS (V.0.) *
text: Starves them, forces them to steal
dialog: and if necessary, to kill.
text: The boy stands out of breath, his body gleaming with
text: sweat. Blood drips from his fists.
dialog: *
scene_heading: EXT. SPARTAN COURTYARD - DAY
text: A boy of eleven is tied at the wrists. His face pressed
text: against a column as a handful of muscular, grim-faced
text: soldiers watch. His back already bleeding as he is
text: whipped again. His face is stone, emotionless.
speaker_heading: DILIOS (V.0.) *
dialog: By rod and lash the boy was
dialog: punished, taught to show no pain,
dialog: taught to show no mercy.
scene_heading: EXT. PINDOS MOUNTAINS - DUSK
text: Blue light crouches on black rocks. Snow drifts, defying
text: gravity. A hand, blistered by the cold, clamors and
text: climbs. The hand belongs to the boy, now twelve.
speaker_heading: DILIOS (V.0.) *
text: Constantly tested, tossed into the
text: wild. Left to pit his wits and
dialog: will against nature's fury.
text: Though starving and freezing, there is a nobility in the
text: boy's gaze. Though his body shakes, his homespun tunic
text: no match for the bitter cold, he is defiant.

speaker_heading: DILIOS (V.0.)
dialog: He'd survived on roots, bugs and
dialog: rodents, and now he was freezing
dialog: to death. It was his initiation
dialog: -.. his time in the wild... for he
dialog: would return to his people a
dialog: Spartan, or not at all.
text: The boy stumbles into a clearing surrounded on three
text: sides by the stone faces of the canyon. He stands,
text: peering into the gathering din. He grips the spear,
text: lightly moving it back and forth from hand to hand. The
text: spear is little more than a child's toy, a sharpened
text: stick. The boy's eyes search the tree line, the darkness
text: moves... shadow gliding on muscle and sinew.
speaker_heading: DILIOS (V.0.)
text: He hears a low growl. The hair on
text: his arms stands up. Cold, hungry,
text: defenseless. He is prey.
text: It tracks the boy and he knows it.
speaker_heading: DILIOS (V.0.)
text: The wolf begins to circle the boy.
text: Claws of black steel, fur as dark
text: as night, eyes glowing red...
text: jewels from the pit of Hades
dialog: itself.
text: The WOLF breathes in misty clouds, the swirling snow
text: printed against its black fur.
text: GROWLING as it moves closer, circling, hunting.
text: WE SEE: The boy from between a narrow cut in the rock,
text: just large enough for him to squeeze through. His eyes
text: are calm. His body has stopped shaking. He sees the
text: crack in the black stone, and turns slowly, almost
text: casually, toward it.
speaker_heading: DILIOS (V.0.)
text: The giant wolf... sniffing...
text: drooling... savoring the scent of
dialog: the meal to come. Does the boy
dialog: run? Does he cower? Does he cry?
dialog: No... not this boy. He is calm.
text: The beast pauses, loading to spring. The boy leaps
text: through the cut in the rock. The WOLF pounces, HOWLING
dialog: as it charges!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Its jaws are inches from the boy's neck as he falls
text: backward through the wound in the rock. The beast's body
text: is stopped cold in the tight space. Thrashing, the wolf
text: is pinned by the unforgiving stone. The boy rises
text: slowly.
speaker_heading: DILIOS (V.0.) *
dialog: It is not fear that grips him,
text: only a heightened sense of things.
text: The snow drifts around his feet.
text: TIME SLOWS.
text: The wolf's jaws GNASH! The boy exhales slowly.
speaker_heading: DILIOS (V.0.) *
text: The cold air in his lungs. The
text: leafless poplars moving against
dialog: the coming night.
dialog: 
text: His eyes look back toward the wolf, he nods his respect,
text: then raises his spear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DILIOS (V.0.) *
text: His hands are steady, his form
dialog: | perfect.
text: The clouds part, and the just rising crescent moon, warm
text: on the horizon, casts a shadow of the angry wolf on the
text: cold rock. The boy sets himself, then strikes.
scene_heading: EXT. SPARTAN COURTYARD - DAY
dialog: 
text: A Spartan helmet lands heavily in the snow-covered
text: courtyard, followed by the thick-muscled frame of a
text: SPARTAN GENERAL, who, after going to his knees, bows his
text: head to the snow. Standing before him is the boy, draped
text: in the freshly dressed pelt of a black wolf. As others
text: enter the courtyard, they too fall to their knees, *
text: SHOUTING! Spears are raised.
dialog: |
text: CRIES of joy and reverence are heard as the boy raises
text: his chin.
dialog: é.

scene_heading: EXT. THE CAMPFIRES OF WAR - NIGHT
text: Dozens of SPARTAN HOPLITES sit and stand, transfixed by
text: the agitated pacing Spartan whose fist is raised in
text: dramatic punctuation. This is DILIOS (28), the
dialog: storyteller. His gift. His curse. To conjure from his
dialog: memory, from his imagining, that which men forgot, but
dialog: need to remember.
speaker_heading: DILIOS
dialog: ... Our King! LEONIDAS!
text: The men visible in the firelight, and countless others in
dialog: the darkness beyond...
text: POUND their shields in unison and cry as one.
speaker_heading: SPARTANS
text: LEONIDAS! LEONIDAS! LEONIDAS!
text: A HUSH falls over the band of Spartan warriors, their
text: faces hard, bodies oiled for war. All listen as Dilios
text: pauses. His voice lowers.
speaker_heading: DILIOS
dialog: It has been more than thirty years
dialog: since the wolf and the winter
text: cold, and now, as then, a beast
text: approaches, patient, and
text: confident, savoring the meal to
dialog: come. But this beast is made of
text: men and horses, swords and spears.
text: Dilios scans his audience. The light from the fire moves
text: across the capes of crimson and helmets of bronze.
text: Dilios is a grim orator. His scarred and ruddy face
text: bears witness to his own story.
speaker_heading: DILIOS
text: It is an army of slaves, vast
text: beyond imagining, ready to devour
text: tiny Greece. Ready to snuff out
dialog: the world's one hope for reason
dialog: and justice.
text: There is brewing anger in the eyes of his listeners.
text: Dilios sets his gaze to the fire.

text: Colorful Persian BANNERS SNAP! Pulling taut in the wind.
text: The earth is overturned under the charge of the Company
text: of War horses. ARCHERS, SWORDSMEN and SHADOWED FORMS.
text: Riders all covered in thin patterned robes of gold and
text: blue, embroidered silks, braided belts with long-
text: shouldered capes flowing. Into the sunless dry scrub and
text: wood where the path curves dark and cool they ride on...
dialog: They ride on!
scene_heading: EXT. SPARTA
text: No wall surrounds Sparta. The buildings have no flowered
dialog: columns, no carved arches, no fluted gables, no recorded
dialog: dates and wreathed tributes to the dead. No, this is
text: Sparta. This is the simple elegance of an unadorned
dialog: shelter.
text: WE SEE: The mounted Persian column appear in the
text: stillness of the morning. A massive black horse rears
text: and drops its frame, dust curling around its hooves. A
text: PERSIAN MESSENGER with scarred face and sharpened teeth
text: of gold settles the horses. His 20 men-at-arms fill in
text: along his side.
speaker_heading: MESSENGER
dialog: I bring word from the Great
dialog: Xerxes, Conqueror of all the
dialog: world.
text: The Spartan SENTRIES approach, slowly. One steps forward
text: and sniffs the air, mocking the Persian force.
speaker_heading: SENTRY #1
dialog: Could we offer you a bath,
dialog: Persian?
text: WE HEAR: Laughter from the other Spartans standing
dialog: nearby.
speaker_heading: SENTRY #2
dialog: I am sure our women have a perfume
dialog: you'll find agreeable.
text: The Persian Messenger pulls at the leather reins of his
text: mount, sinking the bit into the horse's foaming mouth.

speaker_heading: MESSENGER
dialog: Show me your King.
speaker_heading: SENTRY #1
dialog: Our King is a busy man.
text: The Persian Messenger reaches into a waxed canvas bag
text: that lays across the horse's neck.
text: WE SEE: The jeweled crowns of conquered nations. The
text: Messenger lifts at the rope running through the bone-
text: white eye sockets of a half-dozen human skulls.
speaker_heading: MESSENGER
dialog: These Kings were busy men once.
text: The Messenger kicks at his horse, holding the skulls and
text: royal headdresses for all to see.
speaker_heading: MESSENGER
dialog: Be afraid. Sparta will burn to
text: the ground. Only the word of King
dialog: Leonidas can save it.
scene_heading: EXT. SPARTAN GARDEN
text: WE HEAR: The FLUTTER of HUMMINGBIRDS against the pale
text: stone walls covered, thick and dark, with ivy and wild
text: lilac. KING LEONIDAS (40), strong and lean, a king, a
text: warrior, a father, rolls on the ground in simulated
text: combat with his six-year-old boy, PLEISTARCHOS.
speaker_heading: LEONIDAS
dialog: Remember, my son. The more you
dialog: sweat here the less you will bleed
dialog: in battle.
text: The boy dives at his father, missing the King's legs.
speaker_heading: LEONIDAS

text: Leonidas smiles.
speaker_heading: LEONIDAS
dialog: Act without hesitation.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Again the boy tackles and they tumble over each other

speaker_heading: LEONIDAS
text: Hesitation creates fear.
text: They wrestle on... continuing one of the ancient rituals
dialog: of father and son.
speaker_heading: LEONIDAS
dialog: Fear is always a constant. But
dialog: accepting it will make you
text: stronger.
text: Leonidas spins and grabs the boy's leg, pulling him to
text: the ground. Leonidas looks across the garden to see his
text: wife, QUEEN GORGO (28), with her athletic frame, watching
text: the two of them.
speaker_heading: LEONIDAS
text: In the end, a Spartan's true
dialog: strength is the warriors next to
dialog: him. Give respect and honor and
dialog: it will be returned to you.
text: Leonidas roils the boy to his back.
speaker_heading: LEONIDAS
dialog: First, you fight with your head.
text: WE SEE: A Spartan, Leonidas' CAPTAIN (45), broad-
text: shouldered and fiercely loyal, speaking to Gorgo near the
text: stone pillars of the compound.
text: Pleistarchos arches, slips free and reverses to his
dialog: father's back. .
speaker_heading: GORGO
dialog: Then you fight with your heart.
text: Gorgo lifts Pleistarchos off of his father.
speaker_heading: LEONIDAS
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: GORGO

speaker_heading: LEONIDAS
dialog: Do not forgot today's lesson.
speaker_heading: PLEISTARCHOS
dialog: Respect and honor.
scene_heading: EXT. MARKETPLACE
text: The Persians wait in the full heat of the sun, watched by
text: Spartan guards. Free women and children pass the narrow
text: streets, carrying electrum vases, all shapes and sizes of
text: glass and terra-cotta water vessels.
text: THERON, 36, a Spartan Councilman with noble features, a
text: body of lean muscles and piercing eyes, retired from the
text: battlefield for a life in politics, stands and speaks
text: freely with the Messenger from the East as Leonidas and
text: Gorgo approach.
speaker_heading: GORGO
dialog: Councilman, you have found
dialog: yourself needed, for once.
text: Theron allows the comment to disappear into the sounds of
dialog: the market.
speaker_heading: THERON
dialog: My King and Queen, I was just
dialog: entertaining your guests.
speaker_heading: LEONIDAS
dialog: I am sure.
text: Leonidas stands before the Persian Messenger.
speaker_heading: LEONIDAS

speaker_heading: LEONIDAS
dialog: You rode all the way from Persia
dialog: for earth and water?
text: The Persian holds to his message studying the King's
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: GORGO
dialog: Do not be coy or stupid, Persian.
dialog: You can afford neither in Sparta.
text: The Persian turns to Gorgo, never having been spoken to
text: by a woman in this tone.
speaker_heading: MESSENGER
dialog: What makes this woman think she
dialog: can speak among men?
speaker_heading: GORGO
dialog: Because only Spartan women give
dialog: birth to real men.
text: The Persian must swallow his pride along with the insult
text: before his men.
speaker_heading: LEONIDAS
dialog: Let us walk to cool our tongues.
text: Leonidas turns away, leaving the rest to follow the

speaker_heading: MESSENGER
dialog: If you value your lives over your
dialog: complete annihilation, listen

dialog: Xerxes.
text: Leonidas stops in his tracks...
speaker_heading: LEONIDAS
dialog: Submission...? That's a bit of a
dialog: problem. Rumor has it the
dialog: Athenians have already turned you

dialog: and boy lovers found that kind of
dialog: nerve...
text: Theron moves forward.
speaker_heading: THERON
dialog: We must be diplomatic.

text: TIME SLOWS for our King. He watches the freedoms of his
dialog: people.
text: WE HEAR: The sounds of CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER.
dialog: The simple pure life each have built for themselves. The

text: WE SEE: The sword lowering from the Persian's neck.
text: Theron relaxes, thinking reason has prevailed. A warm

scene_heading: EXT. A ROCKY CLIFF ABOVE SPARTA - NIGHT
text: Lit by the almost full moon, Leonidas climbs hard, with
text: clenched teeth, the steep rock face inaccessible to most.
text: A foot slips. Rocks come loose. His grip tightens and
text: he climbs on, finally pulling himself and his sixty-pound
text: leather satchel onto a small ledge where a cloaked figure
dialog: stands.
text: The WIND pushes and pulls the torchlight this way and
dialog: that. This is an EPHOR, a priest of the old gods,
text: deformed by breeding. His face and body are covered with
text: boils and lesions. His eyes are bleached white under the
text: hoods of black.
speaker_heading: DILIOS (V.0.)
dialog: The Ephors. Priests to the Old
dialog: Gods, inbred swine, more creature

dialog: king must bribe... and bed.
speaker_heading: EPHOR #1
dialog: Welcome, Leonidas. We have been
dialog: expecting you.
text: The FIRE ROARS in protest at the end of the torch. The
text: Ephor turns and begins to climb an impossible set of
text: stairs hewn out of the rock of the mountain. Leonidas
text: shoulders the satchel and starts after his ungracious
text: host up the stairs, which circle around a finger of rock
text: toward a simple stone temple that glows at the summit.
scene_heading: INT. EPHORS' TEMPLE - NIGHT
text: Oil lanterns cast a warm light on EIGHT EPHORS, all as
text: decrepit as their brother, who stand around Leonidas as
text: he hastily lays out his plan. At the center of the
text: temple is a low stone box filled with fine sand used by
text: the Ephors to sketch down that which is fleeting to man
text: and even more fleeting to the Gods. Leonidas pulls a
text: wooden block across the sand to smooth its surface.
text: Then, with his finger, he begins to draw.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 14,
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LEONIDAS
dialog: The Persians claim their forces

text: his blistered face stern.
speaker_heading: EPHOR #2
dialog: You insult the Gods with your
dialog: arrogance, Leonidas. We are not a
dialog: council of men. We serve the
dialog: Gods, not the whim of a King.
dialog: Before your plan is heard, what do
dialog: you offer?
dialog: 
text: Leonidas is mid-line, drawing his battle plan in the
text: sand. He looks up at the hooded figures. He lifts a
text: finger slowly from the sand. He ducks the leather strap
text: of his satchel and tosses it at the feet of the Ephors.
text: The gold spills out onto the stone floor.
text: Dipping his finger back into the sand, Leonidas sketches
text: a primitive map.
speaker_heading: LEONIDAS
dialog: We will use our superior fighting
dialog: skills and the terrain of Greece
dialog: herself to destroy them. We will

speaker_heading: EPHOR #2

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEONIDAS
dialog: Sparta will burn! Her men will
dialog: die at arms, and her women and
dialog: children will be slaves or worse.
dialog: This is not a campaign for land or
dialog: riches. It is a fight for our
dialog: very lives!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Leonidas plunges his finger back into the sand and draws
text: a line running perpendicular to his line representing the
dialog: coast.
speaker_heading: LEONIDAS
dialog: We will block the Persian coastal
dialog: assault by replacing the great
dialog: stone wall, built by the Phocians
dialog: to protect Greece two hundred
dialog: years ago, and funnel them into

speaker_heading: LEONIDAS
dialog: In that narrow corridor their

speaker_heading: LEONIDAS
dialog: Xerxes' losses will be so great,

speaker_heading: EPHOR #1
dialog: We must consult the Oracle. Trust

speaker_heading: LEONIDAS
dialog: I'd prefer you trust your reason.

speaker_heading: EPHOR #1
dialog: Your blasphemies have cost us
dialog: quite enough already. Don't
dialog: compound them. We will consult
text: the oracle.
text: The Ephors turn away. Leonidas follows them. Carved
text: into the stone, under a domed ceiling, is an altar. It

text: its palm, a beautiful YOUNG GIRL moves hypnotically.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Around the altar the Ephors stoke small fires which burn
text: green with the smell of sulfur, careful not to breathe

speaker_heading: DILIOS (V.0.)
dialog: Diseased old mystics... worthless
dialog: remnants of a time before Sparta's
dialog: ascent from darkness... remnants
dialog: of a senseless tradition.
dialog: Tradition even Leonidas cannot
dialog: defy, for he must respect the word
dialog: of the Ephors. That is the law.

text: CRIES! Through her pleasure and pain. The beating of
text: the drums quicken, as does the violence of her rapture.

dialog: CRIES out!

speaker_heading: DILIOS (V.0.)

text: feet tall at the shoulder, veins in his neck bulging like
text: serpents as he roars, collapsing a Spartan shield with a
text: kick while in the same moment decapitating another
text: Spartan not quick enough to retreat behind his shield. :
text: The giant Immortal focuses his milky eyes on Leonidas,
text: who fights and dispatches two of the dark horde.
text: Leonidas locks eyes with the giant, who recognizes the
text: Spartan king and charges toward him. Leonidas quickly
text: recovers a spear and thrusts it at the charging monster,
text: who rises into the air on a thundering stride, cutting
text: clean in two the spear shaft of the king. He lands with
text: his full 370 pounds of crushing muscle on the shield of
text: Leonidas, throwing him back onto the mutilated bodies of
text: the day-old fallen.
text: Leonidas, lying on his back, recovers his wits just long
text: enough to have his sword kicked from his hand. The giant
text: roars again, pulling Leonidas’ helmet off, which spins to
text: rest on the blood-soaked earth. The Immortal pulls his
text: blade down toward the exposed head of the king, who
text: raises his arm, catching the raw metal blade with a roof
text: block on his bronze-covered forearm.
text: Then Leonidas summons from deep within his warrior soul a
text: crushing right to the jaw of the demon, who spits blood
text: as he roars in defiance. The thing tosses his sword down
text: as he moves right into Leonidas' face, roaring as he
text: opens his mouth. A mix of blood and saliva pours in
text: rivulets between the sharpened teeth of the giant while
text: his eyes fix on Leonidas’ neck. The king's muscles
text: strain beneath the mass of the Persian Immortal.
text: In desperation, Leonidas calls...

text: WE SEE: From the small thicket of trees at the center of

scene_heading: IMMORTAL COMMANDER
dialog: Fight or die where you stand!

speaker_heading: DAXOS
dialog: Go! Show the Spartans what we can

text: The Spartan King looks back down to his hand, clenched
text: around the weapon. He slowly opens his hand and looks
text: back at the Persian General, letting the SPEAR fall,
text: landing with a dusty CLANK!
text: He looks one last time to Xerxes standing atop his golden
text: litter. Behind 10 rows of his bloodthirsty Immortals.
text: Noting the wind as it dances with the black banners at
text: the back of Xerxes' throne.
text: WE SEE bronze strike the earth as Leonidas falls to his
text: knees. His hands go to the rocky soil just in front of
text: him. His head slowly bowing, his eyes close.
scene_heading: ELASHBACK - EXT. SPARTAN COURTYARD
text: Leonidas and his son compare the size of their hands.
text: The King's rough palm is barely covered by the entire
text: soft hand of his son. The boy laughs. His eyes smiling.
text: Soft light moves through leaves, laughing with the boy as
text: he marvels at his father's hands.
scene_heading: EXT. SPARTAN FIELD
text: Gorgo sleeps in waist-high golden hay. Leonidas with the
text: stem of yellowed grass lays next to her. He traces the
text: contour of her cheek, she slowly swats at it. He
text: continues down her neck, his eyes lost in her form.
text: The nape of her neck, her collarbone, her black hair
text: curly against the golden stalks of hay. Tickled, she
text: opens her groggy eyes and seeing her husband, softly
text: smiles.

scene_heading: EXT. HOT GATES - DAY (PRESENT)
text: Leonidas, eyes closed, lets the faintest of smiles fade,
text: then with head still down, calls...
speaker_heading: LEONIDAS
dialog: STELIOS!!
text: From behind the kneeling King, shields part and in two
text: crushing strides, young Stelios leaps, spear in hand,
text: from the cover of his Spartan brothers.
text: Planting a foot on his King's back, he flies at the
text: Persian General and, still in the air, he thrusts. Ribs
text: part and sever. The exiting blood sprays into the eyes
text: of nearby Immortals as the General withers under the
dialog: blow.
text: Leonidas snatches his own spear and, rising, loads for a
text: mighty throw. Xerxes bares his teeth in anger at the
text: defiant King.
speaker_heading: XERXES
dialog: Slaughter them!!!
text: The air goes thick with wood shafts, feathers and steel.
scene_heading: TIME SLOWS:
text: Leonidas does not see the black banners at the back of
text: Xerxes‘ throne fall with the lull in the wind. The only
text: sound is that of countless ARROWS POUNDING into BRONZE
text: SHIELDS, like hard rain on a metal roof. Through this
text: barrage, Leonidas gathers every ounce of his strength.
speaker_heading: DILIOS (V.0.)
text: His helmet was stifling. It
dialog: narrowed his vision...
text: WE SEE: The Ring's eyes. Calm, cold and focused on his
dialog: target.
speaker_heading: DILIOS (V.0.)
dialog: - and he must see far.
text: The Spartan King's muscles pull the spear forward as
text: around him the Persian spindles cut his children down.
speaker_heading: DILIOS (V.0.)
text: His shield was heavy. It threw
text: off his balance.
text: Leonidas lets his spear fly as one after another, arrows

text: The spear of Leonidas flies against the current of
text: incoming arrows as the King cries out!
speaker_heading: LEONIDAS
scene_heading: XERXES... DIE!
text: Dozens of arrows strike Leonidas at once. His men fall
text: fighting. Leonidas draws his sword, struggling to free
text: it from its sheath as arrow after arrow punches through
text: limb and sinew.
speaker_heading: DILIOS (V.0.)
dialog: The old ones say we Spartans are
text: descended from Hercules himself.
text: Leonidas falis back upon the body of another of his
text: fallen brothers. He then pushes himself back to his
dialog: knees.
speaker_heading: DILIOS (V.0.)
dialog: Bold Leonidas gives testament to
text: our bloodline. His roar is long
dialog: and loud.
text: As Leonidas cries out in his glory, his spear travels
text: silently out, away from the dying Spartans.
text: TIME SLOWS.
text: It soars in a straight line. Its shadow snaking up the
text: ornate carpet of Xerxes' throne.
text: The God King does not move. He can only watch, wide-eyed
text: as the spear of Leonidas, thrown as his final act, grazes
text: his cheek. A small spray of blood flies from Xerxes'
text: face as the spear sticks into the back of the golden
dialog: throne.
text: The assembled host of Persian generals gasps in awe at
text: the sight of the God King's spilled blood, divine no
dialog: more.
text: The unquenchable bloodlust of the Immortals rises to a
text: fevered pitch as they bring to bear their entire arsenal
text: of spears, arrows, swords and lances against the Spartans
text: who fight on as they die.
text: The Captain. charges forward out of ranks. Dozens of
text: arrows finding their mark in his back and chest. Yet, he
dialog: does not fall.

dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Leonidas watches helpless as one of the Immortais plunges
text: a spear into the Captain's chest. The Captain takes hold
text: of it, dropping shield and spear, pulling it into his own
text: body, moving close to the Immortal who wields it.
text: As life ebbs from him, he grips the Immortal's skull and
text: twists it, snapping the neck with an audible crunch. The
text: Immortal falls beneath him. The Captain rolls off, i
text: snapping the arrows that protrude from his body. :
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Astinos...
text: He exhales deeply and dies, his son's name still on his
dialog: lips.
text: Xerxes puts a hand to his bleeding face. Overcome, he
text: collapses to his throne.
text: Leonidas struggles to reach Stelios. The two fight on...
text: side by side with broken blades and useless shields,
text: hacking at the relentless Immortals.
text: WE HEAR: A black and gold turbaned herald...
text: TRUMPET! Through a horn of human bone, signaling the :
text: Immortals to fall back so as not to be cut down by their j
text: own archers. Exhausted and mortally wounded, Stelios and
text: the King crawl back among the handful of still living
dialog: Spartans.
text: Endless scores of fresh archers take up positions on
text: hillside and boulders, surrounding on all sides that
text: which remains of the Intrepid 300.
text: Stelios, through labored breath, his own blood running
text: into his eyes, calls to his King. Just feet away.
speaker_heading: STELIOS
dialog: My King.

text: Each breath pain rising from within hin.
speaker_heading: STELIOS :

text: Countless archers bend bows as if the very earth around
text: the dwindling Spartan ranks was not made of stone, scrub
text: grass and cliff, but of bent ash, cat gut, and hungry
text: iron arrow tips.
text: We are CLOSE TO Leonidas' lips, chapped and splattered
text: with dark blood.
text: A Persian Commander nods to the herald. He inhales
text: deeply. Leonidas is calm. His voice lowers.
speaker_heading: LEONIDAS
dialog: My Queen... my wife.
text: WE HEAR: The HORN. Nesting birds take flight.
text: Leonidas' lips move, a whisper of reverence.
speaker_heading: LEONIDAS
dialog: My love...
text: The arrows are released as one. The lethal dark cloud
text: races across the rugged and bloody battlefield. Stelios
text: narrows his eyes and with his last breath, stands next to
dialog: his King.
text: The ARROWS STRIKE a single...
text: DRUM STROKE.
text: BLACKNESS.
scene_heading: EXT. SPARTA HAYFIELD - DAY
text: At the edge of the city. Gorgo stands waist~deep in the
text: amber hay, it moves around her, pushed and slanted by a
text: late summer wind.
text: The sun is low in the West. Gorgo has come to this spot
text: many times. Her brown eyes scanning the low hills. A
text: figure appears at the edge of the field. The light
text: coming over his back as he moves toward her. His shadow
text: loosely moves among the hay before him. He walks.
text: WE SEE: Dilios, his battered form, a testament to his
text: valor. Shield rutted and the cut bronze has peeled back
text: to reveal oak. His helmet is dented and tarnished. The
text: dried blood on his makeshift eye patch.
text: He stands before his Queen alone. Her eyes a thousand
dialog: questions.
text: They share a silent moment of grief. She knows without
dialog: word the fate of her husband.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He does not reach into pocket or pouch. He simply raises
text: his hand from his hip, turns his palm upward and opens
text: it. There resting in the cut and calloused hand of
dialog: Dilios is the wolf tooth necklace.
text: Gorgo holds out her hands. Eyes welling. Dilios lets it
text: fall then closes his hands around hers. He squeezes
text: gently. She looks down and away. Her face binding in
text: grief. Dilios watches her, feeling his own pain.
text: He moves on, leaving her framed by the waving grass. Her
text: body begins to shake. She drops to her knees. Her nose
text: runs, all her Spartan reserve lost.
text: WE SEE: A boy hurrying past Dilios without a look. The
text: King's son, Pleistarchos, runs, hay brushing at his knees
text: as he rushes to his mother's side.
text: Dilios turns watching from a distance. Pleistarchos
text: reaches her, they embrace. Gorgo's face red and wet with
text: tears as she looks at him, seeing her husband's eyes.
dialog: Her love.
text: She then takes the leather necktie and places it over her
text: son's head. He bows, letting it come to rest at his chest.
text: His small fingers touching it. Pleistarchos puts his hand
text: on his mother's face, gently wiping away her tears.
text: Dilios watches as the dark figures in the bright hay
text: embrace again. He nods silently to himself and turns.
scene_heading: INT. SPARTAN COUNCIL CHAMBER
text: Dilios still bloodied from battle, chin down, brow
text: knitted. Lives each moment again. His voice ECHOING
text: from the stone walls. Dilios stands at the center of the
dialog: round room.
text: WE MOVE: WITH him, rotating slowly.
speaker_heading: DILIOS
dialog: Remember us... as simple an order
dialog: as a King can give. Remember why
dialog: we died.
text: The faces of the Spartan gallery are riveted. This is
dialog: the very reason why this room was built.
speaker_heading: DILIOS
dialog: For he did not wish tribute or song,
dialog: nor monuments, nor poems of war and
dialog: valor. His wish was simple. Remember

dialog: voice which has lead us all along.
speaker_heading: DILIOS (V.0.)
dialog: In all the countless centuries yet
dialog: to be...

text: WE SEE: Spartan after Spartan, eyes locked in death

speaker_heading: DILIOS
dialog: ... but for all Greece and the
dialog: promise this country holds.
text: Shields are pulled aside and from a wall of fresh bronze,
text: with dawn breaking in fingers of golden light, Dilios
text: steps out in front of the Spartan line. He strides
text: slowly with confidence along the barrier of shields. A
text: forest of spears reach back into the distance, pointing
text: skyward.
text: A young SQUIRE hands Dilios his shield and spear. Eyes
text: burn with battle lust as Dilios, never far from this
text: tableau of Spartan bronze, continues.
speaker_heading: DILIOS
dialog: Now, here on this rugged patch of
