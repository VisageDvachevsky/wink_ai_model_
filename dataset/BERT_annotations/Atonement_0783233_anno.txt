dialog: In the strange days towards the end of 2001, I was in Thailand preparing to
dialog: | go location-scouting for a film I’d co-written and was intending to direct,
dialog: based on a novel by Eric Ambler. I’d brought with me Ian McEwan’s novel
dialog: Atonement: | always look forward to his books, and this longish novel, I thought,
text: might be the ideal distraction from the gathering conviction that a piece
text: like Ambler’s The Night-Comers—which deals with the quiet, deadly power
dialog: struggle in Indonesia between moderate and fundamentalist Moslems—would,
text: in the current climate, never even reach the starting gate. So, sitting by the
text: hotel pool, far from the prewar English country landscapes so vividly
text: evoked in the novel, I felt myself sinking into the world of Briony Tallis, so
text: entranced that I could scarcely bring myself to move when the fierce sun
text: shifted and fell across my feet or shoulders.
dialog: By the time I came back to England, I was convinced that, complex and
dialog: interiorized as it was, the novel could still be the basis of a powerful film. I
dialog: contacted my agent, who told me that several writers were already inter-
dialog: ested in the project and that Ian, who had retained a position as Executive
dialog: Producer, had reserved the right to interview, vet, or otherwise audition the
text: candidates. A dinner was arranged with Richard Eyre, an old friend and
dialog: colleague of both Ian and myself; Robert Fox, the producer; and Ian. I gave
text: a somewhat halting (and, in retrospect, totally inaccurate) account of the
dialog: approach I was thinking of adopting and, in due course, to my great excite-
dialog: ment, was offered the job.
dialog: Over the next couple of years, I produced three or four drafts, each of
text: which was analysed and dissected in meetings at Richard’s house, before being
text: discussed in considerable detail with Ian. In the version that emerged, the
text: story was framed by the return of Briony Tallis, celebrating her seventy-
text: seventh birthday, to the country hotel into which her childhood home had
text: been converted; the voice of the old writer, whose actions one blazing
dialog: summer’s day in 1935 had profoundly affected, not to say blighted, her
dialog: own life and the lives of those most precious to her, was heard from time
dialog: to time, reflecting on the implications of this or that event, while she her-
text: self was glimpsed occasionally like a ghost from the future; and the second
text: and third sections of the novel (the flight to Dunkirk and Briony’s wartime
dialog: service in St. Thomas’s Hospital), which happen more or less simultaneously
dialog: in time, were rearranged and interwoven. The intention was always to remain
dialog: as faithful to the spirit of the novel as possible—I’m always baffled by the
dialog: widespread notion that when a high price has been paid for a much-loved
dialog: play or novel, the first thing to do is to set about it with a hacksaw—and to
text: translate it into a calm and measured overview of a series of irredeemable
text: catastrophes, somewhat in the manner of Harold Pinter’s spare and heart
text: breaking account of L. P. Hartley’s The Go-Between.
text: Time drifted on, and a familiar anguish began to make itself felt: the
text: fear that for one or another unfathomable reason, the film might in the end
dialog: not be made. A pretty expensive art film about a writer and her very partic-
text: ular sufferings and temptations might well seem a hard sell, and eventually
text: Richard Eyre moved away in the direction of a sure thing: his exquisitely acted
text: and entertainingly malevolent version of Notes on a Scandal. It seemed to
text: me as if a whale I’d been riding for a number of years was about to disap-
dialog: pear into the deep: and then I was called into the Working Title offices to
dialog: meet Joe Wright.
text: Joe wasted no time in uttering one of those formulae that strike dread
dialog: into a screenwriter’s heart (others might include, “This is a really good first
dialog: draft” or “Who exactly are we supposed to be rooting for?”). He said: “I'd
dialog: like to start from scratch.” Furthermore, he meant it. But the good news
dialog: was he knew what he wanted: to bring the screenplay back even closer to
dialog: the form of the novel, and he had good, specific ideas of how this might be
text: done. For him the first move was to kick away the crutches: the explanatory
text: voice-overs, the framing device, the linearity of narrative. This would mean
text: that the story would have to be told primarily in images and that the actors’
text: thoughts would have to be readable on their faces rather than audible on the
dialog: vi
dialog: sound track; and that, echoing the bold strategy of the book, we would be
text: dealing in big, self-contained chunks of narrative, where the focus would shift
text: unapologetically from one character to another.
dialog: This had one major unforeseen advantage: the twenty-minute gap between
text: seeing Briony at thirteen and Briony at eighteen made it far easier to think
dialog: of casting two separate actors, an idea that had not really occurred to us before,
dialog: when our structure had appeared to insist on a teenage actor capable of
text: aging up and down. The reclaiming of the first half of the story, so that it
text: could be seen through the eyes of a genuine child, made an immeasurable dif-
text: ference to the understanding of Briony’s crime, if that is what it is. And the
text: holding in reserve of old Briony, who now appears only in a relatively brief
text: epilogue, means that the viewer of the film, no longer alerted by premoni-
text: tory hints, can suffer the same dislocating shoc
dialog: the novel.
dialog: The entire process was long and arduous: a
dialog: lowed by constant revision of one section or
text: ‘s at the end as the reader of
dialog: couple more full drafts, fol-
dialog: another, until finally, at the
dialog: end of 2005, Joe and I went to spend two weeks on a property not far from
text: Florence, belonging to Susa Gelpke, an extreme’
dialog: ly sympathetic and hospitable
dialog: friend of Joe’s, out of which came a final draft which proved to me the
dialog: truth of something I had often heard asserted:
dialog: consuming or effortful than the work require
dialog: nothing can be more time-
dialog: to make a piece of writing
text: seem simple, lucid, and effortless.
dialog: A word, finally, about the passage we always referred to as “the Dunkirk
dialog: section.” Formally troublesome in itself, it was also the most serious victim
dialog: of the budget restrictions that had, quite sensibly, been applied to this
text: adventurous project. There were to be no columns of refugees strafed by
text: German Stukas, no Panzers rolling northwards, no carpet-bombing of the
text: retreating armies. Instead, illustrating another old adage about the creativity
text: unleashed by imposed limits, there would be three soldiers tramping north
text: through a phantasmagorical landscape of literal death and dreams and mem-
text: ories of many other kinds of death. The teeming chaos of Dunkirk had to
dialog: 
text: be portrayed in a kind of composite scene, brilliantly organized by Joe into
text: a single, spectacularly executed Steadicam shot. Not exactly a case of less
dialog: meaning more, although it meant that the thousand extras were required only
text: for one day, it gave a genuine sense of sweep and size and a true feeling of
dialog: the sorrow and pity of war. Here and elsewhere I can say, almost as an
text: objective bystander, though with great pleasure and pride, that the film found
text: its own compelling way of conveying the novel’s particularly eloquent bal-
dialog: ance of the epic and the intimate.
dialog: A word about the text itself? what you have in your hands is a transcrip-
text: tion, made after the event, of the finished film. The dozens of scenes that
text: fell by the wayside like exhausted soldiers on their way to Dunkirk had their
dialog: place in the overall scheme of things, but to include any or all of them
text: might seem like a criticism of the completed object: the film Atonement, of
dialog: which this is the written record.

text: The SOUND of a typewriter, irregularly struck, now fluent, now
text: creating an urgent rhythm that forms the percussive element of
dialog: the opening score.
text: A doll’s house, in the form of the Tallis house, an enormous
text: Victorian Gothic pile. The CAMERA moves from room to room, from
text: the nursery and spare bedrooms on the second floor, to the main
text: bedrooms on the first floor, where puppet versions of mother,
text: daughter, son and baby sister are neatly ordered, to the ground
text: floor with its library, drawing room, dining room and kitchen.
text: Finally the CAMERA moves to the hall through which a young
text: gardener puppet wheels a wheelbarrow.
text: The CAMERA PULLS BACK through a downstairs window to reveal the
dialog: whole impressive facade.
scene_heading: A CAPTION: ENGLAND, 1935
scene_heading: INT. BRIONY’S BEDROOM. TALLIS HOUSE. DAY.
dialog: 
text: The doll’s house is kept in BRIONY’s bedroom. At 13, she’s the
text: youngest of the family, an intense-looking child with a wilful
text: temperament. Her room is meticulously tidy, with model animals
text: arranged with military precision, all facing in the same
text: direction, two by two, as if queuing for the Ark.
text: BRIONY is typing out a version of her just-completed first play,
text: a battered copy of the Oxford English Dictionary open on the
text: desk. As the CAMERA arrives at her manuscript, she is typing,
text: with a confident flourish, the words THE END. Having done this,
text: she leans forward to pull the page from the typewriter and add
text: it to a small pile (the play is no more than 8 pages) of
text: manuscript, the cover page of which reads THE TRIALS OF ARABELLA
text: by Briony Tallis. It’s still early in the morning, but the beads
text: of sweat BRIONY brushes from her forehead tell us that the day
text: is already exceptionally hot.
scene_heading: INT. LANDING, STAIRCASE AND HALLWAY. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Holding her manuscript, BRIONY hurries along the landing, past a
text: door opening on to a spare bedroom. Inside, a HOUSEMAID is
text: singing as she makes up twin beds. BRIONY descends the servants’
text: staircase, which leads to a black-and-white tiled hallway. She
text: doesn’t even glance into the library, a vast, gloomy room
text: glimpsed through its open door, but turns to move towards the
text: back of the house.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. DAY
text: BRIONY glances into the empty dining room and passes through the
text: scullery into the huge old kitchen, where GRACE TURNER, the
text: housekeeper, sits at one end of the kitchen table polishing the
text: silver, while BETTY, the cook, is supervising two or three
text: KITCHEN-MAIDS, who are peeling mounds of potatoes, scouring oven-
dialog: trays, etc.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: I’ve finished my play!
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Well done, dear.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Have you seen Mummy?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I expect she’ll be in the drawing
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I hope you're not going to be getting
dialog: under our feet today, Miss Briony,
dialog: we've got a dinner for ten to prepare.
text: BRIONY’s already on her way out of the room, not listening.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY. DAY.
text: BRIONY hurries back down the hall, reaches the drawing room door
text: and is about to enter when she sees ROBBIE TURNER, an impressive-
text: looking young man of 24 in working clothes, outside an open door
text: leading to the formal gardens. He’s putting on a pair of muddy
text: gardening boots.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Hello pal. I hear you’re putting on a
dialog: play.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Who told you?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
text: Jungle drums.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Will you come and see it?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I’m not sure that would be quite...
text: He breaks off, quickly finds another tack and stands.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Why don’t you let me read it? You used
dialog: to make me beautiful bound copies of
dialog: all your stories.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: I still want you to come.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Let’s see.
text: BRIONY enters the drawing room. Inside the morning news plays on
dialog: the wireless.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Mummy, I need you!
text: She closes the door behind her.
scene_heading: INT. DRAWING ROOM. DAY.
text: The drawing room is an enormous corner room looking out onto a
text: terrace. EMILY TALLIS, BRIONY’s mother, a slightly faded woman
text: with pale skin and raw nerves, finishes reading BRIONY’s
text: manuscript. The radio has been turned off. BRIONY hovers above
text: her, anxious and excited. EMILY looks up and smiles warmly at
speaker_heading: BRIONY.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Stupendous! It’s stupendous, darling!
dialog: Your first play!
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Do you think Leon will like it?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Well of course he will. ‘The Trials of
text: Arabella’ by Briony Tallis.
scene_heading: EXT. TALLIS HOUSE. GARDENS. DAY.
text: It’s no later than 10am, but the sun is already high and blazing
text: down on the monumental facade of the Tallis house, recognisable
text: from its miniature version seen earlier. Lying on one of the
text: rolling lawns is CECILIA TALLIS, BRIONY’s sister, a beautiful,
text: restless-looking girl of 23, who is making a desultory attempt
text: to read a fat edition of Richardson’s Clarissa. She turns back a
text: page to re-read something, then sighs, rolls on to her back and
text: shuts her eyes against the sun. BRIONY is lying a few feet away.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Cee?
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: What do you think it would feel like
dialog: to be someone else?
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Cooler, I should hope.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: I’m worried about the play.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: I’m sure it’s a masterpiece.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: But we only have the afternoon to
text: rehearse. What if the twins can’t act?
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: You have to be nice to them. Think how
dialog: you'd feel if your mother had run off
text: with Mr. What’s-His-Name who reads the
text: news on the wireless.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Perhaps I should have written Leon a
dialog: story. If you write a story, you only
dialog: have to say the word ‘castle’ and you
text: can see the towers and the woods and
dialog: the village below... But in a play
dialog: it’s... it all depends on other
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Mm.
text: BRIONY rolls over. Some way off, ROBBIE TURNER pushes a
text: wheelbarrow up to a flower bed and parks it.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Cee?
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Why don’t you talk to Robbie any more?
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: I do. We just move in different
dialog: circles, that’s all.
text: Down by the flower bed, ROBBIE glances across at CECILIA and
text: BRIONY. But he’s very focused on his immediate task which is the
text: planting of a row of cuttings from the greenhouse. He wipes the
text: sweat off his forehead and begins to dig with a trowel.
scene_heading: INT. NURSERY. DAY.
text: Rehearsals are taking place in a now disused room on the top
text: floor, the former nursery, occupying the front corner of the
text: house. BRIONY has wedged herself into an old high chair and
text: looks down at her red-headed cousins: LOLA QUINCEY, 15, and her
text: twin 9 year-old brothers, PIERROT and JACKSON. They’re all
text: clutching handwritten copies of BRIONY’s play.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Do we have to do a play?
speaker_heading: PIERROT
dialog: Why do we have to?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: It’s to celebrate my brother Leon’s
dialog: visit.
speaker_heading: PIERROT
dialog: I hate plays.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: So do I.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: How can you hate plays?
speaker_heading: PIERROT
dialog: It’s just showing off.
text: LOLA crosses her legs, revealing an ankle bracelet above her
text: sandals, and a set of brightly painted toenails; she speaks
text: quite calmly.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: You'll be in this play or you'll get a
dialog: clout and I’1l tell the Parents.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: You're not allowed to clout us.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: We're guests in this house and what
dialog: did the Parents say we were to make
dialog: ourselves? Well? Pierrot?
speaker_heading: PIERROT
dialog: Amenable.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Jackson?
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Amenable.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Amenable, that’s right.
text: She turns graciously to BRIONY.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Now, Briony, what’s your play about?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: It’s about how... love is all very
dialog: well, but you have to be sensible.
text: LOLA frowns, dubious.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: I suppose you’re going to be Arabella.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Well... Not necessarily.
text: She’s been surprised into this, but LOLA takes immediate
dialog: ruthless advantage.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: In that case, do you mind if I play
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: JACKSON
text: Lola was in the school play.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Do say yes, it’d be the first decent
dialog: thing to happen to me in months.
text: BRIONY can’t see any way to get out of it.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Well... all right.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: I suppose we should start by reading
dialog: it...
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: If you're going to be Arabella, then
dialog: I’ll be the director, thank you very
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Sorr-ee!
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: I’m going to do the prologue.
text: She looks down and begins reading.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Prologue.
text: This is the tale of spontaneous Arabella
text: Who ran away with an extrinsic fellow.
dialog: It grieved her parents to see their first born
text: Evanesce from her home to go to Eastbourne...
text: The door opens; BRIONY breaks off and looks up to see DANNY
text: HARDMAN, the seventeen year-old spotty son of the head gardener,
text: standing in the doorway.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Nothing. Just thought I'd watch.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Rehearsals are private, I’m afraid.
dialog: You can see the play this evening.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I’1l have to work then.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Well, I’m sorry, Danny.
text: DANNY reluctantly prises himself away, closing the door behind
text: him. BRIONY turns back to the OTHERS.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Can we have a swim now?
speaker_heading: PIERROT
dialog: Yes, yes, yes!
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: There’s no time!
speaker_heading: PIERROT
dialog: Cecilia will let us.
text: Before BRIONY can respond, the TWINS are charging towards the
text: door, pretending to fire guns at one another and shouting for
speaker_heading: CECILIA.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: I’m sure a half-hour break would do us
dialog: all good.
text: LOLA saunters casually after the twins, leaving BRIONY alone.
text: She sits on the floor, her back up against the wall, fanning
text: herself with her script, her expression morose. A wasp is
text: buzzing irritatingly, trapped between two panes of the open sash
text: window. BRIONY gets up and goes over to liberate it. She’s about
text: to lower the sash, when something outside catches her attention.
text: Below, to one side of the house, is a terrace, dominated by a
text: monumental fountain. Beside the fountain are ROBBIE and CECILIA
text: glaring at each other.
text: As BRIONY watches, ROBBIE stretches out a hand and says
text: something, as if issuing a command. In response, although her
text: expression is mutinous, CECILIA immediately kicks off her shoes,
text: unbuttons and removes her blouse and strips off her skirt, so
text: that she’s standing before ROBBIE in her underwear.
text: BRIONY gasps and steps back from the window. The wasp buzzes
dialog: frantically.
text: When she returns, ROBBIE is standing motionless by the fountain
text: and CECILIA has disappeared. Then, suddenly, the surface of the
text: water breaks and CECILIA emerges from the fountain. She picks up
text: her clothes, turns her back on ROBBIE and pulls them on to her
text: still dripping body. Then she bends and rises again, this time
text: holding a previously invisible vase of flowers, and strides off
text: back towards the house. ROBBIE, left by the fountain, reaches
text: out a hand and lays it on the surface of the water.
text: BRIONY lowers the sash with a bang, liberating the wasp.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS. DAY.
text: CUT BACK IN TIME.
text: CECILIA, with an armful of wild flowers, runs through the woods,
text: enjoying the sheer exhilaration of movement. There isn’t a cloud
text: in the sky.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. NURSERY. DAY.
text: CLOSE on BRIONY, seen through the window,staring out.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS. DAY.
text: CUT BACK IN TIME.
text: CECILIA runs on through the woods.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY. DAY.
text: CECILIA crosses the hall, as the TWINS come clattering and
text: shouting down the stairs.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Can we go for a swim please, Cecilia?
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: I don’t see why not, as long as you
dialog: don’t go near the deep end.
text: And the TWINS rush away as CECILIA steps into the drawing room.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. DRAWING-ROOM. DAY.
text: CECILIA crosses to the window. Outside, ROBBIE is standing
text: rolling himself a cigarette.
text: CECILIA goes over to a cherry-wood table, where there’s an early
text: 18th-century Meissen vase. She drops the flowers untidily into
text: it and pulls out a crushed packet of cigarettes, which turns out
text: to be empty. She glances back out of the window, picks up the
text: vase, checks her reflection in the mirror and strides out
text: towards the terrace.
scene_heading: EXT. TERRACE. DAY.
text: CECILIA speaks a little sharply, startling ROBBIE.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Can you do me one of your Bolshevik
dialog: roll-ups?
dialog: 10.
text: She doesn’t stop; and he follows her, making the cigarette as
text: she heads across the lawn towards the fountain.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Beautiful day.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I suppose so. Too hot for me.
text: They move on in silence.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: How are you enjoying your book?
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Not at all.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: It gets better.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: I'd rather read Fielding any day. Much
dialog: more... passionate.
text: CECILIA suddenly feels awkward and hastens to change the
dialog: subject.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Leon’s coming down today, did you
dialog: know?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I’d heard a rumour.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: He’s bringing a friend with him. This
dialog: Paul Marshall. The chocolate
dialog: millionaire.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Are the flowers for him?
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Why shouldn't they be? Leon says he’s
dialog: very charming.
text: They reach the fountain: CECILIA puts the vase down on the top
text: step leading up to it. ROBBIE hands her the cigarette and lights
dialog: it. They obviously know one another very well; yet there’s some
text: definite, perceptible constraint between them. There’s more
text: than a hint of accusation in what CECILIA says next.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: The Old Man telephoned last night. He
dialog: says you’re planning to be a doctor.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I’m thinking about it, yes.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Another six years of student life?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: How else do you become a doctor?
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: You could get a Fellowship now,
dialog: couldn’t you? With your First.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: But I don’t want to teach...
text: He breaks off, looks away for a moment; then turns back to her.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I said I’d pay your father back.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: That’s not what I meant at all.
text: There’s an edge of real hostility in her voice. She puts her
text: cigarette between her lips and bends to pick up the vase,
text: preparing to dunk it in the fountain, having first taken out the
text: flowers and laid them on the step.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Let me do that.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: I’m all right, thanks.
text: But ROBBIE persists, reaching for the vase.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: You take the flowers.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: I’m all right!
text: He gets hold of the vase, just as CECILIA turns away; and with
text: the crisp sound of a dry twig snapping, two triangular sections
text: of the rim of the vase detach themselves in his hands. In his
dialog: 12.
text: shock, he lets them go; and they drop into the fountain and sink
text: slowly, spiralling to the bottom, almost three feet down.
text: CECILIA looks at him, horrified.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: You idiot! You realise this is
dialog: probably the most valuable thing we
dialog: own.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Not any more, it isn’t.
text: The hint of truculence in his voice serves to agitate CECILIA
text: even more. She sets the vase down. Then straightens up, aware
text: that ROBBIE has begun to unbutton his shirt. She takes a step
text: towards him, then, confusedly, a step back. ROBBIE, afraid she’s
text: going to step on the vase, throws out a restraining hand, a
text: gesture so abrupt as to seem peremptory.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Careful!
text: CECILIA’s response is to kick off her shoes and, in front of
text: ROBBIE’s transfixed gaze, to strip down to her underwear. Then
text: she steps over the lip of the fountain and lowers herself into
dialog: it.
text: She gasps at the unexpectedly cold water, but doesn’t hesitate
text: to plunge her face beneath the surface.
text: ROBBIE, watches, unable to look away, his expression a queasy
text: mixture of fear and longing. CECILIA’S hair fantails out across
text: the surface of the water.
scene_heading: UNDERWATER. DAY.
text: CECILIA reaches down to the bottom of the basin and carefully
text: retrieves the two triangular shards of porcelain.
scene_heading: EXT. TERRACE. DAY.
text: CECILIA lays the two pieces of pottery down by the vase and,
text: with her back to ROBBIE, scrambles back into her clothes. Then
text: she gathers up her sandals, tucks them under her arm, picks up
text: the pottery fragments and puts them in her skirt pocket, takes
text: up the vase of flowers and marches back towards the house.
text: ROBBIE stands there, watching her go. Then he reaches out a hand
text: and lays it on the surface of the water, as if to calm it.
dialog: 13.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. NURSERY. DAY.
text: BRIONY, seen through the window, closes it and stays where she
text: is for a moment, staring out. Then she turns back into the room
text: and crosses it, grabbing up her notebook.
scene_heading: EXT. PERGOLA. DAY.
text: BRIONY strides through the rose-covered pergola, moving away
text: from the house.
scene_heading: EXT. TALLIS HOUSE DRIVE. DAY.
text: A cream-coloured Rolls-Royce makes its stately way up the drive.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. CECILIA’S BEDROOM. DAY.
text: CECILIA’s room is heroically untidy. The bed is unmade, the
text: floor is littered with papers, clothes, and open books, the
text: ashtrays are overflowing and the dressing-table is a disaster
text: area. CECILIA herself sits, painting her toenails, when she
text: hears the SOUND of the approaching motor. She crosses to the
text: window gingerly, so as not to ruin her nail polish.
text: In the distance she sees ROBBIE striding across the lawns on his
text: way down to the lodge, where he lives with his mother. The Rolls-
text: Royce slows and stops alongside ROBBIE and the passenger leans
text: out to speak to him.
text: CECILIA frowns in obvious annoyance.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: No need to encourage him.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY. DAY.
text: The two young men, LEON TALLIS, 25, and his friend PAUL
text: MARSHALL, 28, surge into the house, followed by DANNY HARDMAN,
text: struggling with their suitcases.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Cee! Mother!
text: He turns to DANNY.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Where is everyone, Danny?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Dunno, sir.
speaker_heading: LEON
text: I’m gasping for a drink.
dialog: 14.
text: He steps into the drawing room. DANNY, still with the luggage,
text: follows confusedly.
scene_heading: INT. DRAWING ROOM. DAY.
text: LEON is moving over to the drinks table.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Will you have one?
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Rather.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Whisky?
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Please.
text: As LEON fixes the drinks, CECILIA bursts into the room.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Leon!
text: LEON takes her in his arms.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Here she is!
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Oh, I’ve missed you. I’ve been going
dialog: completely doolally up here.
text: LEON turns to include MARSHALL.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: This is my sister, Cecilia; Paul
dialog: Marshall.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: I’ve heard an awful lot about you.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Likewise.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Where are we putting him?
text: CECILIA turns to DANNY.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
text: In the blue room.
text: DANNY starts off up the stairs, then stops, looking gormless.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Mother's lying down, she’s got one of
text: her migraines.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Not surprised, this heat.
text: CECILIA looks up at DANNY, somewhat irritated.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
text: The big room next to the nursery.
text: DANNY sets off, grunting with effort.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Is the Old Man staying in town?
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Looks like it. There’s some sort of
text: rush on at the Ministry.
scene_heading: INT. EMILY TALLIS‘S BEDROOM. DAY.
text: EMILY is on her bed in her darkened room, propped up against two
text: pillows, her eyes protected by an eyeshade, cooled by an
text: electric fan that whirs on her bedside table.
text: From the nursery comes the regular thud of a bouncing rubber
dialog: ball.
text: EMILY sighs and pushes up her eyeshade.
scene_heading: INT. NURSERY. DAY.
text: The TWINS are sitting in their still wet bathing suits, bouncing
text: a rubber ball against the wall.
text: LOLA lies on the couch, flicking through a fashion magazine.
speaker_heading: PIERROT
dialog: So aren't we doing the play?
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Don’t ask me.
speaker_heading: PIERROT
dialog: I don’t like it here.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE. DAY.
text: On the lake floats a white pontoon. CECILIA is wearing a white
text: one-piece swimsuit and nursing a glass of punch. MARSHALL and
text: LEON are also in bathing suits. We’re looking at CECILIA, lying
text: on the diving board in the blinding heat, as MARSHALL’s droning
text: voice nibbles at the edge of her attention.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: And currently our main challenge is
dialog: whether or not to launch the new Amo
dialog: bar, the Army Amo. You see, Pass the
dialog: Amo!
text: CECILIA turns her head to look at him for a moment.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: My source at the Ministry of Defence -
dialog: I used to clean his shoes at Harrow,
dialog: so he’s very reliable - assures me
dialog: we've a good chance of getting the Amo
dialog: bar included in the standard-issue
dialog: ration pack. Which means I’d have to
text: open at least three more factories,
dialog: more if they bring in conscription,
dialog: which I’d say is bound to happen if
text: Herr Hitler doesn’t pipe down - and
dialog: he’s about as likely to do that as buy
dialog: shares in Marks and Spencers, wouldn't
dialog: you agree?
text: CECILIA’s been making a valiant effort to seem interested; now
text: she takes a sip of her punch.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: This isn’t very good.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: I make a cocktail with rum, crushed
text: ice, and melted dark chocolate.
dialog: Absolutely scrumptious!
text: CECILIA manages to catch LEON’s eye and make a discreet vomiting
text: face; LEON is obliged to rise to his feet to conceal an
text: irresistible burst of silent laughter. To recover, he turns away
dialog: to speak to CECILIA.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Guess who we met on the way in?
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Robbie.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: I told him to join us tonight.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Leon! You didn’t!
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: (to Marshall)
dialog: So Robbie the Housekeeper’s son, whose
dialog: father did a bunk twenty years ago,
dialog: gets a scholarship to the local
text: grammar and the Old Man puts him
text: through Cambridge; goes up at the same
dialog: time as Cee and for three years she
dialog: hardly speaks to him! She wouldn’t let
text: him within a mile of her Roedean
dialog: chums.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Anyone got a cigarette?
text: MARSHALL produces a gold case, brings it over to CECILIA and
text: lights the cigarette she’s taken.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Don’t know what the hell he’s doing
dialog: these days, messing about in flower
dialog: beds...
text: CECILIA is standing on the diving board now.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: As a matter of fact he’s planning on
dialog: doing a medical degree.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: And the Old Man said yes to that?
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Look, I think you ought to go down to
dialog: the lodge and ask him not to come.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Why? Has something happened between
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Oh, for God's sake.
text: CECILIA dives into the lake.
scene_heading: UNDERWATER. DAY.
text: CECILIA swims by, powerful underwater breast-stroke.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM IN THE LODGE. DAY.
text: ROBBIE surfaces in his bath: he settles back, brooding, looking
text: up at a skylight, a small pane of glass directly above him, a
text: square of bright blue sky, through which flies an RAF plane.
scene_heading: INT. NURSERY. DAY.
text: LOLA, PIERROT and JACKSON are hanging about aimlessly, already
text: at a loss as to what to do.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: When can we go home?
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Soon.
speaker_heading: PIERROT
dialog: We can’t go home: it’s a divorce!
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: How dare you say that?
speaker_heading: PIERROT
dialog: Well, it’s true.
text: LOLA grabs PIERROT by the shoulders and shakes him.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: You will never ever use that word
dialog: again. Do you understand?
dialog: 
text: PIERROT nods miserably. Eventually, JACKSON breaks the silence.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Now what are we going to do?
speaker_heading: MARSHALL (0.S.)
dialog: I’m always asking myself that.
text: They’re all startled by PAUL MARSHALL’s sudden appearance in the
text: doorway. He advances into the room, hand extended.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: My name’s Paul Marshall. And you must
dialog: be the cousins from the north. What
dialog: are your names?
text: They tell him, as he shakes hands with them.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: What marvellous names.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Do you know our parents?
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Well, I’ve read about them in the
dialog: paper.
text: This causes consternation, from which LOLA is the first to
dialog: recover.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: What exactly have you read about them?
text: MARSHALL realizes it may be time to back-pedal.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Oh, I don’t know. Usual sort of
dialog: nonsense.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: I’1l thank you not to talk about this
text: in front of the children.
text: MARSHALL turns to the TWINS and speaks with glutinous solemnity.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Your parents are absolutely wonderful
dialog: people, that’s quite clear and they
dialog: love you and think about you all the
dialog: time.
text: LOLA’s expression changes; he’s successfully appeased her and
text: follows swiftly through with a compliment.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Jolly nice slacks.
text: LOLA smooths them down, visibly pleased.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: We went up to see a show and got them
dialog: at Liberty’s.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: What was the show?
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Hamlet.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Ah, yes: to be or not to be.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: I like your shoes.
text: MARSHALL tilts his brown and white co-respondent shoes,
text: self-satisfied.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
text: Ducker’s in the Turl. They make a...
dialog: wooden thing shaped like your foot and
dialog: keep it for ever.
speaker_heading: PIERROT
dialog: I’m starving, when’s dinner?
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: I might be able to help you out, if
dialog: you can guess what I do for a living.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: You've got a chocolate factory.
speaker_heading: PIERROT
dialog: Everyone knows that.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Ah, so it wasn’t a guess.
dialog: 20.
text: serenely
text: He takes a slab of something wrapped in greaseproof paper out of
text: his pocket and unwraps it to reveal a shell of khaki sugar which
text: he taps with his fingernail.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: There’1l be one of these provided in
dialog: every kitbag of every soldier in the
dialog: British Army. Sugar casing so it won’t
dialog: melt.
speaker_heading: PIERROT
dialog: Why should they get free sweets?
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Because they'll be fighting for their
dialog: country.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Our Daddy says there isn’t going to be
dialog: a war.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Your Daddy is wrong.
text: He’s snapped at the boy, and now smiles wolfishly in an attempt
dialog: to make amends.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: We're calling it the Army Amo.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Amo amas amat.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Top marks.
speaker_heading: PIERROT
dialog: It’s boring how everything ends in 0.
dialog: Polo and Aero.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: And Oxo and Brillo.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Sounds as if you don’t want it then. I
dialog: shall have to give it to your sister.
text: Which he does. She takes it, smiling triumphantly at the
text: disappointed TWINS. She glances flirtatiously at MARSHALL, who
text: watches with frank interest as she wraps her lips around the end
text: of the bar. His voice is soft and breathy.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Bite it. You have to bite it.
dialog: 22.
scene_heading: EXT. GROTTO. DAY.
text: Beyond the formal lawns at the bottom of the garden is an old
text: crumbling grotto. This is BRIONY’s place: she sits in the shade,
text: scribbling furiously in her notebook.
speaker_heading: BRIONY (V.O.)
dialog: The Princess was aware of his
dialog: remorseless wickedness, but that made
dialog: it no easier to overcome the
dialog: voluminous love she felt for Sir
dialog: Romulus...The Princess knew
dialog: instinctively that the one with red
dialog: hair was not to be trusted...As his
text: young ward dived into the depths of
text: the lake in search of the enchanted
text: chalice, Sir Romulus twirled his
text: luxuriant moustache...Sir Romulus rode
text: north with his two companions, drawing
text: ever closer to an effulgent sea...So
dialog: heroic in manner he appeared, so
dialog: valiant in word, no one could guess at
text: the darkness lurking in the black
dialog: heart of Sir Romulus Turnbull: he was
dialog: the most dangerous man in the world.
scene_heading: INT. ROBBIE’S STUDY/BEDROOM IN THE LODGE. DAY.
text: ROBBIE sits at his typewriter, pensive. His tiny room is stuffed
text: full of books; open on his desk is a copy of Grays Anatomy. He
text: reads back what he’s just written.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Dear Cecilia, I thought I should write
dialog: to apologize for my clumsy and
dialog: inconsiderate behaviour...
text: He sighs, pulls the paper out of the typewriter, crumples it up
text: and throws it in the waste-paper basket, where it joins other
dialog: rejected drafts.
scene_heading: INT. CECILIA’S BEDROOM. DAY.
text: CECILIA is studying herself in the full-length mirror. She's
text: wearing a black dress and a jet necklace.
text: With a profound sigh, she shakes her head and lets the dress
text: fall to the floor.
dialog: 23.
text: On SOUND: the final duet of Act 1 of La Boheme.
scene_heading: INT. ROBBIE'S STUDY/BEDROOM. DAY.
text: The music is on ROBBIE’S gramophone. He leans back, wrenching
text: the paper out of the typewriter, again, crumpling it and
text: throwing it in the waste-paper basket.
text: A series of JUMP CUTS: ROBBIE moves over to the gramophone,
text: stands a moment listening to the climax of the duet, picks up
text: the arm and moves the needle back to replay the high note. He
text: paces his small room. He feeds another sheet of paper into the
text: typewriter, stubs out his cigarette, pulls the sheet out of the
text: typewriter and starts again. Decisively, he begins to type.
text: As he types, the words appear on the paper: “In my dreams I kiss
dialog: your cunt, your sweet wet cunt. In my thoughts I make love to
dialog: you all day long. Robbie.”
text: ROBBIE sits back with a small gasp and laughs; he’s surprised
text: himself. Then he pulls the page out of the typewriter, sets it
text: down on Gray’s Anatomy, pushes the typewriter aside and reaches
text: for some notepaper and a fountain pen. After a pause for
text: reflection, he unscrews the pen and starts writing.
dialog: He writes: “Dear Cecilia...”
speaker_heading: ROBBIE (V.O.)
dialog: «+. you'd be forgiven for thinking me
dialog: mad-the way I acted this afternoon.
scene_heading: INT. CECILIA'S BEDROOM. DAY.
text: CECILIA is now wearing a green halter-neck evening gown and the
text: jet necklace has been replaced with a rope of pearls. A couple
text: of other dresses lie on the floor beside the rejected black
dialog: dress.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE (V.O.)
dialog: The truth is, I feel rather light-
dialog: headed and foolish in your presence,
dialog: Cee, and I don’t think I can blame the
dialog: heat. Will you forgive me? Robbie.
text: CECILIA fixes on a diamond hair-clip, contemplates her
text: reflection for a moment, this time with satisfaction and leaves
dialog: the room.
dialog: 24.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRS/FRONT ROOM. LODGE. DAY.
text: ROBBIE comes downstairs in a vest, carrying a shoe brush and a
text: pair of black brogues. His mother, GRACE TURNER, whom we've
text: already encountered in the Tallis kitchen, is sitting in the
text: front room with her eyes closed, her feet up and her slippers
text: dangling from her toes. ROBBIE spreads out a double page of the
text: Daily Sketch, before sitting to polish his shoes.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Off out, then?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Yes; Leon asked me to join them for
dialog: dinner.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: So that’s why I’ve been polishing the
dialog: silver all afternoon.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I’1l think of you when I see my face
text: in the spoon.
text: He stands up. GRACE watches him for a moment.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You’re not a bit like your father. Not
dialog: in any way.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: That’s because I’m all yours.
text: ROBBIE kisses his mother’s forehead.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I‘ll be late.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Your shirts are hanging upstairs.
text: ROBBIE starts to leave.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Son?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: 25.
scene_heading: INT. ROBBIE'S STUDY/BEDROOM. DUSK.
text: ROBBIE, rushing now, does up the front of his shirt and at the
text: same time finds an envelope, folds his letter, looks for his
text: cigarette case, puts the letter in the envelope and seals it. He
text: puts his jacket on, tests his lighter three times and leaves the
dialog: room.
scene_heading: EXT. LODGE & PARK. DUSK.
text: ROBBIE leaves the bungalow, impeccable in his evening dress, the
text: envelope in his hand and a spring in his step; he looks for all
text: the world like a young man with a glorious future.
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY. DUSK.
text: ROBBIE walks down the drive towards the Tallis house, his letter
text: still in his hand. He comes to a monumental bridge that crosses
text: a small stream. Below he sees a figure at the water’s edge,
text: slashing at nettles with a hazel switch.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Briony? Is that you?
text: BRIONY turns, obviously startled and straightens her hair.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Are you all right?
text: BRIONY nods, her face flushing.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Do you think you could do me a favour?
text: BRIONY scrambles up the slope to join ROBBIE.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Could you run ahead and give this to
dialog: Cee? I'd feel a bit of a fool handing
dialog: it over myself.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: All right.
text: She takes the envelope from him, turns and runs off without
text: another word. He starts to roll himself a cigarette.
text: ROBBIE watches her go, leaving the drive to take a short cut
text: across the grass, running all the way.
dialog: 26.
text: Suddenly ROBBIE gasps, as if punched in the solar plexus, and
text: lets drop the makings of the cigarette.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Briony.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDENS. DUSK.
text: But BRIONY is out of earshot, running across the gardens,
text: clutching the envelope.
scene_heading: INT. ROBBIE’S STUDY/BEDROOM. DAY.
text: CUT BACK IN TIME.
text: Again ROBBIE tests his lighter three times and leaves the room.
text: But this time the CAMERA PANS back to ROBBIE’s desk and moves in
text: on the hand-written letter, still lying on his copy of Gray's
dialog: Anatomy.
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY. DUSK.
text: ROBBIE, panicked now, cups his hands around his mouth and yells
text: at the top of his voice:
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Briony!
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY. DUSK.
text: BRIONY runs into the hall and stands for a moment, alone. Then,
text: impulsively, she rips open the letter, stuffs the envelope into
text: her pocket and reads.
text: The SOUND of a typewriter, builds to:
scene_heading: INT. ROBBIE'S STUDY/BEDROOM. DAY.
text: The hammers of ROBBIE’S typewriter in extreme close-up, crashing
text: down with the word: C-U-N-T
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY. DUSK.
text: WIDE on BRIONY, a tiny figure isolated in the vast hall,
text: transfixed by what she’s just read.
dialog: 27.
scene_heading: INT. DRAWING ROOM. DUSK.
text: CECILIA and LEON, both holding gin-and-tonics, sit in a window
text: seat overlooking the gardens.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: I suppose he’s what you might call
dialog: eligible.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Rather!
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: He certainly seems to think he’s the
dialog: cat's pyjamas. Which is odd,
text: considering he has pubic hair growing
text: out of his ears.
text: LEON snorts with laughter.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: I imagine he’d give you a lot of very
text: noisy boneheaded sons.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: He’s quite a good egg, actually.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: You say that about everyone.
text: LEON’S face lights up as BRIONY bursts into the room; he goes
text: into his Arthur Askey impersonation.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Rummy, if it ain’t my little sis!
text: BRIONY thrusts the letter into CECILIA’s hand without a word and
text: flings herself into LEON’S embrace.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: I wrote a play, Leon. I wanted to do a
dialog: play for you, The Trials of Arabella.
text: CLOSE on CECILIA as she unfolds the letter and reads. She
text: blushes hotly, looks up to make sure her shock has not been
text: observed and bows her head to read it again.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: There’s still time, doesn’t have to be
dialog: this evening.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: No, it’s impossible!
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Briony?
text: BRIONY completely ignores CECILIA, pretending to hang on LEON’s
dialog: every word.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Tell you what, I’m good at voices and
dialog: you're even better. We’1l read it out
dialog: after dinner.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Briony, did you read this letter?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Yes, let’s, that’s a wonderful idea!
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Briony...
text: CECILIA’s about to speak, but she’s interrupted by the sudden
text: appearance of PAUL MARSHALL, who’s carrying a silver tray, on
text: which stand five cocktail glasses containing a sludgy brown
text: liquid. He has a faint scratch running down his right check.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Here we are, my chocktail; I insist
dialog: you try it.
text: BRIONY tries to take advantage of this to slip out of the room;
text: but CECILIA grabs hold of her arm and hisses at her.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Wasn‘t there an envelope?
text: BRIONY wriggles free and hurries out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. BRIONY’S BEDROOM. DUSK.
text: BRIONY, not yet changed, paces restlessly up and down, trying to
text: make sense of the events of the evening. There’s a light tap on
text: the door and she looks up, very surprised to see LOLA.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Do you mind if I come in?
text: Before BRIONY can answer, LOLA comes in and perches on the edge
text: of the bed; her expression is tragic. She’s dressed for dinner
text: and wearing make-up and lipstick.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: I’ve had the most appalling evening.
dialog: The twins have been torturing me.
dialog: Look.
text: She pulls up a sleeve to reveal a blue bruise on her upper arm.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: How awful!
text: As she speaks she notices LOLA’s wrist is blotched and sore-
text: looking; she reaches out to take it.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Chinese burns?
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: That’s right.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: But why?
text: LOLA is beginning to weep softly, in the presence of BRIONY’s
text: obvious sympathy.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: They want to go home. They think it’s
dialog: me keeping them here.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Lola, can I tell you something?
dialog: Something really terrible?
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Yes, please.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: What’s the worst word you can possibly
dialog: imagine?
scene_heading: EXT. LAWN/TERRACE. DUSK.
text: ROBBIE approaches the towering bulk of the house, dragging his
text: feet. He looks up at the lighted windows and comes to a halt
text: outside the front door, not at all sure he can bring himself to
text: proceed. Finally, he takes a deep breath and tugs at the bell-
dialog: pull.
scene_heading: INT. BRIONY’S BEDROOM. DUSK.
text: LOLA seems to have made a complete recovery. She’s staring at
text: BRIONY in undisguised fascination.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: He’s a sex-maniac!
text: BRIONY nods seriously, struggling to find the correct mature
dialog: response.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: That’s right.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: What’s Cecilia going to do?
text: From below, a ring on the doorbell.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: You ought to call the police.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Do you think so?
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: He said he thought about it ‘all day
dialog: long.’ All you need do is show them
dialog: the letter.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: You won’t tell anyone, will you?
dialog: Promise.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: I promise.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: If he found out, there’s no knowing
dialog: what he might do.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: You’re right.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: You'd better tidy your face. I’ve
dialog: still got to change.
text: LOLA goes to the door, turns back in the doorway.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Thanks, Briony, you’re a brick.
text: She leaves the room.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRCASE AND HALLWAY. NIGHT.
text: BRIONY, now changed for dinner, crosses the landing and starts
text: down the last section of staircase leading to the hall. As she
text: reaches the bottom step, she notices a diamond hair-clip lying
text: in front of the door to the library. She crosses to the hair-
text: clip and picks it up. A moment later she hears a low moan,
text: recognizably CECILIA’S voice, coming from behind the door.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY. NIGHT.
text: BRIONY opens the door quietly and stands, framed in the doorway,
text: peering apprehensively in.
text: The library is cavernous and dark, lined with floor-to-ceiling
text: bookshelves. The only light comes from a desk lamp that points
text: directly into BRIONY’s eyes. Silence. BRIONY takes a tentative
text: couple of steps into the room. As she does so, there’s a sound
text: from the far corner.
speaker_heading: CECILIA (0.S.)
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Someone’s come in.
text: BRIONY edges closer and suddenly, revealed in the corner, frozen
text: against the bookshelves, are ROBBIE and CECILIA. ROBBIE, who has
text: one of CECILIA’s wrists pinned against the wall, appears to be
text: attacking CECILIA, while CECILIA has a hand round his head,
text: gripping a handful of hair.
text: BRIONY, bewildered, stops by the desk.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Cecilia?
text: SOUND of a doorbell.
scene_heading: EXT. TALLIS HOUSE. DUSK.
text: CUT BACK IN TIME.
text: CLOSE on ROBBIE’S hand, tugging at the bell-pull.
text: When the door opens, it’s CECILIA, the folded letter in her
dialog: hand.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: It was a mistake.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
text: Briony read it.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Oh God. I’m so sorry. It was the wrong
dialog: version.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: No one was ever meant to...
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: No.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY. NIGHT.
text: CECILIA turns away and moves briskly towards the library.
text: ROBBIE, after a second’s hesitation, follows her, almost
text: stepping on the hair-clip which has dropped from her hair.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY. NIGHT.
text: It’s dark in the library.
text: ROBBIE waits in the doorway, until CECILIA has switched on the
text: desk-lamp; then he closes the door behind him and advances
text: tentatively into the room. CECILIA crosses almost the full width
text: of the room, before turning to face him.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: What was in the version I was meant to
dialog: read?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I don’t know, it was more formal, it
dialog: was less...
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Anatomical?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Yes.
text: CECILIA doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry. ROBBIE begins to
text: inch towards her as she begins to back gradually into a dark
text: corner, until she’s up against the bookshelves.
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: It’s been there for weeks and then
dialog: this morning by the fountain... I’ve
dialog: never done anything like that before
dialog: and I was so angry with you, and with
dialog: myself. I thought if you went away to
dialog: medical school, I’d be happy. I don’t
dialog: know how I could have been so ignorant
dialog: about myself. So stupid.
text: Tears well in her eyes. He’s moving closer and closer.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: You do know what I’m talking about,
dialog: don’t you? You knew before I did.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Why are you crying?
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Don’t you know?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Yes, I know exactly.
text: He reaches out and draws her to him, until their faces are
text: inches apart. He kisses her briefly and pulls back; then they
text: look at each other and kiss again, this time a long, passionate
text: and breathless kiss, that draws from CECILIA a falling, sighing
text: sound. He pushes her back into the corner and she starts tearing
text: at his shirt, pulling at his waistband. He buries his face in
text: her breasts and she drags his head up by the hair and bites his
text: lip. She links her hands around his neck. He reaches down under
text: her dress and into her underwear. She kicks off her shoes and he
text: raises one of her feet on to the lowest shelf. He undoes his
text: buttons, lifts her dress and enters her. She turns her head
text: sharply, biting her lip. They stop moving and slowly turn to
text: look into each other’s eyes. Then, after a long, still pause
text: they whisper to one another, barely audible.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Robbie.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Cecilia.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I love you.
dialog: 34.
text: She gasps as he starts moving again, crushing her against the
text: creaking shelves. He takes her wrist and holds it back against
text: the wall.
text: The door opens. CECILIA and ROBBIE freeze.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Someone’s come in.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Cecilia?
text: CECILIA doesn’t answer. ROBBIE steps back from CECILIA and
text: begins adjusting his clothes, keeping his back to BRIONY.
text: CECILIA tidies herself up, steps out from behind ROBBIE and
text: pushes past BRIONY without a word. BRIONY watches her leave the
text: room, at a loss, then turns back, startled, as she senses ROBBIE
text: turning towards her. She takes a step back, frightened; but he
text: merely fumbles with his bow-tie and, staring coldly past her,
text: leaves the room.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM. NIGHT.
text: BRIONY enters the dining room to find ROBBIE holding CECILIA’S
text: chair for her to sit. Also around the table are LEON, MARSHALL,
text: LOLA and, at the top of the table, EMILY. DANNY HARDMAN is
text: rather sloppily pouring wine for LEON, whilst leering across the
text: table at LOLA.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: In Charlotte Street last week, people
dialog: were sitting out having dinner on the
dialog: pavement.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: It was always the view of my parents
dialog: that hot weather encouraged loose
dialog: morals. In high summer my sister and I
dialog: were never allowed out of the house.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: What do you say, Cee? Does the hot
dialog: weather make you behave badly?
text: CECILIA flushes red, taken by surprise.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Good heavens, you’re blushing.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: It’s just hot in here, that’s all.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Lola, wipe that lipstick off. You’re
dialog: far too young.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: What about you, Briony? What sins have
dialog: you committed today?
text: BRIONY, now seated, looks across at him indignantly.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: I've done nothing wrong.
text: She turns to look meaningfully at ROBBIE and CECILIA. Meanwhile
text: EMILY speaks to LOLA,
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Have you seen the twins recently?
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Er...no.
text: Following some nervous impulse, ROBBIE suddenly finds himself
text: joining in the conversation.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: They didn’t look very happy last time
dialog: I saw them, poor little chaps.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: You know nothing about it.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I can’t imagine what’s got into you,
dialog: Briony. I’ve never known you be so
dialog: rude.
text: CECILIA dabs her lip with a napkin to find a tiny spot of blood.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Well, they’re not poor little chaps:
dialog: just look what they did to Lola!
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
text: Jackson and Pierrot. Bruised her arm,
dialog: gave her Chinese burns.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: She’s quite right, I’m afraid, I had
text: to pull them off her.
dialog: 36.
text: He indicates the scratch on his cheek.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: That’s how I got my war wound.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: The twins did that? Lola?
text: LOLA doesn’t reply.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
text: It all turned into a bit of a wrestle.
dialog: Still, no harm done, eh, Lola?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Would you go and find these boys
dialog: please, Briony? Tell them dinner’s
dialog: ready and where are their manners.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Why do I have to go?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Briony, you'll do as you're told or
dialog: you'll go straight to your room.
text: BRIONY rises from the table, her expression mutinous; EMILY
text: turns to inspect LOLA’s arm. Under the table, CECILIA reaches
text: for ROBBIE’s hand.
scene_heading: INT. TWINS’ ROOM. NIGHT.
text: BRIONY switches the light on and is surprised to find the room
text: empty. There’s a large ragged piece of paper on one of the beds.
text: As BRIONY moves towards it, she sees it’s headed in big red
text: capitals: TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN. She reaches for it.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRCASE AND HALLWAY. NIGHT.
text: BRIONY comes flying down the stairs, the piece of paper in her
dialog: hand.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM. NIGHT.
text: All heads turn as BRIONY flings open the door. CECILIA lets go
text: of ROBBIE’s hand.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: It’s a letter!
dialog: 37.
text: CECILIA immediately panics.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Give it here.
text: Then she sees what’s in BRIONY’S hand and relaxes; BRIONY,
text: meanwhile, is advancing towards the head of the table.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
text: They’ve run away.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Who has?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: The twins.
text: BRIONY reads from the piece of paper.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: “We are going to run away because Lola
dialog: is so horrid to us and we want to go
dialog: home. Also there wasn’t a play.”
text: She hands the sheet of paper to EMILY. LOLA has gone pale.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Not to worry, we'll send out some
dialog: search parties, they can’t have gone
dialog: far.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Cee, you come with me.
text: CECILIA manages to catch ROBBIE’s eye and half-shrugs, as if to
dialog: say it can’t be helped.
scene_heading: EXT/INT. TERRACE/DRAWING ROOM. NIGHT.
text: BRIONY comes out on to the terrace; she hesitates a moment and
text: then moves off into the darkness.
text: WIDE SHOT: the house with torch beams fanning out across the
text: grounds. VOICES calling out the twins’ names.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE. NIGHT.
text: BRIONY crosses the small bridge that crosses from the bank of
text: the lake to the small island, her torch switched on.
dialog: 38.
text: Seeing what might be the flash of another torch in the distance,
text: she stops and listens.
scene_heading: EXT. BOAT HOUSE. NIGHT.
text: BRIONY comes down a narrow stone alley and peers into the watery
text: darkness under the boat house. Suddenly, a duck splashes away
text: from under a boat, startling her.
scene_heading: EXT. GROTTO. NIGHT.
text: BRIONY climbs down the steep steps into the bowl of the grotto.
text: Then, once again, she hesitates and slows to a standstill.
text: Suddenly, out of the darkness, there’s a painful gasp; and
text: BRIONY whirls round, pointing her torch. For a fraction of a
text: second there’s an image of LOLA, on all fours, her dress hiked
text: up and a tall male figure, kneeling behind her. BRIONY drops her
text: torch in shock; it shines up in her eyes, blinding her, so that
text: the man, rising to his full height, turning and scrambling away
text: up the bank, disappears before she can pull herself together.
text: LOLA’S voice breaks the silence.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Briony?
text: BRIONY picks up the torch and shines it at LOLA, who by now is
text: in a sitting position. She hurries over to join LOLA, dropping
text: to her knees beside her.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Lola. Are you all right?
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: I’m sorry, I didn’t, I’m sorry...
text: BRIONY puts her arm round LOLA’s bony shoulders; she seems
text: strangely invigorated.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Who was it?
text: LOLA doesn’t answer. She’s sitting up now, her arms wrapped
text: round her knees, rocking slightly. They talk in whispers.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: I saw him. I saw him.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: It was him, wasn’t it?
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Yes. It was him.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Lola... Who was it?
text: LOLA doesn’t answer.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: It was Robbie, wasn’t it?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Robbie.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: You saw him.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Like you said, he’s a sex maniac. And
dialog: you don’t even know what happened
dialog: before dinner. I caught him attacking
dialog: my sister in the library. I don’t know
dialog: what he’d have done, if I hadn’t come
dialog: in...
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: You actually saw him.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Of course I did. Plain as day.
speaker_heading: LOLA
text: He came up behind me. He pushed me to
text: the ground and then he put his hand
dialog: over my eyes. I couldn’t actually, I
dialog: never actually...
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Listen, I’ve known him all my life.
dialog: And I saw him.
speaker_heading: LOLA
dialog: Because I couldn’t say for sure.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Well, I can. And I will.
dialog: 40.
scene_heading: INT. HALL. NIGHT.
text: LEON crosses the hall with LOLA limp in his arms, followed
text: closely by BRIONY and CECILIA. He speaks to EMILY in an urgent
text: undertone.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Call the police. And she'll be needing
dialog: a doctor as well.
scene_heading: INT. DRAWING ROOM. NIGHT.
text: As the party surges into the room, following LEON, LOLA bursts
text: into noisy tears, which continue as LEON lays her down on one of
text: the sofas and EMILY tries to comfort her.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: It’s all right, dear, you're all right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Is Robbie back?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I haven’t seen him.
text: All this is very fast and chaotic: then BRIONY, who’s standing
text: just inside the French windows, makes a quiet announcement.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: I know who it was.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY. NIGHT.
text: BRIONY, her face sharply lit against the dark library wall, is
text: being interrogated by a stony-faced plain clothes INSPECTOR.
text: EMILY is scarcely visible. He rattles out the questions
text: intimidatingly; but BRIONY’S answers are firm and unhesitating.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: You saw him, then?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Yes, I saw him.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: Just as you see me.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: I know it was him.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: You know it was him, or you saw him?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Yes, I did. I saw him.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: With your own eyes?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Yes. I saw him, I saw him with my own
text: eyes.
text: EMILY rests a comforting hand on her daughter’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Well done, darling.
scene_heading: EXT. TERRACE. NIGHT.
text: CECILIA paces on the terrace, drawing hard on her cigarette, as
text: she peers out into the darkness, looking for ROBBIE.
scene_heading: INT. LANDING. NIGHT.
text: BRIONY hesitates outside CECILIA’s room, then tries the door
text: gingerly. It’s dark in the room.
scene_heading: INT. CECILIA’S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
text: BRIONY steps into the room, closes the door, turns on the light,
text: crosses to CECILIA’s dressing table, opens one of the drawers
text: and begins to rummage around in it.
text: We pass through the wall into -
scene_heading: INT. LOLA‘S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
text: - LOLA’s bedroom, where LOLA, is being examined by a DOCTOR,
text: watched by BETTY the cook.
scene_heading: INT. CECILIA’S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
text: BRIONY continues to rummage, opening CECILIA’s desk.
dialog: 42.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY. NIGHT.
text: CECILIA is being interrogated: as with BRIONY, she’s brightly
text: lit, the INSPECTOR and EMILY are in shadow.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: My brother and I found the two of
text: them, down by the lake.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: You didn’t see anyone else?
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: I wouldn’t necessarily believe
dialog: everything Briony tells you; she’s
dialog: very fanciful.
scene_heading: CECILIA'’S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
text: BRIONY throws back the covers on CECILIA’S bed and finds, there
text: on the rumpled sheet, what she’s looking for. CECILIA’s handbag
text: and in it ROBBIE’s letter.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY. NIGHT.
text: DANNY HARDMAN is being interrogated. He’s flustered, almost
text: tearful.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: When they went looking, I went up to
dialog: my Dad’s. I did, honest..
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: Why was that?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: To tell him all about it.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY. NIGHT.
text: CLOSE on the letter as EMILY reads it, the INSPECTOR waits in
dialog: the background.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: I know I shouldn’t have opened it.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: No. You should not. But at least
dialog: you've done the right thing now.
dialog: 43.
scene_heading: INT. DRAWING ROOM. NIGHT.
text: Tea is being served to the various POLICE OFFICERS.
text: MARSHALL is on one of the sofas, fast asleep, his mouth open.
text: LEON, sitting isolated in an armchair, sighs and consults his
dialog: watch.
text: BRIONY sits at the piano. Suppressing a yawn, she reaches
text: forward and plonks on one of the notes two or three times. At
text: the window, CECILIA has seen something.
text: A WIDER SHOT reveals a CONSTABLE stepping into the room.
speaker_heading: CONSTABLE
dialog: Sir, there’s someone coming.
scene_heading: EXT. TERRACE. NIGHT.
text: CECILIA emerges from the house to join EMILY, BRIONY, LEON,
text: MARSHALL and the three POLICEMEN all of whom are watching,
text: motionless, the approach of a strange apparition through the
text: mist: which eventually reveals itself as ROBBIE, with PIERROT on
text: his shoulders and JACKSON, clinging on to his hand. EMILY speaks
text: sharply to BRIONY.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: It’s time you went to bed.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Now.
text: Obediently, BRIONY turns and vanishes into the house. ROBBIE,
text: closer now, stops in his tracks as he becomes aware of the
scene_heading: POLICEMEN.
scene_heading: INT. BRIONY’S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
text: BRIONY is awake, crying into her pillow silently. She stops,
text: hearing the sound of a car starting, and jumps out of bed.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. LANDING/STAIRCASE/DRIVE. NIGHT.
text: Briony runs across the landing and jumps up on to a window ledge
text: to look out. Below is a police Humber with all four doors open.
dialog: 44.
text: Then ROBBIE appears, his wrists handcuffed in front of him,
text: moving between the two CONSTABLES. One of them rounds the car to
text: get into the back seat. ROBBIE stops suddenly and turns back
text: towards the house. At the same time, EMILY’S VOICE rings out.
speaker_heading: EMILY (0.S.)
dialog: Cecilia!
text: BRIONY cranes forward to try to see what’s happening.
text: CECILIA, ignoring her mother, runs to ROBBIE. ROBBIE moves
text: towards her, catching the CONSTABLE off guard for a second; she
text: catches hold of ROBBIE’s lapel and whispers into his ear. The
text: CONSTABLE arrives and disengages her hand, gently but firmly,
text: then leads ROBBIE to the car and pushes him down into the back
text: seat. CECILIA bursts into tears, as the door closes. The car
text: begins to pull away from the house. Visible through the back
text: window, as he twists round to look over his shoulder, is the
text: shocked, white face of ROBBIE.
text: The car is only about twenty yards away from the house, when
text: it’s obliged to slow down by the irate figure of GRACE TURNER,
text: clutching an umbrella, marching down the very centre of the
text: drive. As the car passes her and before it can accelerate away,
text: she brings the umbrella down with a great crash on the shining
text: paintwork, roaring out at the top of her voice:
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Liars! Liars! Liars!
text: BRIONY’S P.O.V.: CECILIA stands motionless, isolated below on
text: the driveway.
text: TRACKING SHOT: the CAMERA slowly CLOSES IN on BRIONY’s eye,
text: unblinking at the window.
scene_heading: INT. BARN. NIGHT.
text: ROBBIE TURNER, in a private’s uniform, is a good deal thinner
text: than when we last saw him, pale and unshaven. He’s with two
text: corporals in the loft of a French barn: TOMMY NETTLE, a young,
text: skinny Cockney and FRANK MACE, a giant of a man, black, with a
text: once-white bandage round his large head, holding a patch over
text: one eye. He’s stuffing sacks with straw to make rough
text: mattresses, while NETTLE tries to light a stub of candle.
scene_heading: A CAPTION: NORTHERN FRANCE, 1940.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: .«+.So I says to him: “you can sit
dialog: round here twiddling your thumbs,
dialog: waiting to get your head blown off if
dialog: you want to, I’m off out of it”...
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Ssh.
text: He’s heard footsteps approaching the barn. NETTLE and MACE reach
text: for their rifles and ROBBIE takes out a revolver. Two figures
text: appear in the doorway, carrying something, possibly weapons,
text: it’s too dark to tell.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Bonsoir, Messieurs.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Bonsoir.
text: He whispers to the CORPORALS
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Let me do this.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Anglais? Belges?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Anglais.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: On a quelque chose pour vous.
dialog: (We have something for you.)
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Quoi?
dialog: (What?)
speaker_heading: MACE
dialog: What’s his game?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: He says he’s got something for us.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: Fucking hell.
text: The two FRENCHMEN take another step and ROBBIE and the CORPORALS
dialog: release their safety catches.
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Laissez vos armes!
dialog: (Put away your guns.)
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Vous aussi!
dialog: (Put away yours!)
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Attendez!
dialog: (Wait!)
text: One of the FRENCHMEN reaches in his pocket and brings out a
text: torch, which he uses to reveal that the two of them are carrying
text: loaves and bottles. The two FRENCHMEN are obviously brothers and
dialog: in their fifties.
speaker_heading: 1sT FRENCHMAN
dialog: Ou a du manger pour vous. Du pain, du
dialog: sucre...
dialog: (We have some food for you. Some
dialog: bread, some sugar.)
speaker_heading: 2ND FRENCHMAN
dialog: Et du vin!
dialog: (And some wine!)
speaker_heading: 1sT FRENCHMAN
dialog: Vive 1’Angleterre.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Er, Vive la France.
text: Later. The two FRENCHMEN sit in the loft with ROBBIE, MACE and
text: NETTLE, circulating the wine bottle.
speaker_heading: 2ND FRENCHMAN
dialog: Qu’est-ce que vous faites ici?
dialog: (What are you doing here?)
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Tout au commencement de la retraite,
dialog: il y avait un attaque de Panzers et
dialog: j'ai été séparé de ma section.
dialog: (When the retreat started, Panzers
dialog: attacked and I was separated from my
dialog: unit.)
speaker_heading: 1sT FRENCHMAN
dialog: Ah, c’est vrai, 1l’armée anglaise se
dialog: retire.
dialog: (So it’s true, the English are
dialog: retreating.)
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: On va disparaitre, avant qu’il fait
dialog: jour.
dialog: (We'll be gone at first light.)
speaker_heading: 1sT FRENCHMAN
dialog: On s’est battu toutes ces années, tant
dialog: de gens sont morts. Maintenant les
dialog: Allemands sont de nouveau en France.
dialog: (We fought all those years, lost all
text: those dead. Now the Germans are back
dialog: in France.)
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: On va revenir. On va les chasser.
dialog: C’est promis.
dialog: (We’ll come back. We’1ll throw them out.
dialog: I promise you.)
text: Later. Below, the FRENCHMEN smile and wave.
speaker_heading: 1sT FRENCHMAN
dialog: Bonne chance!
dialog: (Good luck!)
text: They disappear into the night. NETTLE turns to ROBBIE.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: Come on, then. How come a toff like
dialog: you, talks French and everything, ends
dialog: up a private?
text: ROBBIE hesitates, then decides to be forthcoming.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Not eligible for officer training if
dialog: you join direct from prison.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: You’re pulling my tit.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: No, I’m not: they gave me a choice,
dialog: stay in prison or join the army.
text: They’re looking at him with increased respect, as he adds,
dialog: quietly:
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: And, for the record, the last thing I
dialog: am is a toff.
text: He leans back against the wall, lost in thought.
dialog: 48.
scene_heading: INT. JOE LYONS CORNER HOUSE IN THE STRAND. DAY.
dialog: 
text: CUT BACK IN TIME.
text: ROBBIE, in uniform, looks through the glass separating the foyer
text: from the café and sees CECILIA, in her nurse’s uniform, sitting
text: at a table near the back. Suddenly overcome with nerves, he
text: turns away, facing the cloak-room, where he tries to get the
text: better of his fears. When he turns back, CECILIA, lit by a shaft
text: of sunlight, is standing by her table, looking at him. ROBBIE
text: pushes into the cafe and moves over to her. For a moment, they
text: stand in awkward silence.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I’m sorry I’m late, I got lost.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Hello.
text: A short silence.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Shall we sit down?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Yes, of course.
text: She’s already ordered tea and now she pours him a cup. Her hand
text: hesitates over the sugar bowl.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: I’m sorry. I’m afraid I can’t
dialog: remember...
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Two, thank you.
text: He begins stirring his tea; CECILIA puts a hand over his. A
text: moment passes, then he gently takes his hand away.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Where are you living?
speaker_heading: CECILIA
text: Tiny flat in Balham. It’s ghastly. The
text: landlady’s rude and horribly nosey.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: You look the same, apart from the
dialog: uniform of course.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: I have to be back at the hospital in
text: half an hour.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Oh, God, that’s...
text: He breaks off, mastering his dismay. Two OLD LADIES are
text: gossiping at a nearby table.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: No...Have you been in touch with your
dialog: family?
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: I’ve told you, I’m not going to. Leon
dialog: came and waited outside the hospital
dialog: last week. But I just pushed past him.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Cee, you don’t...owe me anything.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Didn’t you read my letters? Had they
dialog: let me visit you, had I been
dialog: allowed...every day...I’d have been
dialog: there every day.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Yes. But if all we have rests on a few
text: moments in the library three and a
dialog: half years ago, then I’m not sure...I
dialog: don’t know if...
text: CECILIA puts her hand on his.

dialog: Look at me.
text: He does so. He’s close to tears.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Come back. Come back to me.
text: She reaches out and puts a hand on his cheek; he inclines his
text: head, holding her hand between his cheek and his shoulder.
dialog: 50.
scene_heading: INT. BARN. NIGHT.
text: ROBBIE lies awake, hearing the snoring of the CORPORALS. A white
text: barn owl sits on an adjacent beam staring at ROBBIE, who’s
text: composing a letter in his mind.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE (V.O.)
dialog: Dearest Cecilia...
dialog: Dearest Cecilia...
dialog: Cecilia...
scene_heading: EXT. WHITEHALL. DAY.
text: CUT BACK IN TIME.
text: ROBBIE is walking CECILIA to the bus stop, through milling
text: crowds, many in uniform, past sandbags piled high in shop
dialog: entrances.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: A friend of mine has a cottage by the
dialog: coast; she says we can use it when
dialog: you’re next on leave. White clapboard
text: with blue painted window frames.
text: They look at each other; then he kisses her, a long, deep kiss.
text: CECILIA starts to cry. A bus pulls up beside them. CECILIA
text: hurriedly produces a photograph of the cottage and hands it to
speaker_heading: ROBBIE.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Something to think about while you’re
dialog: away.
text: She tears herself away and scrambles aboard the bus. She stands
text: on the platform, looking back at ROBBIE and the bus starts up
text: and moves away.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I love you.
text: ROBBIE starts to run after the bus, but soon it accelerates
text: away, leaving him marooned in the middle of the road, the
text: traffic passing either side of him.
dialog: 51.
scene_heading: EXT. BARN. DAWN.
text: ROBBIE sits outside the barn in the pearly dawn light. He’s
text: looking at the now somewhat battered photograph of the cottage
text: which is attached to a bundle of letters, which he now puts back
text: in an inside pocket. Then, checking to make sure he’s not being
text: watched, he opens his shirt to reveal, at his solar plexus, a
text: wound about the size of an old penny. It doesn’t look too bad,
text: just red and sore. But when he presses on it, he gasps in pain
text: and the wound releases a flow of colourless liquid.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELDS. DAWN.
text: The three soldiers move across a field, silhouetted against the
text: rising sun.
text: They move along the bank of a narrow canal, in which are
text: reflected the shapes of three German bombers, passing overhead.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: Some poor sod’s going to catch a
dialog: packet.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET IN BALHAM. DAY.
text: CUT BACK IN TIME.
text: CECILIA moves briskly down the street with a letter in her hand.
speaker_heading: CECILIA (V.O.)
dialog: My darling, Briony found my address
text: somehow and sent a letter. The first
dialog: surprise was she didn’t go up to
dialog: Cambridge. She’s doing nurse’s
dialog: training at my old hospital. I think
dialog: she may be doing this as some kind of
text: penance. She says she’s beginning to
dialog: get the full grasp of what she did and
dialog: what it meant. She wants to come and
dialog: talk to me.
text: She kisses the letter and posts it.
speaker_heading: CECILIA (V.O.)
dialog: I love you. I’1l wait for you.
dialog: 52.
scene_heading: INT. POSTBOX. DAY.
text: The letter falls on to the pile of other letters.
speaker_heading: CECILIA (V.O.)
dialog: Come back. Come back to me.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE (V.O.)
dialog: Come back.
scene_heading: EXT. APPLE ORCHARD. DAY.
text: ROBBIE, MACE and NETTLE move cautiously through a mist-shrouded
dialog: orchard.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE (V.O.)
dialog: Come back. Come back.
text: NETTLE, who's limping a little, comes to a ragged halt.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: Where are we going, guv?
text: He suddenly sits down on the ground and, with a cry of rage,
text: pulls off his boots and hurls them into the distance.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: I fucking hate those boots. I hate
dialog: them worse than all the fucking
dialog: Germans put together!
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: You'll have a job getting back to
dialog: England in your socks.
text: ROBBIE trudges off through the trees to retrieve NETTLE’s boots.
text: He approaches the area where he thinks NETTLE’s boots might have
text: fallen, a little out of sight of the CORPORALS, finds the boots,
text: picks them up, wearily removes his tin hat, mops his brow and
text: closes his red-rimmed eyes. When he opens his eyes again, he
text: notices something, frowns and advances a few paces.
text: In a clearing in the orchard, lying in neatly organised rows,
text: are the corpses of thirty GIRLS, all around 13, dressed in the
text: neat black and white uniform of a convent school.
text: ROBBIE looks down at them, appalled and moved.
dialog: 53.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER-BANK NEAR THE TALLIS HOUSE. DAY.
text: CUT BACK IN TIME.
text: There’s a natural pool not far from the weir in the river which
text: flows through the woods at the far end of the Tallis House
dialog: grounds.
text: ROBBIE finishes dressing, picks up a damp towel and emerges from
text: the trees to find BRIONY, still in her swimsuit, standing by the
text: jump-off point, wrapped in a towel.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Come on, pal. You should be getting
dialog: dressed.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: If I fell in the river, would you save
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Of course.
text: As ROBBIE bends down to do up his shoelace, there’s a loud
text: splash. He looks up. BRIONY has disappeared, her towel lies
text: where she stood. Horrified, ROBBIE moves forward to look down at
dialog: the river.
text: BRIONY surfaces for a second, then goes under again. She’s
text: drifting towards the weir. ROBBIE doesn’t hesitate. He dives
text: into the river.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER.
text: ROBBIE flounders around in the greenish murk. Then he sees a
text: flash of white and the bubbles rising round BRIONY’s flailing
text: limbs. He swims powerfully towards her.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER-BANK. DAY.
text: ROBBIE drops BRIONY in the shallow water near the bank and
text: strides ashore, furious. BRIONY, on the other hand, seems
dialog: delighted.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Thank you, thank you, thank you...
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: That was an incredibly bloody stupid
dialog: thing to do.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: I wanted you to save me.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Don’t you know how easily you could
dialog: have drowned?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: You saved me.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: You stupid child! You could have
dialog: killed us both! Is that your idea of a
dialog: joke?
text: She looks at him for a moment, shocked by his tone, but defiant
dialog: nonetheless.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: I want to thank you for saving my
dialog: life. I’ll be eternally grateful to
dialog: you.
text: He strides away angrily, into the woods, leaving BRIONY
text: disconsolate amidst the cow parsley.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER-BANK IN FRANCE. DAY.
text: ROBBIE leads MACE and NETTLE northwards beside a broad river.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE (V.O.)
dialog: The story can resume. Our story can
dialog: resume. I will simply resume.
text: NETTLE’s insistent voice breaks into his reverie.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: Let’s see Jerry come and have a go at
dialog: us in fucking Southend. Or, better
text: still, Trafalgar Square. No one speaks
dialog: the fucking lingo out here. You can’t
dialog: say “Pass the biscuit” or “Where’s me
text: hand grenade?” They just shrug.
dialog: Because they hate us too. I mean,
dialog: that’s the point. We fight in France
dialog: and the French fucking hate us. Make
dialog: me Home Secretary, I’1ll sort this out
dialog: in a fucking minute. We got India and
dialog: Africa, right? Jerry can have France
dialog: and Belgium and whatever else they
dialog: want. Who’s fucking ever been to
dialog: Poland? It’s all about room, empire.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: NETTLE (cont'd)
dialog: They want more empire. Give’em this
dialog: shithole, we keep ours, and it’s Bob’s
dialog: your uncle and Fanny’s your fucking
dialog: aunt. Think about it.
scene_heading: EXT. SLUICE. DUSK.
text: It’s late afternoon and the sun is low in the sky as ROBBIE and
text: the CORPORALS trudge past some kind of sluice which squats
text: across a broad canal. They’re approaching the outskirts of the
text: industrial quarter of Dunkirk, close enough now to see the huge
text: pall of black smoke rising above the town.
scene_heading: EXT. RAILWAY BRIDGE. NIGHT.
text: ROBBIE is trying to get some sleep under a stone railway bridge,
text: watched by an impassive bullfrog.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE (V.O.)
dialog: Dearest Cecilia, the story can resume.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH BELOW WHITE CLIFFS. DAY.
text: On a deserted shingle beach, beneath towering chalk cliffs,
text: CECILIA sits, looking out to sea towards France.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE (V.O.)
dialog: The one I had been planning on that
dialog: evening walk. I can become again the
dialog: man who once walked across a Surrey
dialog: park at dusk in my best suit,
text: swaggering on the promise of life; the
dialog: man who, with the clarity of passion,
dialog: made love to you in the library. The
dialog: story can resume.
scene_heading: EXT. INDUSTRIAL QUARTER. DAY.
text: The three soldiers tramp along between narrow-gauge railway
dialog: lines.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE (V.O.)
dialog: I will return. Find you, love you,
dialog: marry you, and live without shame.
dialog: 56.
text: A WIDE ANGLE reveals that ROBBIE, MACE and NETTLE are moving
text: past an enormous burning steelworks ringed with deep bomb
text: craters, with destroyed vehicles at precarious angles.
scene_heading: EXT. APPROACH TO BRAY DUNES. DAY.
text: ROBBIE and his companions move along a straight road between
text: patches of scrub grass, the industrial quarter now behind them.
text: Suddenly, ROBBIE raises his head.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I can smell the sea.
text: He sets off at a run, along a path cut through long grass, MACE
text: and NETTLE labouring behind.
scene_heading: EXT. BRAY DUNES. DAY.
text: ROBBIE scrambles up the final steep dune and stops. NETTLE and
text: MACE join him, their jaws dropping in amazement.
text: They are looking down at an astonishing scene. Beyond them, the
text: beach at Bray is teeming with SOLDIERS, hundreds of thousands of
text: men as far as the eye can see. The few ships there are, out on
text: the iron-grey Channel, are almost all capsized or ablaze; and,
text: most striking of all, what looks at first sight like a series of
text: jetties turns out to be columns of SOLDIERS, six or eight deep,
text: standing out to sea for almost five hundred yards in the shallow
text: waters, the closest submerged up to their knees, the furthest
text: obliged to hold their rifles up above their tin helmets to keep
text: them dry. The three MEN watch for a moment in silence, before
text: MACE gives out a heavy sigh.
speaker_heading: MACE
dialog: Fuck me, it’s like something out the
dialog: Bible.
text: For once, NETTLE is at a loss for words.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: Jesus Christ.
text: ROBBIE shakes his head as if to clear it.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH AT BRAY DUNES. DAY.
text: ROBBIE wanders with the others through what seems like a
text: hallucination.
dialog: 57.
text: Harnessed but riderless horses gallop across the sand. A whaler
text: with ragged black sails lies fifty yards from the sea. A
text: football game is in progress. A small group of men throw off
text: their clothes and splash into the sea for a swim. Another larger
text: group huddles in a bandstand, singing a hymn.
text: A chaplain and his clerk are throwing prayer books and bibles
text: into a bonfire; the thin pages catch and float into the air like
text: black snowflakes. A YOUNG SOLDIER of no more than 17 sits
text: quietly looking out to sea with tears streaming down his face.
text: ROBBIE approaches a group of NAVAL OFFICERS, as they stride down
text: the beach with a clipboard, trying to do a head-count. They keep
text: moving briskly throughout the conversation.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: We've just arrived, Sir. Can you tell
dialog: us what we’re supposed to do?
speaker_heading: NAVAL OFFICER
dialog: Nothing. Just wait.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Where are the ships?
speaker_heading: NAVAL OFFICER
dialog: A few made it in yesterday but the
dialog: Luftwaffe blew them to buggery. We
dialog: lost five hundred men when they sank
dialog: the Endurance. And high command in its
dialog: infinite wisdom is denying us air
dialog: cover. It’s a disgrace, it’s a fucking
dialog: disaster.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: The thing is, I’m expected back, you
dialog: see.
speaker_heading: NAVAL OFFICER
dialog: There’s over three hundred thousand
dialog: men on this beach, private. So you’1l
dialog: have to wait your turn. Just be
dialog: grateful that you’re not wounded,
dialog: we've had orders to leave the wounded
dialog: behind.
text: NETTLE pulls ROBBIE away, as the NAVAL OFFICER continues up the
dialog: beach.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: Come on, guv, never trust a sailor on
dialog: dry land. Best off out of it.
dialog: 58.
text: ROBBIE moves on, dazed, through crowds streaming across the
text: beach in opposite directions, past gutted and blazing vehicles.
text: From up ahead, the SOUND of a gunshot.
speaker_heading: MACE
dialog: That’s not right.
text: To one side is a detachment of French cavalry, each man
text: dismounted and standing to attention beside his horse. A FRENCH
text: OFFICER with a pistol moves slowly, almost ceremoniously, down
text: the line, shooting each horse in the head.
text: ROBBIE moves on, as another horse goes down in the background.
text: He rounds the back of the beached whaler where a deranged
text: SOLDIER is perched up on the mast, furiously waving and shouting
text: at the top of his voice.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Can you hear me, laddies? I’m coming
dialog: home.
text: The seafront, or what’s left of it was once a cheerful resort
text: with cafes and little shops. ROBBIE, MACE and NETTLE pass a
text: bandstand and merry-go-round decorated in red, white and blue.
text: Soldiers have opened up the cafes and a good portion of them are
text: raucously drunk. Some lark about on bikes. A solitary sunbather
text: in his underpants lies on a towel. A brawling couple rolls down
text: the bank on to the beach.
text: MACE climbs up on to the gazebo-shaped bandstand where a tight
text: knot of SOLDIERS is singing “Dear Lord and Father of Mankind”.
text: Then he catches up with ROBBIE and NETTLE as they plunge on
dialog: ahead.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Come on. I have to get something to
dialog: drink.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: You need one. You’re grey.
text: He turns to MACE.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
text: He’s gone all grey, look.
text: They move on past another group of SOLDIERS, disabling vehicles
text: with their rifle-butts. Then ROBBIE points ahead to where a
text: cinema sits, perched unexpectedly at the top of the beach.
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: There. Come on.
text: He scrambles up a wooden stairway and disappears into the
text: cinema, having taken one last appraising look out across the
text: raucous inferno of the beach.
scene_heading: INT. CINEMA BAR. DAY.
text: ROBBIE pushes his way through a tight crowd of SOLDIERS, who are
text: singing “The Long and the Short and the Tall” with the words
text: changed from “Bless’em all” to “Fuck’em all”. He can’t find
text: anything to drink, and, as a brawl starts up and bottles begin
text: to fly, he ducks through a door at the back.
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE AREA. DAY.
text: ROBBIE finds a tap on the wall in a kind of box-room, cluttered
text: with film cannisters; he tries it, but nothing comes out. In the
text: background, the SONG has changed to “The White Cliffs of Dover”,
text: but ROBBIE has heard, under this, the murmur of French dialogue
text: and he moves forward to investigate.
scene_heading: INT. CINEMA. DAY.
text: ROBBIE scrambles down a ladder and finds himself at the foot of
text: a giant screen where the huge face, full of doomed melancholy,
text: of Jean Gabin leans forward to kiss the shining lips of Michéle
text: Morgan in Quai des Brumes. As Gabin kisses her a second time,
text: ROBBIE, dwarfed by the enormous black-and-white image, buries
text: his face in his hands.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET IN BRAY. NIGHT.
text: ROBBIE wanders down a rubble-strewn street, between blazing
text: buildings and vehicles; NETTLE, accompanying him, cups his hands
text: around his mouth.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: Mace! Mace!
text: They turn a corner and NETTLE, demoralised, stops to light a
dialog: cigarette.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: Hold up, guv.
dialog: 60.
text: ROBBIE , looking listlessly around, sees an elderly FRENCHWOMAN
text: step into a shop with shattered windows. His interest abruptly
text: aroused, he speaks crisply to NETTLE.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Wait here.
text: He sets off into the shop, leaving a bemused NETTLE.
scene_heading: INT. SHOP. NIGHT.
text: ROBBIE moves into a kind of parlour off the main shop. He looks
text: around; he’s sweating now and very pale. Suddenly, a familiar
text: VOICE breaks into his reverie.
speaker_heading: GRACE (0.S.)
dialog: Why don’t you sit down?
text: ROBBIE turns to find the reassuring figure of GRACE, his mother,
text: standing in a doorway. Gratefully, he sinks into a chair.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: It’s so hot in here.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Take your boots off.
text: Later. GRACE is washing ROBBIE’s feet. They exchange a tender
dialog: smile.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I have to get back. I promised her. To
dialog: put things right. And she loves me.
dialog: She's waiting for me.
text: GRACE looks up at him, infinitely understanding. There’s a loud
text: explosion outside.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. NIGHT.
text: ROBBIE strides out of the shop, carrying bread and wine, no
text: longer wearing his boots. NETTLE, who’s sitting waiting, is
text: obliged to jump to his feet and hurry after him.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: Oi! Wait!
text: NETTLE catches up with ROBBIE.
dialog: él.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: What you done with your boots?
text: No answer. NETTLE circles ROBBIE, trying to get his attention.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: You sure you're feeling all right?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Never better.
text: He moves on, frowning in concentration.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Now, I’m wondering if the beach really
dialog: is the best place for dinner.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE STREET. NIGHT.
text: ROBBIE and NETTLE turn into a side street, as bombs explode
text: not far away, and the night is lit up by flashes of artillery.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I’m not sure, I don’t recognise it...
text: NETTLE follows, scrambling over rubble and bomb debris. He
text: indicates a dark opening.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: This’1l do. Down here.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: No, no, it’s a little further on.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: What is?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: This place I know, an old cottage,
text: white clapboard with blue painted
text: window frames.
text: NETTLE finally understands he’s delirious and decides to play
text: along with him, whilst manoeuvering him towards the entrance of
text: an abandoned ice factory.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: Oh, yes, that’s right, that’s where
dialog: we're going.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: It’s close to here.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: We’re there. This is it.
text: He succeeds in leading ROBBIE into the side entrance of the
dialog: factory.
scene_heading: INT. ICE FACTORY. NIGHT.
text: NETTLE guides ROBBIE between ranks of sleeping SOLDIERS,
text: arriving at a steel staircase leading down to a cellar.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: Here we are. Down here.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRCASE AND CELLAR. NIGHT.
text: ROBBIE descends the narrow staircase, NETTLE following. The
text: cellar is also crowded, but they reach an empty stretch of wall
text: and NETTLE starts to help ROBBIE off with his pack. As he does
text: so, ROBBIE more or less collapses.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: It’s all right, guv’nor.
text: He straightens ROBBIE out and drapes a thin blanket over him.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: That’s right. Get your head down.
dialog: There you go. Tuck yourself in. Keep
dialog: yourself warm.
text: NETTLE hands ROBBIE a chunk of bread.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: Chew on a bit of this but quiet like
dialog: or they’1l1 all be wanting some. And
dialog: try and get some sleep. Ssh.
text: Having calmed ROBBIE, NETTLE settles himself down facing him.
text: Darkness. Then a match flares. It’s ROBBIE: he has the bundle of
text: letters in his hand, and the photograph of the cottage on the
text: coast. SOUND of the sea. Slowly the match burns out.
speaker_heading: MONTAGE
text: Key moments from ROBBIE’s past, some familiar, some not, REPLAY,
text: some running backwards.
text: The fragment of Meissen flies back up out of the fountain and re-
text: attaches itself to the lip of the vase.
dialog: 63.
text: ROBBIE takes back the letter he’s handed to BRIONY.
text: The hammers of ROBBIE’s typewriter lift the ink from the page: T-
text: N-U-C, leaving clean white paper.
text: ROBBIE, alone, advances through a poppy-field in France, under a
text: blazing sun.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE (V.O.)
dialog: Find you, love you, marry you, and
dialog: live without shame.
text: The Dunkirk cinema is filled with SOLDIERS singing “The White
dialog: Cliffs of Dover.”
text: As Jean Gabin kisses Michéle Morgan, ROBBIE raises his face
text: from his hands.
text: A SLOW TRACKING SHOT finds CECILIA, in her green evening gown,
text: standing outside the Tallis House.
text: ROBBIE’s arrest, played backwards: he backs away from the car,
text: breaks away momentarily from the CONSTABLE escorting him.
text: CLOSE on CECILIA: She leans forward and whispers into ROBBIE’s
dialog: ear.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: I love you. Come back. Come back to
dialog: me.
scene_heading: INT. CELLAR. NIGHT.
text: ROBBIE comes awake with a start; NETTLE is gently shaking him.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: Bit too much noise, guv’nor.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Noise? What noise?
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: You keep shouting. Some of the lads
dialog: are getting a bit peeved.
text: ROBBIE tries to lift his head but can’t. NETTLE strikes a match.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: Christ. You look a bit rough.
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Thing is, I've decided to stay ona
dialog: bit. I’m meeting someone. I’m always
text: keeping her waiting.
text: NETTLE wipes the sweat off ROBBIE’S forehead; he begins to
text: speak, his voice soothing.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: Now listen, listen to me, guv’nor. I
dialog: went out for a Jimmy Riddle just now.
dialog: Guess what I saw? They’re getting
text: themselves sorted out down on the
text: beach. The boats are back and a geezer
text: from the Buffs is marching us down at
dialog: seven. We're away, we're off home,
dialog: mate! So get some more sleep and no
dialog: more of your bleeding shouting, all
dialog: right?
text: ROBBIE looks peaceful. He speaks in a cracked whisper:
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I won't say a word. Wake me before
dialog: seven, would you? Thanks so much. You
dialog: won't hear another word out of me. I
dialog: promise.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR AND WARD IN ST.THOMAS'S HOSPITAL. DAY.
text: A broad, empty hospital corridor, simonized to an improbable
dialog: gloss.
text: A CAPTION: LONDON, THREE WEEKS EARLIER.
text: The SOUND of rapid, regular steps at the far end of the
text: corridor. Then they appear, a group of PROBATIONARY NURSES
text: following a WARD SISTER, like ducklings after their mother.
text: At the back of the group is BRIONY TALLIS, now eighteen,
text: dressed, like the others, in the constricting purple and white
text: tunic of a probationer.
text: SISTER DRUMMOND, a woman in her thirties with a narrow mouth and
text: a quiet but lethal delivery, and her NURSES sweep into a long
text: ward with high ceilings and windows.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: DRUMMOND
dialog: Bed castors should be lined up and
text: pointing inwards. I found three
dialog: yesterday that weren’t. You know who
dialog: you are.
text: They keep walking, moving fast.
speaker_heading: DRUMMOND
dialog: Which of you was responsible for
dialog: putting away the blankets today?
text: An amiable-looking nurse, FIONA AVERY, pipes up apprehensively.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: I was, Sister.
speaker_heading: DRUMMOND
dialog: I don’t suppose you can tell us what
dialog: you did wrong.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: No, Sister.
speaker_heading: DRUMMOND
text: Labels are folded to the inside, are
dialog: they not?
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Oh, yes, Sister, sorry, Sister.
speaker_heading: DRUMMOND
dialog: Do them again. Nurse Tallis, I'll see
dialog: you in my office. The rest of you are
dialog: excused.
text: BRIONY follows SISTER DRUMMOND towards her office.
scene_heading: INT. SISTER'S OFFICE. DAY.
text: BRIONY stands across from SISTER DRUMMOND, who sits at her desk.
speaker_heading: DRUMMOND
dialog: Is this job at all important to you,
dialog: Tallis?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Very important, Sister.
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: DRUMMOND
dialog: Yesterday you were seconded to men’s
dialog: surgical. When your patient came round
text: from his anaesthetic, it seems the
dialog: first thing he did was to ask for
dialog: Briony. Who might Briony be?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Well, me, Sister.
text: SISTER DRUMMOND suddenly draws herself up and shouts at BRIONY.
speaker_heading: DRUMMOND
dialog: There is no Briony! You are Tallis.
dialog: Nurse Tallis. Is that understood?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Yes, Sister.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR. NIGHT
text: BRIONY stands at a window at the end of a long corridor looking
text: out at a view of the Thames and Parliament beyond. The sun is
text: setting. Her focus shifts to her own reflection which she
text: studies impassively for a moment.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
text: There is no Briony.
text: She turns from the window and walks away down the corridor,
text: past people putting up the blackout shutters. Over this, the
text: VOICE of a RADIO NEWSREADER.
speaker_heading: NEWSREADER (V.O.)
dialog: This is the B.B.C Home Service. Here
text: is the news. The B.E.F., with their
dialog: French allies, are fighting a
text: desperate battle in the Northern Zone
dialog: of the Western Front. The Allied
dialog: Forces have not lost cohesion and
text: their morale is high. The R.A.F.
dialog: continues to give all the support in
dialog: its power to the Allied armies in
dialog: Northern France...
scene_heading: INT. NURSES’ DORMITORY. NIGHT.
text: The CAMERA moves slowly through the 20-bed dormitory, taking in
text: jars of cosmetics, overflowing ashtrays and tennis racquets. In
text: the corridor a NURSE stands at the wall-mounted telephone
text: talking to each one of her family in turn.
dialog: 67.
text: Back in the dormitory, NURSES are putting in curlers, writing
text: letters, crying gently on one another’s shoulder, dancing to a
text: Flanagan and Allen record. Finally, we arrive at BRIONY, who is
text: trimming the nails on FIONA’S right hand.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Thanks, I never could make the
text: scissors work with my left hand. Mummy
dialog: always did it for me.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: There. You’re done.
text: She turns to her bedside locker, in which is the small portable
dialog: typewriter she used as a child.
text: Somebody shouts “Lights out!” And the lights go out.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Oh, bother.
text: BRIONY lies back on her bed.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Good night, Tallis.
scene_heading: INT. WATER TANK ROOM. ST. THOMAS’ HOSPITAL. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The water tank room is high in a tower above the hospital. The
text: SOUND of someone typing. BRIONY is perched on a step, among the
text: pipes and tanks, typing furiously. Beside her, a small pile of
dialog: paper.
text: A noise at the bottom of the stairs. BRIONY is startled.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Don’t panic. It’s only me.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Fiona! I almost jumped out of my skin!
text: FIONA climbs up. She’s wearing her dressing gown. She sits and
text: fishes for a cigarette.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: So this is what you get up to after
dialog: lights out. I thought you might be in
text: the middle of some tempestuous
dialog: romance.
text: She shivers.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Don’t you freeze to death up here?
text: She moves to look out of the window.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: I love London. Do you think all of
dialog: this will be bombed and just
dialog: disappear?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: No. I don’t know.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Do you write about Sister Drummond? Do
dialog: you write about me?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Sometimes.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Can I look?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: I'd rather you didn’t. It’s private.
text: She puts out a hand to cover the title page, which reads: Two
dialog: 
text: Figures By a Fountain by Briony Tallis.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: I don’t see any point in writing a
dialog: story if you're not going to let
dialog: anyone read it.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: It’s not ready yet.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: What’s it about ?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: It’s just...it’s about a young girl, a
text: young and foolish girl, who sees
dialog: something from her nursery window
text: which she doesn’t understand, but she
dialog: thinks she does...I probably won't
dialog: ever finish it.
text: FIONA considers BRIONY for a moment.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: I look at you, Tallis, and you’re so
dialog: mysterious.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: FIONA (cont'd)
dialog: I’ve never been mysterious. Do you
dialog: know what I decided tonight?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: I could never marry a man who wasn’t
dialog: in the Royal Navy.
text: BRIONY thinks about this, then bursts out laughing. FIONA
text: shushes her, giggling helplessly herself.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATION OFFICE. DAY
text: A sympathetic-looking ASSISTANT with an index-card in her hand
text: turns to speak to BRIONY, who’s in uniform, waiting on the other
text: side of the counter.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: Here we are, Cecilia Tallis, I think
dialog: this is her address.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Thank you.
scene_heading: INT. WARD. NIGHT.
text: BRIONY, on night duty, sits at her table studying textbooks.
speaker_heading: BRIONY (V.O.)
dialog: Dear Cecilia, Please don’t throw this
dialog: away without reading it. As you’1ll
dialog: have seen from the notepaper, I’m here
dialog: at St. Thomas's, doing my nurses’
dialog: training.
scene_heading: INT. SLUICE ROOM. DAY.
text: BRIONY, in a heavy rubber apron, sluices a bedpan, looking away,
text: holding her breath.
speaker_heading: BRIONY (V.O.)
dialog: I decided not to take up my place at
dialog: Cambridge. I decided I wanted to make
dialog: myself useful, do something practical.
dialog: 70.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. DAY.
text: BRIONY and FIONA are polishing the floors using a heavy bumper
text: that they can hardly move from side to side.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: It says in the paper the army are
dialog: making strategic withdrawals.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: I saw that. It’s a euphemism for
dialog: retreat.
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL YARD. DAY.
text: BRIONY works alongside a number of other PROBATIONERS, on her
text: knees in the centre of the yard, scrubbing the frame of one of a
text: number of filthy old beds.
speaker_heading: BRIONY (V.O.)
dialog: But no matter how hard I work, no
dialog: matter how long the hours, I can’t
dialog: escape from what I did...
scene_heading: INT. WASH ROOM. NIGHT.
text: BRIONY stands at the only (cold) tap, fiercely scrubbing her
text: hands with a scrubbing-brush and baking soda. Her hands are red-
text: raw, cracked and marked with chilblains.
speaker_heading: BRIONY (V.O.)
dialog: ...and what it meant, the full extent
dialog: of which I’m only now beginning to
dialog: grasp. Cee, please write and tell me
dialog: we can meet. Your sister, Briony.
scene_heading: INT. STORE ROOM. DAY.
text: BRIONY works in a corner near the doorway, with FIONA. From
text: time to time PORTERS arrive with trolleys and leave piles of
text: boxes outside in the corridor. Other NURSES unpack and stack
text: kidney bowls and packs of hypodermics.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: So do you?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Do I what?
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Have a secret fiance in France? That’s
dialog: what everybody thinks.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: No. Of course not.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Imagine not knowing if he’d ever come
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: I’ve never been in love.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: What never? Not even a crush?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: I had a crush once, when I was ten or
dialog: eleven. I jumped in the river to see
dialog: if he’d save me from drowning.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Now you’re teasing me.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: No. And he did save me. But as soon as
dialog: I told him I loved him the feeling
dialog: sort of disappeared.
text: Outside in the corridor, there’s a commotion. People are running
text: past. Another PROBATIONARY NURSE sticks her head through the
dialog: doorway.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Something's happened.
text: BRIONY and FIONA put down the boxes they’re stacking and run out
text: into the corridor, where everyone is running towards the exit.
scene_heading: EXT. ENTRANCE TO ST. THOMAS’S HOSPITAL. DAY.
dialog: 
text: As BRIONY and FIONA arrive, out of breath, bloody and wounded
text: SOLDIERS are being unloaded from the lorries and ambulances.
text: Many of them are black with oil, coated in grime and dazed with
text: exhaustion. BRIONY has scarcely arrived, when a young REGISTRAR
text: barks at her.
speaker_heading: REGISTRAR
dialog: You! Get on the end of this stretcher!
dialog: 72.
text: He turns away from her and picks up the stretcher, handles
text: behind him, so that he doesn’t see the vast effort it costs
text: BRIONY to lift her end. The PATIENT is a large SERGEANT, his
text: bare feet and filthy bluish toes directly below BRIONY’s face,
text: his thigh disfigured by an ugly wound. BRIONY struggles forward,
text: each step plainly an agony for her and, even more distressingly,
text: for the SERGEANT.
scene_heading: INT. SECOND FLOOR. CORRIDOR. DAY.
text: The lift doors slam open and the REGISTRAR emerges carrying the
text: stretcher. BRIONY is struggling desperately along behind the
text: REGISTRAR, her teeth gritted, her face puce with effort. The
text: PATIENT utters a fearsome groan. Tears begin to roll down
text: BRIONY’s cheeks as she gasps with effort, the fingers of her
text: left hand begin inexorably to unravel. She hangs on grimly until
text: they turn into the ward.
scene_heading: INT. WARD. DAY.
text: A NURSE and a SISTER wait by an emergency bed in a ward now
text: crammed with extra beds. The REGISTRAR and BRIONY arrive
text: alongside and stop. BRIONY’s left hand gives way and she’s
text: obliged to catch the stretcher on her knee. This causes an
text: anguished gasp from the PATIENT. The REGISTRAR glares at her.
text: BRIONY turns and hurries away, glancing surreptitiously at her
text: red and dented left hand.
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. DAY.
text: BRIONY emerges into a scene of escalating chaos as more and more
text: field ambulances arrive and dozens of wounded soldiers mill
text: about hopelessly or sit waiting on the pavement.
speaker_heading: 1ST SOLDIER
text: Fucking shambles.
speaker_heading: 2ND SOLDIER
dialog: Turner! Private Turner?
text: BRIONY spins on her heels. There is a slight man, his face
text: filthy and black with oil. It is ROBBIE.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Robbie? Robbie!
text: ROBBIE turns away. BRIONY rushes to him, puts a hand on his arm
text: and turns him forcibly. The man is not ROBBIE.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Excuse me.
scene_heading: INT. BRIONY’S WARD. DAY INTO NIGHT
text: A MONTAGE of BRIONY’s work against a background of ceaseless
text: activity in the rest of the ward. BRIONY helps lift a man whose
text: leg has been amputated back on to his bed.
text: BRIONY swabs the oil from a long, stitched wound down a man’s
dialog: back.
text: BRIONY leans forward, puts one hand on an AIRMAN’s leg, grips
text: the end of a protruding piece of shrapnel with the forceps and
text: pulls it out, firmly and smoothly.
text: BRIONY rips a dressing off a man’s chest, causing him to cry out
text: and vomit.
text: BRIONY joins a group of NURSES around the bed of a young man
text: whose body is entirely covered in savage oil burns.
text: Outside in the hallway, FIONA, overcome, turns towards the wall
text: and weeps.
scene_heading: INT. WARD. NIGHT.
text: BRIONY moves between rows of sleeping patients, checking them.
text: She’s intercepted by SISTER DRUMMOND.
speaker_heading: DRUMMOND
dialog: You speak a little French, if I
dialog: remember rightly.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Only school French, Sister.
speaker_heading: DRUMMOND
dialog: The soldier over there in bed 13. Go
dialog: and sit with him for a minute. Hold
text: his hand.
text: BRIONY hesitates, looking over towards the soldier.
speaker_heading: DRUMMOND
dialog: Off you go.
text: BRIONY slowly moves down the length of the ward, full of
text: apprehension. Bed 13 is surrounded by screens. Inside the
text: screens is the patient, LUC CORNET, his head heavily bandaged.
dialog: 74.
text: He’s asleep. BRIONY sits by the bed and hesitantly takes his
text: hand. He turns to her.
speaker_heading: CORNET
dialog: Te voila, enfin.
dialog: (Here you are, at last.)
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: La soeur m’a envoyée. Pour bavarder un
dialog: peu.
dialog: (The Sister sent me. For a little
dialog: chat.)
speaker_heading: CORNET
dialog: Ah, oui, je me souviens de ta soeur.
dialog: Elle était toujours trés gentille.
dialog: Qu’est-ce qu’elle fait maintenant?
dialog: (Oh, yes, I remember your sister. She
dialog: was always so nice. What’s she doing
dialog: now?)
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Erm, elle est aussi infirmiére.
dialog: (She’s a nurse as well.)
speaker_heading: CORNET
dialog: Est-ce qu’elle s’est mariée enfin avec
dialog: cet homme qu’elle aimait tant? J’ai
dialog: oublié son nom.
dialog: (Did she finally marry that man she
dialog: was so in love with? I’ve forgotten
dialog: his name.)
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Er, Robbie. Bientét, j’espére.
dialog: (She will soon, I hope.)
speaker_heading: CORNET
dialog: Robbie, oui, c’est ga.
dialog: (Robbie, yes, that’s right.)
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Et vous, comment vous appellez-vous?
dialog: (And what’‘s your name?)
speaker_heading: CORNET
dialog: Luc. Luc Cornet. Et toi?
text: BRIONY hesitates.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Tallis.
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: CORNET
dialog: Tallis. C’est joli.
dialog: (That’‘s pretty.)
text: A spasm of pain or bewilderment crosses his face. He grips her
text: hand tightly and looks at her, frowning.
speaker_heading: CORNET
dialog: Je me rappelle de toi maintenant.
dialog: C’est 1’Anglaise. Tu te souviens, ta
dialog: premiére visite a Millau? Je
dialog: travaillais avec mon pére prés des
dialog: fours. J'ai entendu ton accent.
dialog: (I remember you now. You’re the
dialog: English girl. You remember your first
dialog: visit to Millau? I was working by the
dialog: ovens with my father. I heard your
dialog: accent.)
text: BRIONY looks at him, moved by his confusion.
speaker_heading: CORNET
dialog: Tu peux me rendre un tout petit
dialog: service, Tallis?
dialog: (Can you do me a little favour?)
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Bien sfr.
dialog: (Of course.)
speaker_heading: CORNET
dialog: Ce bandage me serre terriblement. Tu
dialog: peux le desserrer un peu? S‘il te
dialog: plait.
dialog: (These bandages are so tight. Can you
dialog: loosen them a bit? Please.)
text: BRIONY stands to look down at the bandage. It’s secured by a
text: pair of simple gauze bows. She begins to undo them.
speaker_heading: CORNET
dialog: Tu te souviens de ma soeur cadette,
dialog: Anne? Elle joue toujours ce petit
dialog: morceau de Debussy. Tu te souviens?
dialog: (You remember my younger sister, Anne?
dialog: She still plays that little Debussy
dialog: piece. Do you remember?)
text: He starts to hum the tune. BRIONY continues to unwind the
text: bandages.
speaker_heading: CORNET
dialog: Elle prend toujours une mine si grave
dialog: quand elle joue, tu ne trouves pas?
dialog: (She always looks so serious when she
dialog: plays, you know?)
text: All of a sudden, the sterile towel underneath the bandage slides
text: away, taking most of the bloodstained dressing with it. A
text: section of CORNET’s skull is missing and BRIONY finds herself
text: looking directly down at his brain.
speaker_heading: CORNET
dialog: Et nos croissants? Qu’est-ce que tu en
dialog: pensais?
dialog: (What about our croissants? What did
dialog: you think of them?)
text: Methodically, not panicking, BRIONY starts to replace the
dialog: dressing.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Délicieux. Les plus délicieux a
dialog: Millau.
dialog: (Delicious. The most delicious in
dialog: Millau.)
speaker_heading: CORNET
dialog: Oui, c’est la qualité du beurre.
dialog: (Yes, it’s the quality of the butter.)
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Oui.
dialog: (Yes.)
speaker_heading: CORNET
dialog: C’est pour ga que tu venais tous les
dialog: jours?
dialog: (Is that why you came every day?)
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Oui, bien sar.
dialog: (Yes, of course.)
text: CORNET thinks for a moment. Meanwhile, with infinite care,
text: BRIONY is replacing the sterile towel.
speaker_heading: CORNET
dialog: Parce que, tu sais... Ma mére t’aime
dialog: beaucoup.
dialog: (Because, you know...my mother is very
dialog: fond of you.)
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Ah, bon?
dialog: (Oh, yes?)
speaker_heading: CORNET
dialog: Oui. A son avis, on devrait se marier
dialog: pendant 1’été.
dialog: (Yes. In her opinion we should get
dialog: married in the summer.)
text: BRIONY falters in her work, but recovers. She’s tying the bows
text: of the bandage.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: C’est plus confortable comme ga,
dialog: j’éspére.
dialog: (I hope that’s more comfortable. )
speaker_heading: CORNET
dialog: Tu m’aimes?
dialog: (Do you love me?)
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Oui.
dialog: (Yes.)
text: She’s spoken without hesitation. He’s broken into a light sweat,
text: and she leans forward to wipe his face tenderly. He looks up at
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: CORNET
dialog: Tu peux rester un peu?
dialog: (Can you stay a while?)
text: BRIONY nods reassuringly. All of a sudden, it’s as if an
text: electric current has passed through him. He jerks upright and
text: begins to topple forward. BRIONY catches him and his head slumps
text: forward, banging against her cheek. It’s all she can do to get
text: him back to his previous position in the bed. She’s settling
text: him, her face close to his, when his eyes flutter open. A tear
text: rolls down his cheek.
speaker_heading: CORNET
dialog: J'ai peur. J'ai peur. Tallis.
dialog: (I'm frightened. I’m frightened,
dialog: Tallis.)
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Briony. Je m‘appelle Briony.
dialog: (My name is Briony.)
text: She’s suddenly aware of SISTER DRUMMOND standing above her. She
text: speaks with her habitual sinister softness.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: DRUMMOND
dialog: Stand up, Nurse Tallis.
text: BRIONY does, bracing herself for an onslaught which doesn’t
text: come. Instead, DRUMMOND reaches out to straighten BRIONY’S
text: collar. Behind her, a NURSE covers LUC CORNET’S face with the
text: sheet. Finally, DRUMMOND speaks, an unprecedented note of
text: tenderness in her voice.
speaker_heading: DRUMMOND
dialog: Now go and wash the blood off your
dialog: face.
text: Numbly, BRIONY turns away and sets off down the centre of the
text: silent, darkened ward.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL DAY ROOM. DAY.
text: Open on full-screen newsreel footage: the return of the BEF from
text: France. The newsreel is being shown on a makeshift screen in the
text: day room, where it is being watched with various degrees of
text: disbelief and disgust by those of the patients well enough to be
text: up and about. In total contrast to everything we've seen in the
text: hospital and at Dunkirk, what’s shown tells of a heroic rescue
text: and a triumphant return. We see the troops offering smiling
text: faces and giving the thumbs-up as train carriages roll into
text: London. We see Union Jacks waving, and happy wives and children.
speaker_heading: NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
dialog: The navy has earned our undying
text: gratitude. The army is undefeated.
dialog: Courage has brought them through
text: unconquered, their spirit unbowed.
dialog: This is the epic of Dunkirk, a name

text: BRIONY stands at the back, watching this propaganda. The next

speaker_heading: FRONT.
speaker_heading: NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
text: In the course of a comprehensive tour,

text: On the screen the Queen is being given a tour of the ARMY AMO
text: factory. BRIONY begins to collect her things to leave. Suddenly
text: her attention is caught, as there, on the screen, she sees LOLA
text: QUINCEY and PAUL MARSHALL shaking hands with the Queen.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: NEWS REPORTER
dialog: The confectionery magnate, and friend
dialog: of the British Army, Mr. Paul
dialog: Marshall, gave the Queen a tour of the
dialog: Army Amo factory with his lovely soon-
text: to-be-wed fiancee Miss Lola Quincey.
dialog: And what a mouthwatering couple they
dialog: are. Keep the Amo coming, our boys
dialog: have a sweet tooth!
text: LOLA looks at the camera and smiles, as if straight at BRIONY.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH OF THE HOLY TRINITY, CLAPHAM. DAY.
text: The church stands at the end of a street of terraced houses, an
text: imposing facade behind pillars and a flight of steps. BRIONY
text: approaches, moving up the street, taking note of an empty black
text: Rolls Royce parked outside the church. She hesitantly climbs the
text: steps towards the church door.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH OF THE HOLY TRINITY. DAY.
text: The wedding is already in progress, as BRIONY quietly lets
text: herself into the church.
text: There are a large number of GUESTS. PIERROT and JACKSON, now
text: fourteen, stand between their estranged parents, HERMIONE and
text: CECIL. On the other side are the many GUESTS of MARSHALL. LOLA,
text: in full bridal white and heavily veiled, and MARSHALL in a
text: morning suit, face the VICAR, who is in full flow.
text: BRIONY slips into a pew at the back and watches.

scene_heading: INSPECTOR.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BRIONY (V.O.)
dialog: I saw him.
text: BRIONY sits in her seat, an appalling knowledge dawning.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: VICAR
dialog: Therefore if any man can show any just
dialog: cause, why they may not be lawfully
dialog: joined together, let him now speak, or
dialog: for ever hold his peace.

scene_heading: EXT. GRASSY BANK NEAR THE TALLIS HOUSE. NIGHT. 1935.
dialog: 
text: This time it’s clear that the figure scrambling away up the bank

scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY. NIGHT.
text: YOUNG BRIONY faces the INSPECTOR.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: I saw him, I saw him with my own eyes.
text: The church organ thunders on.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH OF THE HOLY TRINITY. DAY. 1940.
dialog: 
text: BRIONY stands in her pew as LOLA and MARSHALL walk towards her.
text: They don’t notice her until the VICAR swings open one of the
text: great doors of the church. A shaft of sunlight sweeps across,
text: shining straight on BRIONY. She stares at LOLA and MARSHALL as
text: they draw level with her. LOLA’S eyes meet with BRIONY’S, her
text: forehead crinkles with displeasure, her lips purse. MARSHALL’S
text: face reddens and then they are gone.
text: BRIONY is left alone in the church.
dialog: 81.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET NEAR BALHAM. DAY.
text: BRIONY passes down a narrow terrace of red-brick houses. Coming
text: towards her is a MOTHER with four unruly BOYS, all carrying
text: cardboard suitcases and knapsacks.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Leave off, let the nursey through!
text: The BOYS take no notice of her whatsoever, and BRIONY is obliged
text: to stand aside to let them pass. The MOTHER smiles at her
text: apologetically.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: They’re going down to the country
dialog: today. Never been out of London
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: I hope they get a nice family.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: They dunno what they’re in for with
dialog: this lot!
scene_heading: EXT. DUDLEY VILLAS IN BALHAM. DAY.
text: BRIONY walks down the long, drab street and stops at no.43,
text: outside which is an old Ford 8 without wheels, supported on
text: piles of brick. She walks down the front path, rings the
text: doorbell and then, realizing it doesn’t work, uses the heavy
text: knocker to knock twice. The door is opened by a sour-faced
text: woman in her thirties, MRS. JARVIS.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: I’m looking for Miss Tallis. Cecilia
dialog: Tallis. Is she in?
text: MRS.JARVIS turns and yells up the stairs.
speaker_heading: MRS. JARVIS
dialog: Tallis! Door!
text: Eventually, CECILIA appears in the doorway. She’s wearing a blue
text: striped dressing-gown and men’s socks.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: My God.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: I tried writing, but you wouldn’t
dialog: answer. I have to talk to you.
scene_heading: INT. CECILIA'S FLAT. DAY.
text: CECILIA leads BRIONY to her tiny kitchen/living room. Everything
text: - furniture, lino, wallpaper - is cheap and shabby. There’s a
text: small table covered by a gingham cloth, a few books
text: (Shakespeare, Gray’s Anatomy), an overflowing ashtray and a jam
text: jar containing a bunch of harebells. The door to the bedroom is
dialog: closed.
text: CECILIA is lighting a cigarette as BRIONY advances tentatively
text: into the flat. She sees CECILIA’s uniform hanging behind the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: So you’re a ward sister now?
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Yes.
text: CECILIA forces herself to offer BRIONY a cigarette.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Thanks.
text: BRIONY launches abruptly into what she’s come to say.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: I want to go in front of a judge and
dialog: change my evidence, Cee.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Don’t call me that!
text: She turns away, trying to control herself.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Please don’t ever call me that.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: What I did was terrible, I don’t
dialog: expect you to forgive me.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Don’t worry, I won’t.
text: She turns away again.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: You’re an unreliable witness, they'd
dialog: never re-open the case.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Well at least I can tell everyone
dialog: else, I‘ll go home, explain to Mummy
dialog: and Daddy and...
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: What’s stopping you?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: I wanted to see you first.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: They don’t want to know. That
text: unpleasantness is all tidied away in
dialog: the past, thank you very much.
text: BRIONY starts: the bedroom door has opened and ROBBIE stands in
text: front of them, in his uniform shirt and trousers. His shirt is
text: open revealing a square bandage taped over the wound at his
text: solar plexus. BRIONY is partly obscured from ROBBIE’s view by
text: CECILIA who has turned to him. He talks quietly to CECILIA
text: without focusing on BRIONY, then briefly nods in her direction.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Excuse me.
text: Then he’s gone again. Silence.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
text: He sleeps so deeply.
text: BRIONY holds onto the table for support. In silence CECILIA
text: begins to move around the kitchen area of the room. She fills a
text: kettle. Mixes milk and water to egg powder and lays a pot of jam
text: and three plates and cups on the table. Finally they hear the
text: click of the bathroom door and ROBBIE whistling as he crosses
text: the landing. BRIONY moves as far away from the door as possible.
text: She’s in his sight line as ROBBIE opens the door. He sees her.
text: He can’t even address her.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: What is she doing here?
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: She came to speak to me.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Oh, yes? What about?
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: The terrible thing I did.
text: ROBBIE moves around the room, putting his hands in his pockets,
text: taking them out again. It’s clear he’s furious, hardly able to
dialog: contain himself.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I’ll be quite honest with you. I’m
dialog: torn between breaking your neck here
dialog: and throwing you down the stairs.
text: BRIONY stands her ground, shaken but not afraid.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Have you any idea what it’s like in
dialog: jail? Course you don’t. Tell me, did
dialog: it give you pleasure to think of me
dialog: inside?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: But you did nothing about it.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Do you think I assaulted your cousin?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Did you think it then?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Yes, yes and no. I wasn’t certain.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: And what’s made you so certain now?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Growing up.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Growing up?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: I was thirteen.
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: How old do you have to be before you
dialog: know the difference between right and
dialog: wrong? Do you have to be eighteen
dialog: before you can own up to a lie? There
dialog: are soldiers of eighteen old enough to
dialog: be left to die on the side of the
dialog: road! Did you know that?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Five years ago you didn’t care about
dialog: telling the truth. You and all your
dialog: family, you just assumed that for all
dialog: my education, I was still little
dialog: better than a servant, still not to be
dialog: trusted. Thanks to you, they were able
dialog: to close ranks and throw me to the
dialog: fucking wolves.
text: BRIONY shakes her head. ROBBIE clenches his fist, looks as if
text: might attack her. BRIONY prepares herself, flinching. But
text: CECILIA intervenes, holding on to him, calming him.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Robbie. Robbie, don’t. Please. Look
dialog: at me, Robbie. Look at me.
text: She kisses him gently and lingeringly on the lips. BRIONY looks
text: away, something like shame in her eyes. We stay on BRIONY’s
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: CECILIA (0.S.)
dialog: Come back, come back, come back to me.
text: BRIONY looks out of the window. ROBBIE and CECILIA are now
text: talking in low voices as BRIONY watches an OLD WOMAN outside in
text: the street below, pushing a pram.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Briony.
text: BRIONY turns.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
text: There isn’t much time. Robbie has to
dialog: report for duty at six and he’s got a
dialog: train to catch. So sit down. There are
dialog: some things you’re going to do for us.
text: BRIONY and CECILIA sit in the kitchen. ROBBIE leans on the
text: table, looming over them.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: You'll go to your parents as soon as
dialog: you can and tell them everything they
dialog: need to know to be convinced that your
dialog: evidence was false. You’1ll go and see
dialog: a solicitor and make a statement and
dialog: have it signed and witnessed and send
dialog: copies to us. Is that clear?
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Then you'll write a detailed letter to
dialog: me, explaining everything that led up
dialog: to you saying you saw me by the lake.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Try and include whatever you can
dialog: remember of what Danny Hardman was
dialog: doing that night.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
text: It wasn’t Danny Hardman. It was Leon’s
dialog: friend, Marshall.
text: They both look at her, astonished.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: I don’t believe you.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: He’s married Lola; I’ve just come from
dialog: their wedding.
text: Silence. Finally, ROBBIE exhales the breath he’s been holding,
text: CECILIA looks across at him.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Lola won't be able to testify against
text: him now. He’s immune.
text: ROBBIE straightens up and turns away, grappling with a riot of
text: emotions. Silence. Finally, BRIONY stands up and speaks, very
dialog: 87.
dialog: formal.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: I’m very, very sorry to have caused
dialog: you all this terrible distress. I am
dialog: very, very sorry.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Just do what we’ve asked of you. Write
dialog: it all down.
speaker_heading: BRIONY
dialog: I will. I promise.
text: She leaves abruptly, her eyes brimming with tears.
scene_heading: EXT. DUDLEY VILLAS. DAY.
text: In the window, CECILIA and ROBBIE are locked in a tender
dialog: embrace.
text: Below in the street, BRIONY turns away and sets off into the
dialog: distance.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND TRAIN.
text: BRIONY sits on a busy train staring straight ahead, trying to
dialog: take in all that’s happened, all she’s learnt. Trying not to
text: cry. The lights flicker on and off, taking us finally to black.
text: OVER THIS, the tired VOICE of OLDER BRIONY.
speaker_heading: OLDER BRIONY (V.O.)
dialog: I’m sorry, could we stop for a minute?
scene_heading: INT. TV CONTROL ROOM. DAY. 1999.
text: Seen on dozens of monitors, BRIONY TALLIS, 76 now, has
text: interrupted an interview she’s giving for television. Leaning
text: forward, she unhooks her radio mike.
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER
dialog: Of course. Is anything wrong?
speaker_heading: OLDER BRIONY
dialog: I just need a couple of minutes to
dialog: myself.
text: The VIDEOTAPE rewinds and we’re back to earlier in the
dialog: interview.
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER
dialog: Your new novel, your twenty-first, is
dialog: called Atonement; it’s a period piece
dialog: set before and during the Second World
dialog: War...
text: He breaks off, concerned, as OLDER BRIONY buries her face in her
dialog: hands.
text: INT.
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER
dialog: Briony?
scene_heading: BATHROOM. DAY.
text: Alone, OLDER BRIONY grimaces at her over-made-up face in the
text: mirror, pours three aspirin into her hand and washes them down.
text: Then she lowers her head and closes her eyes.
text: INT.
scene_heading: TV STUDIO. DAY.
text: The interview has resumed.
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER
dialog: I'd like to talk now about your new
text: novel, Atonement, which is coming out
dialog: in a few days to coincide with your
dialog: birthday. It’s your twenty-first
dialog: novel...
text: CLOSE on BRIONY, her face against black: where we will remain
text: for the rest of her interview.
speaker_heading: OLDER BRIONY
dialog: It’s my last novel.
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER
dialog: Oh, really? You mean you're retiring?
text: OLDER BRIONY contemplates him calmly for a moment.
speaker_heading: OLDER BRIONY
dialog: No, dying.
text: Before the INTERVIEWER is quite able to reassemble his thoughts,
dialog: she resumes:
speaker_heading: OLDER BRIONY
dialog: My doctor tells me I have something
dialog: called vascular dementia; which is
text: essentially a continuous series of
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: OLDER BRIONY (cont'd)
dialog: tiny strokes. Your brain gradually
dialog: closes down. You lose words, you lose
dialog: your memory: which, for a writer, is
dialog: pretty much the point. That’s why I
dialog: could finally write this book; and
dialog: why, of course, it’s my last novel.
dialog: Strangely enough, it would be just as
dialog: accurate to call it my first novel. I
dialog: wrote several drafts as far back as my
dialog: time at St. Thomas's Hospital during
dialog: the war. I just couldn’t ever find the
dialog: way to do it.
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER
dialog: Because the novel is autobiographical,
dialog: is that right?
speaker_heading: OLDER BRIONY
dialog: Yes, entirely. I haven’t changed any
dialog: names, including my own.
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER
dialog: And was that the problem?
speaker_heading: OLDER BRIONY
dialog: No. I had for a very long time decided
dialog: to tell the absolute truth. And I
dialog: think...
text: She hesitates.
speaker_heading: OLDER BRIONY
dialog: You’ve read the book, you’11l
dialog: understand why. I got first-hand
dialog: accounts of all the events I didn’t
dialog: personally witness, conditions in
dialog: prison, the evacuation of Dunkirk,
dialog: everything. But the effect of all this
dialog: honesty was rather...pitiless, you
dialog: see. I couldn’t any longer imagine
dialog: what purpose would be served by it.
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER
dialog: By what? By honesty?
speaker_heading: OLDER BRIONY
dialog: Or reality. Because, in fact, I was
dialog: too much of a coward to go and see my
dialog: sister in June, 1940.
scene_heading: INT. WATER TOWER AT ST THOMAS’S HOSPITAL. NIGHT. 1940.
dialog: 
text: BRIONY sits at her typewriter.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: OLDER BRIONY (V.O.)
dialog: I never made that journey to Balham.
dialog: So the scene in which I confess to
dialog: them is invented, imagined.
scene_heading: INT. CECILIA’S FLAT IN BALHAM. DAY.
text: ROBBIE’s face; the empty bed.
speaker_heading: OLDER BRIONY (V.O.)
dialog: And, in fact, could never have
dialog: happened...
scene_heading: INT. CELLAR AT BRAY DUNES. DAWN.
text: CORPORAL NETTLE removes a piece of wood from the entrance to the
text: bombed out cellar. Light pours in.
speaker_heading: OLDER BRIONY (V.O.)
dialog: ..-because Robbie Turner died of
text: septicaemia at Bray Dunes on the first
dialog: of June 1940, the last day of the
dialog: evacuation...
text: ROBBIE lies dead amongst the rubble; beside him is the bundle of
text: letters and CECILIA’s photograph. NETTLE picks up the letters.
speaker_heading: NETTLE
dialog: Cheerio, pal.
text: He covers ROBBIE’s face and puts the letters in his pocket.
scene_heading: INT. PLATFORM ON BALHAM TUBE STATION. NIGHT.
text: A thick pipe, running above the platform, is dripping,
text: undramatic but regular.
speaker_heading: OLDER BRIONY (V.O.)
dialog: «+. and I was never able to put things
dialog: right with my sister Cecilia...
text: A WIDE SHOT shows the platform, dimly lit, crowded with sleeping
text: bodies, mostly women and children.
text: PAN OVER the bodies: one of them, CECILIA, as it turns out,
text: opens her eyes, quite calmly, at the SOUND of muffled explosions
text: from the first bombs falling on the street above. The lights
text: flicker and revive.
dialog: gl.
scene_heading: EXT. BALHAM TUBE STATION. NIGHT.
text: The illuminated sign above the station also flickers and goes
text: out. Out here the SOUND and flash of the bombs is far more
dialog: present.
speaker_heading: OLDER BRIONY (V.O.)
dialog: ..-because she was killed on the 15th
dialog: of October, 1940...
scene_heading: INT. BALHAM TUBE STATION. NIGHT.
text: A vast wall of water cascades, in slow motion, down the deserted
text: escalators.
speaker_heading: OLDER BRIONY (V.O.)
dialog: ...by the bomb that destroyed the gas
text: and water mains above Balham tube
dialog: station.
scene_heading: INT. PLATFORM ON BALHAM TUBE STATION. NIGHT.
text: CECILIA sits up as the lights flicker and, this time, go out.
text: The thunderous roar of the approaching waters.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERWATER.
text: CECILIA’s body, balletically graceful, hair fantailed out,
text: drifts through the tube tunnel towards a distant light.
scene_heading: INT. T.V. STUDIO. DAY. 1999.
text: OLDER BRIONY looks intently at the CAMERA.
speaker_heading: OLDER BRIONY
dialog: So my sister and Robbie never had the
dialog: time together they both so longed for
dialog: and deserved, which, ever since,
dialog: I’'ve...always felt I prevented. But
dialog: what sense of hope or satisfaction
dialog: could a reader derive from an ending
dialog: like that? So, in the book, I wanted
dialog: to give Robbie and Cecilia what they
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: OLDER BRIONY (cont'd)
dialog: lost out on in life. I’d like to think
dialog: this wasn’t weakness or evasion, but a
dialog: final act of kindness.
text: She thinks for a moment.
speaker_heading: OLDER BRIONY
dialog: I gave them their happiness.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH BELOW WHITE CLIFFS. DAY.
text: ROBBIE and CECILIA crunch across the pebbles and splash
text: gleefully through the waves, below the towering white cliffs on
