text: He looks at the OVERWEIGHT BOY, 12, sitting on his left.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Christ. Would it kill you to lose
dialog: some weight? I barely have any

speaker_heading: SALMON PANTSUIT

speaker_heading: BALD GLASSES

dialog: (re: shitty tattered
dialog: paper)
dialog: You’re looking at my transcript!
dialog: Try not to wrinkle it any more than
dialog: it is, okay? As you can see, I
dialog: haven't passed beyond the eighth

speaker_heading: BALD GLASSES

dialog: Point A: “The speller must not have

dialog: paragraphs, five hundred and eighty
dialog: one lines of rules in your rule
dialog: book and I am complying with every
dialog: stupid one of them!
speaker_heading: BEDAZZLED JUDGE
dialog: The Spelling Bee is meant for kids.
dialog: Not adults who couldn’t even

speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: “Couldn't?” “Couldn't?” So now
dialog: you’re saying you won’t let me

dialog: fucking retarded?
speaker_heading: BEDAZZLED JUDGE
dialog: (flustered)

speaker_heading: BALD GLASSES
dialog: The Daily Pro- HA! That’s not a

speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Well let’s not argue over

speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: They don’t want to let me

speaker_heading: JENNY

speaker_heading: JENNY

speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: They’re more like Piranhas with
dialog: scorpion tails for dicks than
dialog: actual lawyers.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: As you can guess, the Daily Probe
dialog: is involved in its fare share of
dialog: legal suits and boy do these guys
dialog: know how to gum up the works! So,
dialog: in about a half hour you will
dialog: receive a Temporary Restraining
dialog: Order and Preliminary Injunction
dialog: prohibiting the continuation of

dialog: this whole legal matter up.
text: Jenny cringes, whispers.
speaker_heading: JENNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: BEDAZZLED JUDGE
dialog: Legal matter? This isn’t a legal

speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: It is now. We're suing the three

text: All the color drains out of the Judges’ faces.
speaker_heading: BALD GLASSES

speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Hmm. Maybe. Maybe not. Again.
dialog: Semantics. But getting down to the
dialog: bottom of that will take weeks.
dialog: Months.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Until then, no spelling bee. Hey,
dialog: can I at least stay to watch you

speaker_heading: JENNY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JENNY (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. GYMNASIUM, JUDGE’S TABLE
text: A crowd of concerned parents has bloomed around the table.
speaker_heading: SALMON PANTSUIT
dialog: There’s nothing we can do about the
text: loophole he found. He’s clearly an
dialog: alcoholic or a drug tweaker. I
dialog: think the least unpleasant option
dialog: is to just humor his derangement a
dialog: bit, let him participate, and when
text: he loses, his pathetic reality of a

dialog: to take it anymore! He’s focused.
dialog: He wants it. And word on the

dialog: understatement.
speaker_heading: CHUCK (V.0.)
dialog: Don’t let his virgin exterior fool
dialog: you! Eric Tai from San Diego
dialog: California is an absolute spelling
dialog: bee Mongoose! Two years ago, he
dialog: placed second. Last year, he lost
text: by a syllable to Benjamin Flourney.
dialog: One syllable! Now, Eric wants to
text: proverbially pop out of the Mekong
text: Delta with a knife in his mouth and
text: disembowel the final round.
text: Next we see a montage of rough video footage of Guy
text: constantly walking away from the camera and flipping the

speaker_heading: PETE (V.O.)
dialog: And finally, in what has been the
dialog: strangest turn of events in Bee
dialog: history, we have contestant Guy
dialog: Duncan from St. Louis, Missouri.
dialog: Oh, did we forget to mention?
dialog: Guy's thirty four years-old! This
dialog: man has made huge waves in the
dialog: competitive spelling world by
text: exposing and capitalizing on a
dialog: loophole in the competition’s
dialog: rules, and OH MAMA! Have things
dialog: been topsy-turvy! But he’s here
dialog: and the only way we’re gonna get
dialog: rid of him is if he loses!
text: Finally, we see quick footage cuts of Scribbs COO Bill Bowman

speaker_heading: CHUCK (V.0.)
dialog: And all of this spelling bee action
dialog: is constantly promoted, lauded, and

dialog: charismatic COOs, Scribbs
dialog: Institute’s own Bill Bowman.
text: We cut to a LIVE SATELLITE FEED of Bowman, donning an X-Games
text: helmet, being harnessed to a zipline that stretches beyond

speaker_heading: CHUCK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: We have Mr. Bowman joining us on a
dialog: live feed right now to share a few
dialog: words.
speaker_heading: BOWMAN
dialog: Thanks Chuck, Pete. I’m sorry I’m
dialog: not in town yet. I’m at the mouth
dialog: of the Kilauea Volcano on the
dialog: island of Kauai, as I zipline
dialog: across all the major volcanos of
dialog: the world in my ongoing attempt to
dialog: raise awareness about the literacy
dialog: epidemic in America. You know,
dialog: it’s a lot more dangerous than it
dialog: looks- and I’m talking about our
dialog: literacy rate, not the ziplining.
dialog: But never fear, I’1l make it to
dialog: Washington in time to hand out
dialog: first prize to our next National
dialog: Spelling Bee champion. Who will be
dialog: the next champion? I don’t know.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: BOWMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: But I’1l tell you this, you can’t
dialog: be a Bee champion, unless you've
dialog: shown honor, sportsmanship and
dialog: integrity. It’s just impossible.
dialog: As always, I can’t wait to meet all
dialog: of our noble competitors. Well,
dialog: most of them. I/‘11 be arriving
dialog: with high hopes, as well as that
dialog: much loved giant check!

scene_heading: S-T-R-U-T-H-I-0-U-S. Struthious.

speaker_heading: DIRECTOR DEAGAN

speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Listen-
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR DEAGAN
dialog: Now you just shoosh!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You know, when I was a little girl,
dialog: I was always picked last in P.E. I
dialog: hated sports. That’s probably
dialog: what, thankfully, thrust me into
dialog: the welcoming bosom of the spelling
dialog: bee. Now, I’m proud to say, we are
dialog: projected to have more viewers than
dialog: the Superbowl. That feels kinda
dialog: nice to say out loud. So how did I
dialog: accomplish this? Elbow grease?
dialog: Yes. Hard work? Maybe.
dialog: Integrity? You betcha. But what I
dialog: didn’t do is use slimy gimmicks
dialog: just as yourself!
text: Director Deagan pulls out a competitor number from her desk.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR DEAGAN (CONT’D)
dialog: So I wanted to personally give you
dialog: your number...
text: She moves around the table and hangs it around Guy’s neck.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR DEAGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You think you’re smart because you
dialog: found a loophole- and you're taking
scene_heading: advantage of it. B-R-A-V-O. But I
dialog: know you’re not smarter than even
dialog: the poorest speller in this
dialog: competition. So may this number
dialog: serve as the noose you hang
dialog: yourself by.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Wow. Thanks.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR DEAGAN
dialog: Don’t mention it. Oh, and one
dialog: other thing. I personally arranged
dialog: your hotel accommodations for you.
dialog: Just wanted you to know that.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: You shouldn't have.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR DEAGAN
dialog: But I did.

speaker_heading: GUY

dialog: You could have done that in an e-

speaker_heading: GUY

speaker_heading: CHAITANYA
dialog: Of course you do. Everyone does.
dialog: I bet you even Helen Keller had a
dialog: favorite word. She was blind and
dialog: deaf. Everyone’s got a favorite
dialog: word.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Well, I guess I’m a fucking
dialog: oddball, then.
speaker_heading: CHAITANYA
dialog: I bet Abraham Lincoln had a
dialog: favorite word. Mark Twain. Neil

dialog: did silent films.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: NO SHIT! BUT I DON’T!
speaker_heading: CHAITANYA
dialog: Well, if you were to have one what
dialog: would it be?
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: (gritted teeth)

speaker_heading: CHAITANYA
dialog: Say you're on a desert island and

speaker_heading: GUY

speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Listen, I’m trying to make the best

speaker_heading: GUY

speaker_heading: CHAITANYA
dialog: My father says bad words. But I’m

speaker_heading: GUY

dialog: bad words. I don’t give a shit.
speaker_heading: CHAITANYA
dialog: I shouldn't.
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Do it. Who has the right to decide

speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Why in the fuck do you think that

speaker_heading: CHAITANYA

dialog: nothing.
speaker_heading: GUY

dialog: I‘1l totally open up.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: YOU WOULDN'T!
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Try me.
text: Guy limps away.
text: Jenny's phone vibrates. She has an e-mail alert. It reads:
dialog: “Jenny- Guy Trippon info. We're even! Jeremy.”
text: Jenny opens up the e-mail on her phone. Reads. Her eyes go

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER
text: Chaitanya studies from his huge binder. His phone rings. He
text: picks it up.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: CHAITANYA
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: FRONT DESK
dialog: Yes, your father left a message
dialog: saying he’1ll be waiting for you in
text: the lobby in five minutes.
speaker_heading: CHAITANYA
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Really? Thanks.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL HALL - MOMENTS LATER
text: Chaitanya walks out of his room. Before the door shuts
text: completely, GUY silently limps inside from behind a nearby
dialog: planter.
scene_heading: INT. STATE PLAZA HOTEL, LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Chaitanya looks around the lobby. No father.
text: Chaitanya freezes- a horrible thought has just crossed his
dialog: mind.
text: Chaitanya runs for the elevator.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL HALL - MOMENTS LATER
text: Chaitanya runs as fast as he can to his room.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Chaitanya scrambles inside...HIS BINDER IS GONE!
text: Chaitanya notices a flickering reflection from his window.
text: Chaitanya looks out his window to see Guy below in the
text: parking lot, standing next to the BURNING BINDER! Guy looks
text: up and flips Chaitanya the double bird.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER
text: There is a knock at Guy’s door. Guy limps over to and opens
text: it to face a PIZZA DELIVERY GUY holding TWENTY PIZZA BOXES.
dialog: 79.
scene_heading: PIZZA DELIVERY GUY
dialog: That will be two hundred and eighty
dialog: dollars, not including tip.
text: Guy grits his teeth and slams his door.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Amateur.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - MUCH LATER
text: There’s a knock on Chaitanya’s door. He opens it and is

speaker_heading: MARZIPAN
dialog: Hey, Sugar!
text: Suddenly ANOTHER HOOKER APPROACHES.
speaker_heading: HOOKER
dialog: What are you doin’ here, bitch?!
speaker_heading: MARZIPAN
dialog: I GOT THE CALL.
speaker_heading: HOOKER
scene_heading: WELL SO DID TI!
speaker_heading: MARZIPAN
dialog: This is my hood, bitch!
speaker_heading: HOOKER
dialog: WHO YOU CALLING BITCH, BITCH?
text: Chaitanya slams his door shut, completely freaked out as the

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - MUCH MUCH LATER
text: Guy jumps awake to his door being rapped hard.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: WHO IS IT?
speaker_heading: POLICE (0.S.)

speaker_heading: GUY

speaker_heading: POLICE (0.S.)
dialog: Sir, we've received a call that

speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: That's right, coppers! I've got a

dialog: get any closer! Then, I'1l fuckin’

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: GUY

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE STATION - DAWN
text: Jenny walks out with Guy.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: That little fucking bastard!
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Hey, at least they didn’t press

speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: He knew I wouldn't believe it was
dialog: the real cops. It’s war!
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Guy. I gotta talk to you about
dialog: something. I’ve been digging
dialog: around and...I found out who your
dialog: father is. Maybe...just stop
text: walking for a second.
text: Jenny stops Guy. Looks into his eyes. Takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: JENNY (CONT'D)
dialog: As incredible as this sounds, Guy,
dialog: your father is Scribbs President
dialog: Bill Bowman.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Yeah. I know.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Wait, what? You do?
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: My mother told me when she was
dialog: dying. He was a traveling
dialog: encyclopedia salesman, she was a
text: waitress at a diner he passed
dialog: through all the time. When she got
dialog: pregnant he stuck around for awhile
dialog: or something, but once I was born,
dialog: he headed for the hills and never
dialog: looked back.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: So Bowman doesn’t have any idea who
dialog: you are-
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: -Not a fucking clue. And he’s not
dialog: going to until I finish making a
text: mockery out of what he seems to
dialog: love more than anything else, the
dialog: spelling bee.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Guy! This is huge.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: It's not important to your story,
dialog: if that’s what you’re trying to
dialog: drive at.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Like hell it isn’t! This is
dialog: completely important. Everything

speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: JENNY (CONT'D)
dialog: This is now the whole point of my

speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: No fucking way.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Look, not wanting me to get a quote
dialog: from some kid is one thing, but you
dialog: can’t really tell me what to write.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: I’m doing it right now.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I like you and I thought you liked
dialog: me, but nothing gets in the way of
dialog: me doing my job well.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Are you kidding me? Nothing gets
dialog: in the way of your shitty little
dialog: tabloid piece? Spare me. Why
dialog: don’t you knock off this
dialog: professional reporter act. You
dialog: write for a scabby rag that fat
text: housewives wash down with a pint of
dialog: ice cream every week.
text: Jenny’s clearly stung by Guy’s words.
speaker_heading: GUY (CONT'D)
dialog: If you write one word about this,
dialog: I‘1l never talk to you again!
speaker_heading: JENNY
text: FINE! THEN I GUESS THAT'S THE WAY
dialog: IT HAS TO BE! You just do what you
dialog: have to do and I’1l do what I have
dialog: to do.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Whatever. You fucking ingrate!
text: Jenny scoffs. She’s so enraged she’s speechless.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL AUDITORIUM, BROADCAST BOOTH
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: And welcome everyone to the big
dialog: tamale, the final countdown, where
dialog: the eye meets the tiger! Pete, if
dialog: you thought the going got weird
dialog: during the Bee yesterday, just
dialog: listen to what happened when the
dialog: semi-final round was over. Reports
dialog: have come in that National Spelling
dialog: Bee Director Bernice Deagan has
dialog: been arrested and charged with
text: assault with a deadly weapon, on
dialog: none other than Guy Duncan!
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: She tried to Tanya Harding him,
text: Chuck. With a pipe. Anda ski
dialog: mask. Allegedly. Much to
dialog: America’s disappointment, Guy only
dialog: suffered minor injuries and will be
text: competing in the final round.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Un. Believable. This morning
dialog: Scribbs COO Bill Bowman announced
dialog: that Director Deagan has been
dialog: removed from her position and that
dialog: he himself will oversee the final
dialog: round today. And we are fortunate
dialog: enough to have Mr. Bowman with us,
dialog: in Washington D.C., right now.
text: Bowman steps into frame.
speaker_heading: BOWMAN
dialog: Thank you, Chuck. I would like to
dialog: take the opportunity to address
dialog: this unique situation to everyone
dialog: watching out there. I regret the
dialog: alleged actions of former Director
dialog: Bernice Deagan. As you know, I
dialog: myself am a former bee champ.
dialog: Before I became one of the most
dialog: influential and powerful executives
dialog: in America, I learned first hand
dialog: that the bee is about
dialog: sportsmanship, not assault and
dialog: battery. I look forward to moving
dialog: past this ugly incident and am very
dialog: excited to personally crown our
dialog: next National Spelling Bee Champ,
dialog: whoever that may be.
dialog: 83.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: From your lips to God’s ears.
dialog: Pete, take it away.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: So let’s get to it! The final
dialog: round of this year’s Scribbs
dialog: Institute National Spelling Bee,
dialog: where the last speller standing
text: walks away with five hundred
dialog: thousand dollars-
text: Bowman leans in to interject.
speaker_heading: BOWMAN
dialog: -And a lifetime supply of
dialog: dictionaries and encyclopedias-
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: -blah blah blah FIVE HUNDRED
dialog: THOUSAND DOLLARS!!!
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL AUDITORIUM, STAGE
text: All twenty five competitors sit up on the stage as the judges
text: and audience and Bowman sit before them.
text: Disheveled and worse for the wear, Guy limps past Chaitanya,
text: who’s wearing a blazer that has one sleeve obviously longer
dialog: than the other.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: What happened to the duds? Looks
text: like a “friend” got hold of them.
text: Chaitanya’s tired and grumpy.
speaker_heading: CHAITANYA
dialog: You got arrested.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: I’m going to fucking end you.
speaker_heading: CHAITANYA
dialog: (through gritted teeth)
dialog: Bring it.
dialog: 85.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL AUDITORIUM, BROADCAST BOOTH
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Looks like there’s some harsh words
dialog: being shared between two of the
dialog: contestants down there, Chuck.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL AUDITORIUM, STAGE
text: Eric Tai walks up to the mic. He’s super awkward, nearly
text: savantish with his rocking back-and-forth.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL AUDITORIUM, BROADCAST BOOTH
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: This is Eric Tai. Quite the word
dialog: Ninja.
speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: PROCTOR

text: The audience goes wild. Eric pumps his fist in just about

text: Next, Chaitanya comes up to the mic. Guy leans forward in
dialog: his seat.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL AUDITORIUM, BROADCAST BOOTH
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Chaitanya Chopra, Chuck. Chaitanya
dialog: has been here twice before and
dialog: hopes three times is the charm.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Let’s see if the genie’s in his
dialog: bottle, Pete.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: That might have been a skosh

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: No more than calling a Chinese kid

speaker_heading: PROCTOR

speaker_heading: CHAITANYA
dialog: Tmesis. Definition?

dialog: for humorous effect; for
dialog: example, ‘abso-bloody-lutely.’”
speaker_heading: CHAITANYA

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: TASTIC!

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Ouch. The wheels came off of that

speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Pete, all the Bee veterans will
dialog: tell you, “Take your time. Even if
dialog: you think you know it, ask those
dialog: questions. Spell it out in your
dialog: hand.”
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: So right. You want to be the
dialog: tortoise, not the hare.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Wow. That one was the most
dialog: insensitive of all. I can’t
dialog: believe you went there.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What? “Hare” as in rabbit, not
dialog: “hare” as in...lip!
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: We should just drop it.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL AUDITORIUM, STAGE
text: Tamara rushes off the stage in tears.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: She spelled it Zitgeist! What a

text: hisses.
speaker_heading: PROCTOR
text: QUIET IN THE AUDIENCE PLEASE!
speaker_heading: CHUCK (0.C.)
dialog: And here comes Guy Duncan.
text: The booing grows. Guy happily stands before his haters.
text: Guy looks down at Bowman. Bowman looks up at him, with no
text: idea what's going in Guy’s head. This is the first time Guy
dialog: has ever stood before his father. We see a slight change in
text: Guy's face- almost a tinge of emotion.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: PETE (0.C.)
dialog: Holy smokes! I don’t think there's
dialog: ever been booing at the Bee before,

speaker_heading: CHUCK (0.C.)
dialog: Well, there’ve been a lot of Bee

speaker_heading: GUY
scene_heading: Just kidding C-O-N-D-I-G-N.

speaker_heading: PROCTOR
dialog: That is corr-
dialog: (over the boos)
dialog: THAT IS CORRECT!
text: Guy turns to the BOY WITH A UNIBROW sitting to his right.
speaker_heading: GUY

speaker_heading: PROCTOR

text: The Raging Mother from before stands up in the audience and

speaker_heading: RAGING MOTHER
dialog: YOU MEAN LIKE THAT MAN!
text: The audience laughs and cat calls Guy.
speaker_heading: PROCTOR
dialog: Ma’am. I’m going to have to ask
dialog: you to leave.
speaker_heading: RAGING MOTHER
dialog: Not until he does!
text: The Proctor nods and two security guards approach the Raging
text: Mother. She goes limp and they have to drag her away. As
text: she gets dragged out she starts chanting:
speaker_heading: RAGING MOTHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Take him out! Take him out!
speaker_heading: CHUCK (0.C.)
dialog: Well, we promised fireworks, ladies

speaker_heading: PETE (0.C.)
dialog: Is this a Spelling Bee or the G8
dialog: Summit?!
speaker_heading: CHUCK (0.C.)
dialog: Zing! Zow! Petey’s back!
text: Soon, everyone in the audience is chanting “TAKE HIM OUT!”
text: Guy seems unaffected by all this.
text: Guy leans in toward the rest of the contestants.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Get ready, mongoloids. This only
dialog: makes me stronger...
text: We hold on the contestants up on the stage as Guy stands
text: before the mic.
dialog: 91.
text: Through quick cuts we see the number of contestants dwindle
text: down, until finally there are only three. ERIC TAI,
text: CHAITANYA, and GUY.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL AUDITORIUM, BROADCAST BOOTH
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: And then there were three. Eric
dialog: Tai, Chaitanya Chopra and Guy
dialog: Duncan. They will fight to the
dialog: finish, when we come back!
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL AUDITORIUM, STAGE
speaker_heading: PROCTOR
dialog: You may stand and stretch your legs
dialog: during this commercial break.
text: Guy looks at Eric Tai who has met his parents at the foot of
text: the stage. His equally awkward father approaches to give him
dialog: encouragement.
text: Then Guy looks at Chaitanya who is now huddled with his
text: parents. Guy watches as Chaitanya’s mother rubs his back,
text: his father gives him quiet words of inspiration.
text: Guy looks across the auditorium to Jenny. She turns her back
text: to him and interviews one of the angry parents.
text: Guy sits completely alone up on the stage.
text: He looks at Bowman, talking to the Proctor, then he turns
text: back to Chaitanya with his parents again. Then back to
dialog: Bowman.
text: Guys blinks wearily. A change is happening inside of him.
speaker_heading: PROCTOR (CONT’D)
dialog: Okay everyone, ten seconds. The
dialog: three finalists must now sit
dialog: together.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL AUDITORIUM, STAGE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Eric, Chaitanya and Guy all sit side by side.
text: Eric Tai goes up to the mic. Guy glances at Chaitanya,

dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: PETE (0.C.)
dialog: And here we go, what might be the
text: final leg of the competition.
speaker_heading: PROCTOR
dialog: Kopophobia.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Kopophobia. Can I have the
dialog: definition?
speaker_heading: PROCTOR
dialog: “Fear of exhaustion. Otherwise
dialog: known as “Lexicographer’s Curse.”
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Is it derived from the Greek
dialog: “Kopos” meaning “fatigue?”
speaker_heading: PROCTOR
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ERIC
scene_heading: K-O-P-O-P-0O-B-I-A.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: No!
text: Ting! The crowd erupts with upset! Eric sadly leaves the
dialog: stage.
speaker_heading: CHUCK (0.C.)
dialog: OH THAT’S GOTTA HURT! Eric knew he
dialog: left out the H. This has been a
dialog: long day and it’s clearly taken
dialog: it’s toll on Eric.
speaker_heading: PETE (0.C.)
dialog: How ironic that fatigue made him
text: misspell a word about fatigue.
speaker_heading: CHUCK (0.C.)
dialog: That one will haunt him for life.
dialog: And he’s just a kid, so that’s a
dialog: long time to be haunted by
dialog: something. Long time. And now,
dialog: Guy Duncan.
text: Guy steps up to the mic, amidst boos.
speaker_heading: PROCTOR
scene_heading: PARISOLOGY .

speaker_heading: GUY (CONT'D)
scene_heading: P-A-R-I-S-A-L-0-G-Y.
text: Ting! The audience goes crazy with glee. Chaitanya looks at
text: Guy with shock. Bowman applauds.
speaker_heading: CHUCK (0.C.)
dialog: Well what do you know! For the
dialog: first time this whole tournament,
dialog: Guy Duncan has spelled a word
dialog: incorrectly!
speaker_heading: PETE (0.C.)
dialog: But, the rules of the final round
dialog: dictate that because he’s one of
dialog: the final two remaining
text: contestants, Guy remains on stage.
text: Guy sits back down. Looks at Chaitanya, who stares at Guy
text: with amazement, all pretense of anger has washed away.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: I know how bad you want this. I
dialog: get it. So take it. Fuck off.
text: Chaitanya slowly gets to the mic. The audience wildly
text: cheers.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOUSEHOLD - SAME TIME

scene_heading: INT. SPORTS BAR - SAME TIME

speaker_heading: PROCTOR
text: Infinitesimally.
speaker_heading: CHAITANYA
dialog: Infinitesimally. Can I have the
dialog: definition?
speaker_heading: PROCTOR
dialog: Yes. “Exceedingly small.”
text: Chaitanya looks back at Guy. He knows this word. But
text: on his face that he’s feeling guilty.
speaker_heading: CHAITANYA
scene_heading: Infinitesimally. E-N-F-I-N-I-T-E-Ss-

speaker_heading: CHUCK (0.C.)

speaker_heading: GUY

speaker_heading: CHUCK (0.S.)

speaker_heading: PETE (0.S.)
dialog: INDEED IT HAS, CHUCK!

speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: JUST TAKE IT!
speaker_heading: CHAITANYA

text: Bowman is joined by the Judges as he clambers into the scrum

text: The audience screams in a frenzy.
speaker_heading: BOWMAN
dialog: Knock it off! Both of you!

speaker_heading: AUDIENCE (0.S.)
speaker_heading: oO
speaker_heading: CHAITANYA

speaker_heading: GUY

dialog: reporter friend of mine who is

speaker_heading: BOWMAN
dialog: Oh my. You...you have her eyes.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: I’M NOT FUCKING LYING- what?

speaker_heading: JENNY

speaker_heading: CHAITANYA

speaker_heading: CHAITANYA
dialog: Wow!
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Right?
speaker_heading: CHAITANYA
dialog: Where'd you get this?
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: It’s an old movie police car. I
dialog: got it at an auction with my half
dialog: of the winnings. Worth every
dialog: penny.
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: CHAITANYA
dialog: Now you don’t need the toy you have
dialog: the real thing!
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: But only because of my good friend.
dialog: So, you want to give it a whirl?
speaker_heading: CHAITANYA
dialog: Who? Me?
speaker_heading: GUY

speaker_heading: OH SHIT!

speaker_heading: AERIAL POV:
dialog: A high speed chase!
text: As the police car tears after the three screaming kids on
text: their bikes...through the streets, over lawns, through
