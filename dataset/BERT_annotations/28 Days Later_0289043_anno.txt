scene_heading: CLOSE ON A MONITOR SCREEN:
dialog: 
text: Images of stunning violence. Looped.
dialog: 
text: Soldiers in a foreign war shoot an unarmed civilian at point-
text: blank range; a man is set on by a frenzied crowd wielding
text: clubs and machetes; a woman is necklaced while her killers
text: cheer and howl.
dialog: 
text: Pull back to reveal that we are seeing one of many screens in
text: a bank of monitors, all showing similar images...
dialog: 
text: Then revealing that the monitors are in a...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SURGICAL CHAMBER - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: ...surgical chamber. And watching the screens is a...
dialog: 
text: ...chimp, strapped to an operating table, with its skull
text: dissected open, webbed in wires and monitoring devices,
text: muzzled with a transparent guard. Alive.
dialog: 
text: Behind the surgical chamber, through the wide doorframe, we
text: can see a larger laboratory beyond.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BRIGHT CORRIDOR - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A group of black-clad ALF Activists, all wearing balaclavas,
text: move down a corridor. They carry various gear - bag, bolt
dialog: cutters.
dialog: 
text: As they move, one Activist reaches up to a security camera
text: and sprays it black with an aerosol paint can.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The Activists enter the laboratory.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF ACTIVIST
dialog: Fucking hell...
dialog: 
text: The Chief Activist takes his camera off his shoulder and
text: starts taking photos.
dialog: 
text: The room is huge and long, and darkened except for specific
text: pools of light. Partially illuminated are rows of cages with
text: clear perspex doors. They run down either side of the room.
text: In the cages are chimpanzees.
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Most are in a state of rabid agitation, banging and clawing
text: against the perspex, baring teeth through foam-flecked
dialog: mouths.
dialog: 
text: They reach the far end of the lab, where on a huge steel
text: operating table they see the dissected chimp.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FEMALE ACTIVIST
dialog: Oh God...
dialog: 
text: The dissected chimp's eyes flick to the Activists. Blood
text: wells from around the exposed brain tissue.
dialog: 
text: Tears starts to roll down the Female Activist's cheeks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF ACTIVIST
dialog: (to Female Activist)
dialog: Keep your shit together. If we're
dialog: going to get them out of here...
dialog: 
text: The Finnish Activist is checking the perspex cages.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINNISH ACTIVIST
dialog: I can pop these, no problem.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF ACTIVIST
dialog: So get to it.
dialog: 
text: The Finnish Activist raises his crowbar and sticks it around
text: the edge of one of the doors - about to prise it open.
dialog: 
text: At the moment, the doors to the laboratory bang open.
dialog: 
text: The Activists all turn. Standing at the entrance is the
dialog: Scientist.
dialog: 
text: A pause. The Scientist jumps to a telephone handset on the
text: wall and shouts into the receiver.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: Security! We have a break-in! Get
dialog: to sector...
dialog: 
text: A hand slams down the disconnect button.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: ...nine.
dialog: 
text: The Chief Activist plucks the receiver from the Scientist's
text: hands, and then rips the telephone from the wall.
dialog: 
text: A beat.
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: I know who you are, I know what you
dialog: think you're doing, but you have to
dialog: listen to me. You can't release
dialog: these animals.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF ACTIVIST
dialog: If you don't want to get hurt, shut
dialog: your mouth, and don't move a
dialog: fucking muscle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
speaker_heading: (BLURTS)
dialog: The chimps are infected!
dialog: 
text: The Activists hesitate, exchanging a glance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: (continuing; stumbling,
speaker_heading: FLUSTERED)
dialog: These animals are highly
dialog: contagious. They've been given an
dialog: inhibitor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF ACTIVIST
dialog: Infected with what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
text: Chemically restricted, locked down
dialog: to a... a single impulse that...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF ACTIVIST
dialog: Infected with what?
dialog: 
text: The Scientist hesitates before answering.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: Rage.
dialog: 
text: Behind the Activists, the bank of monitors show the faces of
text: the machete-wielding crowd.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: (desperately trying to
speaker_heading: EXPLAIN)
dialog: In order to cure, you must first
dialog: understand. Just imagine: to have
dialog: power over all the things we feel
dialog: we can't control. Anger,
dialog: violence...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINNISH ACTIVIST
dialog: What the fuck is he talking about?
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF ACTIVIST
dialog: We don't have time for this shit!
dialog: Get the cages open!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: No!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF ACTIVIST
dialog: We're going, you sick bastard, and
dialog: we're taking your torture victims
dialog: with us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: NO! You must listen! The animals
dialog: are contagious! The infection is in
dialog: their blood and saliva! One bite
dialog: and...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FEMALE ACTIVIST
dialog: They won't bite me.
dialog: 
text: The Female Activist crouches down to face the wild eyes of
text: the infected chimp behind the perspex.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: STOP! You have no idea!
dialog: 
text: The Scientist makes a desperate lunge towards her, but the
text: Chief Activist grabs him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FEMALE ACTIVIST
dialog: Good boy. You don't want to bite
dialog: me, do you?
dialog: 
text: The Female Activist gives a final benign smile, then the
text: Finnish Activist pops open the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: NO!
dialog: 
text: Like a bullet from a gun, the infected chimp leaps out at the
text: Female Activist - and sinks its teeth into her neck. She
text: reels back as the chimp claws and bites with extraordinary
dialog: viciousness.
dialog: 
text: At the same moment, a deafening alarm begins to sound.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FEMALE ACTIVIST
speaker_heading: (SHRIEKING)
dialog: Get it off! Get if off!
dialog: 
text: The Finnish Activist rips the ape off and throws it on to the
text: floor. The infected chimp immediately bites into the man's
text: leg. He yells with pain, and tries to kick it off.
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Behind him, the Female Activist has started to scream. She
text: doubles up, clutching the side of her head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FEMALE ACTIVIST
dialog: I'm burning! Jesus! Help me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: We have to kill her!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FEMALE ACTIVIST
dialog: I'm burning! I'm burning!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF ACTIVIST
dialog: What's...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: We have to kill her NOW!
dialog: 
text: Meanwhile, the Female Activist's cries have become an
text: unwavering howl of pain - and she is joined by the Finnish
text: Activist, whose hands have also flown to the side of his
text: head, gripping his temples as if trying to keep his skull
dialog: from exploding.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF ACTIVIST
dialog: What's wrong with them?
dialog: 
text: The Scientist grabs a desk-lamp base and starts running
text: towards the screaming Female Activist...
dialog: 
text: ...who has ripped off her balaclava - revealing her face -
text: the face of an Infected.
dialog: 
text: She turns to the Scientist.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: Oh God.
dialog: 
text: She leaps at him. He screams as they go tumbling to the
dialog: ground.
dialog: 
text: The Chief Activist watches in immobile horror as she attacks
text: the Scientist with amazing ferocity.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Another ACTIVIST makes his way down the corridor towards the

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: No answer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACTIVIST
dialog: Mika? Where are you?
dialog: 
text: He reaches the door to the lab, which is closed - and...
dialog: 
text: ...as he opens it, we realize the door is also soundproofed.
dialog: 
text: A wall of screaming hits him.
dialog: 
text: He stands in the doorway - stunned by the noise, and then the
dialog: sight.
dialog: 
text: Blood, death, and his colleagues, all Infected.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACTIVIST
dialog: Bloody hell.
dialog: 
text: The Infected rush him.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: Close up of Jim, a young man in his twenties, wearing pale
text: green hospital pyjamas. He has a month's beard, is
text: dishevelled, and asleep.
dialog: 
text: We pull back to see that Jim is lying on a hospital bed, in a
text: private room. Connected to his arms are multiple drips, a
text: full row of four or five on each side of his bed. Most of the
text: bags are empty.
dialog: 
text: Jim's eyes open.
dialog: 
text: He looks around with an expression of confusion. Then he sits
text: up. He is weak, but he swings his legs off the bed and
text: stands. The attached drips are pulled with him and clatter to
dialog: the floor.
dialog: 
text: Jim winces, and pulls the taped needles from his arm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Ow...
dialog: 
text: His voice is hoarse, his mouth dry. Massaging his throat, he
text: walks to the door.
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COMA WARD - LATE AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: The door to Jim's hospital room is locked. The key is on the
text: floor. He picks it up and opens the door.
dialog: 
text: Jim exits into a corridor.
dialog: 
text: At the far end, a sign read: COMA WARD. There is no sign of
dialog: life or movement.
dialog: 
text: Jim walks down the corridor. One of the doors is half-open.
text: From inside, there is the sound of buzzing flies.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL WARDS - LATE AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: Jim moves as quickly as he can through the hospital, still
text: weak, but now driven by adrenaline.
dialog: 
text: All the wards and corridors are deserted. Medical notes and
text: equipment lie strewn over the floors, trolleys are upended,
text: glass partition doors are smashed. In a couple of places,
text: splashes of dried blood arc up the walls.
dialog: 
text: He reaches A&amp;E. On one wall is a row of public pay phones.
dialog: 
text: He lifts a receiver, and the line is dead. He goes down the
text: line, trying them all.
dialog: 
text: In the corner of the A&amp;E reception is a smashed soft-drinks
text: machine, with a few cans collected at the base.
dialog: 
text: Jim grabs one, rips off the ring-pull and downs it in one go.
text: Then he grabs another, and heads for the main doors.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL - LATE AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: Jim exits and walks out into the bright daylight of the
text: forecourt. The camera begins to pull away from him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Hello?
dialog: 
text: Aside from a quiet rush of wind, there is silence. No
text: traffic, no engines, no movement. Not even birdsong.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LONDON - SUNDOWN
dialog: 
text: Jim walks through the empty city, from St. Thomas's Hospital,
text: over Westminster Bridge, past the Houses of Parliament, down
text: Whitehall, to Trafalgar Square.
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A bright overhead sun bleaches the streets. A light drifts
text: litter and refuse. Cars lie abandoned, shops looted.
dialog: 
text: Jim is still wearing his hospital pyjamas, and carries a
text: plastic bag full of soft-drink cans.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL LONDON ROAD/CHURCH - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jim walks. Night has fallen. He needs to find a place to
dialog: rest...
dialog: 
text: He pauses. Down a narrow side street is a church. He walks
text: towards it. The front doors are open.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jim walks inside, moving with the respectful quietness that
dialog: people adopt when entering a church.
dialog: 
text: The doors ahead to the main chamber are closed. Pushing them,
text: gently trying the handle, it is obvious they are locked. But
text: another open door is to his left. He goes through it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - STAIRWELL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jim moves up a stairwell.
dialog: 
text: Written large on the wall is a single line of graffiti:
text: REPENT. THE END IS EXTREMELY FUCKING NIGH
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - GALLERY LEVEL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jim moves into the gallery level, and sees, through the dust
text: and rot, ornate but faded splendor. At the far end, a stained-
text: glass window is illuminated by the moonlight.
dialog: 
text: Jim pads in, stands at the gallery, facing the stained-glass
text: window for a moment before looking down...
dialog: 
text: Beneath are hundreds of dead bodies. Layered over the floor,
text: jammed into the pews, spilling over the altar. The scene of
text: an unimaginable massacre.
dialog: 
text: Jim stands, stunned. Then sees, standing motionless at
text: different positions facing away from him, four people.
dialog: 
text: Their postures and stillness make their status unclear. Jim
text: hesitates before speaking.
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: ...Hello?
dialog: 
text: Immediately, the four heads flick around. Infected.
dialog: 
text: And the next moment, there is the powerful thump of a door at
text: the far end of the gallery.
dialog: 
text: Jim whirls to the source as the Infected below start to move.
dialog: 
text: The door thumps again - another stunningly powerful blow, the
text: noise echoing around the chamber.
dialog: 
text: Confused, fist closing around his bag of soft drinks, Jim
text: steps onto the gallery, facing the door...
dialog: 
text: ...and it smashes open.
dialog: 
text: Revealing an Infected Priest - who locks sight on Jim, and
text: starts to sprint.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Father?
dialog: 
text: The Priest is half way across the gallery
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Father, what are you...
dialog: 
text: And now the moonlight catches the Priest's face. Showing
text: clearly: the eyes. The blood smeared and collected around his
text: nose, ears, and mouth. Darkened and crusted, accumulated over
text: days and weeks. Fresh blood glistening.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Jesus!
dialog: 
text: In a movement of pure instinct, Jim swings the bag just as
text: the Priest is about to reach him - and connects squarely with
text: the man's head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Oh, that, was bad, that was bad...
dialog: I shouldn't have done that...
dialog: 
text: He breaks into a run...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - STAIRWELL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Down the stairwell...
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: ...into the front entrance, where the locked door now strains
text: under the blows of the Infected inside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Shit.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jim sprints down the stone steps.
dialog: 
text: As he reaches the bottom the doors are broken open, and the
text: Infected give chase.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL LONDON ROAD - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jim runs - the Infected have almost reached him.
dialog: 
text: A hand fires up a Zippo lighter, and lights the rag of a
dialog: Molotov cocktail.
dialog: 
text: As Jim runs, something flies past his head, and the Infected
text: closest to him explodes in a ball of flame.
dialog: 
text: Jim turns, and sees as another Molotov cocktail explodes,
text: engulfing two in the fireball.
dialog: 
text: He whirls, now completely bewildered.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
speaker_heading: HERE!
dialog: 
text: Another Molotov cocktail explodes. The Infected stagger from
text: the blaze, on fire.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: OVER HERE!
dialog: 
text: Jim whirls again, and sees, further down the road...
dialog: 
text: ...Selena, a black woman, also in her twenties. She wears a
text: small backpack, a machete is stuck into her belt - and she
text: holds a lit Molotov cocktail in her hand.
dialog: 
text: ...Mark, a tall, good-looking man - throwing another bottle.
dialog: 
text: It smashes on the head of the last Infected, bathing it in
dialog: flame...
dialog: 
text: The burning Infected bumps blindly into a car. Falls. Gets up
dialog: again.
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Blindly, it staggers off the road, into a petrol station -
text: where an abandoned car has run over on the pumps.
dialog: 
text: The ground beneath it suddenly ignites, and the petrol
text: station explodes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Selena and Mark lead Jim into a side street.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
speaker_heading: (DAZED)
dialog: Those people! Who were... who...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: This way! Move it!
dialog: 
text: Jim allows himself to be hurried along.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SHOP - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Selena stops outside a newsagent's shop. The shop's door and
text: windows are covered with a metal security grill, but the
text: grill over the door lock has been prised away enough for
text: Selena to slip her hand through to the latch.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SHOP - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Inside, most of the shelves have been emptied of
text: confectionery. Newspapers and magazines litter the floor. The
text: magazine covers of beautiful girls and sports cars have
text: become instant anachronisms.
dialog: 
text: At the back of the shop, a makeshift bed of sheets and
text: sleeping bag is nestled. This has obviously been Selena and
text: Mark's home for the last few days.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEWSAGENT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jim, Mark and Selena enter the newsagent's and pull down the
dialog: grill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
text: A man walks into a bar with a
text: giraffe. They each get pissed. The
text: giraffe falls over. The man goes to
dialog: leave and the barman says, you
dialog: can't leave that lying there. The
dialog: man says, it's not a lion. It's a
text: giraffe.
dialog: 12.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: Silence.
dialog: 
text: Mark pulls off his mask and turns to Selena.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: He's completely humorless. You two
dialog: will get along like a house on
dialog: fire.
dialog: 
text: Selena, who has already taken off her mask, ignores Mark.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Who are you? You've come from a
dialog: hospital.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Are you a doctor?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: He's not a doctor. He's a patient.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I'm a bicycle courier. I was riding
dialog: a package from Farringdon to
text: Shaftesbury Avenue. A car cut
dialog: across me... and then I wake up in
dialog: hospital, today... I wake up and
dialog: I'm hallucinating, or...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What's your name?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Jim.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'm Mark. This is Selena.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Okay, Jim. We've got some bad news.
dialog: 
text: Selena starts to tell her story, and as the story unfolds we
text: see the images she describes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
text: It began as rioting. And right from
dialog: the beginning, you knew something
dialog: bad was going on because the
dialog: rioters were killing people. And
text: then it wasn't on the TV anymore.
text: It was in the street outside. It
dialog: was coming through your windows. We
dialog: all guessed it was a virus. An
dialog: infection. You didn't need a doctor
dialog: to tell you that. It was the blood.
dialog: 13.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Something in the blood. By the time
dialog: they tried to evacuate the cities,
dialog: it was already too late. The
dialog: infection was everywhere. The army
dialog: blockades were overrun. And that
dialog: was when the exodus started. The
dialog: day before the radio and TV stopped
dialog: broadcasting there were reports of
dialog: infection in Paris and New York. We
dialog: didn't hear anything more after
dialog: that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Where are your families?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: They're dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Yours will be dead too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: No... No! I'm going to find them.
dialog: They live in Greenwich. I can walk.
dialog: (heading for the exit)
dialog: I'm going to... to go and...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: You'll go and come back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (pulling at the grill)
dialog: Yes! I'll go and come back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Rules of survival. Lesson one - you
dialog: never go anywhere alone, unless
dialog: you've got no choice. Lesson two -
dialog: you only move during daylight,
dialog: unless you've got no choice. We'll
dialog: take you tomorrow. Then we'll all
dialog: go and find your dead parents.
dialog: Okay?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - DAY
dialog: 
text: Jim, Selena and Mark walk along the Docklands Light Railway
text: in single file. Ahead is a train.
dialog: 
text: Behind the train, as if spilled in its wake, are abandoned
text: bags, suitcases, backpacks.
dialog: 
text: Mark drops pace to let Jim catch up.
dialog: 14.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: How's your head? Fucked?
dialog: 
dialog: No reply.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (gesturing at the city)
dialog: I know where your head is. You're
dialog: looking at these windows, these
dialog: millions of windows, and you're
dialog: thinking - there's no way this many
dialog: people are dead. It's just too many
dialog: windows.
dialog: 
text: Mark picks up a handbag from the tracks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: The person who owned this bag.
dialog: Can't be dead.
dialog: 
text: Mark reaches in and starts to pull things out as they walk,
text: discarding the personal possessions.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
text: A woman - (car keys) - who drove a
dialog: Nissan Micra - (teddy) - and had a
dialog: little teddy bear - (condoms) - and
dialog: carried protection, just in case.
dialog: 
text: Marks tosses the condoms behind him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
speaker_heading: (DRY)
dialog: Believe me, we won't need them
dialog: anymore than she will.
dialog: 
text: He hands the bag to Jim and walks ahead.
dialog: 
text: Jim pulls out a mobile phone.
dialog: 
text: He switches it on.
dialog: 
text: It reads: SEARCHING FOR NETWORK.
dialog: 
text: The message blinks a couple of times. Then the screen goes
dialog: blank.
dialog: 
text: Jim looks left.
dialog: 
text: He is now alongside the train. The inside of the windows are
text: smeared with dried blood. Pressed against the glass is the
text: face of a dead man.
dialog: 15.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jim drops the phone and breaks into a run - running past Mark
dialog: and Selena.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
speaker_heading: (HISSING)
dialog: Hey!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GREENWICH COMMON - DAY
dialog: 
text: Jim, Selena and Mark jog across Greenwich Common. Jim
text: gestures towards one of the streets on the far side of the
dialog: green.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
speaker_heading: (LOW VOICE)
dialog: Down there. Westlink Street. Second
text: on the left.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WESTLINK STREET - DAY
dialog: 
text: The street is modest red-brick semi-detached houses. They
text: stand outside Number 43. Jim waits while Selena scans the
text: dark facade.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: If there's anyone in there who
dialog: isn't human...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I understand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Anyone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I understand.
dialog: 
text: Selena shoots a glance at Jim. Jim is gazing at the house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BACK GARDEN - DAY
dialog: 
text: Jim uses the key under the flowerpot to open the back door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Jim, Selena and Mark move quietly through the kitchen and the
text: downstairs of the house.
dialog: 16.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Surprisingly, everything is neat and tidy. Washed plates are
text: stacked by the sink, newspapers on the table are neatly
text: piled. The headline on the top paper reads simply:
scene_heading: CONTAINMENT FAILS.
dialog: 
text: They reach the bottom of the stairs. Selena gestures upwards,
text: and Jim nods. They start to ascend.
dialog: 
text: At the top of the stairs, Selena sniffs the air, and recoils.
text: Jim has noticed it too. His eyes widen in alarm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
speaker_heading: (WHISPERS)
dialog: Wait.
dialog: 
text: But Jim pushes past and advances along the top landing, until
text: he reaches a door. By now the smell is so bad that he is
text: having to cover his nose and mouth with the sleeve of one
dialog: arm.
dialog: 
text: Jim pushes open the door. Inside, two decomposed bodies lie
text: side by side on the bed, intertwined. On the bedside table
text: are an empty bottle of sleeping pills and a bottle of red
dialog: wine.
dialog: 
text: Mark appears behind him. Jim stares at his parents for a
text: couple of moments, then Mark closes the door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Jim sits on the toilet, alone. He is crying. In his hand is a
dialog: piece of paper: "Jim - with endless love, we left you
dialog: sleeping. Now we're sleeping with you. Don't wake up."
dialog: 
text: The paper crumples in his fist.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Jim, Selena and Mark sit in the living room, on the two
text: sofas. Jim looks dazed, uncomprehending. Selena watches Jim,
text: her expression neutral.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: They died peacefully. You should be
dialog: grateful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I'm not grateful.
dialog: 
text: Jim's words hang a moment. Then Mark talks, simply,
text: unemotionally, matter-of-fact throughout.
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: The roads out were all jammed. So
dialog: we went to Paddington Station.
dialog: Hoping: maybe we could get to
dialog: Heathrow, maybe buy our way on a
dialog: plane. My dad had all this cash,
dialog: even though cash was already
dialog: useless, and Mum had her jewellery.
dialog: But twenty thousand other people
dialog: had the same idea.
speaker_heading: (A MOMENT)
dialog: The crowd was surging, and I lost
text: my grip on my sister's hand. I
dialog: remember realizing the ground was
dialog: soft. I looked down, and I was
text: standing on people. Like a carpet,
dialog: people who had fallen, and...
text: somewhere in the crowd there were
text: infected. It spread fast, no one
dialog: could run, all you could do was
dialog: climb. Over more people. So I did
dialog: that. I got up, somehow, on top of
text: a kiosk.
speaker_heading: (A MOMENT)
dialog: Looking down, you couldn't tell
dialog: which faces were infected and which
dialog: weren't. With the blood, the
dialog: screaming, they all looked the
dialog: same. And I saw my dad. Not my mum
dialog: or my sister. But I saw my dad. His
dialog: face.
dialog: 
text: A short silence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Selena's right. You should be
dialog: grateful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: We don't have time to get back to
dialog: the shop before dark. We should
dialog: stay here tonight.
dialog: 
text: Jim nods. He isn't sure what he wants to say.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: My old room was at the end of the
dialog: landing. You two take it. I'll
dialog: sleep down here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: We'll sleep in the same room. It's
dialog: safer.
dialog: 18.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LONDON - DAY TO NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The red orb of the sun goes down; the light fades. As night
text: falls, London vanishes into blackness, with no electric light
dialog: to be seen.
dialog: 
text: Then the moon appears from behind the cloud layer, and the
text: dark city is revealed.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jim is on the sofa. In the moonlight, we can see that his
text: eyes are open, wide awake. Selena is curled on the other
text: sofa, and Mark is on the floor - both asleep. The house is
dialog: silent.
dialog: 
text: Jim watches Selena sleeping for a couple of moments.
dialog: 
text: Then, quietly, he gets off the sofa and pads out of the
text: living room, down the hall to the kitchen.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jim enters, standing just inside the doorway. He looks around
text: the room. On one wall, a faded kid's drawing of a car is
text: framed. Above the counter, on a shelf of cookery books, an
text: album has a handwritten label on the spine: "Mum's Favorite
dialog: Recipes".
dialog: 
text: Jim walks to the fridge. Stuck to the door is a photo of Jim
text: with his parents, arm in arm, smiling at the camera. Jim is
text: on his mountain bike, wearing his courier bag.
dialog: 
scene_heading: FLASH CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Jim, sitting at the kitchen table as his Mum enters, carrying
text: bags of shopping. Jim walks over to the bags and pulls out a
text: carton of orange juice, which he pulls straight to his mouth
text: and begins to gulp down.
dialog: 
text: His Dad walks in from the garden.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM'S DAD
dialog: Give me a glass of that, would you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (draining the carton, and
dialog: giving it a shake)
text: It's empty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jim touches the photo, their faces, lightly.
dialog: 
text: Jim is facing away from the back door, which has a large
text: frosted-glass panel.
dialog: 
text: Through the glass panel, unseen by Jim a dark silhouette
text: looms against the diffused glow from the moonlight.
dialog: 
text: Through the kitchen window, a second silhouette appears.
dialog: 
text: Then there is a scratching noise from the back door.
dialog: 
text: Jim freezes.
dialog: 
text: Slowly, he turns his head, and sees the dark shapes behind
text: the door and window.
dialog: 
text: A beat - then the door is abruptly and powerfully smashed in.
text: It flies open, and hangs loosely held by the bottom hinge.
text: Standing in the doorframe is an Infected Man.
dialog: 
text: Jim shouts with alarm as the Man lunges at him - and they
text: both go tumbling to the floor. At the same moment, the figure
text: behind the kitchen window smashes the glass, and an Infected
text: Teenage Girl starts to clamber through the jagged frame.
dialog: 
text: The Man gets on top of Jim, while Jim uses his arms to hold
text: back the ferocious assault. A single strand of saliva flies
text: from the Man's lips, and contacts Jim's cheek.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
speaker_heading: (SCREAMS)
dialog: Help!
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Selena is there, holding her machete. The blade
text: flashes down to the back of the Man's neck. Blood gushes.
dialog: 
text: Jim rolls the Infected Man off, just in time to see...
dialog: 
text: ...Mark dispatch the Girl half way through the kitchen
text: window. The Girl is holding Mark, but her legs are caught on
text: the broken glass.
dialog: 
text: Mark jabs upwards into the Girl's torso - she stiffens, then
text: slumps, and as Mark steps back we see he is holding a knife.
dialog: 
text: Jim hyperventilates, staring at the corpse on the kitchen
dialog: floor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: It's Mr. Bridges...
dialog: 
text: Selena turns to Jim. She is hyperventilating too, but there
text: is control and steel in her voice.
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Were you bitten?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: He lives four doors down...
dialog: 
text: Jim turns to the Girl sprawled half way through the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: That's his daughter...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Were you bitten?
dialog: 
text: Jim looks at her. Selena is still holding her machete at the
dialog: ready.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: No... No! I wasn't!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Did any of the blood get in your
dialog: mouth?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: No!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Mark?
dialog: 
text: Jim turns to Mark. He is standing in the middle of the room.
text: Stepped away from the window. The Girl's blood is on his arm -
text: and he is wiping it away...
dialog: 
text: ...off the skin... where a long scratch cut wells up fresh
dialog: blood.
dialog: 
text: A moment.
dialog: 
text: Then Mark looks at Selena, as if slightly startled.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Wait.
dialog: 
text: But Selena is swiping with her machete. Mark lifts his arm
text: instinctively, defensively, and the blade sinks in.
dialog: 
text: Selena immediately yanks it back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
speaker_heading: DON'T!
dialog: 
text: Selena swipes again - and the blade catches Mark hard in the
text: side of the head. Mark falls.
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jim watches, scrabbling backwards on the floor away from
text: them, as Selena brutally finishes Mark off.
dialog: 
text: Selena looks at Mark's body for a couple of beats, then
text: lowers the blade. She picks up a dishcloth from the sink
text: counter and tosses it to Jim.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Get that cleaned off.
dialog: 
text: Jim picks up the rag and hurriedly starts to wipe the
text: Infected's blood from around his neck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Do you have any clothes here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (fazed, frightened of her)
dialog: I... I don't know. I think so.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Then get them. And get dressed. We
dialog: have to leave, now.
dialog: 
text: With practiced speed, Selena starts to open the kitchen
text: cupboards, selecting packets of biscuits and cans from the
text: shelves, and stuffing them into her backpack.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: More infected will be coming. They
dialog: always do.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jim and Selena exit the front door. Jim has changed out of
text: his hospital gear into jeans and a sweatshirt. He also has a
text: small backpack, and is carrying a baseball bat.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LONDON ROAD - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jim and Selena walk: fast, alert. But something is not being
text: said between them... until Jim breaks the silence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
speaker_heading: (QUIET)
dialog: How did you know?
dialog: 
text: Selena says nothing. Continues walking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
speaker_heading: (INSISTENT)
dialog: How did you know he was infected?
dialog: 22.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: The blood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: The blood was everywhere. On me, on
dialog: you, and...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
speaker_heading: (CUTTING IN)
dialog: I didn't know he was infected.
dialog: Okay? I didn't know. He knew. I
text: could see it in his face.
speaker_heading: (A MOMENT)
dialog: You need to understand, if someone
dialog: gets infected, you've got somewhere
dialog: between ten and twenty seconds to
dialog: kill them. They might be your
dialog: brother or your sister or your
dialog: oldest friend. It makes no
dialog: difference Just so as you know, if
dialog: it happens to you, I'll do it in a
dialog: heartbeat.
dialog: 
text: A moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: How long had you known him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Five days. Or six. Does it matter?
dialog: 
text: Jim says nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: He was full of plans. Long-distance
text: weapons, so they don't get close. A
text: newsagent's with a metal grill, so
dialog: you can sleep. Petrol bombs, so the
text: blood doesn't splash.
dialog: 
text: Selena looks at Jim dispassionately.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Got a plan yet, Jim? You want us to
dialog: find a cure and save the world? Or
dialog: fall in love and fuck?
dialog: 
text: Selena looks away again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Plans are pointless. Staying alive
dialog: is as good as it gets.
dialog: 
dialog: Silence.
dialog: 23.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: They walk. Jim following a few steps behind Selena.
dialog: 
text: A few moments later, Jim lifts a hand, opens his mouth, about
text: to say something - but Selena cuts him off without even
text: looking round.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Shhh.
dialog: 
dialog: She has seen something...
dialog: 
text: A line of tower blocks some distance away, standing against
text: the night sky. In one of them, hanging in the window of one
text: of the highest stories, colored fairy lights are lit up,
text: blinking gently.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TOWER BLOCK - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jim and Selena walk through the smashed glass doors of the
text: tower block. It is extremely dark inside.
dialog: 
text: Selena switches on a flashlight and illuminates the entrance
text: hall. It is a mess. The floor is covered in broken glass and
text: dried blood. The lift doors are jammed open, and inside is a
text: dense bundle of rags - perhaps an old corpse, but impossible
text: to tell, because the interior of the lift has been torched.
text: It is black with carbon, and smoke-scarring runs up the
text: outside wall.
dialog: 
text: Selena moves the flashlight to the stairwell. There is a huge
text: tangle of shopping trolleys running up the stairs.
dialog: 
text: Selena gives one of the trolleys an exploratory tug. It
text: shifts, but holds fast, meshed in with its neighbor. Then she
text: puts a foot into one of the grates, and lifts herself up.
text: Shining her light over the top of the tangle, she can see a
text: gap along the top.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Let's hope we don't have to get out
dialog: of here in a hurry.
dialog: 
text: She begins to climb through.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TOWER BLOCK - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jim and Selena move steadily and quietly up the stairwell,
text: into the building. Reaching a next landing, they check around
text: the corner before proceeding. Through a broken window, we can
text: see that they are already high above most London buildings,
text: and on the wall a sign reads: LEVEL 5.
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Need a break?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (completely out of breath)
dialog: No. You?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: They continue a few steps.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I do need a break, by the way.
dialog: 
text: Selena nods. They stop on the stairs. Jim slips off his
text: backpack and sits, pulling a face as he does so...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: What's up?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: 
text: She gives him a cut-the-crap expression.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I've got a headache.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Bad?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Pretty bad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Why didn't you say something
dialog: before?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Because I didn't think you'd give a
dialog: shit.
dialog: 
text: A moment, where it's unclear how Selena will react to this.
text: Then she slips off her own backpack.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: (going through the bag)
dialog: You've got no fat on you, and all
dialog: you've had to eat is sugar. So
dialog: you're crashing. Unfortunately,
dialog: there isn't a lot we can do about
dialog: that...
dialog: 25.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Selena starts to produce a wide selection of pills, looted
dialog: from a chemist.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: ...except pump you full
dialog: painkillers, and give you more
dialog: sugar to eat.
dialog: 
text: She holds up a bottle of codeine tablets, and passes it to
dialog: Jim.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: As for the sugar: Lilt or Tango?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
speaker_heading: (CHEWING CODEINE)
dialog: ...Do you have Sprite?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Actually, I did have a can of
dialog: Sprite, but...
dialog: 
text: Suddenly there is a loud scream, coming from somewhere lower
text: down the building. Jim and Selena both make a grab for their
dialog: weapons.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Jesus!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Quiet.
dialog: 
text: The scream comes again. The noise is chilling, echoing up the
text: empty stairwell.
dialog: 
text: But there is something strange about it. The noise is human,
text: but oddly autistic. It is held for slightly too long, and
text: stops abruptly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: That's an infected.
dialog: 
text: Then, the sound of metal scraping, clattering the blockade.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: They're in.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SHOPPING TROLLEY BLOCKADE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Two Infected, a Young Asian Guy and a Young White Guy, moving
text: with amazing speed over the blockade.
dialog: 26.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STAIRS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jim and Selena sprint up the stairs. Behind them, we can hear
text: the Infected, giving chase, howling.
dialog: 
dialog: They pass level eight, nine, ten...
dialog: 
text: Jim is exhausted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Come on!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (out of breath, barely
dialog: able to speak)
dialog: I can't.
dialog: 
text: Selena continues, and Jim looks over the edge of the
text: stairwell, to the landing below...
dialog: 
text: ...where the two Infected appear, tearing around the corner.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Selena sprints up the stairs... and Jim sprints past her, in
text: an amazing burst of energy and speed.
dialog: 
text: They round another bend in the stairwell...
dialog: 
text: ...then both Jim and Selena scream. Standing directly in
text: front of them is a Man In Riot Cop Gear - helmet with full
text: visor, gloves, a riot shield in one hand, and a length of
text: lead pipe in the other.
dialog: 
text: The Man lunges past both of them, barging past, where the
text: Infected White Man has appeared at the stairwell.
dialog: 
text: The Riot Gear Man swings his lead pipe and connects viciously
text: with the White Man's head. The White Man falls backwards
text: against the Asian Man. Both fall back down the stairs.
dialog: 
text: The Riot Gear Man turns back to Jim and Selena.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Down the corridor! Flat 157!
dialog: 
text: Jim and Selena are stunned, but start to run down the
dialog: corridor.
dialog: 
text: The Asian Man is coming back up the stairs. Jim looks back
text: over his shoulder in time to see the Riot Gear Man deliver a
text: massive blow to the Asian Man's head.
dialog: 27.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jim and Selena run towards Flat 157. The door is open, but as
text: they approach, it suddenly slams shut.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM AND SELENA
dialog: (hammering on the door)
dialog: Let us in!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL (O.S.)
dialog: Who is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Let us in!
dialog: 
text: The door opens a fraction, on the chain. The face of a girl
text: appears. She is fourteen, pale, solemn-faced.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Where's Dad?
dialog: 
text: Jim looks back down the corridor.
dialog: 
text: At the far end, the Man appears. He is holding the limp body
text: of one of the Infected - and he tips it over the balcony,
text: where it drops down the middle of the stairwell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
speaker_heading: (CALLS BACK)
dialog: It's okay, Hannah. Let them inside.
dialog: 
text: The door closes, we hear the chain being slipped off, then it
text: opens again.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FLAT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jim and Selena enter past the pale-faced girl. The flat is
text: council, three-bed, sixteenth floor of the block. It has
text: patterned wallpaper, and nice but boring furnishings. It is
text: lit by candles.
dialog: 
text: The entrance hall leads straight to the living room, which
text: has French windows and a small balcony outside.
dialog: 
text: On one wall, a framed photograph hangs, which shows the Man
text: standing beside a black taxi cab. Next to him is a middle
text: aged woman - presumably the Man's wife. Hannah sits at the
text: cab's steering wheel, beaming.
dialog: 
text: Another photo, beside, show Hannah sat in the seat of a go-
dialog: kart.
dialog: 
text: The Man follows Jim and Selena inside.
dialog: 28.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Come in, come in.
dialog: 
text: They follow the Man through to the living room, and Hannah
text: recloses the front door, which has an impressive arrangement
text: of locks and dead-bolts.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: In the living room, the fairy lights hang in the window,
text: powered by a car battery. Lit by their glow, the Man goes
text: through a careful ritual of shedding his gear, helped by
dialog: Hannah.
dialog: 
text: First, he lays down the riot shield. Then he puts the
text: bloodsmeared lead pipe on a small white towel. Next, he
text: removes his gloves - and places them beside the bar on the
text: towel. Then he folds the towel over the weapon and gloves,
text: and puts it beside the riot shield. Finally he removes the
text: visored helmet.
dialog: 
text: Jim and Selena watch him. They look pretty rattled, not
dialog: really knowing what to expect.
dialog: 
text: After the Man has finished shedding his gear, he turns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: So... I'm Frank, anyway.
dialog: 
text: He extends his hand to Jim and Selena. Jim hesitates very
text: briefly, then shakes it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I'm Jim.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Selena.
dialog: 
text: Frank beams, and suddenly he seems much less frightening and
text: imposing. If anything, he is just as nervous as Jim and
dialog: Selena.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Jim and Selena. Good to meet you.
dialog: And this is my daughter, Hannah.
dialog: (turning to Hannah)
dialog: ...Come on, sweetheart. Say hello.
dialog: 
text: Hannah takes a step into the room, but says nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: So... so this is great. Just great.
text: It calls for a celebration.
dialog: 29.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: I'd say. Why don't you all sit
dialog: down, and... Hannah, what have we
dialog: got to offer?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY)
dialog: We've got Mum's creme de menthe.
dialog: 
text: An awkward beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yes, her creme de menthe. Great.
dialog: Look, sit, please. Get comfortable.
dialog: Sit tight while I get it.
dialog: 
text: Frank exits. Selena, Jim and Hannah all stand, until Selena
text: gestures at the sofa.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Shall we?
dialog: 
text: Jim and Selena take the sofa. Hannah stays standing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (O.S.)
dialog: Where are the bloody glasses?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
text: Middle cupboard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (O.S.)
dialog: No! The good ones! This is a
dialog: celebration!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
text: Top cupboard.
dialog: 
text: Another short, uncomfortable pause. Hannah looks at Jim and
text: Selena from her position near the doorway. Her expression is
text: blank and unreadable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: This is your place, then.
dialog: 
text: Hannah nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: It's nice.
dialog: 
text: Hannah nods again.
dialog: 
text: Frank re-enters. Frank is beaming, holding the creme de
dialog: menthe, and four wine glasses.
dialog: 30.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: There! I know it isn't much but...
dialog: well, cheers!

scene_heading: EXT. TOWER BLOCK - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The moon shines above the tower block.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FLAT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jim, Selena and Hannah all sit in the living room, sipping
text: creme de menthe. Frank is disconnecting the fairy lights as
text: he talks, and pulling the curtains closed, rather
text: systematically checking for cracks along the edges.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Normally we keep the windows
text: covered at night, because the light
dialog: attracts them. But when we saw your
dialog: petrol station fire, we knew it had
dialog: to be survivors... So we hooked up
text: the Christmas tree lights. Like a
dialog: beacon.
dialog: 
text: Finished with the sofa, he sits on the armchair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: We're grateful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Well, we're grateful you came. I
dialog: was starting to really worry. Like
dialog: I say, we haven't seen any sign of
dialog: anyone normal for a while now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: There aren't any others in the
dialog: building?
dialog: 
text: Frank shakes his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: And you haven't seen any people
dialog: outside?
dialog: 
text: Frank's eyes flick to Hannah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We haven't left the block for more
dialog: than two weeks. Stayed right here.
dialog: Only sensible thing to do. Everyone
dialog: who went out...
dialog: 31.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Didn't come back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: And there's two hundred flats here.
text: Most of them have a few cans of
dialog: food, or cereal, or something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: It's a good set-up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It isn't bad.
dialog: 
text: He puts a hand on Hannah's shoulder, and gives it a squeeze.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We've got by, haven't we?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jim is in the bathroom, inspecting himself in the mirror. He
text: is just finishing shaving his beard off, and has had to use
text: the razor dry. He has cut himself several times.
dialog: 
text: Jim does a couple of last dry strokes with the razor, and
text: winces as he cuts himself again. He uses spit to wipe away
dialog: the blood.
dialog: 
text: Then, from outside, Frank speaks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (O.S.)
dialog: You okay in there, Jim?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Yes. Fine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (O.S.)
dialog: Sorry we couldn't spare the water
dialog: but... it's the same with the
dialog: toilet. The, er, flush doesn't
dialog: work. I'm afraid you have to use
dialog: the bucket.
dialog: 
text: Jim opens the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Have to empty it each morning. We
dialog: just chuck it over the balcony...
dialog: No mod cons here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: It's fine.
dialog: 32.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: ...Well, look, it's pretty late.
dialog: I'm going to turn in. We've got a
dialog: spare room. Are you and Selena...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I'll take the living room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Oh, right. I mean, yes... So, good
dialog: night then, anyway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Good night, Frank.
dialog: 
text: Frank smiles, and heads to his bedroom.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FLAT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jim feels his way down the dark corridor back to the
text: candlelit living room. Selena is standing by the window. She
text: looks around when Jim enters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
text: Very spruce.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
text: Very shredded.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Uh-huh.
dialog: 
text: Jim sits on the armchair, and Selena moves to look at a
text: picture on the wall - the photo of Frank's family and the
text: black cab.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: So what do you make of them?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: They're desperate. Probably need us
dialog: more than we need them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: ...I think they're good people.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Good people?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 33.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Well, that's nice. But you should
dialog: be more concerned about whether
dialog: they're going to slow you down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Right. Because if they slowed you
dialog: down...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: I'd leave them behind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
text: In a heartbeat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I wouldn't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Then you're going to wind up
dialog: getting yourself killed.
dialog: 
text: A moment. Then Selena stands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: I'm going to get some sleep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Selena - you think I don't get it.
dialog: But I do get it. And I know I'd be
dialog: dead already if I hadn't met you.
dialog: 
text: Selena hesitates at the door - then turns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: No, look - I mean thank you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: And I mean sure. Good night, Jim.
dialog: 
text: She exits, leaving Jim alone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Good night.
dialog: 
text: Jim walks around the room, blowing out the candles. He leaves
text: one burning beside the sofa.
dialog: 34.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Then he slides open the French doors and exits out onto the
dialog: balcony.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The city is spread out in front Jim. In the distance, to the
text: north, the petrol station still burns, sending billowing
text: clouds of sparks high into the night sky.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FLAT - EARLY MORNING
dialog: 
text: Jim sits on the armchair, facing the window, nursing a can of
text: Lilt. Outside, the sky has just started to brighten with
text: first light.
dialog: 
text: Frank enters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Morning, Jim.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Morning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Listen, have you got a minute?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TOWER BLOCK ROOF - EARLY MORNING
dialog: 
text: Frank and Jim appear from a service door. The view over
text: London is spectacular - low clouds catching the sunrise, and
text: a plume of smoke still drifting up from the petrol station
text: blaze. But more noticeable is that the entire roof area is
text: covered in buckets, pans, bowls, plates...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We lost water pressure three weeks
dialog: ago. For a while, I thought we'd be
dialog: okay with the water in the other
text: flats. The cistern and tanks. But
dialog: it vanishes so quick you wouldn't
dialog: believe. You drink it, it
text: evaporates, turns stagnant...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (looking at the pans)
dialog: They're all empty...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It hasn't rained in over a week.
dialog: 
text: Frank sits, watching Jim.
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You can set up a plastic sheet to
text: catch dew and condensation. Trap it
dialog: somehow. I saw it on TV once and
dialog: I've been experimenting, but I
dialog: can't get it to work, and... you
dialog: don't happen to...
dialog: 
text: Jim shakes his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You'd never think it. Needing rain
dialog: so badly... Not in fucking
dialog: England...
dialog: (he breaks off)
dialog: Jim, we don't have enough water for
dialog: and Selena.
dialog: 
text: A moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No. It's not what you think.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FLAT - DAY
dialog: 
text: Jim, Selena, Frank and Hannah all sit in the living room.
text: Frank is on the armchair. On the coffee table in front of him
text: is a small radio. He turns it on - producing a fuzz of radio
dialog: static.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: There haven't been any broadcasts
dialog: for weeks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
speaker_heading: (INTERRUPTING)
dialog: Just listen.
dialog: 
text: They listen. Through the static, the sound of a voice begins
text: to sift through.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: The answer to infection is here...
dialog: if you can hear this, you're not
dialog: alone... there are others like
dialog: you... other survivors... we are
dialog: soldiers, we are armed and we can
dialog: protect you...
dialog: 
text: The Male Voice fades into the static.
dialog: 36.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
speaker_heading: (AMAZED)
dialog: Soldiers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: There's more. Listen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Our location is the forty-second
dialog: blockade, M602, twenty-seven miles
dialog: north-east of Manchester... you
dialog: must find us...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Then it just repeats.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: It's a recording?
dialog: 
text: Frank switches the radio off, and produces a map of Britain,
text: which he opens on the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's a recording. But this is where
dialog: it's telling us to go.
dialog: 
text: Frank points to the location described.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: The North...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: The way things are, we might need
dialog: two or three days to get up there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: We.
dialog: 
text: A moment. Then Frank gives a short, embarrassed laugh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Sound carries in this flat. Jerry-
dialog: built, I suppose, and... me and
dialog: Hannah do need you more than you
dialog: need us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: I wasn't -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's okay. Look, it's the truth. I
dialog: can't leave the block if it's just
dialog: the two of us.
dialog: 37.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: If something happened to me, Hannah
dialog: would be alone. But if we were with
dialog: other people...
dialog: 
text: He lets the sentence hang, gazing at Jim and Selena with
text: undisguised hope.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: If it's a recording, for all we
dialog: know the soldiers who made it are
dialog: dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yes. It's possible.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: And that stuff about the answer to
dialog: infection. There is no answer to
dialog: infection. It's already done pretty
dialog: much all the damage it can.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Maybe they've got a cure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Maybe they've got nothing at all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: The only way to find out is to
dialog: reach them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: We could die trying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Or die here.
dialog: 
text: Hannah speaks so rarely that her interjection seems to take
text: everyone by surprise. Including her. For a moment she looks
text: flustered, but then she continues.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: And anyway, it isn't true what Dad
dialog: said. You need us just the same as
dialog: we need you. We need each other.
dialog: And we'll never be safe in the
dialog: cities, and soldiers could keep us
dialog: safe.
dialog: 
text: She pauses for a breath.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: So we have to try and get there.
dialog: 38.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Get there how?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TOWER BLOCK - DAY
dialog: 
text: A black London cab drives fast out of the tower block's
text: underground garage, bursting into the daylight.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAB - DAY
dialog: 
text: Hannah and Selena sit on the back seat, and Jim sits on the
text: fold-down. Frank smiles, starts the meter running, and leans
text: around to his passengers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Just so as you know. I don't take
dialog: cheques or credit cards.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAB - DAY
dialog: 
text: Frank drives through the destroyed streets of the capital.
dialog: 
text: They pass a stray Infected, through the smashed window of a
text: shop. It's head flicks around at the noise of the cab's
text: engine, and starts to move, but the cab is moving too fast to
dialog: catch.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAB/TUNNEL ENTRANCE - SOUTH - DAY
dialog: 
text: The cab pulls up at the entrance of a tunnel that leads under
dialog: the river Thames.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What do you think?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: It's the most direct route to the
text: other side of the river.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Then we should go the indirect
text: route. The one in broad daylight.
dialog: That isn't underground.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Let's just get it done.
dialog: 39.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Frank floors the accelerator and they head into the tunnel.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAB - DAY
dialog: 
text: Frank drives through the tunnel. Wrecked cars and debris are
text: illuminated in the headlights, and Frank weaves expertly
text: between them. His passengers roll with the movement of the
dialog: cab.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I knew this was a shit idea. You
dialog: know why? Because it was really
dialog: obviously a shit idea. Driving into
text: a dark tunnel, full of smashed cars
dialog: and broken glass is really fucking
dialog: obviously a shit idea.
dialog: 
text: As Jim speaks, out of the gloom, caught in the headlights, a
text: huge pile of cars appears, stretching across the full width
dialog: of the tunnel.
dialog: 
text: Frank slams his foot down on the accelerator.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Oh no.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAB - DAY
dialog: 
text: The cab bumps up onto the barricade and drives over.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAB - DAY
dialog: 
text: The cab bumps down the other side of the barricade, with a
text: cheer from the passengers - but the jubilation only lasts a
text: moment, because the cab his the road hard, on to a carpet of
text: broken glass, and the front left tire blows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: HOLD ON!
dialog: 
text: Frank saws the wheel, but loses control. The cab scrapes
text: along the side of an abandoned car, then slews to a halt.
dialog: 
text: Frank tries accelerating again, but the cab immediately pulls
text: left, back into the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Fuck.
dialog: 
text: Frank jumps out of the cab, and shines his flashlight around
dialog: the tunnel.
dialog: 40.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: The world's worst place to get a
dialog: flat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Agreed. I think we'd better do this
dialog: quick.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - DAY
dialog: 
text: Frank opens the boot and puts the jack into Hannah's hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You know what to do.
dialog: 
text: Hannah immediately runs to the front of the cab and hunches
text: down. Meanwhile, Frank unclips the spare and hauls it out.
dialog: 
text: Jim and Selena stand at the back of the cab, weapons ready,
text: shining their flashlights into the darkness.
dialog: 
text: At the front of the cab, Hannah pumps the jack, but it is
text: moving with aching slowness.
dialog: 
text: At the back of the cab, Jim and Selena wait nervously.
dialog: 
text: There is a noise from further down the tunnel, in the
text: direction which they came. A scrabbling rush of movement -
text: but too quiet to be humans.
dialog: 
text: Jim and Selena exchange a glance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: ...You heard that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (from the front of the
speaker_heading: CAB)
dialog: Heard what?
dialog: 
text: Jim is about to answer. Then is eyes widen. He looks down...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Holy shit.
dialog: 
text: A tide of rats is rushing under their feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: (as the rats rush around
speaker_heading: THEM)
dialog: What the fuck?
dialog: 41.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
text: They're running from the infected.
dialog: 
text: As if in answer, the howls of the Infected echo down the
dialog: tunnel.
dialog: 
text: Hannah desperately positions the jack underneath the cab, as
text: the rates run over her face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hannah, get out, get out!
dialog: (to Jim and Selena)
dialog: Just lift it! LIFT IT!
dialog: 
text: Jim, Selena, and Frank get their hands under the side of the
text: cab, and pull upwards. The cab rises.
dialog: 
text: Hannah, with great skill and speed, fits the new tire, like a
text: pit-stop mechanic at a grand prix.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: (straining with the
speaker_heading: WEIGHT)
dialog: Come on!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Almost there!
dialog: 
text: As Hannah puts an expert twist on the last wheel nut, the
text: cab's back lights pick up the faces of the Infected spilling
text: over the barricade.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
speaker_heading: (SHOUTING)
dialog: Go! Go!
dialog: 
text: They lunge back into the cab, just as the nearest Infected
text: slams against the back window.
dialog: 
text: As the cab races off, Jim leans out the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (at the Infected)
dialog: Fuck you!
dialog: 
text: Frank slams his foot down, and they tear off.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TUNNEL EXIT - NORTH - DAY

speaker_heading: FRANK

dialog: daughter.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAB - DAY
dialog: 
text: The cab drives through London, the meter steadily clocking
text: upwards. Driving, Frank's eyes flick down to the fuel gauge.
text: It is under a quarter full.

text: Green shoots are pushing through the cracks in the pavements
text: and road, as nature begins to reclaim the city.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAB - DAY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Whoa! Stop the cab! Stop the cab!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAB - DAY
dialog: 
text: They have stopped outside of a supermarket. The windows are
text: dark, but unbroken, and it looks as if there is still food on
dialog: the shelves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Un. Believable.
dialog: 
text: She opens the door to the cab, holding her machete.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You're getting out?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: This place hasn't been looted. It's
text: a gold mine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: But we don't know what's in there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Food and drink is what's in there.
dialog: And we need it.

text: Selena gets out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Wait!

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Who's arguing about whisky? I'm

speaker_heading: FRANK

scene_heading: EXT. WESTWAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: The cab sits at the back of an apparent traffic jam leading
text: onto the Westway.
dialog: 
text: Both sides of the dual carriageway are jam-packed with
text: abandoned cars, a deserted gridlock. All cars point in the
text: same direction - out of town. Some of the cars are crashed,
text: riding up on each other, rolled over, burned out.
dialog: 
text: As the camera rises upwards, we can see that the gridlock
text: snakes along the entire distance of the flyover. Like the

text: Frank, Jim, and Selena begin to walk towards the service
text: station, holding their weapons at the ready.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LAY-BY - DAY
dialog: 
text: Cautiously, Frank, Jim and Selena approach the truck. There
text: is no sign of life around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Stay close, Jim.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: ...What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: You heard.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TRUCK - DAY
dialog: 
text: While Jim and Selena stand guard, Frank works quickly. He
text: prises the fuel cap off, inserts the tube, sucks into the
text: tube, and spits as the diesel begins to flow into the jerry
dialog: can.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAB - DAY
dialog: 
text: Hannah watches from the driver's seat. She has her hands on
text: the wheel, and is sliding her hands over the plastic, making
text: a series of imaginary turns, shifting gears...
dialog: 48.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TRUCK - DAY
dialog: 
text: As they wait for the can to fill, Jim tosses his bat into the
text: air, giving it a single flip, catching it as the handle comes
dialog: back around...being a bit flash.
dialog: 
text: Selena notices, and does not look impressed.
dialog: 
text: Almost in response to her nonplussed gaze, Jim begins to walk
text: towards the cafe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Where are you going?
dialog: 
text: Jim points his bat in the direction of the cafe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: We've got enough food.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: We don't have any cheeseburgers.
speaker_heading: (TO HIMSELF)
dialog: "Stay close." It's like going on
dialog: holiday with your fucking aunt.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAFE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Jim walks inside the cafe, and finds the aftermath of
text: carnage. Decomposed bodies lie scattered, on and under
text: tables: a couple of men, a female cook, and a young family.
dialog: 
text: Jim walks towards the family.
dialog: 
text: The father sits wedged between the seats and the table, which
text: are both bolted to the floor. His neck is snapped, head
text: hanging backwards.
dialog: 
text: The mother lies a couple of feet away, on the floor, half
text: over an infant, as if in a final protective gesture.
dialog: 
text: Jim looks down at them.
dialog: 
text: Then there is a noise behind.
dialog: 
text: Instinctively Jim snaps around, swinging the bat as he does
text: so - and connects against a small body, which flies
dialog: backwards.
dialog: 
text: Only then do we - and Jim - see what he has hit. Crumpled,
text: motionless on the ground is an Infected Kid, an eight year
dialog: old boy.
dialog: 
text: A moment. Jim looks stunned, appalled.
dialog: 49.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Then the Infected Kid's eyes flick open. Still alive.
dialog: 
text: Jim's baseball bat swings down.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TRUCK - DAY
dialog: 
text: The can is full. Frank removes the tube.
dialog: 
text: Jim appears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Find anything.
dialog: 
text: Jim says nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Find anything, Jim?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: Selena lets it pass - and the moment is broken as Frank
text: stands with the can.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay. We're done.
dialog: 
text: He lifts a hand to Hannah.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAB - DAY
dialog: 
text: Hannah smiles, turns the ignition, and throws the cab into
dialog: gear.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FORECOURT - DAY
dialog: 
text: The cab tears towards Jim, Selena and Frank, then - at the
text: last moment - flips into a handbrake turn, and drifts to a
text: neat stop, a couple of meters from them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (leaning out of the
speaker_heading: WINDOW)
dialog: I am a cab driver's daughter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You're Ayrton Senna's bloody
dialog: daughter.
dialog: 50.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAB - DAY
dialog: 
text: The cab drives down the motorway, fuel needle pressed up
text: against the full mark. The meter runs up a tab of over three
dialog: hundred pounds...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAB - DAY
dialog: 
text: They pass a sign for MANCHESTER - 130 MILES.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAB - DAY
dialog: 
text: The occupants have settled into the reflective silence of a
dialog: long drive.
dialog: 
text: Selena seems lost in thought. She looks at Jim, who has his
text: hand stuck out the window, and is using his hand like an
text: aerofoil, catching the wind, dipping and rising.
dialog: 
text: Then she looks at Frank, and notices...
dialog: 
text: ...Frank glance in the rear-view mirror at Hannah, who
text: catches her dad's eye. Frank smiles, and gives her a wink.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAB - DAY
dialog: 
text: The cab drives along A-roads.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAB - LATE AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: Jim is looking through some of the bags of food.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Who's unbelievably hungry?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Me.
dialog: 
text: Jim looks out of the window. They are in completely empty,
text: rolling countryside, stretching for miles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Let's have a picnic.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PICNIC SPOT - LATE AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: They have stopped in a beautiful spot, quite high, clear
text: view. It is a beautiful day. The late afternoon sunshine is
text: bright over the green fields, trees cast long shadows.
dialog: 51.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Everyone is happily sat on the grass, eating from their
dialog: hoard.
dialog: 
text: Jim has pulled open a packet of stale hot-cross bun; Hannah
text: empties a packet of Maltesers into her mouth; Frank holds a
text: block of cheddar, taking bites from the cheese as if it were
text: cake ; Selena drinks from a can of tinned peaches, swallowing
text: the pieces almost whole, with the juice running down her
dialog: chin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Oh my God, yes. I can taste the
dialog: vitamin C. I can feel it in my
dialog: blood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (cracking a bun in half)
dialog: These are great. They're like huge
dialog: biscuits.
dialog: 
text: He offers half to Hannah, who takes a bite.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: It's true. They are like biscuits.

speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: JIM
speaker_heading: (SWALLOWING)
dialog: I said, the raisins are still

dialog: 
text: Selena and Hannah laugh again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hey.
dialog: 
text: Everyone turns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Look over there.
dialog: 52.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Some distance away, in the fields below, a group of three
text: horses - two adults and a foal - are galloping over the
text: fields as if wild. A majestic and surreal sight, and it
text: somehow implies the way the world will change.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Do you think they're infected?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No. I think they're doing just
dialog: fine.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FIELDS - LATE AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: The horses gallop, leaping a stone wall, and away.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PICNIC SPOT - SUNSET
dialog: 
text: The meal has been eaten. Frank sits, playing with his radio,
text: trying to listen to the faint broadcast. Beside him, Hannah
text: lies on her back, eyes closed.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FENCE GATE - SUNSET
dialog: 
text: Jim and Selena have walked a little distance away from the
text: others, and are sitting on a fence gate, looking over the
dialog: view.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You know what I was thinking?
dialog: 
text: Selena considers this a moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: You were thinking that you'll never
dialog: hear another piece of original
dialog: music ever again. You'll never read
dialog: a book that isn't already written.
dialog: Or see a film that isn't already
dialog: shot.
dialog: 
text: Jim smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: That's what you were thinking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: No... I was thinking I was wrong.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: About what?
dialog: 53.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Selena doesn't reply for a moment. Then she turns to look at
text: Frank and Hannah - who look oddly normal, surrounded by the
text: food wrappers from the picnic, Frank listening to the radio.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: All the death, all the shit - it
dialog: doesn't really mean anything for
dialog: Frank and Hannah. Because she's got
dialog: her dad, and he's got his daughter,
dialog: so... it's okay.
dialog: 
text: A beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: (looking back at Jim)
dialog: I was wrong when I told you that
dialog: staying alive is as good as it
dialog: gets.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
speaker_heading: (SMILES)
dialog: That's what I was thinking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: ...Was it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Uh-huh. You stole my thought.
dialog: 
text: Selena leans over and gives Jim a light kiss on the cheek.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: (smiling back at Jim)
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (slightly surprised, but
speaker_heading: PLEASED)
dialog: Ah, keep it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PICNIC SPOT - SUNSET
dialog: 
text: Frank switches off the radio. He looks over at Hannah, who is
text: dozing peacefully, then over to Jim and Selena.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
speaker_heading: (CALLING)
dialog: It's getting late. We should stay
dialog: here the night.
dialog: 
text: Jim raises a hand in reply.
dialog: 54.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAB/PICNIC SPOT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The cab sits, parked up at the picnic spot. Jim, Selena,
text: Frank and Hannah lie beside it, wrapped in their jackets,
text: using their small backpacks as pillows.
dialog: 
text: The moon is bright, and only Selena is asleep...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Can't sleep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Nor can I. It doesn't feel safe,
dialog: outdoors like this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I think we're safe enough.
dialog: 
text: A couple of moments pass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: ...Selena didn't seem to have any
dialog: trouble.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I know. I noticed that too.
text: (reaching over and shaking
scene_heading: SELENA'S SHOULDER)
dialog: Selena...Selena!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
scene_heading: (EXTREMELY DROWSY)
dialog: What... what is it...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: How did you manage to get to sleep?
dialog: 
text: Selena gives a dozy grumble, then sits up, reaches into her
text: backpack, and pulls out several bottles of pills. She hands
text: one of them to Jim.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Bloody hell. You must have needed a
dialog: hell of a prescription for that
dialog: lot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
speaker_heading: (DROWSY)
dialog: I didn't need a prescription. I'm a
dialog: qualified chemist.
dialog: 
text: She drops back down and goes straight back to sleep.
dialog: 55.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (inspecting the bottle)
dialog: Valium. Great. Not only will it get
dialog: us to sleep, but if we get attacked
dialog: during the night, we won't even
dialog: care.
dialog: (pops the lid)
dialog: Two each?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Not for me, thanks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
speaker_heading: (INDICATING HANNAH)
dialog: What about...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Can I, Dad?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
speaker_heading: (DOUBTFUL)
dialog: I don't know, honey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Da-ad, plee-ease. I can't sleep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: All right, all right. Give her half

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM'S VALIUM DREAM
dialog: 
text: Jim is riding his bike through the city. It's London back to
text: normal, pre-infection. Busy streets, traffic, pedestrians,
text: car horns, radios playing.
dialog: 
text: Jim rides fast, his courier bag over his shoulder, weaving
text: between cars, shooting a red light, turning a corner into...
dialog: 
text: Gower Street. Suddenly, a car pulls out into Jim's path. The
text: car brakes hard, and Jim brakes hard, skidding...
dialog: 
text: ...and the two miss each other by a whisker.
dialog: 
text: The Driver flashes into road rage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE DRIVER
dialog: You stupid cunt!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Fuck you!
dialog: 56.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The Driver flips Jim the finger, and accelerates away.
dialog: 
text: Jim remains stopped by the pavement, one foot down for
text: balance, breathing hard. Pedestrians pass. Groups of people,
text: everyday people, walking by.
dialog: 
text: Jim watches them, noticing their faces. Some talk to each
text: other, or into mobile phones. Some smile, or walk lost in
dialog: thought.
dialog: 
text: After a few moments, Jim sets off again, seemingly
text: distracted, still watching pedestrians' faces...then two of
text: the faces seem to catch his attention. A man and a woman,
text: middle-aged, chatting.
dialog: 
dialog: His parents.
dialog: 
text: Jim's head turns as he passes them, confusion on his face,
text: his bike drifting into another lane...
dialog: 
text: ...into the path of a second car. The car that hit him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAB/PICNIC SPOT - NIGHT
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY)
dialog: Hey.
dialog: 
text: Frank's hand is on Jim's shoulder. Jim stirs, half-wakes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (confused, semi-conscious)
dialog: What...
dialog: 
text: Frank is sitting beside him - and we see for the first time
text: that Frank is awake, keeping guard over them while they
dialog: sleep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Shh. You're having a bad dream,
dialog: that's all.
dialog: 
text: Jim's face relaxes a little.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (mumbled, half-asleep
speaker_heading: ALREADY)
dialog: Okay, Dad.
dialog: 
text: Frank raises his eyebrows, then smiles.
dialog: 57.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAB/PICNIC SPOT - EARLY MORNING
dialog: 
text: Jim is sitting up. The others are all awake. Frank bouncing
text: the repaired flat tire to check it, Hannah slipping on a
text: fresh sweatshirt from her backpack, Selena leaning against
text: the cab, chewing on a chocolate bar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Here you go, Frank. This is how you
dialog: catch dew. I'm covered in the
dialog: fucking stuff.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (packing the spare away)
dialog: Okay. Let's get rolling.
dialog: (he checks his watch)
dialog: If we make good time, we'll be
text: there before midday.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MOTORWAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: The cab is driving, towards us, then slows to a halt.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAB - DAY
dialog: 
text: Everyone is looking at something ahead of them. They seem
text: awestruck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Bloody hell...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It must be Manchester.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: But, the whole of Manchester. The
dialog: whole city...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
text: No fire crews to put it out.
dialog: 
text: We see what they are looking at...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAB - DAY
dialog: 
text: On the horizon ahead, there is the glow of a truly massive
text: fire. The smoke spreads into the sky like the plume from a
text: vast, spreading volcano crater. The city burning.
dialog: 58.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAB - DAY
dialog: 
text: The cab drives towards the surreal sight. As they drive, pale
text: flakes begin to fall, drifting past the windows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: It can't be...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Is it snow?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: (hitting the windscreen
speaker_heading: WIPERS)
text: It's ash.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAB - DAY - ASH FALL
dialog: 
text: The cab drives through the ash fall. Through the soft
text: blizzard, they pass a sign for: MANCHESTER - 14 MILES (in the
text: opposite lane). The city is behind them.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MOTORWAY - DAY - ASH FALL
dialog: 
text: The cab drives down a motorway. The ash is still falling, and
text: they start to pass bodies by the roadside.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAB - DAY - ASH FALL
dialog: 
text: Inside the cab there is a sense of real anticipation.
text: Everyone is sitting up, scanning the road ahead.
dialog: 
text: Then they come over the brow of a hill, and the ash-fall
text: clears like mist parting, to reveal...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay, everyone. I think this is it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MOTORWAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: Fifty meters down, the road is blockaded. It is obviously a
text: military construction - hurriedly put together, but expertly
dialog: built.
dialog: 
text: Behind rolls of razor wire are fifteen foot sheets of
text: corrugated iron, held upright by scaffold pipes. In the
text: middle of the blockade there is a gap wide enough to get a
text: vehicle through, but concrete blocks force a chicane.
dialog: 59.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: On either side of the road there are sandbag nests. On the
text: corrugated iron, white painted words read: 42ND BLOCKADE. But
text: despite the impressive construction, there is no sign of
dialog: movement or life.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAB - DAY
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Try the horn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Don't. We might attract the wrong
dialog: kind of attention.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. 42ND BLOCKADE - DAY
dialog: 
text: The cab rolls slowly towards the blockade - past many more
text: bodies, Infected, rotting.
dialog: 
text: It reaches the chicane, and eases around the concrete blocks.
text: Then it passes through the gap in the corrugated barrier. On
text: the other side of the blockade, canvas tents have been
text: erected on the grass verge, and two transporter trucks are
text: parked. A few packing crates and tarpaulins are also
text: scattered around. But still no signs of life. The blockade
text: appears to have been abandoned.
dialog: 
text: Franks slows to a halt, but keeps the engine running.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAB - DAY
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What do you think?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
text: It looks deserted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Or overrun.
dialog: 
text: Frank flicks the radio on - there is only static. He switches
text: it off again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Let's check it out.
dialog: 60.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. 42ND BLOCKADE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Everyone exits the cab, holding their various weapons. Jim
text: has his baseball bat, Selena has her machete, and Frank has
dialog: his lead pipe...
dialog: 
text: Cautiously, they begin to explore. They first head over to
text: the grass verge and the tents. In front of one of them,
text: Hannah picks up a Bergen backpack. She upends it, and a few
text: clothes fall out.
dialog: 
text: Frank moves past her, and carefully pulls back the tent flaps
text: - machete at the ready. Inside, there is a small table, and
text: maps and papers are strewn across the floor. And a radio.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: I don't understand. Did they leave?
dialog: 
text: Jim pushes open the flaps of another tent with his baseball
dialog: bat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: They didn't all leave.
dialog: 
text: Inside, several body bags lie, buzzing with flies.
dialog: 
text: Selena stands several feet away, by one of the packing cases.
text: She pulls out a tangle of camouflage webbing, then lets it
text: drop back inside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: I don't like this. I think we
dialog: should go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
speaker_heading: (SUDDENLY SNAPPING)
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: (COMPOSES HIMSELF)
dialog: The vehicles. We should check the
dialog: vehicles first. There has to be
dialog: something...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VEHICLES - DAY
dialog: 
text: Frank jumps down from the back of one of the trucks. Like the
text: others, like everything else it is empty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Nothing. Nothing here. I can't
dialog: believe it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Frank.
dialog: 61.
dialog:

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: "We should go."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
speaker_heading: (EXPLODING)
dialog: Go fucking where? What the fuck are
dialog: we supposed to do? How is this
dialog: going to fucking end? It's never
dialog: going to -
dialog: 
text: Frank cuts himself off. Then, turning from the others, he
text: walks away.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BLOCKADE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Frank walks underneath the archway of one of the blockade
text: structures, and sits down. Needing to be alone.
dialog: 
text: His head sinks, staring at the ground beneath his legs. A
text: couple of moments later he looks up - and sees that sitting
text: opposite of him, on the other side of the archway, almost
text: mirroring his posture and position, is a dead Infected.
dialog: 
text: The corpse of the Infected sits gazing back at Frank with
text: sightless eyes.
dialog: 
text: A moment between the two of them. A blank-faced exchange.
dialog: 
text: Frank looks left and sees the corpse of another Infected, a
text: few feet beyond the blockade. And another, beyond it. And
text: another, a few more feet to the right.
dialog: 
text: Then Frank looks upwards. Above him, on the walkway of the
text: blockade, another corpse lies. And this corpse is swarmed
text: with crows, picking at it.
dialog: 
text: Frank gets up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Get out it.
scene_heading: (SUDDENLY SHOUTING)
dialog: GET OUT OF IT!
dialog: 
text: He bends, picks up a rock and throws it, but misses, sailing
text: past them.
dialog: 
text: In a rage again, Frank goes under the blockade and starts to
text: kick it. The scaffold clangs, vibrates, and - startled - the
text: crows lift off from the mutilated corpse and fly...
dialog: 62.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: ...dislodging, or disrupting, a single droplet of blood from
text: the corpse, that rolls off the neck, and begins to fall
text: downwards.
dialog: 
text: Down... to where Frank gazes upwards.
dialog: 
text: The droplet splashes, pinpoint perfect, on Frank's eye.
dialog: 
text: Frank frowns, his hand immediately going to his face. The
text: fingers come away, with the tiny smear of red.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Dad... are you okay?
dialog: 
text: Frank turns. Hannah is there, with Jim. Selena stands a
dialog: little way further back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I... I'm fine, honey. I'm sorry. I
dialog: just lost my temper. I...
dialog: 
text: He breaks off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: ...What?
dialog: 
text: Frank frowns. A hand goes to his temple.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hannah...
dialog: 
text: Abruptly, the color is draining from his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
speaker_heading: (TO HANNAH)
dialog: Get away from me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: ...Dad?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Get away from me!
speaker_heading: (TO JIM)
dialog: Get her away from me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (moving to Frank)
dialog: Why? What's...
dialog: 
text: Frank lashes out and shoves Hannah away, knocking her back to
dialog: the ground.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: GET AWAY FROM ME!
dialog: 63.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A trickle of blood runs out of Frank's nose. Then he doubles
text: up, clutching the side of his head. He screams with pain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Jim...
dialog: (breaking into a run)
dialog: Jim, he's infected!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: No! No!
dialog: 
text: Hannah lunges towards her dad, but is caught by Selena.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: (holding Hannah back)
dialog: Jim!
dialog: 
text: But Jim is frozen, holding his baseball bat.
dialog: 
text: Frank screams again. Then drops to his knees.
dialog: 
text: Hannah struggles with Selena, trying to get to Frank.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Dad!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Jim!
dialog: 
text: Jim is still frozen, baseball bat half-raised.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
speaker_heading: KILL HIM!
dialog: 
text: And Frank looks up, his face contorted. The infection has
dialog: taken hold.
dialog: 
text: And at that moment there is a rifle report, a rush of air,
text: and a rapid thump of impact.
dialog: 
text: Frank falls forwards to the tarmac.
dialog: 
text: A moment of silence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: ...Dad?
dialog: 
text: Selena lets Hannah go.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, the GUNFIRE comes again. Three shots in quick
text: succession - into Frank's motionless body.
dialog: 
text: In a daze, Hannah starts towards her dead father.
dialog: 64.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLIFTON
dialog: STAY AWAY FROM HIM!
dialog: 
text: They all turn to see three British soldiers standing by a
text: jeep. One of the soldiers (Farrell) advances, with his gun
text: still raised, while the others (Mitchell and Clifton) hold
text: back giving cover.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: Get away from the man! NOW!
dialog: 
text: Jim steps towards Hannah and grabs her, pulling her away from
text: Frank's body. She doesn't struggle. She is in a state of
text: absolute shock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY)
dialog: Jesus.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - DAY
dialog: 
text: A jeep drives down a small road - away from the blockade.
text: Jim, Selena and Hannah sit in the back. Behind is the cab,
text: driven by the Sergeant. A little way ahead of them, the
text: walled grounds of a huge country mansion appear.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT DRIVEWAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: From a cast-iron gated entrance, a gravel driveway leads up
text: to the impressive country mansion, surrounded by a high
text: perimeter wall. The grounds show acres of lawn and flower
dialog: beds. These have obviously had many years of very careful
text: cultivation and attention, but now are just starting to look
text: unkempt and overgrown.
dialog: 
text: The jeep pulls up by the front steps. Waiting there is
text: another soldier, a major. Like the other soldiers, he is
text: unshaven, but has the authority of command about him, even in
text: the relaxed way that he stands.
dialog: 
text: As Jim, Selena and Hannah dismount from the jeep, he
text: appraises them. Then speaks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I'm Major Henry West. Welcome.
dialog: We've got beds with clean sheets
text: and a boiler that produces hot
dialog: water. So you can all have a
dialog: shower. You look like you need one.
dialog: 
text: Jim, Selena, and tear-streaked Hannah gaze back at Henry
text: blankly.
dialog: 65.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SHOWER - DAY
dialog: 
text: Jim has a shower, sees the cab driving round in circles
text: outside the shower window, then...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MANSION - DAY
dialog: 
text: Jim walks down a sweeping staircase to the front hall.
text: Scattered around are various bits of military gear. A pair of
text: muddy boots, a jacket, assorted kit, webbing, etc.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VERANDA - DAY
dialog: 
text: Henry is sitting, looking out over the back lawn.
dialog: 
text: Pulling back, we see Jim is with him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You heard our broadcast.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: We must be a disappointment. You
dialog: were hoping for a full brigade. An
text: army base, with helicopters and
dialog: field hospitals.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: We were hoping for...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: The answer to infection. Well, as I
dialog: said, it's here. Though it may not
dialog: be quite what you imagined.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I didn't know what to imagine,
dialog: so... We just feel lucky to have
dialog: found you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You were lucky. The fire drove
dialog: hundreds of infected out of
text: Manchester. The surrounding area is
text: teeming with them.
dialog: 
text: Henry glances back at Jim.
dialog: 66.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: But there's no need for you to
dialog: worry. We're well protected here.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN - DAY
dialog: 
text: Henry shows Jim around the grounds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Three-sixty visibility. Flat
text: terrain all around the house...
dialog: Floodlights, which we've rigged up
dialog: to a generator. Don't like to waste
dialog: the fuel, but when we want to, we
dialog: can turn night into day.
dialog: 
dialog: Moving on...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: High perimeter wall, which helps,
dialog: and we've been lacing the grounds
text: with trip wires and land mines.
dialog: 
text: Henry indicates where Farrell, Smith and Davis can be seen,
text: running a trip wire.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You wouldn't want to go mowing the
dialog: lawn, but if they get in, we hear
dialog: them.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MANSION - LOWER LEVELS - DAY
dialog: 
text: Henry leads Jim into the basement level of the mansion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Secondary to protection, our real
dialog: job is to rebuild. Start again.
dialog: Down here is the wood-fired boiler
dialog: that provides us with hot water.
dialog: Our first step to civilization.
dialog: 
dialog: Then to a kitchen...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: And here, the kitchen.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MANSION - KITCHEN - DAY
dialog: 
text: Several of the soldiers are unpacking the food bags from the
text: cab. One of the soldiers, Jones, is wearing an apron.
dialog: 67.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: What are you cooking, Jones?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: It's a surprise, sir!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MAILER'S PIT - DAY
dialog: 
text: Henry leads Jim into a small courtyard, hanging with
text: bloodstained laundry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: And finally...
dialog: 
text: The laundry starts to billow - and with it we hear the sound
text: of rushing movement. As a darkly stained sheet is ripped
text: aside, an Infected is revealed only a few feet away.
dialog: 
text: Jim jumps back, but Henry stays put - as the Infected is
text: suddenly jerked backwards by a chain around its neck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: ...meet Mailer.
dialog: 
text: Mailer is uniformed. A soldier. Apart from the chain around
text: his neck, he is gagged with a filthy and blood-blackened rag
text: tied tight into his mouth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Mailer, Jim. Jim, Mailer. Got
dialog: infected three days ago. Mitchell
dialog: managed to knock him out cold. Got
text: a chain around his neck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You're keeping him alive?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: The idea was to learn something
dialog: about infection. Have him teach me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: And has he?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: In a way.
speaker_heading: (KNEELS)
dialog: He's teaching me he'll never bake
dialog: bread. Plant crops, raise
dialog: livestock. He's telling me he's
dialog: futureless. And eventually he'll
dialog: tell me how long the infected take
dialog: to starve to death.
dialog: 68.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Dinner's at seven. Don't forget to
dialog: tell the girls.
dialog: 
text: Henry exits, leaving Jim with Mailer.
dialog: 
text: Mailer lunges at Jim - a moment between them.
dialog: 
text: Then Jim exits.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Carefully, Jim opens the door to the girls' bedroom. Inside
text: is Hannah lying on the bed, face covered, on her side. Selena
text: lies behind her, her arm lying protectively over Hannah's
dialog: body.
dialog: 
text: Selena looks around, sees Jim, and puts a finger to her lips.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jim and Selena enter, and close the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: ...So how is she?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: She's lost her dad. That's how she
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: (A MOMENT)
dialog: It's all fucked, Jim.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly Selena looks as if she's on the verge of tears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Hey, don't...do that. Look,
dialog: Hannah... Hannah's what Frank said
dialog: she was. Tough. Strong. And just
dialog: like me, just like you, she will
dialog: cope...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Shut up, Jim. Just shut up. I don't
dialog: want her to fucking cope. I want
dialog: her to be okay. And when Hannah had
dialog: her dad, it was all okay. Remember?
dialog: And when it was okay for them, it
dialog: was okay for us. And now it's all
dialog: fucked.
dialog: 69.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Then Selena's tears are flowing.
dialog: 
text: Jim seems to want to reply, but doesn't have the words.
dialog: 
text: Instead, he lifts Selena's face and kisses her on the lips...
dialog: 
dialog: ... a moment.
dialog: 
text: Then Selena pushes him a away.
dialog: 
text: Selena leaves the room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MANSION - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A surreal scene.
dialog: 
text: Dinner, with full silver service, candles, wine and crystal
text: glasses, napkins, and everyone rather formally sitting while
text: Jones lays food on the table, wearing an apron over his
dialog: uniform.
dialog: 
text: Made all the more surreal by Jim and Selena's grubby clothes,
text: and Hannah's dazed, tear-streaked face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: So, what have we here? Tinned ham,
dialog: tinned peas, and omelette. You've
dialog: prepared a feast, Jones.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Honor of our guests, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Absolutely. I was going to suggest
dialog: a toast, but this omelette will do
dialog: just as well.
dialog: (cuts off a chunk of
dialog: omelette and raises it)
dialog: To new friends.
dialog: 
text: Henry pops the omelette in his mouth, then promptly spits it
dialog: out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Jones, did you notice while cooking
dialog: that these eggs are off?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: I thought the salt might cover the
dialog: taste, sir.
dialog: 70.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (pushing his plate away)
dialog: Get rid of it.
dialog: 
text: Henry turns to Hannah as Jones sheepishly exits, carrying the
dialog: omelette.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I don't suppose you can cook, can
dialog: you? I can't tell you how badly we
dialog: need someone who shows a little
text: flair in the kitchen.
dialog: 
text: Hannah ignore/is unaware of Henry's attempt to bring her out
dialog: of her shell.
dialog: 
text: Meanwhile, the soldiers start helping themselves to the other
text: food on the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: That's a fucking disappointment.
dialog: When I saw those eggs, I thought it
dialog: was Christmas.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: We'll have eggs again. Once
text: everything's back to normal.
dialog: 
text: The soldiers pause. Exchange glances. Then burst out
text: laughing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Listen to him! He's still waiting
text: for Marks and Spencer's to reopen.
dialog: 
text: More laughter at Bell - interrupted by the sergeant, Farrell,
text: who conspicuously is not joining in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: I think Bell's got a point. If you
dialog: look at the whole life of the
dialog: planet, man has only been around
dialog: for a few blinks of an eye. So if
dialog: the infection wipes us all out,
dialog: that is a return to normality.
dialog: 
text: Farrell turns to Bell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: Is that what you meant, Bell?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: Uh...yeah.
dialog: 71.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (to Jim and Selena)
dialog: Have you met our new-age sergeant?
speaker_heading: (TO FARRELL)
dialog: Remind me, Farrell, why exactly did
dialog: you join the army in the first
dialog: place.
dialog: 
text: A moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: This is what I've seen in the four
dialog: weeks since infection. People
dialog: killing people. Which is much what
dialog: I saw in the four weeks before
dialog: infection, and the four weeks
dialog: before that, and before that, as
dialog: far back as I care to remember...
dialog: People killing people. Which to my
dialog: mind puts us in a state of
dialog: normality right now.
dialog: 
text: Selena turns to Hannah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
speaker_heading: (QUIET)
dialog: You're not eating.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: I don't want to eat.
dialog: 
text: Henry picks up on their exchange.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You must eat, Hannah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: I don't want to eat. I want to bury
dialog: my dad. He's one of the people
dialog: you're talking about.
dialog: 
text: A silence over the dinner table.
dialog: 
text: Broken by the thud of a mine detonation.
dialog: 
dialog: Then...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: Stand to!
dialog: 
text: And suddenly all the soldiers are kicking back their chairs,
text: jumping to their feet. Producing SA-80s that they had under
dialog: the table.
dialog: 72.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MANSION - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Farrell, Jones, Mitchell, Bedford, Smith and Clifton race out
text: of the house, fanning, dropping into position.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Go, go, go!
dialog: 
text: Two more soldiers, Davis and Bell, fire from window positions
text: on the mansion's first floor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: Jones! Cover right!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Three o'clock! Three o'clock!
dialog: 
text: Coming across the grounds are four Infected, sprinting across
text: the lawn towards the house. Immediately, one of them is
text: catapulted into the air by an explosion under its feet - a
dialog: mine.
dialog: 
text: The soldiers open fire, Jones closing his eyes as he pulls
dialog: the trigger.
dialog: 
text: The three remaining Infected are cut down - one hit in the
text: head by Smith, another folding under a burst from Farrell,
text: the last falling under fire from Mitchell, landing face down
text: on a mine which explodes onto its chest.
dialog: 
text: Chunks of Infected spin into the air, then patter down like a
text: light rain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
speaker_heading: (DELIGHTED)
dialog: That was mad! Did you see that!
dialog: That was fucking mad!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARRELL
speaker_heading: (ANGRY)
dialog: Clear!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Clear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
speaker_heading: (STILL LAUGHING)
dialog: Clear.
speaker_heading: (TO JONES)
dialog: Fuck me, I never saw that before.
text: Keeled over and - bam! Gone, like
dialog: fucking magic.
dialog: 73.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SMITH
text: I drew a lovely bead. One shot.
text: Right between its eyes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jim stands, looking out of the open French windows at the
dialog: soldiers.
dialog: 
text: Selena is standing behind him. She is holding her machete.
dialog: 
text: The soldiers bounce in. Mitchell and Smith in particular are
text: hyped from their adrenaline rush.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
text: It was all hanging in the air, and
dialog: all these bits coming down, and...
dialog: 
text: Mitchell catches sight of Selena holding her machete.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Hello.
dialog: 
text: He heads towards her, and takes the machete from her hands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I'll tell you what: you don't need
dialog: this penknife any more, sweetie.
dialog: I'm here to protect you now.
text: (winks at the other
speaker_heading: SOLDIERS)
dialog: But listen, if you want to hold a
text: huge chopper...
dialog: 
text: Bedford bursts out laughing, and Selena grabs her machete
dialog: back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Whoa! Feisty!
dialog: 
text: He gives her a slap on the backside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Fuck you!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: You bet. How about right now?
dialog: 
text: Now doubly hyped. Mitchell reaches forward and pulls up the
text: hem of Selena's T-shirt. She yelps and twists, knocking back
text: his hand.
dialog: 74.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Yeah! A little rough stuff!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARRELL
speaker_heading: MITCHELL!
dialog: 
text: But Farrell clearly has little command over Mitchell, who
text: tries again for Selena's T-shirt, still laughing.
dialog: 
text: Jim snaps.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
speaker_heading: (ANGRILY GRABBING
speaker_heading: MITCHELL)
dialog: Cut it out!
dialog: 
text: And Mitchell turns immediately on Jim, his sexual charge
text: flipping seamlessly back to violence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
text: (grabbing Jim, propelling
text: him back across the room,
dialog: up against a wall)
dialog: Easy, tiger. You don't want to go
dialog: picking a fight with me.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly Farrell is behind Mitchell. We see a movement (a
text: kidney punch), and Mitchell drops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (gasping, on the ground)
dialog: Ahh, you cunt. Cunt.
dialog: 
text: Then - as if through sixth sense, sensing a presence, all
text: turn. Henry is standing in the doorway.
dialog: 
text: A moment. Then Henry turns to Mitchell - who has picked
text: himself up, and is clutching his side, breathing hard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Corporal, first point of order
text: after an attack.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Re-secure the perimeter, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Then get to it. Jones, Bedford, go
dialog: with him.
speaker_heading: (TO FARRELL)
dialog: Sergeant.
dialog: 75.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARRELL
speaker_heading: (TIGHTLY)
dialog: Sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
text: Clear the bodies off the lawn. The
dialog: rest of you go with him.
dialog: 
text: The soldiers exit, leaving only Jim, Henry and Selena in the
dialog: room.
dialog: 
text: Selena is shaken, and won't meet Jim's eyes.
dialog: 
text: Henry hands Selena her machete back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: My apologies.
dialog: 
text: Selena takes the machete and exits, but Jim doesn't follow.
text: Obviously there is something he wants to say to Henry.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STUDY ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jim and Henry enter the study room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Drink?
dialog: 
text: Henry walks over to a drinks cabinet, and pours two brandies,
text: waiting for Jim to speak.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Look. We're grateful. Very grateful
dialog: for your protection, and just to
dialog: have found other people. But if
dialog: we're going to stay here with you,
dialog: you're going to have to stop your
dialog: men from -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Who have you killed?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
speaker_heading: (THROWN)
dialog: I haven't killed anyone.
dialog: 
text: Henry hands Jim his drink.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Since it began, who have you
dialog: killed? You wouldn't be alive now
dialog: if you hadn't killed somebody.
dialog: 76.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: A boy. I killed a boy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: A child?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: But you had to. Otherwise he'd have
dialog: killed you. Survival. I understand.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I promised them women.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Eight days ago I found Jones with
dialog: his gun in this mouth. He said he
dialog: was going to kill himself because
dialog: there was no future. What could I
dialog: say to him? We kill all the
dialog: infected or wait until they starve
dialog: to death. And then what? What do
dialog: nine men do except wait to die
dialog: themselves?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I moved us from the blockade, I set
dialog: the radio broadcasting, and I
dialog: promised them women. Because women
dialog: mean children.
dialog: 
text: Jim turns and runs out of the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: And children mean a future.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jim bursts into the girls' bedroom. Selena is dressed,
text: sitting next to Hannah, who is awake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Get up. Get up!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Wha...
dialog: 77.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: We've got to get out of here!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: But we...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (hauling them up)
dialog: We're leaving. Now! NOW!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MANSION STAIRS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jim and the girls run down the stairs...
dialog: 
text: ...heading for the front door.
dialog: 
text: But behind it is Mitchell, waiting, holding his SA-80.
dialog: 
text: Jim is hit full in the face, and blacks out.
dialog: 
text: As he comes around, he can hear the sound of shouting and
text: screaming.
dialog: 
text: Farrell is backing away from other soldiers, who are closing
text: in on him, even though his gun is raised.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: You can't do this! You can't do
dialog: this! Get back! I'll fucking slot
dialog: you! I'll slot you, I fucking swear
dialog: it!
dialog: 
text: But he doesn't follow his threat through. We hear him scream
text: as the soldiers overpower him.
dialog: 
text: Jim looks up, and sees Henry is kneeling over him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I want to give you a chance. You
dialog: can be with us, or not.
dialog: 
text: Jim stares back at him. And Henry gazes at Jim, searching
text: behind Jim's eyes. And understands what he finds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Okay, Jim. Okay.
dialog: 
text: Henry gives Jim's cheek a soft pat, then rises.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
speaker_heading: (TO MITCHELL)
dialog: Him too.
dialog: 78.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jim's eyes flick to the side, where he sees Selena holding
text: Hannah tightly.
dialog: 
text: Selena looks down at Jim, terrified.
dialog: 
text: Black screen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARRELL'S VOICE
dialog: He's insane.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CELLAR
dialog: 
text: Jim, blindfolded, is sitting beside a radiator, to which his
text: hands are tied.
dialog: 
text: He is in a cellar. Farrell is on the other side of the small
text: room, also tied.
dialog: 
text: Jim, blind, looks around at the sound of Farrell's voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: You know what they're doing, a few
dialog: hundred miles from here? Across the
dialog: channel, across the Atlantic,
text: they're eating dinner. They're
dialog: wondering what to watch on TV
dialog: tonight. They're sleeping next to
dialog: their wives.
dialog: 
text: Jim's head turns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: But we're here, chained to a
dialog: fucking radiator because the OC has
dialog: gone insane. Starting the world
dialog: again when the rest of the world
dialog: hasn't even fucking stopped. Think
dialog: about it! How could infection cross
dialog: the oceans? How could it cross the
dialog: mountains and the rivers? They
dialog: stopped it. And right now TVs are
text: playing and planes are flying in
text: the sky and the world is continuing
dialog: as fucking normal. Think. Actually
dialog: think about it. What would you do
dialog: with a diseased little island?
dialog: 
text: A moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: They quarantined us.
dialog: 
text: A moment.
dialog: 79.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARRELL
speaker_heading: (QUIET)
dialog: There is no infection. It's just
dialog: people killing people.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: He's insane.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: ... Quarantine?
dialog: 
text: Then the door to the cellar bursts open, revealing Mitchell

scene_heading: EXT. TREE-LINED PATH - DAY
dialog: 
text: Mitchell and Jones are leading Jim and Farrell through a
text: small forest at the back of the mansion garden.
dialog: 
text: Time has passed. It has started raining. Both Jim and Farrell
text: have been badly beaten. Jim's shirt is ripped. Blood runs
text: from his nose, and from a cut on the side of his head. He
text: seems dazed. Numbed. More by the situation than his beating.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. EXECUTION GROUND - DAY
dialog: 
text: Jim and Farrell are led into a clearing. Just ahead is a
text: high, ivy-covered brick wall - the perimeter wall of the
text: mansion. And at the base of the wall are bodies. Stacked,
text: tangled, swarming with flies.
dialog: 
text: Jim turns, and sees Mitchell and Jones standing behind him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: Come on then, you fucking pansies.
dialog: Do me first.
dialog: 
text: Mitchell grins, and pulls out his bayonet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: So you're going to stick me,
dialog: Mitchell? Is that it?
speaker_heading: (TO JONES)
dialog: Is that how you're going to let
dialog: your sergeant go out, Jones?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: No, Mitch. Do it with the gun.
dialog: 
text: Mitchell ignores Jones, and starts to fix the blade to the
text: end of his gun.
dialog: 80.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: You're going to let him stick me,
dialog: are you? Like a fucking dog?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Mitch, come on. Just shoot him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Because it's quick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: So?
dialog: 
text: The bayonet fixes home with a click.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: I'll shoot him, then.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: You fucking won't.
speaker_heading: (TO FARRELL)
dialog: Any last words?
dialog: 
text: Farrell spits in Mitchell's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I'm going to enjoy this.
dialog: 
text: Mitchell pulls back his bayonet, and at that moment, there is
text: an explosion of gunfire. Jones has fired and killed Farrell.
dialog: 
text: As Farrell drops, the enraged Mitchell turns on Jones.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: You stupid cunt! What are you
dialog: doing?
dialog: 
text: Mitchell knocks Jones down, putting his gun right in Jones's
dialog: face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
speaker_heading: (WHIRLING)
dialog: How did he...
dialog: 
text: They turn. Jim has vanished.
dialog: 
text: From the side of the clearing, in the trees, there is the
text: sound of sudden movement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: There!
dialog: 81.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Both men immediately set off, diving back into the foliage...
dialog: 
text: A beat passes. Then, in the pile of bodies, one of them sits
dialog: up...
dialog: 
text: ...Jim. We have been looking right at him. But in the tangle
text: of bodies, and the bloodstained clothes, his camouflage was
dialog: complete.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TREES - DAY - LIGHT RAIN
dialog: 
text: Mitchell and Jones move fast, scanning, pushing through the
text: undergrowth. Mitchell is absolutely furious. And as they run,
text: they startle a couple of birds, which fly up from the ground,
text: making a suspiciously familiar noise...
dialog: 
text: They both have the same realization at the same moment.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. EXECUTION GROUND - DAY
dialog: 
text: Mitchell and Jones burst back into the clearing, and they
text: start firing into the bodies, emptying a full clip into the
dialog: corpses...
dialog: 
dialog: ....Silence.
dialog: 
text: Then Jones looks up to the ivy-colored wall...following the
text: path of the ivy upwards, to the coiled razor wire, where a
text: scrap of torn and bloody clothing hangs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Oh no. We're fucked, we're fucked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
text: No problem. He's outside. No gun.
text: No vehicle. He's a dead man.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY
dialog: 
text: Jim runs through the woods, away from the mansion. His hands
dialog: are still tied.
dialog: 
text: He is out of breath, frightened, jumping at every sound.
dialog: 
text: Then he trips, rolls down a short slope, and when he comes to
text: rest, he is looking upwards.
dialog: 
text: Above him, there is a parting in the clouds, and through the
text: parting is blue sky.
dialog: 82.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: And across the sky, bisecting the blue, is a single vapor
dialog: trail.
dialog: 
text: A pin-prick of silver plane. Followed by a sonic boom. As
text: much in Jim's head as anywhere else.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DOOR - DAY
dialog: 
text: Close-up of a closed door, with the sounds of a struggle on
text: the other side.
dialog: 
text: Then, suddenly, Selena's voice: hard, desperate:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: You can't do this to her! She's
dialog: only fourteen!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY - RAIN
dialog: 
text: (Note: in the room is a large, freestanding mirror.)
dialog: 
text: Hannah and Selena are cornered by Clifton, Bedford, Bell and
text: Davis. The soldiers are hyped. Bedford pulls clothes out of a
text: wardrobe, yanking out dresses, underwear - throwing them at
dialog: the girls.
dialog: 
text: Bell stands by the closed door - frightened, caught like a
text: rabbit in the headlights between testosterone madness and the
dialog: horror.
dialog: 
text: And Clifton is laughing, animal-like, tearing at Selena's
text: clothes, while Hannah is kicking and screaming - held by
dialog: Davis.
dialog: 
text: Close-up on Selena: suddenly transfixed by Hannah the young
text: girl's fight, the hopelessness.
dialog: 
text: Abruptly, Selena turns, grabs Clifton's arm, and to his
text: amazement, yanks him around.
dialog: 
text: Then she kisses him on the lips. Simply, but unambiguously.
dialog: 
text: Bell, Davis and Bedford watch in amazement.
dialog: 
text: Selena breaks off.
dialog: 
text: The frenzy has been broken by her extraordinary action - and
text: bizarrely, so has the balance of power.
dialog: 83.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: You need to give me a moment with
text: Hannah. Alone.
dialog: 
text: Clifton nods - he seems a little dazed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLIFTON
dialog: The OC. He... he wants you to...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: He wants us to dress up nice.
dialog: 
text: She picks up two of the dresses Bedford has thrown - the red
dialog: dresses.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: But if you want us to change,
dialog: you'll have to get out of the room.
dialog: 
text: A moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: (calm, powerful)
dialog: It's just fucking polite.
dialog: 
dialog: Another moment.
dialog: 
text: Then Clifton nods. Acquiesces.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLIFTON
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: Okay. Clear out.
dialog: 
text: They exit.
dialog: 
text: Selena stands with Hannah, emptying pills from her Valium
dialog: bottle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Eat them.
dialog: 
text: Hannah hesitates.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
speaker_heading: (HARD)
dialog: Eat them, Hannah!
dialog: 
text: Hannah takes the handful of pills and holds them in her open
dialog: palm.
dialog: 
text: Then she looks to Selena.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Are you killing me?
dialog: 84.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A moment - maybe a single moment of tenderness, a strand of
text: hair brushed from Hannah's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: No. I'm making you not care.
dialog: 
text: Locked eyes with Selena, Hannah raises the first pill to her
text: mouth. Then the next.
dialog: 
text: The door behind opens - revealing the soldiers.
dialog: 
text: Clifton sees what is happening.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLIFTON
dialog: Hey! What the fuck are you doing?
dialog: 
text: Selena crams the pills into Hannah's mouth.
dialog: 
text: The soldiers lunge for the girls, as Hannah tries to swallow
text: the pills, and Selena whirls to fight them off...
dialog: 
text: ...and at that moment, the sound of distant siren begin to
dialog: rise.
dialog: 
text: Everyone freezes.
dialog: 
dialog: Then...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Jim.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEDFORD
dialog: He's at the blockade!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MANSION - STAIRS - DAY - RAIN
dialog: 
text: The soldiers run down the stairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: He went over the wall! We thought
dialog: he'd be dead sir!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Shut up! Davis - you're coming with
dialog: me!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BLOCKADE - DAY - RAIN
dialog: 
text: Jim stands in the blockade, turning the handle of a siren.
text: Rain is pouring down, mingling with the blood on his face.
dialog: 
text: Jim stops, and the sound of the siren starts to fade away.
dialog: 85.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: From the motorway ahead, through the rain, a jeep is
text: approaching.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MOTORWAY - LATE AFTERNOON - RAIN
dialog: 
text: The jeep drives fast down the motorway, and pulls up. Davis
text: is driving and Henry stands on the back, manning the jeep's
text: mounted machine gun.
dialog: 
text: The jeep pulls up, one hundred meters from the blockade, and
text: Henry brings the mounted machine gun to bear on the blockade.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Okay. Let's see if we can sidestep
dialog: the cat-and-mouse bullshit.
dialog: 
text: Henry opens fire.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BLOCKADE - LATE AFTERNOON - RAIN
dialog: 
text: Bullet rip through the blockade, punching holes through the
text: vehicles, smashing through the packing crates...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MOTORWAY - LATE AFTERNOON - RAIN
dialog: 
text: Henry stops shooting. With a peal of thunder, the rain
text: suddenly begins to flood down.
dialog: 
text: The barrel of the machine gun spits and steams as the
text: raindrops hit the hot metal.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BLOCKADE - LATE AFTERNOON - HEAVY RAIN
dialog: 
text: Davis pulls up at the outskirts of the blockade, and they get
text: out of the truck.
dialog: 
text: Henry and Davis make their way into the blockade. With a
text: signal from Henry, the two split up.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BLOCKADE - WITH HENRY - LATE AFTERNOON - HEAVY RAIN
dialog: 
text: Henry moves through the blockade.
dialog: 
text: He lets off a controlled burst of shots into the tents.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BLOCKADE - WITH DAVIS - LATE AFTERNOON - HEAVY RAIN
dialog: 
text: Stealthily, Davis searches around the trucks and tents...
dialog: 86.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A flash of movement - fast, like an Infected, ducking behind
text: one of trucks: Jim.
dialog: 
text: Davis wipes the rain from his eyes, and presses forwards.
dialog: 
text: Jim is nowhere to be seen.
dialog: 
text: Another flash of movement, around the back of the next truck.
dialog: 
text: Davis moves around the truck...but Jim is not there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: Fuck.
dialog: 
text: Davis turns, and sees...
dialog: 
text: ...Jim, flying towards him, holding Frank's lead pipe, lips
text: drawn back over his teeth in a rictus smile, murderous.
dialog: 
text: He is the vision of the Infected, in his expression, his
dialog: movements, the blood, everything.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BLOCKADE - WITH HENRY - LATE AFTERNOON - HEAVY RAIN
dialog: 
text: Henry turns, as if having just heard something. Perhaps a
dialog: scream.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
speaker_heading: (CALLING)
dialog: Jim?
dialog: 
text: Another noise. This time it is unambiguously an Infected
text: howl. Henry turns again. From down the motorway, and from the
text: fields, he can now see the Infected. A large number,
text: attracted by noise of the heavy machine gun, are approaching.
dialog: 
text: He looses off a couple of shots at the Infected, then starts
text: to back away to the jeep.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. JEEP - LATE AFTERNOON - HEAVY RAIN
dialog: 
text: Henry runs up to the jeep. Through the rain, and the water
text: running down the windscreen, Henry can see a figure sitting
text: at the driver's seat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Davis?
dialog: 
text: The figure doesn't move.
dialog: 
text: Henry approaches cautiously, gun raised, and finds...
dialog: 87.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: ...Davis sitting on the front seat, dead, his skull smashed
dialog: open.
dialog: 
text: Henry whirls, expecting to find Jim behind him.
dialog: 
text: But there is no one there.
dialog: 
text: Henry shoots again, blindly, emptying his clip at anything
text: and everything around him.
dialog: 
text: He reloads - hurriedly, hands slipping on the wet clip,
dialog: betraying nervousness...
dialog: 
text: ...and fires at a rain shadow that sweeps between two of the
text: tents. Then his nerve is gone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Fine! Fine, you little bastard!
dialog: Fucking die out here!
dialog: 
text: Henry hauls out Davis's body, gets into the driver's seat,
dialog: turning the ignition...
dialog: 
text: ...but nothing is happening.
dialog: 
text: Henry turns the key again, desperately. The motor doesn't
dialog: even turn over.
dialog: 
text: Reaching under the dashboard, he pulls out a handful of
dialog: wires.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Jim.
dialog: 
text: And at the moment, an Infected slams onto the windscreen,
text: face against the glass.
dialog: 
text: Henry shouts out of surprise and anger, lifting his gun, and
text: fires at point-blank range, through the glass, into the
text: Infected's face.
dialog: 
text: The windscreen shatters, blown outwards.
dialog: 
text: And now, where our view was obscured by rain-washed glass, we
dialog: can see clearly...
dialog: 
text: ...Infected, in the blockade, coming through the downpour,
text: running towards the jeep.
dialog: 
text: Henry opens fire and cuts them down.
dialog: 88.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MAILER'S PIT - NIGHT - HEAVY RAIN
dialog: 
text: Jim appears above Mailer in his pit, and shoots off Mailer's
dialog: chain.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - HEAVY RAIN
dialog: 
text: Jones stands holding his gun at Selena and Hannah, who sit on
text: the sofas, opposite each other. Also in the room are Clifton,
text: standing by the French windows, and Mitchell.
dialog: 
text: Jones seems jumpy, a sheen of sweat on his forehead, as if
text: sensing that things have gone seriously wrong.
dialog: 
text: A flicker of lightning lights up outside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: What was that? Was that a claymore?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: It was lightning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: But I heard something.
dialog: 
text: A moment. Rain and wind lash the windows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I'll go and hit the floods. Take a
dialog: butcher's. Girls, keep an eye on
dialog: him, would you?
dialog: 
text: Mitchell exits.
dialog: 
text: Jones wipes at the beads of sweat on his upper lip. And in
text: noticeable contrast, Hannah is completely calm...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Those pills. I think they're having
dialog: an effect. I can feel them, and...
dialog: I don't feel sleepy, but...
dialog: 
text: Her sentence trails off. Then she turns to Jones.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
speaker_heading: (TO JONES)
dialog: They've been a long time.
dialog: 
text: Jones says nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: What are you going to do if they
dialog: don't come back?
dialog: 89.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jones still says nothing, but the question is clearly hitting
dialog: a nerve.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Will you be the boss if Henry is
dialog: dead? Is that the way if works?
dialog: 
text: Selena looks at Hannah quickly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Shut up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: I don't think they are coming back.
dialog: I think they've been killed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: I told you to shut up!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
speaker_heading: (NERVOUS)
dialog: Hannah...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
speaker_heading: (FLAT)
dialog: They're dead.
dialog: 
text: Hannah's eyes flick over Jones's shoulder, and something
text: fleeting passes over her face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: You're going to be next.
dialog: 
text: At that moment, a mine detonates in the mansion grounds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Shit!
dialog: 
text: At that moment, the floodlights power up...
dialog: 
text: ...illuminating Mailer, just on the other side of the French
text: windows, just behind Clifton, a split second before he
text: smashes through.
dialog: 
text: Then he does smash through.
dialog: 
text: Clifton is thrown to the ground, with Mailer on top of him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLIFTON
dialog: Help! Shoot him! Shoot him!
dialog: 
text: Jones is hopeless, panicking - fires, and misses.
dialog: 90.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Hannah watches, spaced out. Selena shakes Hannah by the
text: shoulders, pulling Hannah upwards.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Hannah! Hannah! We have to get out
dialog: of here!
dialog: 
text: Mailer vomits blood into Clifton's face.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT - HEAVY RAIN
dialog: 
text: Selena and Hannah back out of the living room, through the
text: house. Hannah is very doped up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Oh Jesus, Jesus, Hannah, stay with
dialog: it, stay with it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
text: (relaxed, as she's yanked
speaker_heading: ALONG)
dialog: Don't worry. I feel fine. Really.
dialog: 
text: They reach the front hallway, and the front door bursts
dialog: open...
dialog: 
dialog: Mitchell, with Bedford.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: What the fuck's going on? What's
dialog: all the shouti...
dialog: 
text: Mitchell is cut off by a high scream, from down the hall, in
text: the direction of the living room.
dialog: 
dialog: All turn, and see...
dialog: 
text: ...Jones, running, screaming, out of one doorway, across the
text: hallway. He has lost his weapon - and is chased by Mailer,
text: but not Clifton. Like a train passing, in half a second they
text: are out of sight.
dialog: 
text: A moment. Then Mitchell explodes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
speaker_heading: (TO BEDFORD)
dialog: Don't just fucking stand there! Get
dialog: after them!
dialog: 91.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT - HEAVY RAIN
dialog: 
text: Mailer chases Jones into the kitchen, but when he enters,
text: Jones is nowhere to be seen.
dialog: 
text: Mailer turns, and sees Bedford in the kitchen doorway,
text: holding his gun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEDFORD
dialog: What the fuck are you going to do
dialog: now, eh?
dialog: 
text: But just as Bedford lifts his gun to shoot Mailer...
dialog: 
text: Clifton runs at him, full speed from down the corridor...
dialog: 
text: ...and Bedford is knocked sideways by the infected Clifton.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MANSION - NIGHT - HEAVY RAIN

speaker_heading: MITCHELL
speaker_heading: (GRABBING SELENA)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: Mitchell? What's going on?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Stay here and defend these stairs
dialog: with your fucking life!
dialog: 
text: He turns back to the girls, still holding Selena's arm, and
text: Hannah is gone.
dialog: 
text: Selena sees her, heading away down towards the corridor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Hannah!
dialog: 92.
dialog: 
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT - HEAVY RAIN
dialog: 
text: Hannah runs into the dressing room.
dialog: 
text: The freestanding mirror sits in the middle of the floor.
dialog: 
text: Also on the floor are her clothes, and she starts to look
text: through them, looking for her jeans...
dialog: 
text: ...which she lifts up, then digs in the pocket, and pulls
text: out...a photo of her with Frank and her mother.
dialog: 
text: She gazes at the photo.
dialog: 
text: At that moment, there is a noise from behind her.
dialog: 
text: She looks up, and sees, in the reflection of the mirror,
text: Clifton, running down the corridor towards her.
dialog: 
text: With Clifton: we burst into the dressing room, which is now
text: empty.
dialog: 
text: Clifton freezes, then looks around.
dialog: 
text: And the camera pulls back, to reveal Hannah, clinging on to
text: the back of the large mirror, trembling.
dialog: 
text: A moment - then Clifton moves on.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT - HEAVY RAIN
dialog: 
text: Silence in the kitchen. Bedford lies dead, torn to pieces.
dialog:

dialog: been hiding.
dialog: 
text: Trembling with fear, he crawls out...moves into the

dialog: 
text: It is empty.
dialog: 
text: Jones starts running. Down the corridor outside the kitchen.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT - HEAVY RAIN
dialog:

dialog: 
text: And suddenly stops. Dead in his tracks.

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jim is standing right in front of him.
dialog: 
text: Jones looks surprised, wide eyed. His mouth opens, but no

dialog: 
text: Pull back, to see: Jones has run straight into Jim's bayonet.
dialog:

dialog:

dialog: 
text: Jones is lying flat on his back, mortally wounded, gazing up.
text: Still alive - but only just. Taking his very last breaths.
dialog: 
text: Henry kneels beside him, and Jones's eyes turn to his

dialog: 
text: Henry's hand closes around Jones.
dialog:

text: Henry moves into a basement corridor.
dialog: 
text: Then pauses.
dialog: 
text: There is the sound of movement.
dialog: 
text: An Infected howl.
dialog: 95.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Then suddenly, pouring out from every door and shadow ahead,
text: come a rush of Infected.
dialog: 
text: Henry opens fire, a volley into them as he backs away fast...
dialog: 
text: ...to a door, which he slams and bolts behind him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT - HEAVY RAIN
dialog: 
text: Mitchell is holding Selena in one hand, and his gun in the
text: other, dragging her down a corridor.
dialog: 
text: The howls of the Infected fill the house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Hannah!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Shut your fucking mouth! You want
dialog: to get us killed?
dialog: 
text: Mitchell opens a door...
dialog: 
text: ...which leads nowhere. The floor of the room through the
text: open door is missing.
dialog: 
text: And below, in the basement-level corridor, the space is full
dialog: of the Infected.
dialog: 
text: They look up at Mitchell, and Mitchell looks down at them.
dialog: 
text: A vision of writhing Hell. They are a mass of faces and
text: bodies. Some are appalling wounded. Some are half-dressed in
text: ragged clothes. Some are naked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: ...Shit.
dialog: 
text: He pulls Selena away, towards another door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: In here! IN HERE!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MANSION - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - NIGHT - HEAVY RAIN
dialog: 
text: Henry is in the basement corridor, on the other side of the
text: door he has bolted.
dialog: 
text: Ahead, there is movement - rapid.
dialog: 
text: Henry looks to the source, and sees: Clifton, running from
text: the front hall towards him, clearly infected.
dialog: 96.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: No alarm registers on Henry's face.
dialog: 
text: As Clifton sprints towards him, Henry remains still. Then, at
text: the last moment he closes his eyes...
dialog: 
dialog: ...and fires.
dialog: 
text: Clifton is hit, falls.
dialog: 
text: Henry opens his eyes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC - NIGHT - HEAVY RAIN
dialog: 
text: Jim enters the skylight window, into an attic, positioned
text: above the girls' bedroom.
dialog: 
text: In the floor is a hole, and through it he can see Mitchell
dialog: and Selena.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT - HEAVY RAIN
dialog: 
text: Selena and Mitchell stand in the middle of the room.
dialog: 
text: In the room are Selena and Hannah's bags, Selena's machete,
text: lying by the side of the bed. She can see it, but...
dialog: 
text: ...Mitchell is holding her tight. He has his gun trained on
text: the door, facing away from the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: It's me and you, now. And I'm going
dialog: to get you out of here, and then
dialog: we're going to find some nice
dialog: little fucking place, with a pretty
dialog: little fucking garden, and...
dialog: 
text: Jim drops down from the attic.
dialog: 
text: Mitchell turns, but is knocked off balance by Selena
text: squirming out of his grip...then Jim is on him.
dialog: 
text: With incredible viciousness, the power and savagery of the
text: infected, Jim beats Mitchell to death. He smashes his head
text: against the wall. Then he throws Mitchell to the ground, and
text: jams his thumbs in Mitchell's eyes.
dialog: 
text: When it is over, Jim looks up.
dialog: 
text: Selena stands, holding her machete. She is frozen by the
text: sight of him. The blood on his face. The matted hair. He is
text: the image of an infected.
dialog: 97.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jim stands and takes a step towards her. Selena remains,
text: motionless, watching him approach.
dialog: 
text: Then, just as he is about to reach her, her arm flashes
text: upwards, holding the machete, to cut Jim down...
dialog: 
text: ...but she hesitates. She can't do it.
dialog: 
dialog: A moment. Then...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
text: That was longer than a heartbeat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: ...Jim?
dialog: 
text: Jim moves forwards, and kisses her. Simply. Hard. Then pulls
text: back, leaving a trace of blood on her lips.
dialog: 
text: Behind Jim's back, the door opposite, in the corridor,
text: silently swings open.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: I thought...I thought you were...
dialog: 
text: Jim moves forwards, and they kiss. Passionately.
dialog: 
text: Then Jim breaks off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Listen to me. I've got to tell you -
dialog: I've got to tell you. The world
dialog: isn't fucked. It's going to be
dialog: okay. We've got a chance, if we can
dialog: get to...
dialog: 
text: Selena interrupts him, by continuing the kiss.
dialog: 
text: And Jim responds.
dialog: 
text: As, behind him, a small figure in a red dress slip into the
dialog: room.
dialog: 
text: Then a vase smashes over the back of Jim's head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Ow!
dialog: 
text: He reels back, and Hannah is on him, jumping on his back,
text: hitting him with her fists.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Hannah! Stop! It's okay!
dialog: 98.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Hannah breaks off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: He's not infected!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: I thought he was biting you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
text: (holding the back of his
speaker_heading: HEAD)
dialog: I was kissing her!
speaker_heading: (BREAKS OFF)
dialog: Are you stoned?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: It's a long story.
dialog: 
text: They are interrupted by the sounds of Infected howling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: We have to get out of here.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MANSION - NIGHT - HEAVY RAIN
dialog: 
text: Jim, Selena and Hannah run out of the house, through the
text: front hall, to the cab.
dialog: 
text: Hannah gets in the driver's seat...
dialog: 
text: ...and Jim yanks open the back door, ready to pile into the
dialog: back only to find...
dialog: 
text: ...Henry. Sitting on the fold-down back seat. Holding his
dialog: gun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You killed all my boys.
dialog: 
text: Henry pulls the trigger - a single shot. Jim is hit in the
text: stomach and falls backwards into Selena's arm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Jim!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAB - NIGHT - HEAVY RAIN
dialog: 
text: Hannah floors the accelerator.
dialog: 
text: But instead of going forward, the cab reverses.
dialog: 99.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MANSION - NIGHT - HEAVY RAIN
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: What...Hannah! Hannah?
dialog: 
text: The cab reverses fast, then Hannah slams the brakes. The cab
text: slides to a halt.
dialog: 
text: An Infected slams against Henry's window.
dialog: 
text: At that moment, the back windscreen smashes.
dialog: 
text: The hands of the Infected grab hold of Henry's head.
dialog: 
text: Hannah watches, turned around in the seat.
dialog: 
text: Henry scream - and we see it's Mailer's face behind him.
dialog: 
text: Hannah floors the accelerator again, but this time in forward
text: gear. Henry is sucked out of the back window.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAB - NIGHT - HEAVY RAIN
dialog: 
text: The cab screeches up to Jim and Selena.
dialog: 
text: Selena bundles Jim in, and the cab is off in a spray of
dialog: gravel...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT - HEAVY RAIN
dialog: 
text: As Henry is killed by Mailer, the silhouettes of the Infected
text: appear in the shadows.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAB - NIGHT - HEAVY RAIN
dialog: 
text: The cab races towards the cast-iron front gates of the
text: mansion - and we see they are locked with a chain and
text: padlock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: We're going to crash!
dialog: 
text: The gates loom. Hannah speeds towards them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: We're going to crash!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Just fucking do it!
dialog: 100.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Hannah reaches and buckles her seat belt. Jim and Selena
dialog: brace for impact...
dialog: 
text: They hit the gates, hard. Jim and Selena fly towards the
text: perspex divider.
dialog: 
text: Freeze. Held.
dialog: 
scene_heading: FADE TO BLACK:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 28 DAYS LATER
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE UP TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - DAY
dialog: 
text: A green field, with three white letters laid out across the
dialog: grass. Spelling:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HELL
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Waking from a nightmare, Jim's eyes snap open with a sharp
text: intake of breath.
dialog: 
text: An echo of when we first saw him lying in the hospital. But
text: this time, when we pull away, we see he is lying on a double
text: bed, in the bedroom of a small farmhouse.
dialog: 
text: Alone. But Selena's clothes are scattered.
dialog: 
text: Jim rises.
dialog: 
text: He looks around. Bright daylight is flooding into the room
text: through the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Jesus. Not the curtains too.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Jim walks down the stairs and peers into a living room -
text: where he sees the sofa, with its cover removed.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
dialog: 
text: Jim enters - to find Selena sitting surrounded by lengths of
text: material which she is stiching together.
dialog: 101.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He picks up a length of red material. Once part of the dress.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You looked all right in this, you
dialog: know.
dialog: 
text: Selena ignores him.
dialog: 
text: Jim walks to the front door and opens it.
dialog: 
dialog: Pull back to reveal...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
dialog: 
text: A stunning view.
dialog: 
text: A Lakeland valley, with a single farmhouse, and the black cab
text: parked outside.
dialog: 
text: Also outside is Hannah, who is arranging huge lengths of
text: material on the grass.
dialog: 
text: From our ground-level angle, there is no sense to be made of
text: what Hannah is doing.
dialog: 
dialog: And we keep pulling back...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LAKELAND VALLEY - DAY
dialog: 
text: ...fast, down the valley, along a single ribbon of road.
dialog: 
text: Past a sign: Langdale Valley...
dialog: 
text: Further, now over a mile distant from the farmhouse, then:
dialog: 
text: Stopping, abruptly.
dialog: 
text: At a single Infected, who sits, emaciated, in the middle of
dialog: the road.
dialog: 
text: A quiet moment with the starving emaciated Infected. It is so
text: weak it can hardly move. Only blink.
dialog: 
text: Then, in the background, a distant rush of noise, the low
text: roar of a jet engine.
dialog: 
text: Slowly, the Infected turns its head upwards, where, in the
text: clear blue sky, it sees:
dialog: 
text: A vapor trail.
dialog: 
text: A plane.
dialog: 102.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VALLEY - DAY
dialog: 
text: A silent bird's eye view, looking down, at the valley floor
text: and the farmhouse.
dialog: 
text: Where, outside, we now make sense of the stitched sheets and
text: curtains, as they form letters on the grass below:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HELL
text: But tiny figures are forming a new letter. An O:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HELLO
text: Then, in the background, the sound of the jet, the rush of
dialog: noise.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: There! THERE!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Jim, Hannah and Selena look down the valley, where...
dialog: 
text: ...screaming towards them, flying low along the valley floor,
text: comes a jet plane.
dialog: 
text: They stand transfixed as the plane races towards them.
dialog: 
text: As it passes over, flying directly overhead, the terrific
text: wash of air and noises whips around them, connected with a
dialog: colossal sonic boom...
dialog: 
text: The boom rolls away, and the plane has passed...
dialog: 
text: Around Jim, Selena and Hannah, the sheets and material of the
text: letters, ripped into the air, now spiral to the ground,
text: falling around them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Do you think he saw us this time?
dialog: 
scene_heading: CUT TO BLACK:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE END
