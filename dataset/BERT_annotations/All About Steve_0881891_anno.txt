scene_heading: TNT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: A New York Times crossword puzzle. The hand of MARY HOROWITZ
text: scratches the answers in ink without pausing even a second
dialog: between each one.
speaker_heading: MARY (V.O.)
dialog: Vita aenigma est. Life is a
dialog: puzzle. It is. Specifically, life
text: is most like a crossword puzzle.
dialog: There are a million reasons why,
dialog: not the least of which is that
dialog: life, like crosswords, requires the
dialog: use of your whole entire brain-
text: Her writing hand knocks a glass of grape soda and it spills
text: all over the puzzle.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Crap.
text: The puzzle answers all run together.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
text: Ten plastic folding chairs line the hallway -- all empty
dialog: except for one.
text: In the last chair sits Mary Horowitz, 31, in her best
text: synthetic cardigan, somebody's grandmother's skirt, her own
text: red rubber boots. Genius meets retard. She mumbles to
dialog: herself.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Four letter word for... vomit.
text: She takes a deep breath to calm her nerves. it doesn't help.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Not "barf". For sure not "barf".
dialog: That's too easy. "Puke" is okay,
dialog: but maybe a bit pedestrian (that
dialog: means boring)... I like "hurl". I
dialog: do. I like the way it rolls off
dialog: your tongue -- the word, I mean.
dialog: But my all time favorite is none of
dialog: those.
text: She puts her head between her knees, tries to keep it
dialog: together.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Four letter word for vomit? S-P-E-
text: W. Spew... Sp-ew.
text: A door nearby opens but Mary doesn't budge. A POLICE OFFICER
text: walks out.
text: A 40ish female TEACHER pokes her head out the door, signals
dialog: to Mary.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: We're ready for you now.

scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
text: Mary stands in front of the chalkboard, "CAREER DAY" written
text: in huge letters behind her. She smiles with terror at the
dialog: class of 10 year old KIDS.
text: The Teacher reads from her notes.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Here's a treat, students. Our
dialog: final guest for Career Day, Miss
dialog: Mary Horowitz, is the crossword
dialog: constructor for the Atlanta
dialog: Citizen. You know the crossword
dialog: puzzles you see every week in the
dialog: newspaper? It's her job to create
dialog: them. Isn't that fun?
text: Mary stares at the Teacher, whispers.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You weren't supposed to tell them.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Pardon me?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I made a crossword puzzle to help
dialog: them guess what my job is. You
dialog: ruined it.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Oh, I'm so sorry.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: People do crossword puzzles all the
dialog: time but they don't often think of
dialog: the person who made all the words
dialog: fit together, and who thought up
dialog: the clues, and who made sure the
text: little black squares at the top
text: mirror the ones at the bottom.
text: She pulls one of the crosswords out of the garbage can, holds
text: it up, turns it upside down, forces a nervous smile.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Crossword constructors usually have
dialog: above average intelligence, with
dialog: knowledge of just about every
dialog: subject you can imagine. And it
dialog: helps if they can spell.
text: The card in Mary's hand reads "LAUGH". She laughs. Nobody
text: else does. She looks at the cards again, instantly gets
text: serious, sweeps her hand through the air.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Imagine, for a moment, a world
dialog: without crossword puzzles. A world-
text: Mary notices one Kid with his hand up. It totally throws her
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Daniel, you have a question?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You make a living doing that? Just

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: My parents -
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You live with your parents?
text: The Kids all laugh their asses off. Mary just stares at
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: LARGE KID
dialog: Oh my God, how old are you? Still
dialog: living at home!
text: The kids all laugh some more. Mary's on the verge of panic.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Children!
text: The Teacher shoots the Kids a warning look, then notices Mary
text: hyperventilating.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Are you okay?
text: Mary grasps for breath, struggles to speak.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Water.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Water. Just hang on.
text: The Teacher rushes out. The kids all stare at Mary.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yep, I live at home...
text: She forces herself to get it together, totally faking it.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: But so do all of you, so there...
dialog: And sure, I only create one
dialog: crossword puzzle a week but I have
dialog: deadlines, I have stress, I have
dialog: demands on me so huge you would not
dialog: believe. The newspaper business is
dialog: hell. I mean it. Hell.
dialog: Somebody's got to write about all
dialog: the horrors that go on in this
dialog: world.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: MARY (cont'd)
dialog: And after people read about those
dialog: horrors, somebody else has to bring
text: them back from the brink of
dialog: suicide. Who do you think that is?
text: She leans in close to the front row, scares herself more than
dialog: anybody.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Me! My crossword puzzle is always
dialog: good news. it enlightens.
dialog: it r andma's
dialog: entertains. It keeps your g
dialog: mind alive so she remembers to send
dialog: you five bucks on your birthday.
dialog: Think about that as you lie in bed
dialog: tonight picking your nose and crying
dialog: yourself to sleep. I know I will.
text: The Kids just stare at her. She leans against the teacher's
text: desk, tries to look relaxed but fails miserably.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: My job matters, you know. In media
dialog: circles I am, as the Dutch say,
dialog: geliefd. That means I have plenty
text: of friends. Hoards, in fact.
dialog: Scads even.
dialog: The kids aren't buying it.
speaker_heading: LARGE KID
dialog: You're a freak.
text: The kids all nod in agreement. Mary's frozen, devastated.
text: The Teacher rushes back into the room with a cup of water,
text: hands it over. Mary sips it like communion wine. Half of it
text: runs down her chin.
text: Mary looks at the Teacher, fakes a smile.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: That's a pretty blouse.
text: The Teacher smiles back. Awkward.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL -- DAY
text: The front doors of the school swing open and a visibly shaken
text: Mary walks out. She takes a deep breath and embraces denial.

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Twelve letter phrase for smashing

text: She heads down the walkway toward the bus stop.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: As one would say in old Paris...
dialog: Coup de maitre!
text: A CUSTODIAN cleaning the school yard looks up. Mary keeps on
text: talking - now to him.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It means "master stroke", even
dialog: though the direct translation is
dialog: actually "master blow"... Leave it
dialog: to the French to pass off an
dialog: unpleasant slave activity as an
dialog: everyday expression.
text: The Custodian doesn't know what the hell she's talking about.
text: Mary continues on to the bus stop.
scene_heading: INT. CITY BUS -- DAY

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Excuse me... pardonnez-moi...
dialog: begnadiyen sie mich...
text: She lurches for an empty seat and just about dislodges her

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Hello hematoma.
text: She smiles at an angry ELDERLY LADY sitting across from her.
text: The lady gives her the "don't talk to me" glare, then stares
text: out the window. Mary fidgets in her seat.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: MARY (V.O.)
dialog: In crosswords, as in life, some
dialog: days are harder than others. It's
dialog: true. In the New York Times, for
dialog: example, the puzzles get harder as
dialog: the week goes. So on Monday, a day
dialog: that traditionally bites the big
dialog: one, the crossword is super easy.
dialog: It's comforting to know that
dialog: although life can be difficult at
dialog: times, crosswords let you off easy
dialog: when you need it the most.
text: Mary looks around for anybody to talk to. The other
text: PASSENGERS avert their eyes. Mary starts biting her nails.

speaker_heading: MARY
scene_heading: KONCHA, TAKIHASHI-SAN!
text: He ignores her. Mary hands the papers to Betty.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Hi Betty.
text: Betty just rings up the papers.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Did you see the review of
dialog: "Hairspray" in the Journal
dialog: yesterday? They used the word
dialog: "spectacular" -- always a good

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Nine dollar twenty.
text: Mary fishes in her bag for money.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: We could bring your dad if you
dialog: want. I don't think the show is

text: like a loser for being old.
text: As she takes her time paying, Mr. Takihashi madly gestures
text: about Mary holding up the line. Betty barks at her.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Pecha kucha! Do Itta!
text: Betty takes Mary's money, waves her on and helps the next
dialog: customer.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: So no then? That's a no?
text: Betty ignores her. Mary waits, loads the newspapers into her
dialog: bag.
speaker_heading: MARY (V.O.)
dialog: Sometimes crosswords are even
dialog: better than life. Here's how.
dialog: They don't discriminate.
dialog: Crosswords don't care if you're
dialog: young or old; black or white; male,
dialog: female or intersex. Crosswords
dialog: only care if you're an idiot. And,
dialog: really, that's okay, because if you
dialog: have the IQ of a yam, finishing a
dialog: crossword should be the least of
dialog: your worries.

speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: Not me!.
text: Hartman grabs a gas mask and rushes to the van's side mirror.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: I need blush. No, wait. I'll go
dialog: pasty. It'll look like I could be
dialog: the first media victim. "Hartman
dialog: Hughes, no such thing as too close
dialog: to the story".
text: Hartman looks back at Steve and Angus. They're just standing
text: there, unable to keep a straight face. Hartman deflates.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: Assholes! I knew it was too good
dialog: to be true.
text: He throws his gas mask down, storms off.
speaker_heading: ANGUS
dialog: Hartman, come on.
text: Hartman gets in the elevator, hollers out to them.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: I had a perfectly good bologna

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Crap.
scene_heading: INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - DAY
text: It's house that's been lived in. Every inch cluttered with

dialog: books, books and more books.
text: Mary steps out of her boots and marches into the living room
text: where her 50ish mother, MRS. HOROWITZ, sits reading with MR.
text: HOROWITZ (late 50's, professorial head to toe, furrowed brow
dialog: to worn loafers).
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: "Brilliant" is what they said.
dialog: Never in the history of St.
dialog: Margaret's Career Day have the
dialog: children's brains been so
text: inordinately stimulated as they
dialog: were today by my presentation.
scene_heading: MRS. HOROWITZ
dialog: Good for you, sweetie.
text: Mary pulls the newspapers out of her bag, sorts through them,
text: stacks them on top of the TV.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: "Inspired", the teacher told me.
scene_heading: MR. HOROWITZ
dialog: You get the Post?
text: She hands him the paper.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: "Engrossing" one child exclaimed.
scene_heading: MR. HOROWITZ
dialog: A ten year old said that?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'm sure that's what he meant. And
dialog: "ebullient"-
scene_heading: MR. HOROWITZ
dialog: What happened to your knee?
text: Mary looks down at the blood dripping down from her knee onto

dialog: than the mess.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Dad, some of the greatest orators
dialog: of all time had their heads chopped

text: Her mother yells to her.
scene_heading: MRS. HOROWITZ
dialog: Change those socks before your

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I told you I'm not going.
scene_heading: MRS. HOROWITZ

speaker_heading: MARY

scene_heading: MRS. HOROWITZ
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: A brain tumor characterized by,

dialog: She's nuts.
text: Mary walks up the stairs.
scene_heading: MRS. HOROWITZ
dialog: Mary, it's just a date. This is
dialog: what normal girls your age do.
text: Mary stops on the stairs.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'm normal.
text: Silence from her parents. Mary marches back into the living

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: In fact, I'm normalis extremes.
dialog: That's the kind of normal that

speaker_heading: MRS. HANCOCK
dialog: Of course you are, sweetie.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
text: Mary looks at her obviously lying mother and uncomfortable
text: father. Mary's mind reels, like her head is going to
text: explode. Finally, a determination hits her.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'll go.
text: Mary bolts up the stairs to her room.
text: Mr. and Mrs. Horowitz look at each other, surprised, happy.
scene_heading: MR. HOROWITZ
dialog: You ever want to see grandchildren,
dialog: you better burn the damn boots.
text: She swats him with her book, tries not to laugh.
scene_heading: INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Storage room or bedroom? Boxes and books all over the place.
text: In the middle of it all, a bed.
text: On the dresser, a bunch of photos of Mary Tyler Moore in the - MTM in a
text: 1970's. Taped to the mirror, the chosen photo Horowitz

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Carol, tonight I have a date. A
dialog: blind one. Not the guy, I mean the
dialog: situation. We are, as yet, unknown
dialog: to one another... It's nerve
dialog: wracking, I know. Try not to have
text: a spontaneous epileptiform seizure.
text: The doorbell rings. Mary freezes, listens for the muffled
text: voices downstairs.
text: She sits on the corner of her bed and breathes rapidly into a
text: paper bag.
text: There's a knock on her bedroom door. Mary folds up the bag,
text: puts it in her pocket for later, then opens the door a crack.
dialog: It's her mother.
scene_heading: MRS. HOROWITZ
dialog: Guess who's here.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'd rather not.

scene_heading: MRS. HOROWITZ
dialog: Look at you.
speaker_heading: MARY
text: i already did. Repeatedly.
scene_heading: MRS. HOROWITZ
dialog: You're beautiful.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Please don't mean on the inside.
scene_heading: MRS. HOROWITZ
dialog: Beautiful and smart. And fun. And

dialog: Let's hope all that does it for

scene_heading: INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: A bored, CNN jacket wearing Steve looks up to see Mrs.
text: Horowitz descending the stairs. Not far behind, Mary takes
text: each step like her knees are fused together but still manages
text: to look hot. Steve's pleasantly surprised.
text: With one look at Steve, Mary's eyes glaze over as if a choir
text: is screaming "hallelujah" in her brain.
text: As Mary reaches the bottom step --
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Mary, hi. I'm Steve.
text: She puts up a finger - "just a second".
text: She turns around and runs back upstairs. Steve looks at Mrs.
text: Horowitz, confused.
scene_heading: MRS. HOROWITZ
dialog: And how's your mother?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Great. Thanks.
text: She just stares at him and smiles.
scene_heading: INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Mary runs into her room, kneels down in front of the mizrach
text: and crucifix on the wall. Hands clasped in prayer.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Gods. You may have noticed that
dialog: I'm wearing clean socks.
dialog: Translation: I'm really trying and
dialog: thus should be amply rewarded.
dialog: Thanks for your support.
text: She gets up, has a second thought, gets back onto her knees.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: And by support I don't mean, you
dialog: know -
text: She hikes up her bra.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I mean your assistance, your
dialog: furtherance, your advocacy of my

text: She concentrates hard, opens her eyes. Now she's ready.
scene_heading: INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Steve waits as Mary walks down the stairs again, this time a
text: bit more relaxed.
scene_heading: MRS. HOROWITZ
dialog: There we go.
text: Mary makes it to the bottom of the stairs, steps into her red

text: boots but who cares, Mary's still hot from the knee caps up.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Ready?
text: Mary nods a bunch of times.
dialog:

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Mrs. Horowitz. Goodnight.

dialog: Sir.
speaker_heading: MR. HOROWITZ (O.S.)
dialog: You kids have fun.
scene_heading: MRS. HOROWITZ
dialog: Be careful now. Don't forget your

text: Mrs. Horowitz sees them out the door then heads into the
text: living room. She waves to them out the window, trying to
text: hide her worry but failing miserably.
scene_heading: MR. HOROWITZ
dialog: She'll be fine.
text: They look at each other - a bit of hope, a bit of dread.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Steve unlocks the driver's side door of his SUV while Mary

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Sorry about this blind date thing.
dialog: My mother -
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I never went to kindergarten!
text: He looks at her, totally confused.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: They skipped me to the forth grade.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Okay.
text: She gets in the car, fastens her seatbelt. Steve hesitates
text: then heads to the driver's side, gets in.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I missed finger painting.
text: He has no clue what to say.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Sorry?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Me too.
text: She lunges for his lips but the seatbelt snaps her back
dialog: inches short.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Whoa!
text: Undeterred by the whiplash, Mary undoes her seatbelt and
text: tries again, this time making contact with Steve's lips.
text: He's more than a little startled but kisses her back anyway,
text: all the while straining to see the Horowitz house.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Mary... uh, what about your mother?
text: She straddles him and keeps kissing.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You're not her type. And she's
dialog: married.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: No, we're right in front of your
dialog: house and...
text: She undoes her sweater.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: And I have no problem with that
dialog: whatsoever.
text: She kisses his neck. He looks up with a "thank you, God".
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Steve?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Mary.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Is it Steven with a V or Stephen
dialog: with a P-H?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: V.
text: She works over his face over like it's an ice cream cone.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I thought so. There are almost a
dialog: million Stevens with a V in the
dialog: country, you know. It's much more
dialog: popular than the P-H way, almost
dialog: twice as popular in fact. I think
dialog: it's the Brits who prefer the P-H.
dialog: They love their P-H's over there.
dialog: Not as much as they love their fish
dialog: and chips but still, they love
dialog: them. It was the media thing, you
dialog: know, that's why our moms wanted us
dialog: to get together. You work in the
dialog: media, so do I. We really have to
dialog: hand it to our moms, Steve, we do,
dialog: and not just for raising us, or for
dialog: thriving during a time when women
dialog: painstakingly struggled for
dialog: equality, but I mean we should hand
dialog: it to them for being visionaries
dialog: and predicting our all encompassing
dialog: compatibility. We're
dialog: professionally compatible, yes, but
dialog: it's occurring to me at this
dialog: particular moment that we're also

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Polyester! See? Both synthetic

speaker_heading: KOCO REPORTER
dialog: Eleven months ago, the child we've

text: A few feet away, a female FOX NEWS REPORTER is on camera.
speaker_heading: FOX NEWS REPORTER
text: After months of legal wrangling, a
dialog: judge has ordered in favor of the

text: Steve signals they've cut, lowers his camera. Hartman calls
dialog: out to Angus.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: What if next time I say Baby Peggy
dialog: is like the wishbone of her
dialog: parents' dispute?
text: Hartman acts out a wishbone pull. Steve's disgusted.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah, go ahead and suggest that.
dialog: Corbitt will love it.
text: Steve turns and looks toward the edge of the fenced off
text: hospital grounds. Dozens of PROTESTORS are camped out - a
text: sorry assortment of oddballs standing at the fence, waving
text: their signs: "SPARE THE LEG", and "HONOR THE FATHER". Many
text: of them carry drawings of a three legged baby wearing a halo.
text: Steve braces himself and heads for the crowd. Half way
text: across, he spots a loner walking from the parking lot. He's
text: 35, chubby, his shirt buttoned one button off so it hangs
text: lower on the left. This is HOWARD. In one hand: a pro-leg
text: sign. In his other hand: a carton of chocolate milk.
text: Howard stops to lick up the chocolate milk spilling all over

scene_heading: EXT. OKLAHOMA CITY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL - DAY
text: Mary steps onto the hospital grounds and looks all around her
text: - NEWS CREWS circulate, PATIENTS and staff walk in and out of
text: the hospital, protestors line the fence. Somewhere in the
text: middle, she finds what she's hunting for -- Steve.
text: Mary's face lights up and she starts running toward him - in
text: her mind, no doubt in slow motion, with clouds parting to
text: light her way.
text: Steve's attention is drawn away from the interview with
text: Howard. He spots Mary running toward him, arms outstretched.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Please God, no.
text: He looks for a place to hide but she's running ridiculously
text: fast. It's too late. She's only a few feet away.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Steve!
text: She jumps into his arms but he's only got one arm free and

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Tell me you didn't come all the way

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Of course not... I went to Dallas
dialog: looking for you first. And you
dialog: know why?
text: Steve grabs his head. This is not happening.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Because you're inimitable and I'm

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: No, we're not. I don't know what
dialog: that means but trust me. We're so

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I know. I'm just here to support
dialog: you, show you I care, and also ask

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'll be right here in case you want

text: A SECURITY GUARD approaches her.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Miss, if you want to be here,
dialog: you're going to have to stay behind

speaker_heading: PROTESTORS
dialog: Near, far, wherever you are, we

speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: And like the noble tree frog whose
dialog: extra leg is nothing if not
dialog: natural, so Baby Peggy begins the
dialog: rest of her three legged life...
dialog: This is Hartman Hughes reporting
dialog: live from Oklahoma City.
text: Hartman pulls out his ear piece. Angus, Josh and Steve all
text: look at him, a bit surprised.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Tree frog? Where do you get this
dialog: shit?
text: Hartman taps the side of his head -- it's all up here.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: A little thing called astutitude,
dialog: my friends.
text: Steve and Angus look at each other -- is that even a word?
scene_heading: EXT. OKLAHOMA PROTESTORS CAMP - NIGHT
text: Mary celebrates with the other protestors. The Protestor and
text: his Protestor Wife cry tears of joy. Mary pulls a tissue out
text: of her bag, hands it over. The husband takes it, turns away
text: and wipes his eyes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: There you go, George. Just a

dialog: Nothing to be ashamed of.
text: Elizabeth runs up to Mary, hugs her.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You see? When you sing loud enough
dialog: and when your signs are big enough,
dialog: people listen!
text: Mary spots some of the news vans pulling away.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Steve!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Go, go on. I'll watch your stuff.

scene_heading: EXT. OKLAHOMA MEDIA CAMP - NIGHT
text: Josh pulls the back doors of the van shut.
scene_heading: INT. RENTAL VAN - NIGHT
text: Angus at the wheel, Hartman in the passenger seat. In the

text: Angus starts driving slowly across the grass behind other

scene_heading: EXT. RENTAL VAN - NIGHT
text: As the van drives, Mary runs to catch up.
speaker_heading: MARY

scene_heading: INT. RENTAL VAN - NIGHT

speaker_heading: HARTMAN

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: No, go. Fast.
text: Hartman rolls down his window.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Don't.
text: Hartman sticks his head out the window.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Hughes, I swear I'll kill you.
text: Hartman waves to Mary to catch up. Angus sees her in the
text: mirror as he drives.
speaker_heading: ANGUS
dialog: Is that her? She's hot.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Angus, come on man, get me out of
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: ANGUS
dialog: She's really hot.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Who cares? Jesus, you guys -
text: Angus hits the brakes. Steve hides behind the seat just as
text: Mary catches up with the van.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: Hi beautiful.
text: Mary tries to get a look at Steve but can only see part of
text: his back hunched over behind the seat.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Steve? Are you okay? Is he okay?
text: Angus leans over to her window.
speaker_heading: ANGUS
dialog: I don't think we've met. Angus.
text: Mary shakes Angus' hand. He can't take his eyes off her.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
text: Steve's not feeling well.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Oh no.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: I'm sure he'll be fine by the time
dialog: we get to New Mexico.
speaker_heading: ANGUS
dialog: Your eyes are striking.
text: Steve punches him through the seat. Mary's oblivious.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: Steve really wants you to follow
dialog: us. It would mean a lot to him.
speaker_heading: STAYS
text: Steve cringes, goes to speak up but stops himself and
dialog: hidden.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: He was going to go ask you himself
dialog: but look at the poor bastard. So
text: sick he can't even sit up straight.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What if it's a viral zoonotic
dialog: disease? He should see a doctor.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: Exactly what I told him, but the
dialog: only person he wants touching his
dialog: infected flesh is you.
text: Mary looks at Steve, worried.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: But wait, what if -
dialog: up.
text: Hartman grabs her face, squishes her lips to shut her
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: Hey now, we need you to be strong
dialog: for him. Leachinan trial, Santa Fe,
dialog: can you remember that?
text: Mary nods, unable to speak.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: We'll meet you there, God willing.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 58.
text: He lets go of her face.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Will you take care of him?
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: Like he's my own.
text: She backs away from the window. Angus waves to her and
text: starts driving.
speaker_heading: ANGUS
dialog: Nothing wrong with that one.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Except for those boots.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You're an asshole, Hughes.
text: Hartman laughs.
scene_heading: EXT. RENTAL VAN - NIGHT
text: Mary watches the van drive away.
scene_heading: EXT. OKLAHOMA PROTESTORS CAMP - NIGHT
text: Only a few protestors remain. Abandoned signs and garbage
text: cover the grass. Elizabeth gets autographs from other
text: protestors like it's the last day of high school.
text: Mary runs up, grabs her bags.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Elizabeth! I have to meet Steve at
dialog: his next job, in New Mexico. He's
text: sick, not as in rad, although he is
dialog: that too, but more like unwell,
dialog: infirm, perhaps barfy. Hopefully
dialog: nothing serious but you never can
dialog: be too sure and besides, healthy or
dialog: not, he needs me.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Sign my book before you go?
text: Elizabeth hands her the ratty hand decorated book and a pen.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: The trip's not too long, right
dialog: through all kinds of interesting
dialog: sites like, for example, El
dialog: Santuario de Chimayo: The Lourdes
dialog: of America. Know what that is? A
text: sacred sand pit near a burrito
dialog: stand. What could be better than
dialog: that?
text: Mary looks away from Elizabeth, fidgets a bit.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Want to go? Unless you're busy, I
dialog: mean. You probably have something
dialog: better to do.
text: Elizabeth thinks about it.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Not really.
text: Mary is stunned. She takes a minute to realize it's real,
text: gets excited. From behind her:
speaker_heading: HOWARD (O.S.)
dialog: I'll go too.
text: Mary turns around and spots Howard.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Mary, have you met Howard?
text: Mary shakes her head. Howard offers his hand. It's got
text: dried chocolate milk all over it. She takes it.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Mary, Howard. Howard, Mary. Mary,
dialog: Howard's got a car, you know. He
dialog: can drive us.
text: Mary looks at him, thinks about it.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What kind of car do you have?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Plymouth Colt.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What year?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Eighty-nine.
text: Mary quickly scans her memory.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Replace the recalled seat belts?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Yes.
text: Mary thinks about it, smiles.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Let's grab souvenirs!
text: Elizabeth and Howard each pick up a Baby Peggy sign off the
text: ground. Mary grabs as many as she can hold -- way, way too
text: many. A bunch of them slide off but she perseveres.
speaker_heading: MARY (V.0.)
dialog: Here's something you never see in
dialog: crosswords, two letter words, and
dialog: thank goodness for that. The word
dialog: "go": not fun. The word "vamoose":
dialog: super fun. You see? crosswords
dialog: are just like life in that way -
dialog: they're only boring if you have no
dialog: sense of adventure.
scene_heading: INT. HOWARD'S CAR - NIGHT
text: Howard starts the car. In the passenger seat, Elizabeth has
text: a bunch of the protest signs crammed in at her feet.
text: Mary gets settled in the back seat, spots a copy of
text: Scientific American magazine, then finds an apple stuck
text: behind the seat belt. She yanks the apple out, looks at it.
text: Howard looks at her in the rear view mirror.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: You can have that. I have more.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Thanks.
text: Mary puts the apple in her Kroger bag.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Howard, if you get sleepy and want
dialog: to trade off driving for a while,

speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: MARY (cont'd)
dialog: I'm a night owl, yes, but I'm also
text: a day owl too, a burrowing owl,
dialog: technically. They stay awake all
dialog: day too. I'm pretty much alert
dialog: 24/7, always have been. No
dialog: caffeine. Just sugar and my
dialog: natural tendency to, you know,
dialog: never fall asleep.
text: Mary leans back, closes her eyes, and she's out.
scene_heading: EXT. I-40 - NIGHT
text: Howard's car merges onto the highway, westbound toward New

scene_heading: EXT. SANTA FE FEDERAL COURT HOUSE - DAY
dialog: A media extravaganza - local, national and this time,

text: A REPORTER for Inside Edition talks on camera.
scene_heading: INSIDE EDITION REPORTER
dialog: This tragedy began eight months ago
dialog: in what was once paradise - the
dialog: Elysium Sanctuary outside of Taos,
dialog: New Mexico. For years, celebrities
dialog: considered the five star meditation
dialog: resort the only true place for
dialog: spiritual purification, and with
text: good reason. Nestled in the heart
dialog: of reclaimed Pueblo Indian lands,
dialog: the Elysium Sanctuary promised one
dialog: thing - enlightenment.
text: A COURT TV REPORTER is on camera a few feet away.
speaker_heading: COURT TV REPORTER
dialog: But the Elysium Sanctuary would
dialog: never be the same after tragedy
dialog: struck last winter. Twenty-six
dialog: year old resort masseuse Juan
dialog: Carlos Velasquez found stabbed to
dialog: death in the meditation villa of
dialog: beloved star of stage and screen,
dialog: Cloris Leachman.
dialog: 
dialog:

scene_heading: EXTRA! REPORTER
dialog: Publicists for the eighty year old
dialog: Leachman insist her relationship
dialog: with the deceased Velasquez was no
dialog: different than with the dozens of
dialog: other resort personnel attending to
text: Ms. Leachman during her solitude
dialog: retreat.
text: At the end of the row, Hartman reports.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: But the octogenarian Leachman may
dialog: not have been as innocent as her
dialog: representatives claimed, at least
dialog: according to the evidence found at
dialog: the murder scene.
text: Hartman reads from his notes.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
text: Whips, hot wax, bamboo skewers, a
dialog: spanking bench, and perhaps most
text: damaging, a henna tattoo across Ms.
dialog: Leachman's chest that read "Mrs.
dialog: Juan Carlos Velasquez".
scene_heading: EXT. SANTA FE FEDERAL COURT HOUSE - DAY
text: Elizabeth, Mary and Howard step onto the curb and survey the
dialog: crowd.
text: On one side, an odd assortment of fans with signs like "FREE
scene_heading: CLORIS", "JAIL REAL CRIMINALS, NOT OLD LADIES" and "OSCAR
text: WINNERS DON'T KILL", with photos of Cloris Leachman through
dialog: the years.
text: On the other side of the crowd, a smaller group of MEXICAN
text: MOURNERS with signs "JUSTICE FOR JUAN", "GUILTY", and "LET
text: THE BITCH FRY".
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Guilty or not?
text: They all think about it. A greasy haired Shaman CLYDE steps
text: up behind them.
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: CLYDE
dialog: Everybody deserves the benefit of
dialog: the doubt.

speaker_heading: CLYDE
dialog: Everybody.

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Be has a point.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Yay! I love Cloris Leachman.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Who doesn't?
speaker_heading: MEXICAN MOURNERS
dialog: jMuerte! iMuerte! iMuerte!
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I have to go find Steve. How do I
dialog: look?
text: Unwashed hair, bed head, and there's a chunk of a Twinkie
text: caked onto Mary's ear. Elizabeth picks the Twinkie off,
text: smooths down Mary's hair.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Perfect.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'll be back. Save me a sign! And
dialog: if Cloris comes out, tell her I
dialog: loved her in "My Little Pony: The
dialog: Movie".
text: Mary runs off as Howard and Elizabeth join the crowd of fans.
scene_heading: EXT. SANTA FE FEDERAL COURT HOUSE - MEDIA CAMP - DAY
text: Mary walks among the news vans. At the entrance to a nearby

speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: Hi gorgeous. What'd you do to your
dialog: hair?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Slept on it in the car. Where's

speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: Never better. Come in and wait.

scene_heading: INT. MEDIA TENT - DAY
text: A briefing area is set up - folding chairs, table, podium. A

text: Vince (CNN), DOUG (CNN), the COURT TV REPORTER, a BBC NEWS
scene_heading: PHOTOGRAPHER, a FRENCH PHOTOGRAPHER, A SPANISH JOURNALIST and
dialog: Angus.
text: Hartman escorts Mary in. The guys perk up a bit.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: You all know Mary? Steve's
dialog: girlfriend?
text: Mary shakes hands around the table, greets them all in their
dialog: native tongues.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Hello... Bonjour... Hola...
dialog: Jolly afternoon...
text: She gets to Angus. He kisses her hand.
speaker_heading: ANGUS
dialog: My dear, sit.
text: He shoves the BBC guy out of the way to make room for Mary
text: next to him. Vince shuffles the cards.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Mary, you in?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Poker? Technically I'm familiar
dialog: but I've never actually played.
dialog: With people, I mean.
scene_heading: SPANISH JOURNALIST

scene_heading: EXT. SANTA FE FEDERAL COURT HOUSE - SPECTATORS AREA - DAY

scene_heading: INT. MEDIA TENT - DAY
text: Mary holds her cards close to her.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: "There are few things that are so

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Mark Twain. And you know what else-
speaker_heading: BBC NEWS PHOTOGRAPHER
dialog: Darling, you in or not?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Sorry.
text: Mary looks at her cards, thinks about it for way too long,
text: then grabs a handful of coins from her Kroger bag, slaps them
text: on the table.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Send it, ladies!
text: Steve steps into the tent, spots Mary, turns to run back out.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: Don't go, Steve! Look who's here.
text: Mary jumps up - just about knocks the table over, then
text: sustains a number of injuries trying to leap over chairs. At
text: last she makes it to Steve, hugs him.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Thank God you're okay!
dialog: 
dialog:

text: He looks over her shoulder and mouths "you're dead" to
dialog: Hartman.
speaker_heading: TO
text: He holds her back at arm's length, looks at her, goes

scene_heading: EXT. MEDIA TENT - DAY
text: Steve tries to stay calm talking to Mary.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You have to stop stalking me.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'm not. It's more like picking
dialog: travel destinations based on where
dialog: you happen to be working.
speaker_heading: STEVE
text: Stalking.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Hartman told me you wanted me here.
dialog: Now that I am, what better

dialog: each other better.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: This is crazy.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Hartman said you'd say that.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Go home, Mary.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: And he said you'd say that too.
dialog: It's just your fear talking.
text: Steve just about loses it.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: He's not my friend, he's not your

text: He yells toward the tent.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Hughes! Get out here!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

text: Mary looks right at him.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You know how sometimes you see a

dialog: guy with an attractive girl and you
dialog: think how the heck did he pull that
dialog: off? People won't think that when
dialog: they look at us. We're perfectly

speaker_heading: STEVE
speaker_heading: HUGHES!
text: Hartman peeks out of the tent.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: For the hundredth time, Steve, no,
dialog: I am not interested in a threesome
dialog: with you and your new girlfriend.
text: Steve points to Mary.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Tell her the truth. About all the
dialog: crap you told her.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: Okay. Fine.
text: Hartman goes to Mary, grabs her hand.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: Everything I said about Steve,
dialog: about his feelings for you, his
dialog: hopes, his dreams, his fears, his
dialog: unexplainable odor, forget about
dialog: it. Forget everything I said.
dialog: None of it was true.
text: Mary's stunned, devastated. She looks like she's going to
text: cry. Hartman and Steve look at each other - what now?
text: Hartman shoves him forward. Steve reluctantly puts a
text: comforting hand on her shoulder.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: Because nothing I said comes close
text: to the enormity of Steve's real
dialog: feelings for you!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 68.
text: Mary perks up. Steve yanks his hand off her shoulder like

speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: It's a love that defies words!
text: Steve jumps him. Hartman fights back. Mary's horrified.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Stop it, you guys! Stop! "Victory

dialog: You know who said that? Gandhi.
dialog: And me. Just now.

scene_heading: INT. MEDIA TENT - DAY
text: At the poker table, the guys hear scuffling outside.
speaker_heading: BBC NEWS PHOTOGRAPHER

scene_heading: SPANISH JOURNALIST

speaker_heading: VINCE

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: No! This isn't about money! It's

speaker_heading: JOURNALISTS
dialog: Ohhhh!

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Tell her!
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: Okay, alright.

speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: Mary, millions of people believe

speaker_heading: ANGUS
dialog: Verdict's in.

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Please! Somebody help him! Apply
