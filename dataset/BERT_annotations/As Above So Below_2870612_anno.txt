scene_heading: INT. IRANIAN BUS - AFTERNOON
text: Camera powers up, jostles around until it settles on --
text: The floor of a third world bus. Middle Eastern legs,
text: traditional Arabian dresses to the floor, homemade bags,
text: animals everywhere. A chaotic scene with men, women, children
text: all shouting in Farsi. Brief glimpses of a mountainous
text: landscape through the shaky windows. This bus could really
dialog: use some new shocks and a better muffler.
text: The camera rises, turns around revealing its operator, a
text: WOMAN wearing a hajib (a traditional Arabian headdress). She
text: slumps low in her seat for privacy, looks around cautiously,
text: and carefully lowers her veil revealing --
text: SCARLETT DURANG, mid 20s, an adventurous British
text: archaeologist. The kind of cat that gets killed by curiosity.
text: Her off-the-charts intellect and multiple post-grad degrees
text: are barely concealed by her striking good looks and punk rock
dialog: inclinations.
text: Judging from the cloth that edges frame, she is obviously
text: shooting with a small camera attached to her hajib.
text: She whispers to the camera - alert, but not scared.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I'm approximately 20 miles inside
text: the Iranian border en route to the
dialog: Habala region where they have
dialog: ordered the destruction of a
dialog: network of caves at sundown
dialog: tonight. I believe these caves
dialog: might contain a critical missing
dialog: piece of our history. A piece I
dialog: can’t let them destroy.
text: She turns the camera back around, then pauses and goes back
text: to her face.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh, and if I’m found dead, please
dialog: know I entered the country of my
dialog: own free will, fully knowing the
dialog: penalty for trespassing here is
dialog: burial up to your neck in sand and
text: having a rock wall pushed on top of
dialog: you. Which, you know, seems
dialog: perfectly appropriate.
text: She grins mischievously.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: But they’1l have to catch me first.
scene_heading: EXT. HABALA PROVINCE - SUNSET
text: Sun is almost touching the horizon.
text: The camera shakes as Scarlett crosses through a sparsely
text: populated marketplace as megaphones in the background demand
text: everyone clear the area.
text: Scarlett is careful to keep pace with REZA, a mousy Persian
text: with a neatly trimmed moustache and a weathered knockoff
text: Tommy Hilfiger T-shirt. He leads her to a small, rock hut of
dialog: a home.
speaker_heading: REZA
dialog: Hurry! Come!
scene_heading: INT. POOR IRANIAN HOME - SUNSET
text: The camera follows Reza into a shanty.
speaker_heading: REZA
dialog: If they catch you here it would be
dialog: very bad for you.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Yeah. I know.
text: Reza nods to his WIFE, in traditional garb. She nods back and
text: slides some sooty wooden shelves aside revealing --
text: A PERSON-SIZED HOLE IN THE FLOOR THAT QUICKLY FADES TO
scene_heading: DARKNESS .
text: Scarlett smiles.
text: She shines her mini flashlight into the hole, the ground is
text: about 10 feet down.
text: She gets ready to climb in.
speaker_heading: REZA
dialog: Wait. You’1l need this.
text: Reza grabs a homemade rope ladder that’s tied to the base of
text: the stove and drops it into the hole.
scene_heading: INT. HABALA CAVES - SUNSET
text: Scarlett climbs into the dark cavern.
text: As the camera crosses the threshold it moves into near total
text: darkness. Background sound from the streets above become
text: faint echoes.
text: Reza drops down right behind her.
text: A grinding sound as Reza’s wife slides the bookshelves back
text: into place, obliterating the light above.
text: Once Scarlett gets her footing, she shines her flashlight
text: down the cave corridor. It's long and dark. It's about 4 feet
text: tall, forcing Scarlett and Reza into a crouched scamper.
speaker_heading: REZA
dialog: We don’t have much time. They have
dialog: already cleared the area.
text: They race deeper and deeper into the cave.
text: A MEGAPHONE SQUALL. THEY JUMP. SOMEONE SPEAKS FARSI INTO A
text: MEGAPHONE RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER -- COMING TOWARD THEM!
text: They race back and take cover behind a rock. Scarlett grabs a
text: rock off the floor in case she needs to use it as a weapon.
text: An ARMED GUARD passes, calling instructions out into the
text: megaphone. If he just looks over his shoulder, he’1l see
text: them. But he doesn’t.
speaker_heading: REZA (CONT'D)
dialog: We need to leave. We’re too late.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: They're not blowing the caves until
dialog: sundown, right?
text: Scarlett checks her watch.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: Should give us a few more minutes.
speaker_heading: REZA
dialog: It’s too risky.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Which way is it? I'll go without
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: REZA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I’m not leaving.
text: Reza can see she’s not bluffing. And she’s not. He
text: reluctantly continues.
speaker_heading: REZA
dialog: Hurry!
text: They race through one last corridor, then arrive at their
dialog: destination --
speaker_heading: REZA (CONT'D)
dialog: There.
text: Scarlett races to it - a wall full of ancient Coptic
dialog: Christian inscriptions.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: (whispers )
dialog: It’s even more beautiful than the
dialog: pictures.
text: She runs her fingers through the grooves as if she’s reading
text: braille. She quietly reads aloud in an ancient tongue.
speaker_heading: REZA
dialog: We must hurry. Please!
text: The camera seems to drift down, and she resets it a couple
dialog: times until--
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: How can anyone think straight with
dialog: these head covers falling all
text: She anxiously whips the veil off her head and throws it down
text: on the floor beside her, RE-FRAMING THE CAVE IN AN AWKWARD
scene_heading: ANGLE, CAPTURING SHE, REZA, AND THE WALL SIDEWAYS.
text: She continues reading the inscriptions.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: There’s more.
text: She looks around frantically, grabs a rock off the floor.
speaker_heading: REZA
dialog: We have to go!
text: She hacks away at the inscriptions with the rock, chiseling
text: off chunks of stone with each hit.
speaker_heading: REZA (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing?!
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: They're going to blow it up anyway!
speaker_heading: REZA
dialog: They’1l hear you! Stop!
text: A whistle blows in the distance. Someone shouts in Farsi.
speaker_heading: REZA (CONT'D)
dialog: They're going to blow it.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I just need a minute.
speaker_heading: REZA
dialog: We don’t have a minute!
text: She analyzes the stone wall. Picks a specific spot marked by
text: an inscribed rose. Takes one more hit and THE WHOLE WALL
text: COLLAPSES TO THE GROUND revealing --
text: A GIANT STONE STATUE OF A BULL HOLDING A SNAKE IN ITS MOUTH.
text: IT’S FACE IS FIERCE, OMINOUS, CREEPY. AND IT’S COVERED WITH
scene_heading: INSCRIPTIONS.
text: One glance at it and Scarlett knows what it is.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Oh my God! Do you know what this
dialog: is?!
text: It takes her a moment to snap to. Reza grabs her and
text: physically tries to escort her away.
speaker_heading: REZA
dialog: We must go! Now!
text: She pushes her way free.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I have been searching for this all
dialog: my life! Go! I’1l catch up!
speaker_heading: REZA
dialog: I’m sorry. I have a family.
text: REZA RUNS OFF, LEAVING HER ALONE IN THE CAVE.
text: Scarlett whips out a small piece of equipment the size of
text: remote control from a small satchel hidden under her robes.
text: We hear faint voices on megaphones from down the tunnels.
text: The small scanner hums to life as it emits a solid line of
text: green light. Scarlett begins to methodically blanket the
text: statue with the laser, scanning it for future study.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Come on.
text: The light creates eerie shadows of the statue on vaulted
text: ceilings of the chamber.
text: She's painfully slow making sure to get every detail of this
text: ancient relic. The voices from the megaphones are getting
text: louder and more foreboding.
text: The voice in the megaphone seems to be doing a countdown, but
text: in the foreign language, it’s hard to tell which number it’s
dialog: down to.
text: Scarlett knows how close she’s cutting this, but she won’t
text: lose this piece of history. She continues swiping the green
text: laser line from the scanner over every side of the bull.
dialog: She's done!
text: She grabs her headdress and runs like hell.
speaker_heading: BOOM!
text: A BLACK DUST CLOUD RUSHES PAST SCARLETT, LEAVING HER IN THE
text: DARK IN THE CAVE. SHE COUGHS A COUPLE TIMES, BUT CONTINUES.
speaker_heading: BOOM!
scene_heading: ANOTHER BLAST.
speaker_heading: BOOM!
text: Scarlett keeps racing forward, hoping the sounds of
text: collapsing rock won’t catch her.
text: She slams into something.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
scene_heading: REZA! REZA!
text: Something moves. Sunlight cracks through the dust. The rope
text: ladder drops.
text: Scarlett climbs into the light.
scene_heading: INT. POOR IRANIAN HOME - SUNDOWN
text: And back into Reza’s house.
text: She collapses on the ground, coughing furiously.
text: She holds up the scanner.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I got it. I got it.
text: She keeps coughing as Reza shakes his head.
speaker_heading: REZA
dialog: You remind me so much of your
dialog: father. But you must be more
dialog: careful. His quest was a path to
dialog: madness.
speaker_heading: CUT OUT:
dialog: Note: The following Kickstarter video will be more “produced”
text: than the rest of the film - full of B-Roll, even music,
dialog: glossy - a real presentational video.
scene_heading: INT. SCARLETT’S OFFICE - UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON
text: Scarlett, now in her “street clothes” has a punk-rock hip
text: that’s hard to deny. She looks directly into the camera and
dialog: talks.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Hello Kickstarter. My name is
dialog: Scarlett Durang, and I may have
dialog: just discovered the key to immortal
dialog: life.
scene_heading: INT. SCARLETT’S OFFICE - DAY
text: BENJI DONAGHAN, late 20s, a friendly, slightly heavy red
text: Irishman. The devilish glint in his eyes reminds us of that
dialog: rascally friend we all like to drink with when we need a
dialog: laugh.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: I’m Benji Donaghan. For those of
dialog: you who’ve seen my previous
dialog: documentaries like LONER or BROTHER
dialog: IN ARMS, you know I am fascinated
dialog: with obsessive personality types.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: SCARLETT TALKS TO CAMERA
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I’m a professor of archaeology at
dialog: University College London. I have a
dialog: PhD in Egyptology. A masters in
dialog: chemistry and another PhD in
dialog: linguistics. I am fluent in four
dialog: spoken languages, and two dead
dialog: ones.
dialog: (she smiles)
dialog: And I'm a blackbelt in Krav Maga.
text: BENJI TALKS TO CAMERA
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: I have yet to see her do anything.
dialog: Literally anything at all that
text: isn’t driven by her all-consuming
dialog: quest to find the lost knowledge of
dialog: the alchemists.
text: BACK TO SCARLETT
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: What is alchemy?
text: She smiles. This is a big question.
text: A montage of imagery: Alchemists, arcane symbols,
text: representations of the Philosopher's Stone and the processes
dialog: used to create it play over the following.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Alchemy was an early form of
dialog: science in which the practitioners
dialog: attempted to create a mythical
dialog: substance known as the
dialog: Philosopher's Stone, which could
dialog: turn base metals to gold, cure
dialog: disease and provide the key to
dialog: eternal life.
scene_heading: EXT. RUE NICOLAS FLAMEL - DAY
text: Scarlett points to the house behind her.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: 600 years ago, the greatest of the
dialog: alchemists, Nicolas Flamel, lived
dialog: in this house in Paris.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT'D)
dialog: He was widely believed to have
dialog: succeeded in developing the
dialog: Philosopher’s Stone, which would
dialog: have given him all the wealth he
dialog: could dream of as well as eternal
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: I/E. MONTAGE
text: Imagery of Flamel’s life done in the old style of woodcuts.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Though we don’t have definitive
dialog: proof of this, we do know that he
dialog: was a middle class book dealer who
dialog: suddenly became one of the
dialog: wealthiest men in Paris...
text: Present day footage of buildings his money built.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: ...-donating orphanages and
dialog: hospitals all over the city, many
dialog: of which still stand today.
scene_heading: EXT. RUE NICOLAS FLAMEL - DAY
text: Back to Scarlett.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: In fact, he was so generous with
dialog: this money, that 600 years later,
dialog: this street in Paris is still named
dialog: after him.
text: The camera pans off her to the sign “Rue Nicolas Flamel”
text: beside her.
scene_heading: EXT. FONTAINE DES INNOCENTS - DAY
text: Scarlett now stands near the Fontaine des Innocents - the
text: last remnant of Paris’ original cemetery.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: We also know that when grave
text: robbers, hoping to get their hands
dialog: on the Philosopher’s Stone, tried
text: to dig his body up out of a
dialog: cemetery that used to surround this
dialog: spot here, they found his casket
text: empty. As well as his wife’s.
scene_heading: INT. MUSEUM - DAY
dialog: 10.
text: Scarlett stands in front of an archaeological exhibit ina
dialog: Parisian museum.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: And we know that 400 years later,
dialog: an archeologist working for King
dialog: Louis XV met an old man in Turkey
dialog: who knew things he believed only
dialog: Nicolas Flamel could have known. He
dialog: was convinced to his dying day that
dialog: this man had been Flamel himself.
scene_heading: INT. SCARLETT’S OFFICE - DAY
text: Again, Scarlett sits in her office talking to camera, though
text: she seems uncomfortable with the question asked of her.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I... came from a studious
dialog: household, I guess. When I was 7,
dialog: my mother died suddenly and... we
dialog: took it really hard. My dad dropped
dialog: everything to search for the key to
dialog: everlasting life. And I went with
text: him. Everywhere.
text: Benji speaks to camera.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Her father was a Nobel Laureate!
dialog: When he dropped out and went
dialog: searching for Nicolas Flamel’s
dialog: discovery, it was the scandal of
dialog: academia. Everyone chalked it off
dialog: to madness.
text: Scarlett talks.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: No, he wasn’t crazy. He just
dialog: believed that some things in this
dialog: universe aren’t wired together as
dialog: simply as modern science might
dialog: suggest.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 11.
text: Benji speaks.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: After spending 20 years chasing
text: clues, her father took his own
dialog: life.
scene_heading: INT. MUSEE DE CLUNY - DAY
text: Scarlett stands in front of a glass case holding a GRAVESTONE
text: COVERED IN SYMBOLS at the Musee de Cluny.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: This was Flamel’s gravestone, which
dialog: he designed and carved himself.
text: The camera zooms in on it.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: Many believe that the clues to the
dialog: location of the Philosopher’s Stone
text: is encoded in these arcane symbols,
dialog: but its meaning has remained a
dialog: mystery until this...
text: She holds up a photograph of the statue she scanned in Iran.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
text: The fabled “Rose Key,” a kind of
dialog: Rosetta Stone deciphering
dialog: alchemical symbols into Aramaic.
scene_heading: INT. SCARLETT’S OFFICE
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: We are seeking money to both
dialog: finance the expedition to find this
dialog: mythical stone, and for me to shoot
dialog: a documentary chronicling
dialog: Scarlett’s journey.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Let us conquer death together.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SCARLETT’S OFFICE - EVENING
dialog: Note: from this point forward, everything will be shown in a
text: “raw footage” style.
dialog: 12.
text: The camera powers on, settling on Scarlett at the computer.
text: This lacks all the polish displayed in the promo video. This
text: is the beginning of the documentary footage.
text: Scarlett sits at her computer.
speaker_heading: BENJI (0.C.)
dialog: Hit refresh.
text: She does. The camera turns to reveal: of $30,000 they’re
text: trying to raise to make their documentary, they are $29,975
dialog: of the way there.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Almost there!
speaker_heading: BENJI (0.C.)
dialog: Hit it again.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Give it a moment.
text: She can’t wait. She hits it.
speaker_heading: BENJI (0.C.)
dialog: Some moment.
dialog: $29,990.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: So close.
speaker_heading: BENJI (0.C.)
dialog: Hit it again. Hit it again.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: You.
text: He hits it. “FUNDED!”
text: Scarlett pops a bottle of champagne, pours them each a glass.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: Get on camera!
text: He does. They clink glasses.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: How do you feel?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Like it’s time to get to work.
text: She motions to her statue of the Rose Key.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT'D)
dialog: Now all we need is someone who can
dialog: read Aramaic.
dialog: (She smiles wryly)
dialog: Good thing I know a guy.
scene_heading: EXT. RUE DES JARDINS - DAY
text: Scarlett sees a small crowd gathered on a street watching
text: GEORGE, late 20s, handsomely enthusiastic in a bookish way.
dialog: One look and you know he’s the kind of warm-hearted guy you
dialog: could always depend on in a pinch.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: This is what I love about Paris.
dialog: You can literally step up to any
text: corner and there are layers and
dialog: layers of history going back
dialog: thousands of years. Someone, name
dialog: an era.
text: A couple hands go up. George points at one.
speaker_heading: STUDENT
dialog: French Revolution.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, there’s a good one for that.
dialog: Look at this street right here. In
dialog: 1795 royalist sympathizers stormed
dialog: the streets threatening the
dialog: deputies of the National
dialog: Convention.
text: Benji walks the camera closer as George talks.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Napoleon Bonaparte, recently made
dialog: Commander of the Army of the
dialog: Interior, was asked to stop them.
dialog: So what does he do? He fires
dialog: cannons into the crowd! Cannons
dialog: loaded with pellets so they would
dialog: literally decimate hundreds of
dialog: people. So what do you think the
dialog: government did when they found out?
dialog: You think they reprimanded him? Put
dialog: him in jail? Anything? No! They
dialog: promoted him! You do not want to
dialog: piss off the French.
text: He looks around at the crowd.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, who wants to pick another
dialog: era?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: The era of Nicolas Flamel?
text: George knows that voice. He looks like he’s just been hit by
text: a 2x4 as he spots Scarlett there listening to him.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (to the class)
dialog: Give me a moment, please.
text: George walks to Scarlett.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Whatever it is, I want no part of
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: You haven’t even heard...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'll save you the time. No.
text: George looks to the camera guy.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Who's this guy?
dialog: (looks to Benji)
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: He’s making a film about my search
dialog: for...
speaker_heading: BENJI (0.C.)
dialog: I’m Benji.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (to Benji)
dialog: Word to the wise... walk, don’t run
dialog: from this one!
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: You mean run don’t walk?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah. Shut up.
dialog: (to Benji)
dialog: Did she tell you last time I saw
dialog: her, I literally wound up in a
dialog: Turkish prison?!
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: It was more like a jail than a
dialog: prison.
text: George looks at the camera guy and points at her. You getting
dialog: a load of this?!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It was jail. In Turkey. Think she
dialog: was there waiting for me when I got
dialog: out?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: (sheepish)
dialog: I couldn’t let the lead go dead.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: God forbid. Well go on, chase your
dialog: lead. See how far that gets you. I
dialog: have a class to teach.
text: He turns to walk away.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I found the Rose Key.
text: This stops him in his tracks.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You did?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It was in Iran wasn’t it.
dialog: (catches himself)
dialog: Forget I asked, I don’t care.
dialog: (stops)
dialog: It was though, wasn’t it.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I knew it! Ha! I knew it!
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I need your help translating the
dialog: Aramaic.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Wait. Did you go to Iran?!
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: It doesn’t matter who went.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You did, didn’t you. By yourself?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: It doesn’t matter who...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You are such a lunatic.
dialog: (to the camera)
dialog: She is a total lunatic. Be careful.
dialog: (to Scarlett)
dialog: I‘1ll help translate. But that’s it!
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Okay.
text: He smiles, excited despite himself.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (before going)
dialog: I knew it would be in Iran.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE’S ARCHAEOLOGICAL WORKSHOP - EVENING
text: George and Scarlett look over a small model replica of the
text: statue she found in Iran and a large photo printing of
text: Flamel’s tombstone.
text: Scarlett waits anxiously as George analyzes the symbols
text: writes as he goes.
text: The room is full of artifacts, mud, microscopes. All bones
text: and clay and dirt. All function, no form. Completely lacking
text: a woman’s touch.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Almost done?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Shh.
text: She paces. She’s been waiting for this moment all her life.
text: George puts his pen down.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: What does it say?!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: ("oh my God!)
dialog: It says the Philosopher’s Stone is
dialog: in the Champs Elysee’s Starbucks
dialog: bathroom.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Seriously.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Okay, let me read. I think it’s in
dialog: couplets, so let me try to get the
dialog: rhythm right.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Just tell me what...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Let me do this right...
dialog: (reads )
dialog: “Winged vulture leads your way,
dialog: with brightest light, in darkest
dialog: day.
text: Scarlett sits, not sure what this means.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Underneath the heaven's reign, what
dialog: is lost shall be regained, when
text: halfway twixt the darkest gate and
dialog: this tablet laid atop this pair'ed
dialog: fate.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Parrot?!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Pair’ed.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Pair’ed? You mean paired?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yes. But paired doesn’t rhyme.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: And it has to rhyme?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It rhymed in Aramaic. I’m trying to
dialog: do justice to the translation.
dialog: 17.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: This tablet? You’re sure it said
dialog: this tablet?!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Of course I’m sure.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
text: This tablet. The headstone is a
dialog: marker.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Where it was, in a cemetery that no
dialog: longer exists.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Yeah. “Underneath the heaven's
dialog: reign, what is lost shall be
dialog: regained...”
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: “What is lost shall be regained.”
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: That’s got to be the Philosopher's
dialog: Stone.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: “Underneath heaven’s reign...”
dialog: could be under the night sky...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Or under this tombstone! It’s got a
text: night sky right on it.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: “darkest gate...”
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Hell. “Darkest gate.” The gates of
dialog: hell.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Okay. But that gives us nothing.
text: Halfway between his grave and the
dialog: gates of hell?
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Wait, wait, wait!
text: Scarlett rushes to a SMALL NOTEBOOK FULL OF ALCHEMICAL
text: SYMBOLS AND TEXT. It looks like something written by a
dialog: madman.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: My dad’s notebook. He left it to
dialog: me. There was something...
text: She rifles through it, finds a page. She slams the book down
text: on the table.
text: George looks at it as the camera looks on. It’s a replica of
text: an arcane drawing of the heavenly bodies above the earth, the
dialog: ground, and hell within. But the thing that makes this
dialog: interesting... the distances are noted.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It has the distances they believed
dialog: between heaven and earth and hell!
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: According to the alchemists, the
dialog: number of the Devil was 741. Makes
dialog: sense they would believe hell to be
text: 741 feet beneath the surface of the
dialog: earth.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: So halfway twixt this tablet and...
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
text: 370.5 feet directly beneath his
dialog: tombstone is where we’ll find the
text: Philosopher’s Stone.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Feet were a bit shorter back then.
dialog: More like 10.8 inches per foot.

speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: How are we going to get 370 feet
dialog: into the earth?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Scarlett, you're in Paris!
text: She gets his meaning.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: The catacombs!
speaker_heading: BENJI (0.C.)
dialog: What are “the catacombs?”
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It’s a network of tunnels under the
text: streets of Paris, that spans over
dialog: 200 miles...? No, nothing?
text: He sees Benji really doesn’t know anything about it, so he
text: goes on.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: In the 1700s, the Cemetaire des
dialog: Innocents...
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Where the Flamel and his wife were
text: supposedly buried.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Was so full of hundreds of years of
dialog: dead bodies, that the entire city
dialog: stank, and people were getting
dialog: sick. It was disgusting. So... they
dialog: took all the lime quarries under
dialog: the city and used them to house the
text: remains of some 6 million bodies.
text: He lets that sink in.
speaker_heading: BENJI (0.C.)
dialog: Six million?!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It’s by far the world’s largest
dialog: crypt.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: So we might be able to just walk
dialog: right on down there?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: And get your Philosopher's Stone.
dialog: Which, for the record, I don’t
dialog: really actually believe in.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: You will.
dialog: 21.
scene_heading: EXT. FONTAINE DES INNOCENTS - DAY
text: Scarlett, George and Benji stand on a street corner near
text: where the Flamels were allegedly buried. Scarlett refers to
text: her father’s notebook.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: According to Sir Isaac Newton, who
dialog: was a legendary alchemist, Flamel’s
dialog: grave was twenty seven paces due
text: north from the fountain.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Let’s walk it out.
text: She paces her steps, counting as she goes. She waves to
text: traffic as she walks right through the busy Paris
text: intersection. George shakes his head, looks to Benji.
text: She stops. Calls back to them.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Right...
speaker_heading: HOOONNNKK!
text: The camera spins as A CAR SCREECHES TO A STOP RIGHT BESIDE
text: SCARLETT AND THE CAMERA, scaring the shit out of them both.
text: They get out of the street. Scarlett takes a breath, trying
text: to play off the adrenalin surging through her veins.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT'D)
text: 370.5 feet below that point.
scene_heading: INT. ARCHAEOLOGICAL WORKSHOP - NIGHT
text: Scarlett marks a large map of Paris with a red x.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
text: This is where Flamel’s grave was.
text: George lifts a map of the catacombs printed on transparency
text: and pins it over the map of Paris.
text: FLAMEL’S GRAVE FALLS IN AN AREA WITHOUT TUNNELS UNDER IT.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Shit.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: The catacombs don’t go under
text: Flamel’s grave.
text: Scarlett takes a step back. Thinking.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: So what do we do?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: We? There’s no we here. I’m helping
dialog: with translation. That’s it.
text: Scarlett chooses to ignore him.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Maybe we could burrow in through
dialog: this tunnel.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Burrow in? You know how thick these
dialog: walls are? They’re made of solid
dialog: granite, and they’ve all been
dialog: reinforced since....
text: Something occurs to George.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: «+. parts of the city collapsed
dialog: into it!
text: George looks like he’s just been struck by lightning.
text: He feverishly grabs a small handful of pins, races to the
dialog: map.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: In 1774, about 100 feet of Avenue
dialog: Denfert-Rochereau...
text: He places a pin in the map.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Was literally swallowed up into the
text: ground, falling 100 feet into the
dialog: earth.
text: He places another pin.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Another collapse happened a few
dialog: years later at Barriére d'Enfer.
text: Followed by a collapse here at...
dialog: Avenue des Fontaines!
text: He places a pin right next to the “x” marking Flamel’s grave.
text: Scarlett gets where he’s going with this.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Why would the street collapse if
text: it’s nothing but solid ground
dialog: underneath it?!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Exactly!
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: There must be a hidden chamber!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It would appear so.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: We have to get down there.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Again, there’s no “we” here.

text: Scarlett buys tickets.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Three tickets please.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, no, I’m not going in. Just two
dialog: tickets.
text: Scarlett shoots George a strange look.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Three.
text: Scarlett buys three tickets despite George’s reservations.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I’m serious. I’m not going in
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Don’t tell me you’re scared of a
dialog: little cave?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I... have a thing.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: What kind of thing?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I don’t go underground.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: You're an archaeologist!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I know. But I never go underground.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: That's kind of sad. It’s like being
dialog: a deaf composer or something.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Regardless, you’re not getting me
dialog: down there.
scene_heading: INT. PARIS CATACOMBS OFFICIAL TOUR AREA - DAY
text: Benji films Scarlett following the official tour of THE
text: CATACOMBS. Bones and plaques neatly arranged in a morbid but

text: A French tour guide tours the group of Americans and Brits.
speaker_heading: TOUR GUIDE
dialog: By the 1700s, residents from all
dialog: over Paris were complaining about
text: the horrible smell of the bodies in
text: the overcrowded cemetery. Something
dialog: had to be done. Louis the 15th,

speaker_heading: TOUR GUIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: +. and the remains be brought down
dialog: here in the old quarries that had
dialog: been used to build the city.
speaker_heading: BENJI (0.C.)
dialog: This place is creeping me out. I
dialog: don’t like being in a tomb.
text: Scarlett sees a plaque. “Cemetaire des Innocents.”
text: She turns and talks to the camera.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: These remains are from the same
text: cemetery as the Flamels’ graves.
text: Scarlett references her map.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT'D)
dialog: So, we're looking to go about half
text: a mile right through this wall.
text: As the tour guide continues, Scarlett cases the structure,
text: like an inmate looking for weak links in a prison.
text: Scarlett finds a small gap between the walls. She looks
text: around. The tour is making a little distance.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT'D)
dialog: I can squeeze through this. Wait
dialog: for me.
text: She climbs through the gap in the walls and disappears into
dialog: the darkness.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Jesus. You kidding me?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: (loud whisper)
dialog: Shine the light in here.
text: Benji shines a light into the crevasse. Nothing.
speaker_heading: BENJI (0.C.)
dialog: Scarlett?
text: He turns the camera back to the tour, still barely out of
text: sight, but coming back.
speaker_heading: BENJI (0.C.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Scarlett?!
dialog: 26.
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: BENJI (0.C.) (CONT'D)
dialog: shit.
text: He leans the camera in closer to get a better look,
text: completely getting unnerved by this whole thing.
text: SCARLETT LUNGES OUT A THE CAMERA!
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
speaker_heading: BAAAH!
text: BENJI JUMPS BACK AWAY FROM THE HOLE, DROPPING THE CAMERA.
text: Scarlett finds herself pretty funny.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: You're going to make me break the
dialog: damned camera!
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: TOUR GUIDE
dialog: You are not allowed back there!
dialog: Please get back into the group!
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS TOUR ENTRANCE AREA — DAY
text: On the way out, the TICKET TAKER looks punk rock cool. He
text: smiles to Scarlett. She approaches him.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Do you know any way to get into the
dialog: private areas of the catacombs?
text: The Ticket Taker looks around sheepishly.
speaker_heading: TICKET TAKER
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Thanks anyway.
text: She notes his Die Antwoord t-shirt.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: You missed a nice tour.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I didn’t see anything that could

text: The Ticket Taker hustles to Scarlett. He hands her a club
text: flyer for Club Silencio.
speaker_heading: TICKET TAKER
dialog: Ask for Papillon.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Thanks.
text: She nods to him. He nods back and leaves.
text: She holds it up for George to see.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT'D)
dialog: Let’s go find Papillon.
scene_heading: EXT. CLUB SILENCIO - NIGHT
text: Scarlett, George and Benji get out of a cab.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You sure this is the place?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: That's what it says.
dialog: Nothing from the street would indicate this was a club. Just
text: an average-sized MAN sipping a vodka in front of a
text: nondescript door.
text: Scarlett leads George to the door. The Man stops them. Points
dialog: to a list.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT'D)
dialog: We’re not on the list.
text: He shrugs his shoulders. Not happening.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: We're looking for Papillon.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Ah, Papillon?!
dialog: Why didn't you say so? He opens the door and shows them
dialog: inside.
scene_heading: INT. CLUB SILENCIO - NIGHT
text: Scarlett, George and Benji enter a bizarre Parisian nightclub
text: that resembles a beautifully designed bunker.
text: The Man points to the back of the room.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Papillon la.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Merci.
text: She leads George and Benji through dancers and lounge-lizards
text: to some tables in the back.
text: She finds PAPILLON, sipping a red drink, talking excitedly
dialog: with friends.
dialog: Had he been born half a century ago, Papillon surely would
dialog: have been a leader of the French Resistance, but in these
dialog: times must amuse himself with less constructive forms of
dialog: rebellion.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: Papillon?
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Qui étes-vous?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I need to get into the catacombs.
dialog: I’m told you could take me.
text: He laughs.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Do I look like a tour guide to you?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Do I look like a tourist?
text: He smiles. Takes a sip of his drink.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Why would I want to bring you down
dialog: there?
text: She takes a map of the catacombs out of her pocket and slaps
text: it onto the table in front of him.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Because we've found a secret
dialog: passage that nobody knows about.
text: Papillon looks at the markings. Shakes his head.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: We would have found it if it was
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: No you wouldn’t have. It was
dialog: designed to not be seen.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Why would that be?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Because, I believe, it’s full of
dialog: treasure.
text: Papillon laughs. Looks to George.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Is she serious?
text: George nods.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON (CONT’D)
dialog: Me and my friends can take half
dialog: this treasure?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: You can have it all. That’s not
dialog: what we're looking for.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Half is probably fine.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: You are a strange girl, aren’t you.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: You don’t know the half of it.
dialog: 30.
scene_heading: INT. PAPILLON’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Papillon throws a couple pairs of rubber waders and helmets

speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Try these.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, I’m not going in. I’m just here
dialog: for support.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: He’s coming. George, I need your
dialog: help.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: This guy seems to know what he’s
dialog: doing.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: But who knows what we’1ll come
dialog: across down there. I can’t decipher
dialog: it all without you. Come on, we
dialog: were a good team, remember?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Text it to me and I'll...
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: No cell phones down there. Ground
dialog: is too dense.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: So there’s no way to call for help
dialog: if something goes wrong?
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Then I’m definitely not going.
text: A knock at the door.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: (shouts )
dialog: Entrez!
dialog: (to Scarlett)
dialog: My team.
text: In walks ZED, a quiet, squirrely Frenchman of 25, with large
text: calves and strong hands. A perfectly designed climbing
dialog: machine.
dialog: 31.
text: He’s trailed by SOUXIE, a motherly Goth girl. She’s the den
dialog: mother of the cataphiles.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON (CONT’D)
dialog: This is Zed, the last letter in
text: climbing. And Souxie. The banshee.
text: She sees all the waders and helmets and everything all over
dialog: the place.
speaker_heading: SOUXIE
dialog: Ah, what a mess Papillon!
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: She also manages our supplies.
text: Souxie sorts through the supplies.
scene_heading: INT. PAPILLON'S APARTMENT - LATER
text: The group stands around a map of the catacombs.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: We'll enter through the park. That
dialog: will make it easier to find La

speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: La Taupe?
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: “The Mole.”
speaker_heading: SOUXIE
dialog: He lives down there.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: He lives down there?!
speaker_heading: SOUXIE
dialog: Oui.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Weird.
text: Papillon points to a spot on the map.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: He is usually around...
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: But that’s the wrong direction.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Sometimes going the wrong direction
dialog: is the quickest way.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Do we really need this guy? We have
dialog: Maps and...
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Oui. We need this guy.
scene_heading: INT. PAPILLON’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Souxie counts out all the flashlights, clothes, etc. She
text: tests each flashlight herself. She notices the camera and
dialog: talks.
speaker_heading: SOUXIE
dialog: It is dangerous underground. If you
dialog: run out of batteries, and no
dialog: flashlight, you will die. If you
dialog: run out of water... If you get
dialog: hurt.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: There are also dangers of cave ins,
text: police, rats, bats, claustrophobia,
dialog: drowning, bugs.
speaker_heading: SOUXIE
dialog: Many things can go wrong down
dialog: there. We need to plan for them
dialog: all. There is no room for mistakes.
text: Papillon checks food and water.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: And we always bring enough food and
dialog: water for a week.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: A week?!
text: Papillon shrugs his shoulders.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODED AREA - NIGHT
text: Scarlett and George follow Souxie, Papillon, and Zed into a
text: dark wooded area in a park in Paris.
dialog: 33.
text: Papillon stops them about 50 feet shy of a dirt mound with a
text: hole in it, surrounded by concrete and graffiti. The hole
text: looks more like something a raccoon would live in.
text: He and Zed scan the area for police.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: The police hate me here.
text: All clear.
scene_heading: EXT. CATACOMBS ENTRANCE - NIGHT
text: They approach the hole. A tight fit dropping into darkness.
dialog: Not something you’d ever want to climb into.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You're going in that?! Seriously?
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Let’s turn on the cameras.
text: Benji comes around beside Scarlett. He turns on the GoPro
text: attached to her headlamp. He makes a dipshit face into the
dialog: camera.
speaker_heading: BENJI (CONT'D)
dialog: B camera, good check.
text: He approaches Zed, who also has one on his headlamp. Benji
text: flips it on. Makes a dipshit face into camera.
speaker_heading: BENJI (CONT'D)
dialog: C camera good check.
text: Benji nods to Papillon. Ready.
text: Scarlett hands George a ruck sack.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Here.
text: He looks at it.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What’s this?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Your bag.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You have some serious listening
dialog: skill issues.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Zed... Allez!
text: Zed drops through the hole.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS
text: Zed climbs swiftly through a jagged shaft of rock to the
text: floor of the catacombs.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Clear!
scene_heading: EXT. CATACOMBS ENTRANCE - NIGHT
text: George and Scarlett continue their discussion.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I need you on this.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Scarlett, I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Souxie... Allez!
text: Souxie disappears through the hole.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON (CONT’D)
dialog: (to George)
dialog: I don’t care what you do, but make
dialog: up your mind now.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I’m not coming.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
text: He’s coming.
speaker_heading: BOOM!
text: OUT OF NOWHERE, PAPILLON IS TAKEN DOWN RIGHT THROUGH THE

text: A whistle blows. The camera spins to find a second policeman
text: running toward them.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Allez! Allez! Allez!
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Sorry George.
dialog: 35.
text: She jumps through the hole and disappears.
text: George stands there, looking at his bag. At the hole. At the
text: oncoming policeman.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Shit. Shit. Shit.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Allez! Allez!
text: Benji jumps through the hole with the camera, followed
text: closely by George.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS
text: Benji makes his way down though the jagged rocks as Zed
text: points out the safe places to steps.
text: George appears, with ruck sack.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You fuckers. Shit!
text: Scarlett looks around the catacombs. This is much rougher
dialog: than the official tourist area, but in its way, much more
text: beautiful. Paintings and graffiti on the walls give it an
text: urban, cool vibe.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: This is beautiful.
text: George looks a bit shell shocked to be down here. Scarlett
text: greets him.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT'D)
dialog: I knew you’d come with us.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah, thanks.
text: Papillon appears above, dropping like a bat into hell. He
text: hits every wall on the way down.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Allez! Allez! Allez!
text: Papillon digs furiously in his pockets as they race through
text: the tunnels, fleeing from the police.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN (0.C.)
dialog: Arret! Arret!
dialog: 36.
text: Papillon lights up a smoke bomb, drops it. The effect of the
text: gathering smoke is eerie, unsettling.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Careful!
text: Papillon leaps over a two foot hole in the floor. Followed by
dialog: Scarlett, and the rest.
text: He motions into an alcove where they wait for the smoke to
dialog: clear.
speaker_heading: SOUXIE
text: The catacombs make the police
dialog: nervous. They don’t like to go very
dialog: deep in here.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I don’t blame them.
text: As the smoke clears, they see:
scene_heading: INT. ARTIST ALCOVE - NIGHT
text: They are in a kind of artists’ gallery. The walls are all
text: painted, beautiful.
text: The police are nowhere to be found.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Ha ha. Police will never catch
dialog: Papillon!
text: An ARTIST creeps out of the shadows and curses Papillon out
dialog: for bringing the authorities there. He hates the smoke bombs
text: and despises the tourists that Papillon brought with him.
speaker_heading: ARTIST
dialog: Cessez de réduire la police ici!
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Détendez. Je les ai évités avant
dialog: que nous soyons arrivés ici.
speaker_heading: ARTIST
dialog: Et cette fumée ruine ma peinture.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Bonne chose que votre peinture est
dialog: terrible.

speaker_heading: ARTIST
dialog: Merci.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Avez-vous vu la Taupe?
speaker_heading: ARTIST
dialog: Non. Il n'a pas 6té par ici.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: La Taupe has not been here. We must
dialog: look for him.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: There are over 200 miles of
dialog: tunnels. You suggesting we wander
dialog: them aimlessly until we find this
dialog: weirdo?
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Je ne sais pas.
text: Papillon leads them on.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS CORRIDOR
text: Papillon leads them through a corridor as Scarlett looks over
dialog: her map.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: La Taupe? C’est moi, Papillon.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Wait! We’re going in the wrong
dialog: direction. We need to be going that
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: We haven’t found La Taupe.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Is it possible that he’s not down
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: The artist said he just saw La
dialog: Taupe a couple hours ago.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: No he didn’t. I speak French.
dialog: That’s not what he said.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: La Taupe knows every cave.
text: Scarlett holds up her map.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: So do I.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: You think because you see something
dialog: in a book you know it?!
text: Papillon smacks the map as he talks.
dialog: Going the
speaker_heading: PAPILLON (CONT’D)
dialog: This is not the catacombs! This
dialog: will not tell you anything! Which
dialog: ones are filled with water? Which
dialog: ones are too full of bones to pass?
dialog: Which ones have collapsed?! If you
dialog: want to follow this map go ahead.
dialog: I’m going to find La Taupe because
dialog: these caves are dangerous and you
dialog: need to know where you're going!
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I’m going. Who’s with me.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Scarlett. He’s right.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Why are we wasting our time with...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You know I don’t want to spend an
dialog: extra minute down here than I have
dialog: to. But if this guy says he needs
dialog: La Taupe, I’m inclined to trust
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: He doesn’t even know that the guy
text: is down here. Or where he is.
text: slow way is very much against Scarlett’s nature.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: If the stone is down here, it’s
dialog: been here for six hundred years.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: It’ll keep for a couple extra
dialog: hours.
text: She reluctantly relents.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Okay.
text: George turns to Papillon.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Now, don’t make me look like an
dialog: asshole.
text: As they cross through another room, strange electronic music
dialog: plays.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Come.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS CINEMA
text: Papillon leads them through a slightly larger space. On one
text: side, half a dozen cataphiles sit in what look like stone
text: bleachers cut into the wall.
text: On the other side, a movie -- the old silent version of
text: “Phantom of the Opera” with Lon Chaney. The image has been
text: “remixed” to Aphex Twin, creating an interesting blend of old
text: and new. The movie shows the Phantom descending under the
text: Parisian Opera house into the catacombs.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Our cinema.
text: George looks at the relaxed Parisians watching a movie down
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You guys are freaks.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS CORRIDOR
text: As they cross through a corridor, Papillon points out a small
text: replica of the Bocca della Verita in Rome. (A giant disk of a
text: carved face with an open mouth.)
text: He nudges George, points at it.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: According to legend, this statue
dialog: will bite off your hand if you tell
dialog: a lie.
text: George is loosening up a bit.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Let's give it a shot.
text: He reaches his hand toward it, thinks for a moment.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: You might not believe this, but my

text: little Elvis heads. Early Elvis.
text: George slides his hand into the carved mouth.
text: SENDING BATS SHOOTING OUT FROM THE STATUE!
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Aaah! Shit! I hate this place.
text: Papillon has a good laugh at George.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, thanks guy.
text: As they cross to the far end of the corridor, they hear
dialog: something --
text: A kind of industrial dance music. The beats build as they get
dialog: closer.
text: Papillon looks to the others, does a little rave-y dance,
text: smiles, and runs toward the music.
text: George and Scarlett look to each other. This fucking guy.
text: The music gets louder as they get closer. As they turn a
dialog: bend, they see:
scene_heading: INT. CATAPHILE RAVE
text: AN underground rave, lit in flashing reds and pulsing techno
text: music. People shuffle and dance like the possessed.
text: At a glance, it looks like people might be having sex in the
text: dark corners. Others are scantily clad, in underwear or less.
text: People wearing masks and horns and animal headdresses. The
dialog: kind of underground party we all know probably happens
dialog: somewhere, but would never get invited to ourselves.
dialog: 41.
text: Papillon pushes his way through the crowd, trying to ask
text: people - through the noise - if they’ve seen La Taupe.
text: A SKINHEAD grabs Scarlett, pulls her into the crowd, starts
text: grinding on her. He’s wearing nothing but combat boots and
text: his underwear, revealing a swastika on his chest.
text: Scarlett pushes away, but he’s aggressive.
text: George jumps forward, hitting the Skinhead across the face,
text: slamming him back through the crowd and onto his back.
text: Other Ravers jump to the Skinhead’s aid, striking George in
text: the mouth. Scarlett tries to intervene on George’s behalf,
text: but no words can be heard over the pulsing music.
dialog: People, very tough, very scary people corner George. One
text: takes a swing, but George blocks it. George gets ready for a
text: real fight. He’s amped up.
text: Scarlett inserts herself between George and the crowd.
text: Papillon pushes his way through, and holds the ravers off
dialog: George.
text: Scarlett and George push their way through the crowd and back
text: out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS CORRIDOR
text: As they clear the room, the flashlights overpower the
text: strobes. They can hear again.
text: George touches the back of his hand to his mouth and sees the
dialog: blood.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (to Scarlett)
dialog: You’re welcome.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I didn’t thank you.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: That guy was all over you.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I could've handled it myself.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah, really?
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Those people are crazy people.
dialog: Dangerous people.
text: Papillon makes a crazy sign with his hands.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON (CONT’D)
dialog: You overreact.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I literally punched a Nazi. How am
dialog: I suddenly the asshole?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I’m not some damsel in distress. I
dialog: don’t need your help.
text: George looks around. At himself. In the catacombs.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah? Since when?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: (playful)
dialog: Don’t kid yourself. You wouldn’t
dialog: want to go toe-to-toe with me. I’m
dialog: pretty tough.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You?! That’s ridiculous.
text: She draws a line in the sand on the floor. Stands on George’s
dialog: side of it.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Try to move me across this line.
dialog: I’1l show you.
text: Papillon laughs and claps.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I’m not going to push a girl.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Because you’re scared of her?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I’m not... this is so stupid. What,
dialog: you have some self-defense-class-—
dialog: karate-move you learned in case
dialog: somebody tries to grab you? That’s
dialog: all well and good unless somebody
dialog: pushes you...
dialog: 43.
text: He rushes at her.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: ...LIKE THIS!
text: Scarlett steps toward him, nails him in the solar plexus,
text: knocking the wind out of George.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: oh!
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I might know a little more than a
dialog: self-defense-class-karate-move.
text: Papillon laughs, raises her hand up in victory.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: The champion!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I think he just called you a
dialog: mushroom.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS MUSHROOM ALLEY
text: They enter an alcove with bright fluorescent paint on the
dialog: walls, a lot of it of mushrooms or other hallucinogenic-—
dialog: inspired motifs.
text: Papillon calls down a tunnel.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: La Taupe?
text: They are all looking a bit tired. They’ve covered a lot of
dialog: ground already.
text: A voice calls out from the darkness.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE (0.S.)
dialog: Chantez-le?
text: Papillon stops, does a weird little jig.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: (sings)
dialog: La Taupe, La Taupe, La Taupe. C’est
dialog: moi, c’est moi, c’est moi. Papi,
dialog: Papi, Papi, ion, ion ion.
text: From the darkness, a voice sings.
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: Papi, papi, papi, ion, ion, ion.
dialog: C'est moi, c’est moi aussi, La
dialog: Taupe est le garcon!
text: La Taupe rushes out of the shadows and gives Papillon a bear
text: hug, his face obscured in shadows under his hooded
dialog: sweatshirt.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Mon ami étrange!
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: Mon ami puant!
text: La Taupe looks at Scarlett and George suspiciously.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE (CONT’D)
dialog: Qui sont-elles ?
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Ils sont ok. Vous ne vous inquiétez
dialog: pas.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: Pourquoi ont-ils des appareils-
dialog: photo?
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Ils font un documentaire environ...
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: Non!
text: La Taupe covers his face with his hand.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE (CONT’D)
dialog: (to the camera)
dialog: You cannot film me! I do not permit
dialog: to you filming me.
text: Benji drops the camera low.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE (CONT’D)
dialog: Go. Get out of these place!
text: He takes a beer bottle and throws it at them, almost hitting
dialog: George.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Whoa!
text: Papillon holds up a hand. Give me a sec. He walks off with La
dialog: Taupe.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: This doesn’t bode well.
text: George and the gang watch Papillon and La Taupe exchange
text: terse words. After a discussion, Papillon returns.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: He will join us.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Great.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: If we still want him. Guy threw a
text: bottle at my head.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: He just threw it. It wasn’t at your
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: It skimmed my head. I felt it on my
dialog: hair.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
text: But first he sleeps.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Sleeps?! Did you say, “first he
dialog: sleeps?!"
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: He has eaten the... how you say...
text: Papillon looks around, points to a graffiti image of a
dialog: mushroom.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON (CONT’D)
dialog: These.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Mushrooms?
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Oui. Mushrooms.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: He’s on mushrooms?!
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: How long ago did he eat them?
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Two hours.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: So he’s going to be high for like
dialog: another six?!
text: Scarlett looks at him. George shrugs his shoulders. I know
dialog: what's up.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: We stay here for the night.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: For the night?!
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Yes. We sleep.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No. Fuck this. I’m out. I gotta get
dialog: out of this place. I’m packing my
dialog: shit up and leaving.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: How will you find your way back
dialog: out?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It’s that way.
text: The camera pans off to show the long, dark corridor, George
dialog: points at.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Go ahead. Try. We’ll send a search
dialog: party for you in a couple days.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You know, I’m getting real sick of
dialog: your tone.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: I’m sure the skinhead party would
dialog: love to see you again without me to
dialog: save you.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You didn’t save me.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Why don’t you just try to relax.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Because I’m trapped under the
text: ground! In a rat filled tunnel that
dialog: was dug in the 1500s. Our tour
dialog: guide is high as a kite and so far
dialog: we've been walking in the wrong
dialog: direction. What could possibly stop
dialog: me from relaxing?!
text: Papillon lights up a joint. Offers some to George.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Perfect solution. Let’s everyone
dialog: get high. I’m sure nothing bad
dialog: could happen then.
text: Papillon turns to walk away.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait. Give me that.
text: George has a hit off the joint.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: It’s good, yes?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: We have better in America.
text: Papillon smiles. George does too. Maybe this won’t be so bad.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS MUSHROOM ALLEY
text: Glow sticks light the space to save flashlights.
text: La Taupe, now wearing a kind of industrial mole mask that
text: he’1l continue to wear, spins little flaming balls on strings
dialog: to music. It’s kind of beautiful.
text: Souxie takes something out of a small kit. She crosses out of
text: the room into the darkness of a tunnel by herself.
text: Papillon drinks beer and talks with Scarlett and La Taupe as
text: Zed practices throwing rocks into a bucket.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: You don’t seem like a treasure
dialog: hunter.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I’m not really.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Then why search for this stone?
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: It doesn’t make any sense! A rock
dialog: that can turn other rocks to gold
dialog: and - AND - can also make you live
dialog: forever. Doesn’t make sense.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Science was different back then.
dialog: Alchemists were looking for a
dialog: connection between what was inside
dialog: them and what they were observing
dialog: in the outside world. They were
dialog: trying to perfect themselves, make
dialog: themselves pure as gold while
dialog: working in metals. They respected
dialog: inner truth more than outside
dialog: facts.
text: She turns back to Papillon.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: I guess I’m not searching for
dialog: treasure so much as I’m searching
dialog: for proof of the miraculous.
dialog: Because if even one alchemist
dialog: succeeded, if one perfected himself
dialog: and his own mind and talents and
dialog: knowledge to the point that he
dialog: could bend the laws of physics...
dialog: then we all could. Every one of us.
text: Papillon shrugs. Maybe.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Gold is good too.
text: Scarlett grabs a couple beers and crosses the room toward
dialog: George.
text: The camera turns to George, anxiously sitting alone.
text: Scarlett approaches George with a beer.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: You okay?
text: George shrugs a bit.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Not my favorite place.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: So I gathered.
text: She offers George a beer. He takes it.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: When’s the last time we had a beer
dialog: together?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It’s been awhile, hasn’t it.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: You never returned my calls. After
dialog: Turkey.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I’m sorry I left you there.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I’m glad you're here.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (reluctant)
dialog: Yeah. Me too. If you’re right, this
dialog: could be the greatest
dialog: archaeological find... ever. As big
dialog: as finding the Holy Grail.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I know.
text: George looks around the space.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I used to love exploring caves with
dialog: my brother as a kid. He was so
text: daring and cool and older.
text: He remembers it all so vividly.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
text: A rock I was standing on dislodged
text: and rolled onto his leg, pinning
dialog: him. We tried and tried but
dialog: couldn’t get him out. I went to get
dialog: help, but I got lost trying to find
dialog: my way back.
dialog: 50.
dialog: This pains George terribly.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: By the time we found him, the tide
text: had come in, and he was gone.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: That’s awful. I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah. It was.
text: He shrugs.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: It wasn’t because you left me
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Why I didn’t call you back. It
dialog: wasn’t because you left me.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: It wasn’t?
text: He looks at her seriously.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I was afraid I was falling in love
dialog: with someone so obsessed with the
text: dead, there’s no room left over to
dialog: love the living.
text: She takes this in for a moment. Not one to take criticism
dialog: easily.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: And I never thought I’d fall for
dialog: the kind of guy who runs the second
dialog: things get complicated.
text: She turns and goes back to the fire with the others.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Shit.
text: Camera powers off.
dialog: 51.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS MUSHROOM ALLEY
text: Darkness. Snores. Sleeping people rustling around. Someone
text: moves in the space.
scene_heading: BA-BA-BA-BA-BA-BA-BA!
text: Suddenly, the opening chords of the White Stripes, “I Think I
text: Smell a Rat” rip through the darkness.
text: Everyone frantically searches for a light.
text: George is first to get his hands on a flashlight which he
text: flips on and looks for the source of the music.
text: It’s La Taupe in his industrial mole mask, blaring a stereo
text: at them, “Say Anything” style.
text: He dances to the music and laughs at their startled
dialog: reactions.
text: He turns off the music.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: We go.
text: La Taupe turns and leaves down a corridor, expecting them to
dialog: catch up.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Asshole.
text: The bleary-eyed explorers hustle to pack up and follow.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: (to Papillon)
dialog: This “Mole” guy always so annoying?
text: Papillon shakes his head.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
text: He gets worse.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS CORRIDOR - LATER
text: La Taupe winds them through corridor after corridor. He knows
dialog: his way around here like his own neighborhood.
text: George tries to talk with him.
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Papillon told me you pretty much
dialog: live down here?
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: Down here there is no rules. No
dialog: law. Here I do whatever I want when
dialog: I want it.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You do a lot of drugs, don’t you.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: Yes.
text: George looks around.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I can’t imagine a place I'd less
dialog: want to eat mushrooms.
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: Maybe jail. It’s a toss up.
scene_heading: INT. BONE TUNNEL - LATER
text: La Taupe stops in front of a corridor filled with human
dialog: bones.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: Stay on top. Parce que rats.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Careful there are...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah, we get it.
text: La Taupe scrambles over the bones effortlessly.
text: George goes next, followed by Scarlett, each crawling behind
dialog: the next.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: (to George)
dialog: Come closer. Get close.
text: George crawls over the bones, getting closer behind La Taupe,
text: not sure why Taupe is asking him to do so.
text: La Taupe rips a fart right into George’s face, and laughs.
text: George looks back to Scarlett.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Not sure why the French have such a
dialog: reputation for being rude. I've
dialog: always found them so pleasant.
text: The camera moves with Scarlett as she climbs across the
text: bones. She is anxious as the bones creak underneath her. A
text: swarm of rats make noise underneath.
text: The tunnel gets tighter and tighter as they go, to the point
text: that Scarlett is barely thin enough to fit through.
text: Benji gets caught.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: I’m stuck.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: Fat tourist!
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: (to La Taupe)
dialog: Arret!
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: I can’t move.
text: Scarlett struggles to turn back to Benji.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Can you take off your pack?
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: I already did.
text: Benji struggles more and more against the space.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: You're making it worse! Stop
text: struggling. Take a breathe.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Ah! The rats are nipping at me. Go!
dialog: Just go! I need to get out of here!
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Benji stop! Stop! You need to back
dialog: up a bit. You’re lodged and...
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Fuck! I hate this.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Move back. Just inch back.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: No! No! Just...
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Benji! The only way forward is
text: backward! INCH BACK! INCH BACK!
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Okay, okay.
text: He inches back.
speaker_heading: BENJI (CONT'D)
dialog: There are people behind me too! I
dialog: just need to get out of here! I
dialog: don’t like this.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Move your right shoulder down and
dialog: inch back.
text: Benji moves.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: No, no, no, I’m sorry. Your left
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: I'm freaking out. I need to get
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Keep breathing. Just take a deep
dialog: breath with me.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: No, I need...
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Take a deep breath!
text: Scarlett takes a deep breath and exhales.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: Your body expands when your blood
dialog: pressure rises. You need to calm
dialog: yourself. Come on.
text: She does it again. He joins her this time.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: It’s not helping.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: You're going to be okay. Move your
text: right shoulder down an inch.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Like this?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: That's right. Now see if you can
dialog: adjust the bones underneath you.
dialog: Flatten them out, line them up.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: I...
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Just do it.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Okay.
text: His shaking hands arrange the bones.
speaker_heading: BENJI (CONT'D)
dialog: Ow! A rat just bit me! Ah! Fuck!
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: It’s okay. It’s okay, Benji. You’re
dialog: going to be fine. Just follow me.
text: Benji pulls against the cave. It rumbles slightly.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: It’s gonna collapse.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Just push! Push through it!
text: He does. And finally breaks free.
scene_heading: INT. BONE CHAMBER - LATER
text: They all file out of the bone tunnel.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: This is why we don’t bring fat
text: Irish tourist to the catacombs.
text: La Taupe jabs his finger into Benji’s gut.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE (CONT’D)
dialog: This guy, this fat guy he do not
dialog: belong here. Fat guy, you should
dialog: have taken fat man hall.
text: La Taupe points to another hallway that leads to this same
dialog: end point. They didn’t have to do this to Benji.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: We didn’t even have to go through
dialog: there?! Why are you making this
dialog: harder than it has to be?!
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: It’s more interesting this way.
text: Scarlett snaps. She pushes him up against the wall.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I don’t care who you think you are,
dialog: but the next time you take a chance
dialog: with my people, I’1l hurt you.
dialog: Seriously.
text: La Taupe’s mouth, showing under his mole mask, smiles.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
text: English girl has fire.
text: He nods that he understands, amused by Scarlett’s spunk.
text: The ceiling dusts them all a bit.
speaker_heading: SOUXIE
dialog: We shouldn’t stay very long.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Was that bad?
text: They look to see a stone pillar that should be holding up the
text: ceiling has fallen.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: That is bad.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: We're still not deep enough. We’re
text: only two hundred feet below ground.
dialog: We need to go down another hundred.
text: The ceiling dusts them again.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I think we should move out of this
dialog: area. It seems suspect to me.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: (to La Taupe)
dialog: We need to go deeper.
text: He reluctantly nods.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: Come.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: La Taupe leads them into the next corridor. He shines his
text: light around until he finds some planks of wood on the
text: ground. He pries them up, revealing a hole in the floor that
dialog: goes very deep.
text: George looks at it.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: This is a bad idea, Scarlett.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Papillon, could you take George and
dialog: anyone else back who wants to go?
dialog: I’m going deeper.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: And let you keep all the treasure?
dialog: No, I’m going with you.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (to Scarlett)
dialog: At what point will you stop?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: When I find it.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: And if there is no stone?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: There is. And it’s down there.
text: She nods to La Taupe.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: Allez.
dialog: 58.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMNEY CHUTE
text: One after another, they descend deeper and deeper into the
text: catacombs. They’re all feeling the tension of going this deep
dialog: underground.
text: George looks up to the vast distance above him.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (to La Taupe)
dialog: How do you know we’ll all be able
dialog: to get back up there?
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: If we can’t, we die. So we will.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Not really the answer I was hoping
dialog: for.
scene_heading: INT. WET HALLWAY - LATER
text: They all wade through the muck 300 feet underground. Spirits
text: are sagging.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: How long have we been walking?
text: George looks at his watch.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: About 6 hours.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Can we stop to eat soon?
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
text: Hungry fat Irish.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Jesus, give it a rest! At least I
dialog: live in the real world!
text: This kind of animosity is settling over all of them.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (sings)
dialog: Just sit right back and you'll hear
dialog: a tale, A tale of a fateful trip,
dialog: That started from this tropic port
dialog: Aboard this tiny ship.
text: Scarlett smiles. Joins in.
dialog: 59.
scene_heading: GEORGE AND SCARLETT
dialog: The mate was a mighty sailing man,
text: The skipper brave and sure. Five
dialog: passengers set sail that day
dialog: For a three hour tour...
text: Benji jumps in too.
scene_heading: GEORGE, SCARLETT AND BENJI
dialog: a three hour tour.
text: Papillon won’t be outdone. He jumps in on the next stanza in
text: French, trying to out-sing them with the French version of
dialog: the song.
scene_heading: GEORGE, SOPHIE AND BEN PAPILLON
dialog: The weather started getting Devenir commencée par temps
dialog: rough, rugueuse, Le bateau minuscule
dialog: The tiny ship was tossed, a été jeté en l'air, Sinon

scene_heading: GEORGE, SOPHIE AND BEN PAPILLON, TAUPE, SOUXIE, ZED
dialog: (CONT'D) La terre réglée de bateau sur

speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: Arret! Arret!
text: They all stop. They have reached the end of the tunnel.
text: Nothing but a wall in front of them.
text: Scarlett references her map.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Should be another ten feet that
dialog: way.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: There is no more.
text: Scarlett picks up a stone and taps on the wall. Solid.
text: She looks around, thinking.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: There must be another way to get
dialog: there.
text: La Taupe consults his own personal map of the system of
text: caves. He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: There is no more. C’est fini.
text: They all look for any sign of anything. But there is nothing
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Does this mean, no treasure?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: (bummed )
dialog: Dommage. I was excited to be rich.
text: Scarlett scans the surface for a sign, an inscription,
dialog: anything.
text: She thinks and thinks. She looks at her map. Mutters to
text: herself, thinking through everything that’s led them here,
text: getting more and more frustrated.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: There’s nothing.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Sorry Scarlett.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I really thought we had it right.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I know.
text: He sees how sad she is.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: For what it’s worth, I thought we
dialog: had it right too.
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Are we ready to go the other
dialog: direction?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Scarlett.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Yeah...
text: Scarlett looks down at the compass on her wrist. A flash of
dialog: insight!
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: Wait! Wait! Direction! Magnetic
dialog: north!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Magnetic north! True north remains
text: fixed, but magnetic north shifts
dialog: about 2.5 degrees per hundred
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Which by now would have produced
dialog: Asee
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
text: Variation of about 15 degrees. Not
dialog: here. There!
text: A second small tunnel leading off the one they’re in. They
dialog: race into it.
scene_heading: INT. SMALL TUNNEL
text: Scarlett throws her pack down and scans the walls with her
dialog: fingers.
text: She digs into the stone. Sees something.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh my God. There’s something there!
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I know!
text: She digs and digs.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Don’t wreck it.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Look!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: La Taupe does not like the
text: vultures.
text: La Taupe is right, on the wall is a SMALL INSCRIPTION OF A
speaker_heading: VULTURE.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Winged vulture!
text: She looks to George.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT'D)
dialog: What was it?! “Winged vulture leads
dialog: your way.”
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: “,..with brightest light, in
dialog: darkest day.”
text: She looks at the vulture up close.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: “Winged vulture leads your way...”
text: She follows the angle of the vulture’s beak across the wall
text: until it hits a second wall.
text: She digs around at the joint of the two walls. Sure enough,
dialog: there’s a crease!
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: There’s something here!
text: George is there in a flash.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: I think it’s a Ptolemaic hinge!
text: It looks like a scarab embedded in the stone. She kneels down
text: and finds another one.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Really?! I’ve never seen one
dialog: before.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: What’s a Ptolemaic hinge?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: It’s how they sealed pharaohs'
text: tombs in ancient Egypt. The hinges
dialog: formed a kind of riddle almost like
text: an ancient padlock. There are a
dialog: series of moves you must get
dialog: precisely correct.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Or what?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Or it’1ll fall on you and crush you.
dialog: Or the ceiling would collapse, or
dialog: something else awful that would
dialog: probably kill you.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Jesus.
text: She gets ready to give it a shot. The cataphiles cautiously
text: back away, just in case.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait! What are you doing?! Giving
dialog: it the old college try?!
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: You have a better idea?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah. Go home. Not get crushed and
dialog: die.
text: She smiles at him.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Okay, you do that, but I’m going to
dialog: take a shot.
text: He hesitates for a moment.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Against my better judgement, may I
dialog: ask what your plan is?
text: She opens her notebook...
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: What was the... on the tomb...
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: “Underneath heaven’s reign...”
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Heaven's reign. The celestial
dialog: spheres! 8 planets. Except Uranus
dialog: wasn’t discovered yet. 7 planets.
text: She gets ready to pull the door.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Wait! Was this built before or
dialog: after Copernicus?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Good point. Before.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: So they still believed everything
dialog: rotated around the Earth.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Which means, the Earth was not
dialog: counted as a planet.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: But the moon was. As was the sun.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: So eight?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: That’s my count.
text: She slides the stone out to the seventh line. The ceiling
text: rumbles as the weight resettles.
dialog: They look at it. Seems okay.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s next?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Now we twist.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: How far?
text: Scarlett remembers the inscription out loud.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: .-. “atop this pair'ed fate.”
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Pair... twins?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Twins! Of course, Gemini! According
dialog: to the Egyptian calendar, Gemini
dialog: would fall at three o’clock on a
dialog: dial. Ready?
text: George nods nervously. Papillon backs up.
text: She twists the stone and it spirals outward as it moves.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: Okay... okay... Gemini.
text: She stops. The ceiling rumbles a bit again. Sand pours from
text: beside the stone as the rumbling intensifies.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I don’t like this game.
text: The stone slides toward them.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Back up!
text: La Taupe runs for the door.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What’s happening?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I don’t know.
text: The stone drops out of place and lands on the floor with a
dialog: thud, revealing:
text: A SMALL TUNNEL ABOUT 30 FEET LONG, BARELY WIDE ENOUGH FOR A
text: PERSON TO SQUEEZE THROUGH. La Taupe quickly crowds in to
dialog: look.
text: Scarlett shines a light into it, but it doesn’t reveal much
text: beyond a single rat scurrying out of sight.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No way I’m crawling through that.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Ditto.
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: This is probably the first time
dialog: someone has shined a light in that
dialog: space in over 500 years.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
text: A new tunnel.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: The treasure.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Give me a boost.
text: Papillon places his knee so she can use it to climb through.
text: Scarlett climbs into the hole.
text: She barely squeezes through, but keeps going and going and
text: going. Her breathing gets labored as she pulls her way
dialog: through.
text: From the door side of the hole, we see her clear the other
text: end. She turns back to face the others.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT'D)
dialog: George. You gotta see this.
text: George thinks it over.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: George. Seriously. Come here.
dialog: George really doesn’t want to do this.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Shit.
text: He climbs into the hole and struggles through it to join
dialog: Scarlett.
scene_heading: INT. ROSE CHAMBER
text: George comes out the other side and rolls out of the hole.
dialog: He stands to find:
text: A tomb, atop which is laid A CORPSE, CLEARLY SEVERAL
scene_heading: CENTURIES OLD, PERFECTLY PRESERVED.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
text: He’s dead.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: How is he not rotting?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I don’t know.
text: The headstone is marked “C.R. Of R.C.”
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: C.R. Of R.C.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Christian Rosenkreuz of the Rosy
dialog: Cross.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No! The founder of the
dialog: Rosecrucians?! Holy shit.
dialog: (catches his language,
dialog: apologizes to the corpse)
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: (to Scarlett)
dialog: His tomb was found by Rosicrucians
dialog: in the 1600s. Along with the
dialog: secrets of...
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: ..-alchemy which reignited its
dialog: interest for the next 200 years.
text: George notes another inscription.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: “VITRIOL.” What’s that?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: The motto of alchemy. It stands
dialog: for: “Visita Interiora Terrae
dialog: Rectificando Invenies Occultum
dialog: Lapidem.”
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (translates)
dialog: “Visit the Interior Parts of the
dialog: Earth; by Rectification Thou Shalt
dialog: Find the Hidden Stone.”
text: The others have been filing in.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Is he dead?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yes. For 700 years.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: Creepy.
text: The middle of the chamber is filled with water, making it
text: echo creepily in the space.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: There’s more. “Visit the interior
dialog: parts of the earth.” He’s saying to
dialog: go deeper.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: We're kind of interior already,
dialog: don’t you think?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: What was the... “Winged vulture
dialog: leads your way. In brightest light
dialog: in darkest day.”
text: Scarlett sees something in the water. Looks closer.
text: She turns off her flashlight.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT'D)
dialog: Turn off your flashlights.
dialog: Everyone!
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: With a dead body in here? No way.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Just do it.
text: They all do so, Benji having the hardest time submitting to
dialog: darkness.
text: But as Benji clicks off the onboard light, submerging the
text: group in total darkness, we see what Scarlett saw: traces of
text: light deep in the water.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: Where’s that light coming from if
dialog: that’s a wall?
text: Papillon flips his flashlight on, pokes at the wall. Scarlett
text: drops herself down into the water.
dialog: 69.
text: The camera travels with Scarlett under the water as her hand
text: pokes at the stone deep in the water.
text: She rises back up, now soaking wet.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
text: There’s a loose stone. Someone help
dialog: me.
text: Papillon jumps in with her. The two drop into the water.
text: Again the camera drops in with them as they pull against a
text: large stone. They dislodge it and pull it away from the wall,
text: revealing more light.
text: Scarlett just comes up long enough to take a breath, and rip
text: her backpack off.
text: She then dives back down into the murky brown water, pushes
text: herself through the opening and swims into a brighter light.
text: She clears the wall and pulls herself up on the other side.
scene_heading: INT. ALCHEMIST CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
text: As she rises up, it is obvious that THIS IS THE PLACE THEY’VE
text: BEEN SEARCHING FOR.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Ooh!
text: There are lit torches on the walls. Gold all around them.
text: The floors, walls and ceiling are lined in alchemical symbols
text: and ancient Egyptian symbology. Eerie and magical at the same
dialog: time.
text: Scarlett laughs, still not believing her eyes.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: I found it, Dad. You were right.
text: George comes up out of the water. He sees what she does.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh my God.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Yeah.
text: She can’t help but get choked up.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It’s real.
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: It’s real.
text: George takes a seat.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I think we’re gonna need a bigger
dialog: bag.
text: La Taupe rises out of the water.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: Mon dieu.
text: He takes a gold coin. Shoves it in his pocket. And another
dialog: and another.
speaker_heading: PAPILLON
dialog: I’m quitting my job!!!
text: There is a big pile of coins that seem wedged between the
text: floor and ceiling. La Taupe pulls at them, trying to dislodge
dialog: them.
text: Souxie and Zed appear, and also pocket coins.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: How are these torches lit?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: The Philosopher’s Stone can fuel a
dialog: lamp for eternity.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: So where is it? The stone.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: “The brightest light in darkest
dialog: day.”
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: The sun.
text: She smiles.
text: She points at an ancient-Egyptian-inspired painting of a male
text: god stretched across the floor of the chamber.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: In ancient Egypt, the earth god and
dialog: the sky goddess...
text: She points to the ceiling, where a goddess, lined with stars
dialog: hangs.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: «+. were madly in love. But when
dialog: they had they first child, the sun,
dialog: he became so jealous of their
dialog: affections that he pushed them
text: apart from each other, leaving them
text: only able to touch by the palms of
text: their hands and the soles of their
dialog: feet.
text: She points now to a winged stone painted between the two
dialog: gods.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT'D)
dialog: Every morning the sky gives birth
dialog: to the sun and every evening she
text: swallows him back up.
text: She takes out a knife and makes her way to the winged stone.
text: With all the opulence surrounding them, this one chalky
dialog: purple stone would hardly be worth noting.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: That’s it? It looks so ordinary.
text: Scarlett smiles.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: What better place to hide the most
dialog: valuable stone ever known, than
dialog: beside riches you could never miss.
text: Papillon and La Taupe furiously bag piles of coins and other
dialog: treasures.
text: Scarlett uses her knife to edge the stone out of its place,
text: and carefully places it in a cloth satchel she brought
dialog: specifically for this.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT'D)
dialog: You wouldn’t believe the trouble I
dialog: went through to find you.
text: She tucks the stone into a waterproof pocket.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: Okay, let’s get out of here.
text: They turn around. La Taupe and Papillon pull furiously at a
text: mound of coins wedged so tightly between floor and ceiling,
text: it takes two of them to pull the coins free.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: Wait! Is that...
text: She looks at the ceiling.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: Load bearing?!!
text: As the coins break free, THE CEILING CRACKS. Chunks drop all
dialog: around them.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: Run!
text: They all struggle get up and run like mad as THE CEILING
text: CRUMBLES OVER THEM.
speaker_heading: BOOM!
text: A huge echoing crash as THE CEILING DROPS. They race away
text: from it, barely escaping being crushed under its weight.
text: Brown dust completely envelops them, blotting out all the
text: light in the room. Nothing but darkness. It’s suddenly very
text: quiet, still. Some coughing and struggling. Someone is
text: crying, in pain.
text: Scarlett’s voice is the first to pierce the darkness.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (0.C.)
dialog: Is everyone okay?
speaker_heading: GEORGE (0.C.)
dialog: Yeah. I think I’m okay.
speaker_heading: ZED (0.C.)
dialog: Oui.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE (0.C.)
dialog: I am.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Papillon? Souxie?
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Papillon?! Souxie?!
text: As the dust begins to settle, traces of their head lamps poke
text: through the darkness.
dialog: 73.
text: The sounds of whimpering, muffled.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I hear someone!
text: The air clears a bit more. A hand sticks out of the rubble.
text: George is on it in a second, pulling stones off and tossing
dialog: them aside.
text: Souxie breaks through the rubble. Coughing. In pain.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: SOUXIE
dialog: Papillon!
text: George pulls her out of the rubble. She’s banged up and
text: bruised, has a nasty cut on her arm, but she’s okay.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Papillon, if you’re goofing
dialog: around...
dialog: Nothing.
text: Scarlett sifts back into the rubble. No sign of Papillon.
text: Zed drops under the water and looks. Nothing.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Jesus. Papillon?!
dialog: Nothing.
text: George turns on La Taupe.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: You asshole! You could have killed
dialog: us all!
text: George goes after Taupe, but Scarlett and Zed intervene.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Stop! We shouldn’t disrupt the
dialog: space any more than we already
dialog: have.
speaker_heading: SOUXIE
dialog: Is Papillon... dead?
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: We're all dead! That was the only
dialog: way out!
dialog: 74.
text: He’s right. They are all enclosed in a small room with no
dialog: exit.
speaker_heading: SOUXIE
dialog: Ay!
text: Souxie’s arm is hurting her.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Where’s the first aid kit? We need
dialog: to clean up that cut.
text: They all look around.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
text: The packs are buried.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Water? Food?
text: They all look at each other. Nothing.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Spare batteries?
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
text: Once the headlamps go out...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Let’s start conserving.
text: George turns his off, dropping the light of the space down
text: considerably. Benji does the same.
text: George pokes around at the rubble, looking for a way out.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe we could dig our way out.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: With what? Your hands?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: He’s right. This chamber was
dialog: created by master builders. If they
dialog: wanted to trap the unworthy, we’re
dialog: trapped.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: So what, we just sit here and wait
dialog: for the air to run out?!
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: We're all just cool hanging out
dialog: waiting to die?!
text: George looks around the room. They’re all trying to wrap
text: their heads around the situation. Terrified.
text: Scarlett looks closer at the structure around them.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Those lamps are Freemason by
dialog: design.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Freemasons never built something
dialog: like this without a back door, just
dialog: in case it collapsed on them.
text: She keeps inspecting their surroundings. She takes a rock and
text: taps on the walls, listening for something that sounds
text: hollow. Nothing.
text: The floor and the ceiling seem to be painted and inscribed
text: the same exact way, almost as if there were a mirror running
text: the length of the floor.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: “As above, so below.” That phrase
dialog: is the key to all magic.
text: She continues to search for something that doesn’t fit while
text: continuing her thought.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT'D)
dialog: It means, basically, what is within
dialog: me is outside of me. What is on
dialog: earth is in heaven. As I am, so are
dialog: my cells, so are my atoms.
dialog: Basically, what I believe the world
dialog: to be, so it is.
text: She sees something.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: Look.
text: She points to a rectangle inscribed on the ceiling that’s
text: covered in alchemical symbols.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
text: The Porta Alchemica. The door to
dialog: the mystical.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: So it’s a door?!
text: George grabs a rock and gets ready to chisel at it.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: No! Look. That symbol of the door
text: on the ceiling is the only thing
text: not replicated on the floor.
dialog: 76.
text: Scarlett shines the light from the rectangle on the ceiling
text: down to the floor directly beneath it.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: “Bs above, so below.”
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: So if...
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: If they painted a door on the
dialog: ceiling...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Then there would be a door on the
dialog: floor too.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: There is nothing below us. This is
text: the bottom of the Catacombs.
text: Scarlett takes the rock from George. She kneels down in the
text: water in the gutter at the bottom of the chamber. She hits it
text: with the rock. Hits it again. And again.
text: CRACK. She looks around at the others as the water drains out
dialog: of the bottom.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (to La Taupe)
dialog: That water must be going somewhere.
text: Scarlett doubles her efforts, hitting the shit out of the
dialog: rock until.
speaker_heading: CRACK!
dialog: 77.
text: The floor of the gutter beneath her gives. She rushes away
text: from it as the stones beneath her feet give way and disappear
text: off into nothingness.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: This isn’t catacombs. Look at the
dialog: edges. This wasn’t made by man. Who
dialog: knows where this could lead.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Whatever it is, it’s a possible way
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, going deeper.
text: Scarlett picks a rope and lowers herself down into the chute.
text: The descent is eerie, dark.
text: They watch as she goes. And goes. And goes.
text: Scarlett stops. She takes a flashlight and shines it around,
text: looking at what’s in front of her.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: There’s a passage down here!
scene_heading: INT. THE GATES - CONTINUOUS
text: Scarlett places her feet on the ground and looks up to find:
text: A very small opening with a large stone arch over it. It
text: looks ancient. Very, very ancient.
text: The others file in behind her.
text: Something about this space makes them all feel uneasy.
text: Scarlett notes the ancient inscriptions on the arch.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Can you read that? What does it
dialog: say?
text: George dusts it off to get a better look. Reads it quietly to
text: himself, thinking through the meaning.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: “Abandon all hope, ye who enter
dialog: here.”
text: Scarlett understands.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: What.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: According to mythology, that’s the
text: inscription over the gates of hell.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: I’m not going in there.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: (to La Taupe)
dialog: I thought you didn’t believe in any
dialog: of this.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: I don’t.
text: La Taupe is deeply unnerved by the idea of crossing this
dialog: threshold, but there truly is no other choice.
text: The entrance is so small, so low to the ground that they’1ll
dialog: have to slide through it one at a time.
text: Scarlett notes it.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: “And they shall be made to crawl on
text: their bellies into the kingdom of
dialog: darkness.”
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah. That occurred to me too.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: I don’t like this.
text: They prepare themselves to cross through.
text: Scarlett goes for it. She slides her pack through and follows
text: closely behind it.
scene_heading: INT. ALCHEMIST CHAMBER 2
text: Scarlett stands up in the next room to find:
text: IT’S EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE ALCHEMIST CHAMBER THAT COLLAPSED
text: ON THEM. Same artwork on the ceiling. Same gold. Same missing
text: Philosopher’s Stone. Though this room is still intact.
dialog: 79.
text: It sounds a bit different this side of the threshold. Like a
text: faint throbbing drone in the background.
text: George stands up behind Scarlett, looks around.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Whoa.
text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: It’s exactly the same.
text: Scarlett points at one of the painted gods on the wall.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Not exactly. They’re facing the
dialog: other direction.
text: She's right. This room looks like THE MIRROR IMAGE of the
text: earlier Alchemist Chamber that collapsed on them.
text: La Taupe turns back, considering his options. He drops to his
text: knees, and digs around furiously looking for something. They
text: follow his eyes to find what’s freaking him out - THE SMALL
text: ENTRANCE THEY CRAWLED THROUGH SEEMS TO HAVE DISAPPEARED!
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: What happened to the entrance?
text: THE SMALL ENTRANCE IS GONE. There is no retreat.
text: La Taupe stands and looks at them, very seriously.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE (CONT’D)
dialog: Are we dead?
text: They all contemplate this for a moment.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: No.
text: Scarlett sees the fear rising in her group.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT'D)
dialog: We should keep moving.
text: She takes a deep breath and lunges underwater, pushing her
text: way under the rock to the other side.
dialog: 80.
scene_heading: INT. ROSE CHAMBER 2
text: Scarlett comes up on the other side. A mirror image of the
text: rose chamber. The same tomb. THIS TIME WITH A ROTTEN CORPSE
speaker_heading: ATOP IT.
text: Scarlett looks around nervously.
text: The others join her, one at a time.
text: George looks past Scarlett.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Hello?
text: She spins to find.
text: A FIGURE STANDING AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM. In the dark,
text: it’s hard to see more than a faint shape.
text: George's voice echoes through the long chamber.
dialog: No reaction. Nothing.
text: They all look at each other, not sure what to do.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Can you hear me?
dialog: Nothing.
text: The figure moves a little, muttering quietly to himself -
text: like a man possessed.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: Maybe he knows a way out.
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Do you know a way out?
text: Nothing. The figure just keeps muttering to himself.
text: Scarlett takes a step toward him. And another.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: We have to pass him.
text: She's right. The hole that leads beyond is just behind the
dialog: figure.
dialog: 81.
text: They inch forward.
speaker_heading: FIGURE
speaker_heading: WRRRGAAAAHHH !
text: They all freeze as the figure moves, repetitious, erratic,
text: like someone with severe mental illness.
text: The figure takes another step forward, stepping into the
dialog: light:
scene_heading: REVEALING PAPILLON!
speaker_heading: SOUXIE
dialog: Papillon?!
dialog: Nothing. No reaction.
text: Souxie moves to the front of the pack. Old friends with
dialog: Papillon.
speaker_heading: SOUXIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Papillon. Et-tu bien?
dialog: No reaction.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: How’d you get here?
dialog: Nothing.
text: Souxie moves closer. They all follow her.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Careful, Souxie.
text: Souxie gets closer.
speaker_heading: SOUXIE
dialog: Et-tu bien, Papillon?
text: As they get closer, they can hear pieces of what he’s
text: muttering.
text: He doesn’t seem to see any of them.
speaker_heading: SOUXIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Papillon.
text: She inches closer and closer. She reaches out to touch his
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: SOUXIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Pap...
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: BOOM!
text: IN A FLASH, PAPILLON VICIOUSLY ATTACKS SOUXIE, CRASHING HER
text: RIGHT THROUGH THE CAMERA (which falls into the water, framing
text: the rest of the incident from an odd angle) AND SLAMMING HER
text: HEAD AGAINST THE FLOOR, OVER AND OVER, SCREECHING
scene_heading: FEROCIOUSLY.
text: EVERYONE RUSHES TO SOUXIE’S DEFENSE, fighting to rip Papillon
dialog: off her.
text: PAPILLON FALLS AWAY INTO THE DARKNESS.
text: Benji picks the camera up off the floor and spins it to try
text: to cast light on Papillon.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Over there!
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Where’d he go?
speaker_heading: BENJI (0.C.)
dialog: What the fuck?!
text: Scarlett tends to Souxie, who is unconscious and bleeding
text: from the face and mouth.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: We need to get her out of here! We
dialog: need to get her help!
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: Papillon?!
text: Everyone is shaken up.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Grab her legs!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Okay. Okay.
text: La Taupe lost his mask in the struggle, revealing TERRIBLE
text: BURN SCARS ON HALF HIS FACE. He helps George and Scarlett
dialog: lift Souxie.
text: They rush her to the small opening at the end of the chamber,
text: exactly the same as the one behind the Ptolemaic hinged door.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Give me the rope.
dialog: 83.
text: Zed grabs the rope and hands it to Scarlett.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
text: Tie her feet and lift her into the
dialog: hole once I get through.
text: Scarlett squeezes through, nothing but her feet visible to
dialog: the others.
scene_heading: INT. SMALL TUNNEL 2
text: It’s tight in the tunnel with Scarlett. Her breathing labored
dialog: and nervous.
text: As she nears the end, she hears something in the next room.
text: She stops. Listens. What is it? Someone’s voice? She’s
text: scared, but this isn’t the place to stop. She climbs forward.
text: She approaches the end of the hole very slowly, worried about
text: what she might find in the next room.
text: She suddenly pushes her way out.
scene_heading: INT. WET HALLWAY 2
dialog: Splash!
text: She falls out the other side into the water. She jumps to her
text: feet, and scans the room looking for anyone who might be in
text: there. She doesn’t see anyone.
text: She looks at her arms. Blood? She dips her hand in the water,
text: looks at it. Dark red.
text: She looks around the room again.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Okay. Send Souxie.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I’m coming first. So I can help
dialog: pull.
text: George climbs through. He drops into the water beside
dialog: Scarlett.
text: He too notes the “water.”
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Is this blood?
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I don’t know.
text: George tastes the liquid off his fingers.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It tastes like blood. I think...
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: (very serious)
dialog: Let's just keep going.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah.
text: George and Scarlett pull Souxie through the tunnel while
text: keeping an eye behind themselves, just in case.
scene_heading: INT. WET HALLWAY 2 - SOON AFTER
text: They all rush onward, sticking close together, on edge.
text: They arrive at a hole in the ground. Much like the one they
text: descended earlier.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMNEY CHUTE TOP 2
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Great. Everything is the mirror
dialog: image of what we’ve already done,
text: but somehow it keeps going deeper.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: How deep will this take us?
text: Zed finishes lowering his rope. He does the math in his head.
speaker_heading: ZED
text: Another 100 meters.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Making it... 1000 feet beneath the
dialog: earth’s surface. That’s pretty
dialog: deep.
speaker_heading: ZED
text: Deeper than the Eiffel Tower is
dialog: high.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah, I get it.
dialog: 85.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMNEY CHUTE BOTTOM 2
text: Scarlett and George get to the bottom. Look left to find the
dialog: bone chamber.
text: Scarlett steps back into the chimney and helps spot the
dialog: lowering of Souxie.
text: Only Benji remains above.
speaker_heading: FAINT VOICE (0.C.)
dialog: Scarlett?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Do you hear that?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FAINT VOICE (0.C.)
dialog: Scarlett?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Is that Benji?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: (shaken)
dialog: I don’t think so.
text: Scarlett steps into the chimney. Calls to Benji.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: You okay up there Benji?
scene_heading: INT. CHIMNEY CHUTE TOP 2
text: Benji kneels, alone up top, tense, lowering Souxie down. The
text: camera sits on the ground beside him, cropping him strangely.
text: Is something moving in the shadows behind him?
text: He hears a faint cry. A baby?
text: He uses the camera’s onboard light to look around. Nothing.
text: He lowers Souxie down a little further. Scarlett calls up to
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (0.C.)
dialog: You okay?
text: He hears something. Is someone lurking in the shadows?
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Is someone up here?
dialog: 86.
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (0.C.)
dialog: Benji? You okay?
text: He hears else. Looks. Nothing. He calls down to Scarlett.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Yeah.
text: He hears something directly behind him and spins to find:
text: A WOMAN IN A BLOODY NIGHTGOWN HOLDING A DEAD INFANT. HER FACE
scene_heading: IS CONTORTED, SAVAGE, INSANE.
speaker_heading: BENJI (CONT'D)
dialog: Aah!
text: Benji jumps away from her, dropping the line and slipping on
text: the edge of the chute.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMNEY CHUTE BOTTOM 2
text: Souxie drops the last ten feet, landing with a thud.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Oh! Benji, you just...
speaker_heading: BOOM!
text: They all spin to find BENJI BEHIND THEM, DEAD FROM A FALL
text: DOWN THE CHIMNEY CHUTE.
text: They look up the chimney chute. Is someone looking down at
dialog: them?
text: George checks Benji’s vitals. Shakes his head. Dead.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What just happened?!
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I don’t know.
text: Scarlett bends down and strokes Benji’s hair tenderly.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m so sorry, Benji.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: We should keep moving.
text: George snaps to.
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hand me the camera. We might need
text: the onboard light.
text: Zed grabs it, hands it to George.
scene_heading: INT. BONE CHAMBER 2
text: They shuffle over the bones in the chamber as fast as they
text: can, each struggling against the fear of getting trapped
dialog: here.
text: George sees something under the bones. He shines a light into
dialog: it to get a better look.
text: Underneath the bones is a gutter full of water, in which a
text: YOUNG MAN, struggles to get to the surface of the water to
dialog: breathe.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Danny! Danny!
text: The Young Man pushes against the bones, but George’s weight
text: on top of them makes it impossible for the Young Man to
dialog: breathe.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Get off the bones! He’s drowning
dialog: down there! Everyone get off the
dialog: bones!
text: The Young Man seems to keep pace with George as he
text: desperately tries to get out of the way.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: NO! NO!
text: This is tapping a deep nerve in George.
text: He gets to the end of the bone chamber and checks back to
dialog: find the Young Man gone.
text: George covers his mouth and takes a few beats. Scarlett
text: approaches him.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: It was so real.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Why... Why would... he be here?
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: It’s not him. I think this place
dialog: knows our pain and is using it
dialog: against us.
text: In the distance, SOMEONE SCREAMS MERCILESSLY - and not the
dialog: kind of scream you hear in movies, the kind you hear in an ER
text: at 4 in the morning.
text: They all move very close together, getting more and more
text: unnerved.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR 2
text: The screams become more and more present as the gang
text: approaches. Seems like it’s coming from mushroom alley.
text: The light in the corridor looks different too. As if lit by
text: firelight.
text: They turn the corner to find:
scene_heading: INT. MUSHROOM ALLEY 2
text: A CAR, IN FLAMES IN THE MIDDLE OF MUSHROOM ALLEY, A SMALL
text: FAMILY INSIDE THE CAR, SCREAMING MERCILESSLY, REACHING FOR LA
speaker_heading: TAUPE.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE
dialog: NO! NO!
dialog: La Taupe obviously knows what this is.
speaker_heading: _LA TAUPE (CONT'D)
dialog: NO! CE N'ETAIT PAS MON DEFAUT! CE
dialog: N'ETAIT PAS MON DEFAUT!
text: La Taupe races to the car, trying to help the people.
text: Scarlett and George try to pull him away.
speaker_heading: BOOM!
text: IN A FLASH, the BURNING MAN catches hold of one of La Taupe’s
text: legs. La Taupe struggles against the man, losing his shoes,
text: socks, pants in the struggle.
speaker_heading: LA TAUPE (CONT’D)
dialog: Help me! Help me!
text: George and Scarlett grab La Taupe’s arms and try to pull him
dialog: free, but it’s no use.
dialog: 89.
text: CRACK! The ground beneath the car seems to be cracking.
text: THE BURNING CAR COLLAPSES INTO THE GROUND AS THE BURNING MAN
text: GRABS LA TAUPE BY THE HAIR.
text: The ground swallows up the burning car and La Taupe, but the
text: ground closes at La Taupe’s knees, leaving La Taupe’s lower
text: legs sticking out of the ground, flailing in pain as the
text: sounds of his singeing flesh and agonized screams below.
text: Everyone rushes to his side, trying in vain to pull him back
text: out of the ground. His flesh burns them to the touch.
text: George nudges Scarlett, points. A figure hovers in the
text: shadows at the edge of the corridor they came from.
text: They hurry through the room, to the next hallway.
text: Scarlett hears something.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Music.
text: Sure enough. They hear music in the next room. Similar to the
text: electronic music the ravers played earlier.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: They might know a way out.
text: Scarlett leads George and Zed (who still carry Souxie) into
dialog: the music to find:
scene_heading: INT. CATAPHILE RAVE 2
text: The cataphile party, but it’s very different now. Through the
text: strobing lights, the ravers seem to scream inaudibly,
text: writhing in pain, while BRUTALLY DEVOURING EACH OTHER.
text: The music is different too. It’s full of cattle screams,
text: grinding cacophonous noises, awful.
text: Our gang turns off all lights and hustles through the hellish
text: sight as fast as they can.
text: Suddenly, THE ONBOARD LIGHT ON THE CAMERA FLIPS ON,
text: ILLUMINATING THE RAVERS AND THEY ARE ALL FUCKED UP! EYES
text: BLEEDING, MOUTHS SCREAMING. Horrific.
text: The camera shakes. George spins around to find a raver
text: desperately trying to take refuge behind him. George pushes
text: away from the raver, as another one grabs him.
dialog: 90.
text: George hits him with the lens of the camera, but the ravers
dialog: keep coming.
text: In the struggle, George loses his grip on Souxie.
text: THE RAVERS SUDDENLY SWARM SOUXIE, RIPPING HER TO PIECES IN
scene_heading: SECONDS, DEVOURING HER RAVENOUSLY.
text: George jumps back from the mayhem, but loses his footing.
text: A Raver drops onto George, trying viciously to rip into him.
text: George fights like mad to keep the Raver at bay, and even
text: gets back to his feet as:
text: ANOTHER RAVER RIPS A HUGE BITE OUT OF GEORGE’S NECK, shooting
text: blood into the air. George drops to his knees, bleeding
text: uncontrollably.
text: Scarlett and Zed grab George’s arms and pull him into the
text: next room. In the confusion, Benji’s camera strap has twisted
text: around George’s arm. The camera slides with them as he’s
text: pulled into the next room.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS CINEMA 2
text: The cinema’s screen now shows a “remixed” version of the 1922
dialog: silent film “Haxan - Witchcraft Through the Ages.” It’s
text: bizarre, upsetting, creepy.
text: Scarlett tries desperately to stop George’s bleeding neck.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: No! No!
dialog: Nothing is working.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: (to Zed)
dialog: Come here! Put your hand here! Keep
dialog: pressure!
text: She rips into her bag. Pulls out the Philosopher’s Stone.
text: She crumbles some of it off, rubs it into his wound.
dialog: Watches.
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: It doesn't work?!
text: George mutters something.
dialog: She
dialog: She
dialog: She
dialog: She
dialog: Zed
dialog: She
dialog: She
dialog: gl.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: What? What was that?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (barely audible)
dialog: “VITRIOL.”
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
speaker_heading: VITRIOL?
dialog: gets it.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT'D)
dialog: “Visit the Interior Parts of the
dialog: Earth; by Rectification Thou Shalt
dialog: Find the Hidden Stone."
text: looks at George.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT'D)
dialog: This isn’t the right stone. I have
dialog: to rectify the taking of it. Only
dialog: through putting it back will I find
text: the real hidden stone.
text: stands, looks around the dark, creepy chamber.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh fuck.
text: contemplates it.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m going back.
dialog: thinks he’s surely not understanding this right.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: We must keep moving forward.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: We’re more than half a mile
dialog: underground. By the time you and I
dialog: lift him out of here, he’1l be
dialog: dead.
text: looks over her gear, preparing herself.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: And I’m not going to let that
dialog: happen.
text: runs back toward the rave room.
dialog: 92.
text: Note: The following sequence of Scarlett on her own will be
text: filmed only by the GoPro camera on her head. We will see her
text: arms and legs, hear her vocal and breathing reactions, but
dialog: won’t see her face. Instead, we'll experience the following
text: as she does.
scene_heading: INT. CATAPHILE RAVE 2
text: Scarlett rushes into the room. The same music, the same
text: lights. But this time there’s only one person there, dancing
text: alone amongst all the devoured flesh. Wearing a bull mask.
text: The bull mask moves, but doesn’t seem to be looking directly
text: at her. She races to the next room.
scene_heading: INT. MUSHROOM ALLEY 2
text: Scarlett races through Mushroom Alley, nothing left but a
text: small smouldering hole where La Taupe was swallowed up.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR 2
text: A FIGURE at the other end of the corridor stops Scarlett in
text: her tracks. Doesn’t look like Papillon. Older, heavier.
text: A VOICE behind her.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Scarlett?!
text: She spins around to find:
text: HER FATHER RIGHT BEHIND HER! But something’s wrong with him.
text: His legs are like tree trunks grown into the floor. His arms
text: like brittle twigs with blood dripping off them.
text: She jumps away from the sight...
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Dad?!
text: And bumps into something behind her. She spins to find:
dialog: HER FATHER THERE TOO!
text: Her bumping him has broken off one of his twigs, causing him
text: to howl in pain.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT’S FATHER
dialog: No! What have you done?!
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: What do you...
text: She backs away from the sight, again bumping into something
text: behind her. Her father is there too.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT’S FATHER
dialog: You look just like my daughter.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: It is me dad.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT’S FATHER
dialog: No! You’re not her! She would never
dialog: come here!
text: Scarlett bumps something else, turns, her father is there
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT’S FATHER (CONT’D)
dialog: She would know. If she ever came
dialog: here, there would be no way out.
dialog: She’d be trapped here. Forever!
text: She runs from the room, choking back sobs.
scene_heading: INT. BONE CHAMBER 2
text: As she crosses the threshold into the next room, she bumps
dialog: into her father here too.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT’S FATHER
dialog: Forever! Forever! Forever! Forever!
text: His voice takes on a shrill screeching quality. Like a bad
text: dream in which a loved one suddenly seems possessed.
text: She keeps moving, but this place is really taking a toll on
dialog: her.
text: Scarlett shuttles over the bones in the bone tunnel.
text: Again, she sees her Father, in this room too. The multiple
text: voices of her Father doubling, tripling, into a cacophony of
dialog: agony.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT’S FATHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Ever! Ever! Ever!
text: She clears the bones, and rushes into the next alcove near
text: the chimney chute, SOBBING AS SHE GOES. This is the loneliest
dialog: moment of her life.
dialog: 94.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMNEY CHUTE 2
text: Her father continues to squall in the background as she makes
text: her way to the chimney chute. She can’t reach the opening
dialog: well enough to get footing.
text: She kicks off her shoes to get better traction, takes a
text: running start, jumps up and grabs hold of the rock wall. She
text: struggles to make her way up the first couple feet.
text: As she gets some height in the chimney chute without ropes to
text: protect her, one false move would send her plummeting to her
dialog: death.
text: Her foot slips and she almost drops. She takes a couple deep
dialog: breaths.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: You can do this. Don’t think. Just
dialog: keep going.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMNEY CHUTE 2 - LATER
text: Scarlett gets to the top of the chimney chute, but getting
text: out of the circular hole isn’t easy. She has to carefully
text: position herself as she inches herself to solid ground beside
dialog: the hole.
scene_heading: INT. WET HALLWAY 2
text: She rushes through the bloody water as fast as she can,
text: trying to make up for lost time in the chimney chute.
text: AN ARM REACHES UP FROM UNDER THE WATER AND GRABS HER LEG.
text: She jumps at the feeling and pulls against it. Another arm.
text: Another. Arms reach up and grab her from every direction,
text: pulling her under the bloody water.
scene_heading: INT. BLOODY POOL
text: Scarlett fights against the arms pulling her every which way.
text: She plants a foot on a stone ledge and pushes with all her
dialog: might.
scene_heading: INT. WET HALLWAY 2
text: Scarlett breaks through, now covered head to toe in blood.
text: She rips her way free of the grabbing arms.
dialog: 95.
text: She catches her breath, overwhelmed, freaked out.
scene_heading: INT. SMALL TUNNEL 2
text: Scarlett rushes through the small tight tunnel leading to the
dialog: Rose Chamber.
scene_heading: INT. ROSE CHAMBER 2
text: Scarlett lands in the Rose Tunnel, looks around, all safe.
text: She hurries through.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Ow!
text: She looks down at her feet, illuminating:
text: HEADS BURIED UP TO THEIR NOSES IN STONE, THEIR EYES
text: HORRIFIED, WATCHING HER!
text: Other heads have nothing but their mouths showing and they
dialog: try to bite anything passing.
text: She does her best to avoid the faces, but sustains a series
text: of bites on the way, drawing blood.
text: She dives into the water at the end to swim back into the
dialog: alchemy chamber.
scene_heading: INT. ALCHEMIST CHAMBER 2
text: Scarlett enters the Alchemist Chamber. What once looked so
text: opulent and breathtaking in its beauty, now looks evil,
text: depressing, lonely.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: “By Rectification Thou Shalt Find
dialog: the Hidden Stone."
text: She pulls the rock out as she scours the Egyptian images,
text: looking for the eye of Ra she originally took the stone from.
text: She finds the eye. Lifts the stone. Too high. She slides a
text: rock into place and stands on it. She lifts the stone toward
dialog: the eye of Ra.
text: It clicks right into place. A perfect fit.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, I’ve rectified. Now,
dialog: where's...
dialog: 96.
text: The stone in its place, she drops her eyes, to find a mirror
text: right in front of her face.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: -.. the hidden stone.
text: Thoughts play across her face. She understands something she
dialog: hadn’t before.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS CINEMA 2
text: George and Zed in the cinema.
text: A GROUP OF 5 FIGURES ENTER FROM THE FAR END OF THE ROOM. Zed
text: quickly flips the camera’s onboard light off, dropping the
text: room into near darkness, except for the projected images from
dialog: the silent movie.
text: THE FIGURES MOVE AS IF IN SLOW MOTION, IRREGULAR, SILENT.
text: THEY FLOW LIKE WAVES, TOGETHER IN IRREGULAR BURSTS, AS IF ONE
text: ORGANISM IN 5 BODIES.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: Shhh.
text: George desperately tries to keep quiet despite his neck
dialog: wound.
scene_heading: INT. ROSE CHAMBER 2
text: Scarlett races through the rose chamber where the rotting
text: corpse’s body has been restored to it’s un-decayed state.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS CINEMA 2
text: George and Zed hide.
text: The Figures seem not to have noticed them.
text: The camera lies right behind Zed and George just catching a
text: piece of the passing Figures, which makes the anticipation
text: almost unbearable.
text: The Figures stop as they get close. One of them slowly turns
text: his head, LOOKS RIGHT AT ZED AND GEORGE.
dialog: 97.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMNEY CHUTE 2
text: Scarlett plants her feet and descends the Chimney Chute as
text: fast as she can. She is focused, driven.
text: She hits the ground at the bottom and runs for the bone
dialog: chamber.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS CINEMA
text: The Figures move closer and closer - still in their bizarre
text: slow motion - to George and Zed.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (quiet, to Zed)
dialog: Go.
text: Zed thinks about it for a moment.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: No.
text: Right as the figures are about to grab onto them, Zed grabs
text: George under the arms and pulls him furiously toward the next
dialog: room.
text: The Figures stop. One turns his head to look at them. They
text: pivot, and keep following, in slightly quicker motion. The
text: Figures move slowly but consistently toward Zed and George.
text: Zed pulls George as fast and vigorously as he can, but these
text: Figures are gaining on him.
text: Scarlett sprints right around the Figures as Zed pulls George
text: into the adjacent corridor. As Scarlett passes them, one of
text: the Figures reaches out in fast motion, trying to grab her,
text: but she dodges him just in time.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR 2
text: Scarlett grabs George’s other arm and helps Zed create a
text: little distance from the Figures.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS CINEMA 2
text: Scarlett races to George’s side. He’s unconscious. In bad
dialog: shape.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Did you find the stone?
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Yes.
text: Scarlett stops in the middle of the corridor. Zed drops the
text: camera to the ground beside them, flips the light on so
text: Scarlett can see. The scene is framed irregularly, Scarlett
text: and George’s heads cropped strangely.
text: SHE PLACES HER HANDS OVER GEORGE’S WOUNDS. KISSES HIM DEEPLY.
text: He comes to, coughs up blood. She moves her hands away from
text: his wound to find his wounds gone.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: How did you do that?!
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I am the stone. As are you. As we
dialog: all are. As above, so below.
text: The Figures are getting closer and closer.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Scarlett!
text: She looks, sees them coming nearer and nearer. George regains
text: consciousness. He touches his wounds to find himself healed.
text: Scarlett and Zed help George to his feet. The three of them
text: run from the room as the Figures approach.
scene_heading: INT. ARTIST ALCOVE 2
text: They race into the Artist Alcove.
text: The camera's onboard light (their last remaining light)
text: fritzes out, then comes back on.
text: They look around the room to find it a dead end. There is,
text: however, a large hole in the middle of the floor.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Dead end!
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: No!
text: Zed looks to the hole. He takes a rock and drops it into the
text: hole. It goes and goes and goes, seemingly never hitting the
dialog: ground.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: We'll never be able to climb down
dialog: that.
text: The onboard camera light goes out.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: No! No! We’re so close!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: There were paintings on the wall.
dialog: Did you see them?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: No. I was looking for an exit.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: I have matches.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: You do?
text: Zed digs through his pockets. Counts them.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Three.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Light one.
text: Zed lights one. It flashes and goes out revealing the FIGURES
text: NOW IN THE ROOM, APPROACHING.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: I couldn't see it! Light another
dialog: one!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Don’t let it go out so fast.
text: Zed lights another match. Scarlett scans the room for
text: anything that could give a clue. The Figures are getting
text: closer! She sees Egyptian hieroglyphic paintings on one wall
text: as the match goes out.
text: The match goes out.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I found something. I didn’t have a
dialog: chance to really see it though.
dialog: Light the next one! Hurry!
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: This is the last one.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I know! Go!
text: He lights the match. This time she gets a quick look at the
dialog: painting.
text: The painting shows the Ancient Egyptian demon, AMMUT - part
text: lion, hippopotamus and crocodile - the “soul eater.” Behind
text: him looks like one part of a scale, with a feather on it. A
text: painted beam from that scale rises up to the ceiling, and
text: across above them, and seems to end right over the hole.
text: The match goes out.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: (very quickly)
dialog: The “soul eater.” In Egyptian
dialog: mythology, after you died, you went
dialog: to the underworld where your heart
dialog: was weighed against a feather. If
dialog: your heart weighted more than a
dialog: feather, the soul eater, would eat
dialog: your heart and you were condemned
dialog: to nothingness.
text: The camera flickers for a moment. She uses the light to make
text: her way to the hole.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: We need to make our souls lighter
text: than a feather. And then we jump.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: We what?!
text: The camera flickers, the Figures are now very close.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: What is the thing that weighs your
dialog: soul down? The thing you’ve never
dialog: told anyone?!
text: She goes first.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: The night my dad killed himself. He
dialog: called me and I didn’t answer.
text: The pain of this taps a real nerve in her.
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT'D)
dialog: I wasn’t doing anything important.
dialog: I just didn’t feel like talking to
dialog: him. When I think of what he must
dialog: have been feeling...
text: George takes her hand.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: When I went to get help for my
dialog: brother, I panicked and forgot to
dialog: remember how to get back to him.
dialog: And he died because of it.
text: Scarlett nods gently to him. They look to Zed.
speaker_heading: ZED
text: I was in a car that ran a man over.
dialog: I never reported it.
text: Scarlett takes Zed’s hand too.
text: The camera light flickers. THE FIGURES ARE RIGHT THERE,
scene_heading: SECONDS AWAY.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: On three.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: This isn’t going to work.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: You don’t have to believe in it,
dialog: George. But if you take the jump,
dialog: it’1l work.
text: He nods. The three of them join hands.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (CONT’D)
dialog: One... two... THREE!
text: They step into the abyss together and fall.
scene_heading: INT. ABYSS - CONTINUOUS
text: The camera rattles around, banging off the walls as they
text: fall, screaming through the nothingness.
text: It just seems to go on and on. Falling and falling.
dialog: 102.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS ENTRANCE AREA
speaker_heading: BOOM!
text: They hit a rock wall, and fall to the ground beside the hole.
text: They look around to find paintings and graffiti like that
text: found near the surface.
text: George smiles.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: We're not dead.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: It worked?!
text: There, above them is a ladder leading up to a manhole cover
text: on the surface.
text: They scurry up the ladder, excited by the idea of getting out
text: of this place, open the manhole cover slowly to find:
scene_heading: EXT. PARISIAN STREET - NIGHT
dialog: Paris.
text: Scarlett and George and Zed step out onto the Parisian city
text: street, surrounded by cafes and revelers, partying and
dialog: celebrating life.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: It worked.
text: The three of them embrace.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: See ya around, Zed.
text: Zed watches on as George and Scarlett walk off into the
text: Parisian night, holding each other close, surrounded by
text: Parisians blissfully unaware of the hell that lies beneath
dialog: their feet.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
