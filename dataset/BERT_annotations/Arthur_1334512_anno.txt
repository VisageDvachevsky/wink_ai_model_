scene_heading: EXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A HOMELESS MAN, who from his tatty suit may have been a top
text: broker this time last year, is picking through a bin in
text: Manhattan's deserted night-time financial district.
dialog: 
text: The street starts to vibrate. A TERRIFYING GROWL approaches.
dialog: 
text: A huge black shape smashes into view - THE DARK KNIGHT'S
text: BATMOBILE! Our audience wonder if they've wandered into the
text: wrong movie. The Homeless Man dives for cover.
dialog: 
text: BAM! The Batmobile smashes into a row of parked cars.
dialog: 
text: We hear manic laughing from inside the car, which screeches
text: and careers violently into a sign reading `WALL STREET'.
dialog: 
text: Sirens herald THREE POLICE CARS in hot pursuit.
dialog: 
text: The Batmobile roars up Wall Street, bashing against the New
text: York Stock Exchange, thumping up and down the Federal Hall's
text: steps and finally smashing at high speed into the rear end of
text: the famous 'Charging Bull' statue. Two enormous bronze
text: testicles thud onto the Batmobile's bonnet and roll away.
dialog: 
text: The cop cars screech up, surrounding the Batmobile. TWO OLDER
text: COPS and A ROOKIE surround it, weapons drawn.
dialog: 
text: A HELICOPTER appears, blazing the Batmobile in white light.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROOKIE COP
dialog: Cooool.
dialog: 
text: An older Cop flashes the rookie a dirty look, then points a
text: FLASHLIGHT into a tiny window. THE BATMAN - actually drunken
text: English socialite ARTHUR BACH TEMPLEMEAD in a costume -
text: lowers the window and offers a handshake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Evening, Constable!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLDER COP 1
dialog: (seen it all before)
dialog: Hi, Arthur.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Are you familiar with the
dialog: expression `I can explain
dialog: everything'?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLDER COP 1
dialog: Out of the car, please.
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Terribly sorry, but in the film
dialog: they used a different model to show
text: the old Batchap getting in and out.
dialog: This one has no doors, so I'd have
dialog: to squeeze out the back arsehole
dialog: first. Which nobody wants...
speaker_heading: (TO COP 2)
dialog: Apart from you, cheeky monkey!
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: It's a joke! Okay, okay.
dialog: 
text: Arthur wriggles awkwardly out of a rear hatch. The bronze
text: bull teeters, a little scarily. He stands, wobbly. His Batman
text: utility belt features a big water pistol, a firework, a hip
text: flask and line of shot glasses. And, inexplicably, a big red
text: stapler. The younger cop is desperately fighting the giggles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLDER COP 1
dialog: Okay, explain everything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Well. What with having spunked 1.6
dialog: million fat Alberts on this little
dialog: runaround, I thought why not take
dialog: it a step further and try to
dialog: actually collar a few ne-er do
dialog: wells? It worked for the
dialog: billionaire Bruce Wayne, why not
dialog: the future billionaire Arthur Bach-
dialog: Templemead? Will I have to do
dialog: traffic school?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLDER COP 2
dialog: How much have you drunk, Arthur?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: To use the technical medical term -
dialog: megabloodyshitloads. Either that or
dialog: I've had a stroke! But fret not, I
dialog: have a designated driver.
dialog: 
text: The cop shines his flashlight back inside, revealing A
text: BEARDED HOMELESS OLD MAN IN A CRAPPY 60S `ROBIN' costume.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOMELESS ROBIN
dialog: Where's my five thousand dollars?
dialog: 
text: Arthur counts out a huge wad of cash.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: The Boy Homeless here neglected to

speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
dialog: Or that the only reason he's sober
dialog: is to be ready for the conspiracy
dialog: of leopards about to seize
dialog: Manhattan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOMELESS ROBIN
dialog: It's LIZARDS! English prick!
dialog: 
text: Arthur hands another wad of cash to Cop 1.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I trust this will cover all repairs
dialog: to New York and any inconvenience
dialog: to your good selves?
dialog: 
text: He turns and tries to get back in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
dialog: Up up and away! Ah, no, that's the
dialog: other chap.
dialog: 
text: The bronze bull collapses fully, crushing the Batmobile.

scene_heading: INT. 23RD PRECINCT. CELL - NIGHT - LATER
dialog: 
text: Arthur sits, minus mask, in a cell with Homeless Robin and
text: VARIOUS CRIMINALS and DRUNKS, including A HUGE GUY IN A
text: CHICAGO CUBS SHIRT, sporting a terrifically swollen eye.
dialog: 
text: JAY, a drunk with a bandaged neck, is ranting away at Arthur,
text: who's paying close attention, genuinely fascinated. Cash
text: sticks out of various pockets.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Then the crazy motherfucker cut me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Goodness. Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Said I cut the bombita with pig
dialog: killer!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Rude man. And who threw hot
dialog: Americano in whose face again?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: I did in his. No half and half
dialog: neither. That shit burnt!
dialog: 
text: Jay laughs hard, as does GARY, another crook. Arthur, out of
text: politeness, tries to join in the laughter.
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I burnt my sister's hair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (high fiving him)
dialog: Cool...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Ho wanted to evict me, just 'cause
dialog: I don't fit her definition of
dialog: hygiene. Plenty of places to take a
dialog: shit, toilet's just one of them.
dialog: Just ask the a-rabs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: It's like a chat show, this.
dialog: (looking into an imaginary
speaker_heading: CAMERA)
dialog: It's been said of my next guest, by
dialog: Jay the bandaged lunatic, that
text: she's `a sick-ass, whacked-out,
dialog: whacked-up asswipe'.
dialog: (to a PROSTITUTE)
dialog: Carmella, when did you first dream
dialog: of becoming a crack whore?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROSTITUTE
dialog: Mother died when I was six.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Oh G-d, I hate when that happens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROSTITUTE
dialog: My father raped me when I was
dialog: twelve.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Sounds like you had six relatively
dialog: good years.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: What do you do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I model riding boots, I spend
dialog: money, I sleep with women. But I
dialog: have weekends off and I am my own

speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Really, Elverton - if a chap can't

speaker_heading: ARTHUR

speaker_heading: TITLES

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MANHATTAN- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A different, extremely flashy car zips through Central Park,
text: the back full of released crooks, the huge Chicago guy - his
text: name's MARTY - at the wheel.
dialog: 
text: The car passes A MALE JOGGER. It stops and backs up. Arthur
text: opens a door and beckons the jogger, offering champagne. The
text: jogger gets in. The car sets off again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR (O.S.)
dialog: Anyone know a good bar?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CLUB - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The car pulls up outside a very rough-looking dive club. Out
text: falls Arthur, laughing his head off, along with champagne

text: his crook friends, the jogger, TWO MIDDLE-AGED TOURISTS and A
text: DANCING MAN in a leotard twirling a big sign reading `CHEAP
scene_heading: APARTMENT RENTALS!'
dialog:

text: and a very attractive young woman, SOFIA. He produces A BIG
speaker_heading: ROCKET.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Stand back!
dialog:

dialog: (to his first customer)

speaker_heading: FIRST MAN

speaker_heading: ARTHUR

speaker_heading: ERICA'S FATHER

speaker_heading: CARMELLA
dialog: Whatever you want. But no

speaker_heading: ARTHUR

speaker_heading: ERICA'S FATHER
dialog: Is she now?

speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: It's terribly small.

speaker_heading: ERICA'S FATHER
dialog: You need to grow up, Arthur.

speaker_heading: ARTHUR

dialog: 
text: A `Bodyworlds' plastinated corpse is posed, swinging from a

speaker_heading: HOBSON

speaker_heading: NAOMI

speaker_heading: ARTHUR (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
dialog: What else? Um...tripped over in the
dialog: shower this morning. Head split
dialog: open, found a family of meerkats
dialog: hiding in there! Hated the thought
dialog: of the little lads being homeless
dialog: so I bricked up the remaining half

dialog: and Hobson glued my skull back

text: Still not listening.

speaker_heading: ARTHUR (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Amazing. Do you have any vodka?

speaker_heading: VIVIENNE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR

dialog: occasionally.

speaker_heading: VIVIENNE
dialog: Right, that's it for the chat. Time

speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Not after you ran him over in the

speaker_heading: VIVIENNE

speaker_heading: VIVIENNE

speaker_heading: ARTHUR

speaker_heading: VIVIENNE
dialog: A completely innocent error in

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIVIENNE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIVIENNE
dialog: Oh, give me strength! A Bach-

dialog: dancer called `Mystery'?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: That was just her stage name! To
dialog: give her more mystery when
text: she...waved her fanny around. Her
dialog: real name was...what was it again?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIVIENNE
dialog: Susan is 33 this year. Her egg
dialog: inventory has dropped by 23% since

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR

speaker_heading: VIVIENNE
dialog: No.

speaker_heading: HOBSON
dialog: No. Your father was a gentleman.

speaker_heading: HOBSON
dialog: Even by modern male standards

dialog: (points to the water)
dialog: ...turn this into a nice 1990

dialog: 
text: He sips the water as if it's wine. Lifts it to Jesus.

speaker_heading: ARTHUR (CONT'D)

text: Beneath it is a small information plaque.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
dialog: `Genuine Sword of the First
dialog: Crusade. Excavated Germany, 1972'.
dialog: 
text: He looks around, then reaches up and takes it off. It's VERY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus Fucking Christ!
speaker_heading: (TO JESUS)
dialog: Sorry. It's not like you shouted

speaker_heading: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
dialog: Feel the force, Luke.

dialog: Arthur!

speaker_heading: ARTHUR

dialog: 
text: Burt, unperturbed, takes the sword from Arthur.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Heck, this sword went through three

speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: You don't, um, have anything

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: You're the real Slim Shady? I knew

speaker_heading: BURT

text: Burt turns away to get a glass of water.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: You could switch to Judaism.
dialog: (glances up at the fan)
dialog: Bit warm in here. Do you mind if I
dialog: put the fan on?
dialog: 
text: Arthur turns the fan on a low setting. It rotates slowly, the
text: head going around with it. Burt turns away to pour more
text: water. Arthur grabs the moment to speed up the fan again,
text: until it's going fast enough and Jesus's head falls off.
text: Arthur catches it. Arthur gets behind Burt, out of sight
dialog: temporarily.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Anyway, Arthur. However I feel
dialog: about you, my daughter loves you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Yes, it's a problem, isn't it?
dialog: 
text: Arthur reaches out and, unseen by Burt, he reaches out of

speaker_heading: ARTHUR (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: You made love to a Moslem?
dialog: 38.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: No, sir, it was Prince Alois of
dialog: Lichtenstein and he made love to
dialog: me. The fact that it took three
text: bottles of poppers and a Jacuzzi
dialog: full of Krug to loosen me up
dialog: confirmed my heterosexuality.

speaker_heading: ARTHUR (CONT'D)

text: with delight and claps in appreciation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Do you have something with less

dialog: to re-cook it, just scrape off the
dialog: nouns and trim out all that

speaker_heading: ARTHUR

speaker_heading: SUSAN

speaker_heading: (LOOKING AROUND)
dialog: Who did all this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: The picnic fairies. Who liaised
dialog: with the flower fairies, the candle
dialog: fairies, the log fire fairies, the
dialog: hidden sound system fairies...
dialog: 
text: He lifts a silver platter lid to reveal a vast pizza.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
dialog: ...and the pizza fairies.
dialog: 
text: A crack of a twig from somewhere.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Did you take account of the heroin
dialog: fairies who hang here at night?
dialog: 
text: But there's nobody there. A cool breeze blows. Naomi shivers.
text: Arthur uses a remote to turn the log fire flames up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: It's nice to keep it simple like
dialog: this. I'm sick of Michelin-star
dialog: restaurants. All that embarrassing
dialog: crap with the specials.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Are you kidding? Where I normally
dialog: eat, the special's the one that
text: comes with a free toy.
dialog:

speaker_heading: ARTHUR

speaker_heading: ARTHUR

speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Oh my G-d, you're serious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What's the craziest thing you ever
dialog: told a tour party?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: I once said the Manhattan we were
dialog: in was actually a movie set built
dialog: for `You've got Mail', but that
dialog: after the film wrapped, everyone
dialog: moved to the set because there was
dialog: less crime.
dialog: 
text: A sudden, very loud, very out-of-date ring tone. Naomi takes
text: out a huge ancient Motorola phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAOMI (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes, dad? There's a small Tiffany
text: butter knife about two inches from

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: What are you gonna do? All those
dialog: years your folks tucked you in, did
dialog: their best to stop you from eating

dialog: one day, you're the one saying `No,
dialog: honey, it's bad for you! Go to
dialog: bed.' Weird, huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: (not relating at all)
dialog: Yeah. I hate that.
dialog: (looks at her phone)
dialog: Nice bit of kitsch. Where did you
dialog: find that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: AT&amp;T store in 1998.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: It's...You've had it twelve years?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: It's a fine phone. Battery life of
dialog: eleven seconds, which cuts the crap
text: right out of conversations.
dialog: 
text: Something weird is happening. The world wobbles imperceptibly
text: as the background drops away. She hasn't noticed yet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAOMI (CONT'D)
dialog: I can't believe these mofos who
dialog: gotta keep up with the latest
dialog: bullshit. CDs come along, so out
text: with the vinyl. Vinyl's back in,
dialog: out with the CDs. I just kept the
dialog: vinyl. Way cheaper, and I get to be
dialog: incredibly hip once every 20
dialog: years....

speaker_heading: NAOMI (CONT'D)

text: Cutting wide, we see that the picnic was taking place on a
text: grass covered platform with a tree planted in it - which is
text: being lifted off the ground by a crane!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I couldn't decide between picnic in
text: the park and dinner with a view. So
dialog: it's a picnic in the sky! Isn't it
dialog: ace?
dialog: 
text: The whole thing is rising higher and higher and higher.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: No it is not ace, you crazy English

speaker_heading: ARTHUR

dialog: 
text: Naomi bursts out laughing. She sips champagne.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAOMI

speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: So anyway. The tours...

speaker_heading: NAOMI
speaker_heading: (CALMING HERSELF)

dialog: who failed to recognise my writing
dialog: genius first time round.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What did you write?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: A kids' book. I sent a chapter to a
dialog: childrens' publisher. Sunshine

speaker_heading: NAOMI (CONT'D)
dialog: This isn't funny, you lunatic.
dialog: 
text: The junkie stuffs his face with food, swigs champagne from

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR AND NAOMI
speaker_heading: NOOOO!
dialog: 
text: The junkie's walking towards the edge, oblivious! Arthur
text: jumps up, causing the platform to wobble scarily. He grabs
text: the junkie's arm. The junkie swipes, cutting Arthur's hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: OWWW! You don't understand! We're
text: 180 feet up in the sky!

speaker_heading: JUNKIE
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: No, we're not high! Well we are,
dialog: but only in the literal sense.
dialog: 
text: The junkie hurries away again. He's about to walk off the

text: struggle, the platform rocking badly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO NAOMI)
dialog: Hit the panic button! It's next to
dialog: the truffle station!
dialog: 
text: Naomi's panicking, searching desperately. Arthur and the

speaker_heading: ARTHUR (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: I can't find it. Over here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: No! That's the bouquet of world
dialog: hams!
dialog: 
text: Naomi finds the truffle station and hits the panic button.
text: Down in a Crane Cab an alarm goes off. The driver starts to

dialog: 
text: Naomi tries to help Arthur as he struggles with the junkie,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Why would you do that? You'd never

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIVIENNE
dialog: No. But you'd spend the rest of

dialog: Snart. There's a 99 cent cereal.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)

dialog: know I could still be with Naomi if
dialog: I had the guts.

speaker_heading: HOBSON

speaker_heading: (BEAT)

dialog: 79.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: You must be the nanny.

speaker_heading: HOBSON

speaker_heading: HOBSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Please stop this, I can't inhale

dialog: of your knuckles.
dialog: 
text: Ralph releases her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOBSON (CONT'D)
dialog: If you and your undershirt would

dialog: this dwelling.
dialog: 
text: Naomi appears, looking more of a writer than a tour guide.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Well, well.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Ever since I met Arthur I liked
dialog: him. We have to make sure these two
dialog: wonderful kids stay together...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOBSON
dialog: Try not to talk. It's not your
dialog: words but the breath which bears
dialog: them. Perhaps you could repair to
dialog: the East Wing and make me a cup of
dialog: tea? I wish to speak to Naomi.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Sure, sure.
dialog: 
text: Ralph leaves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOBSON
text: Arthur is having a pre-wedding
dialog: party tonight. You should come.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Oh, should I? Are all the other
dialog: girls he passed up going too?
dialog: 
text: Hobson picks up a letter from Rainbow Press and peruses it.
dialog: 80.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOBSON
dialog: Don't you want to show Arthur how
dialog: well you're doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Tell him thanks, but I have a
dialog: deadline.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOBSON
dialog: Arthur doesn't know I'm here. He's
dialog: far too decent to be involved in
dialog: something so tawdry. You could
dialog: bring your father. A magical
dialog: experience before he's too big to
dialog: leave this apartment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAOMI
speaker_heading: (DISBELIEF)
dialog: Why would I go to this? Why would I
dialog: do that to myself?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOBSON
dialog: My dear, if there's one thing old
dialog: women can tell, it's young men in
dialog: love. And the food promises to be
text: breathtakingly free.
dialog: 
text: Hobson has a slight dizzy spell and sits down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Are you alright?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOBSON
dialog: Better than you, dear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: You really look out for Arthur,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOBSON
dialog: Yes. And it is a job that I
dialog: recommend highly.
dialog: 
text: Ralph comes back and with a cup of disgusting-looking tea.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOBSON (CONT'D)
dialog: You really look out for this

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Ah, what am I gonna do? The no-kill
dialog: pet shelter won't take him.
dialog: 
text: Ralph hands Hobson the cup of tea.
dialog: 81.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOBSON
dialog: Thank you. Would you go the
dialog: bathroom and commence washing? You
dialog: only have three hours and it could
dialog: be quite a project.
dialog: 
text: Ralph goes. Naomi takes the tea.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: I appreciate what you're trying to

speaker_heading: HOBSON
dialog: Suit yourself.

text: Hobson gets up, still dizzy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Have you seen a doctor?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOBSON
dialog: Yes. And he has seen me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: I think Arthur has a very good
dialog: friend. May I kiss you on the
dialog: cheek?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOBSON
dialog: Is it something you feel strongly
dialog: about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Yes.

dialog: values I have always upheld both in
dialog: my business and spiritual life. But

speaker_heading: NAOMI

speaker_heading: ARTHUR

speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Arthur. Please. Can you just call

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: You're a cab.

speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What were you like as a kid?

speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Nuts. I thought the moon followed

dialog: thought it meant something special
dialog: would happen. So I've been waiting.

speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Dance?

speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Arthur. We've been through this.

speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: What is going on here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIVIENNE
dialog: My son became fond of you. You're
dialog: not the first. Or the last, I

dialog: monthly expenses - which always
dialog: makes for entertaining reading, all
dialog: those gifts for all those girls -
dialog: and found he'd bought an entire
dialog: publishing company called...what
dialog: was it now? Rainbow Press.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: You bought Rainbow press? So you
dialog: could tell them to publish my book?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIVIENNE
dialog: He knows people, dear. I'm sure you
dialog: do too, though the people you know
dialog: tend not to own books, let alone

speaker_heading: NAOMI
speaker_heading: (GASPS)

speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Huh?

speaker_heading: ARTHUR

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: HER? You're..a...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Lesbian. Yes. You may have noticed

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: But...why do you want to marry...
dialog: 
text: Arthur glances across, sees Erica skulking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
dialog: Hang on. Am I your beard?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSAN

dialog: 
text: The hateful silence that only 500 angry rich people can

speaker_heading: BURT

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSAN

speaker_heading: ARTHUR

speaker_heading: NAOMI

speaker_heading: VIVIENNE (CONT'D)
dialog: A Bach-Templemead has never been
dialog: poor and we're not about to try
dialog: that experiment with you, Arthur.
dialog: That said, you've shown strength of
dialog: character for once, instead of
text: blubbing on about frogs and
dialog: friendship. The inheritance is
dialog: yours. All I ask is, with Hobson
dialog: gone, you finally start treating me
text: like a mother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Sorry, Vivienne. I can't do that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIVIENNE
dialog: I beg your pardon?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR

speaker_heading: VIVIENNE
