speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: There's an old joke. Uh, two elderly
dialog: women are at a Catskills mountain
dialog: resort, and one of 'em says: "Boy, the
dialog: food at this place is really terrible."
dialog: The other one says, "Yeah, I know, and
dialog: such ... small portions." Well, that's
dialog: essentially how I feel about life. Full
dialog: of loneliness and misery and suffering
text: and unhappiness, and it's all over much
dialog: too quickly. The-the other important
dialog: joke for me is one that's, uh, usually
dialog: attributed to Groucho Marx, but I think
text: it appears originally in Freud's wit and
dialog: its relation to the unconscious. And it
dialog: goes like this-I'm paraphrasing: Uh ...
dialog: "I would never wanna belong to any club
dialog: that would have someone like me for a
dialog: member." That's the key joke of my adult
dialog: life in terms of my relationships with
dialog: women. Tsch, you know, lately the
dialog: strangest things have been going
dialog: through my mind, 'cause I turned forty,
dialog: tsch, and I guess I'm going through a
dialog: life crisis or something, I don't know.
dialog: I, uh ... and I'm not worried about aging.
dialog: I'm not one o' those characters, you know.
dialog: Although I'm balding slightly on top, that's
dialog: about the worst you can say about me. I,
dialog: uh, I think I'm gonna get better as I get
dialog: older, you know? I think I'm gonna be the-
dialog: the balding virile type, you know, as
dialog: opposed to say the, uh, distinguished
dialog: gray, for instance, you know? 'Less I'm
dialog: neither o' those two. Unless I'm one o'
text: those guys with saliva dribbling out of
text: his mouth who wanders into a cafeteria
text: with a shopping bag screaming about
dialog: socialism.
dialog: (Sighing)
dialog: Annie and I broke up and I-I still can't
dialog: get my mind around that. You know, I-I
dialog: keep sifting the pieces of the relationship
dialog: through my mind and-and examining my life
dialog: and tryin' to figure out where did the
dialog: screw-up come, you know, and a year ago we
dialog: were... tsch, in love. You know, and-and-and
dialog: ... And it's funny, I'm not-I'm not a
dialog: morose type. I'm not a depressive character.
dialog: I-I-I, uh,
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: you know, I was a reasonably happy kid,
dialog: I guess. I was brought up in Brooklyn
dialog: during World War II.

dialog: We saw the Fellini film last Tuesday.

dialog: Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?

speaker_heading: MAN IN LINE
dialog: (Even louder now)
dialog: It's the influence of television. Yeah,

dialog: to a ...

speaker_heading: MAN IN LINE

speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Sighing and addressing the audience)
dialog: What do you do when you get stuck in a movie

dialog: it's just maddening!
text: The man in line moves toward Alvy. Both address the audience now.
speaker_heading: MAN IN LINE
dialog: Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion?
dialog: It's a free country!
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta
dialog: give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed
dialog: to pontificate like that? And-and the funny
dialog: part of it is, M-Marshall McLuhan, you don't
dialog: know anything about Marshall McLuhan's...work!
speaker_heading: MAN IN LINE
dialog: (Overlapping)
dialog: Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to
dialog: teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media

speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Oh, do yuh?
speaker_heading: MAN IN LINE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Well, that's funny, because I happen to

dialog: here, just let me-I mean, all right. Come
dialog: over here ... a second.
text: Alvy gestures to the camera which follows him and the man in line to the back

dialog: (To McLuban)
dialog: Tell him.

text: Allison wears a large "ADLAI" button, as do the people around her. The sounds
text: of a comedian on the stage of the auditorium can be heard, occasionally,

text: stops to talk to two women; they, too, wear "ADLAI" buttons.
speaker_heading: ALLISON

dialog: Ma'am, you're on right after this man ...
dialog: about twenty minutes, something like that.
speaker_heading: WOMAN

speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: (Looking down at the clipboard)
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Alvy ... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh ... you're
dialog: on next.
speaker_heading: ALVY
text: (Rubbing his hands together

dialog: What do you mean, next?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: Uh ... I mean you're on right after
dialog: this act.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Gesturing)
dialog: No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: So what are you telling me, you're
dialog: putting on two comics in a row?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: ALVY

dialog: Will you relax, please? They're gonna
dialog: love you, I know.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Overlapping)
dialog: I prefer not to, because ... look,

speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: (Overlapping)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Overlapping)
dialog: -that I've got to ... ah ... ah ...
dialog: They're gonna laugh at him for a couple
dialog: minutes, then I gotta go out there, I
dialog: gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can
dialog: they laugh?
dialog: (Off screen)
dialog: They-they they're laughed out.
speaker_heading: ALLISON

dialog: Do you feel all right?
text: As Allison and Alvy look out at the stage, the camera cuts to their point of
text: view: a comedian standing at a podium in front of huge waving pictures of Adlai
text: Stevenson. The audience, laughing and clapping, sits at round tables in
text: clusters around the room.
text: The camera moves back to Allison and Alvy watching the stage. Alvy is swinging

speaker_heading: COMEDIAN
dialog: (Off screen, onstage)
dialog: You know ...

speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Coughing)
dialog: Thank you. I-I don't know why they would

dialog: (He clears his throat)
dialog: Excuse me, I'm not essentially a political
dialog: comedian at all.
text: The audience starts to laugh.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: I ... interestingly had, uh, dated ...
dialog: a woman in the Eisenhower Administration
dialog: ... briefly ... and, uh, it was ironic to
dialog: me 'cause, uh . . . tsch . . . 'cause I
dialog: was trying to, u-u-uh, do to her what

dialog: for the last eight years.
text: The audience is with him, laughing, as Allison continues to watch offstage.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BEDROOM.
text: Allison and, Alvy are on the bed, kissing. There are books all over the room;
text: a fireplace, unlit, along one of the walls. Alvy suddenly breaks away and sits
text: on the edge of the bed. Allison looks at him.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with
dialog: this, because it-I can't get it off my
dialog: mind, Allison ... it's obsessing me!
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need
dialog: your attention.
text: Alvy gets up from the bed and starts walking restlessly around the room,
text: gesturing with his hands.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: It-but it-it ... doesn't make any sense.
text: He drove past the book depository and the
dialog: police said conclusively that it was an
dialog: exit wound. So-how is it possible for
text: Oswald to have fired from two angles at
dialog: once? It doesn't make sense.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Alvy.
text: Alvy, stopping for a moment at the fireplace mantel, sighs. He then snaps his
text: fingers and starts walking again.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: I'll tell you this! He was not marksman
dialog: enough to hit a moving target at that
dialog: range. But ...
dialog: (Clears his throat)
dialog: if there was a second assassin ... it-
dialog: That's it!
text: Alvy stops at the music stand with open sheet music on it as Allison gets up
text: from the bed and retrieves a pack of cigarettes from a bookshelf.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: We've been through this.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: If they-they recovered the shells from
dialog: that rifle.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
text: (Moving back to the bed and
dialog: lighting a cigarette)
dialog: Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying,
dialog: now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren
dialog: Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Well, why not?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Yeah, Earl Warren?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Moving toward the bed)
dialog: Hey ... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Lyndon Johnson?
speaker_heading: ALVY
text: (Propping one knee on the bed
dialog: and gesturing)
dialog: L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a
dialog: politician. You know the ethics those
dialog: guys have? It's like-uh, a notch
text: underneath child molester.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Nodding his head)
dialog: Tsch.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar
dialog: Hoover and oil companies and the
text: Pentagon and the men's-room attendant
dialog: at the White House?
text: Alvy touches Allison's shoulder, then gets up from the bed and starts walking
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: I-I-I-I would leave out the men's-room
dialog: attendant.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: You're using this conspiracy theory as
dialog: an excuse to avoid sex with me.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Oh, my God!
dialog: (Then, to the camera)
dialog: She's right! Why did I turn off Allison
dialog: Portchnik? She was-she was beautiful. She
dialog: was willing. She was real ... intelligent.
dialog: (Sighing)
dialog: Is it the old Groucho Marx joke? That-that
dialog: I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that
dialog: would have someone like me for a member?
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY
text: Alvy's and Annie's voices are heard over the wind-browned exterior of a beach
text: house in the Hamptons. As they continue to talk, the camera moves inside the
text: house. Alvy is picking up chairs, trying to get at the group of lobsters
text: crawling on the floor. Dishes are stacked up in a drying rack, and bags of
text: groceries sit on the counter. There's a table and chairs near the refrigerator.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Alvy, now don't panic. Please.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Look, I told you it was a ... mistake
dialog: to ever bring a live thing in the house.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Stop it! Don't ... don't do that! There.
dialog: 
text: The lobsters continue to crawl on the floor. Annie, bolding out a wooden
text: paddle, tries to shove them onto it.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Well, maybe we should just call the police.
dialog: Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for
dialog: God's sake.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: If they're only babies, then you pick
dialog: 'em up.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh, all right. All right! It's all
dialog: right. Here.
text: She drops the paddle and picks up one of the lobsters by the tail. Laughing,
text: she shoves it at Alvy who jerks backward, squeamishly.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Don't give it to me. Don't!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Hysterically)
dialog: Oooh! Here! Here!
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Pointing)
dialog: Look! Look, one crawled behind the
dialog: refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed
dialog: at night.
text: (They move over to the refrigerator;
text: Alvy moves as close to the wall as
text: possible as Annie, covering her mouth
text: and laughing hysterically, teasingly
text: dangles a lobster in front of him)
dialog: Will you get outta here with that thing?
dialog: Jesus!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Laughing, to the lobster)
dialog: Get him!
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: Talk to him. You speak shellfish!
text: (He moves over to the stove and
text: takes the lid of a large steamer
dialog: filled with boiling water)
dialog: Hey, look ... put it in the pot.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I
dialog: can't put a live thing in hot water.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Overlapping)
dialog: Gimme! Gimme! Let me do it! What-what's
dialog: he think we're gonna do, take him to the
dialog: movies?
text: Annie hands the lobster to Alvy as he takes it very carefully and drops it
text: gingerly into the pot and puts the cover back on.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Overlapping Alvy and making sounds)
dialog: Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now
dialog: he'll think-
dialog: (She screams)
dialog: Aaaah! Okay.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Overlapping Annie)
dialog: Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: All right. All right. All right.
text: She moves hurriedly across the kitchen and picks up another lobster. Smiling,
text: she places it on the counter as Alvy stands beside the refrigerator trying to
text: push it from the wall.
speaker_heading: ALVY
text: Annie, there's a big lobster behind
dialog: the refrigerator. I can't get it out.
dialog: This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a
dialog: little dish of butter sauce here with a
dialog: nutcracker, it will run out the other
dialog: side, you know what I mean?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Overlapping)
dialog: Yeah. I'm gonna get my ... I'm gonna
dialog: get my camera.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: You know, I-I think ... if I could pry
dialog: this door off ... We shoulda gotten steaks
dialog: 'cause they don't have legs. They don't
dialog: run around.
text: Annie rushes out of the room to get her camera as Alvy picks up the paddle.
text: Trying to get at the lobsters, he ends up knocking over dishes and hitting the
text: chandelier. Holding the paddle, he finally leans back against the sink.
text: Annie, standing in the doorway, starts taking pictures of him.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Great! Great!
dialog: (Screaming)
dialog: Goddammit!
dialog: (Screaming)
dialog: Ooooh! These are ... p-p-p-pick this

speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: All right! All right! All right! All
dialog: right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll
dialog: be wonderful ... Ooooh, lovely!
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Picking up the lobster Annie
dialog: placed on the counter earlier)
dialog: All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
text: Alvy drops the lobster back down on the counter, sticking out his tongue and
text: making a face.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Don't be a jerk. One more, Alvy, please,
dialog: one more picture.

text: lobster again as Annie takes
dialog: another picture)
dialog: Oh, oh, good, good!

dialog: Am I your first big romance?
speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: ALVY'S VOICE

speaker_heading: JERRY
text: Acting is like an exploration of the soul.
dialog: I-it's very religious. Uh, like, uh, a

speaker_heading: ALVY

dialog: Is he kidding with that crap?
speaker_heading: YOUNGER ANNIE
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: Oh, right. Right, yeah, I think I

speaker_heading: ALVY

speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Why are you so hostile?
speaker_heading: ALVY

dialog: points, and now ...
dialog: (Clears his throat)
dialog: they're ahead two points.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group
dialog: of pituitary cases trying to stuff the
dialog: ball through a hoop?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Looking at Robin)
dialog: What's fascinating is that it's physical.
dialog: You know, it's one thing about intellectuals,
dialog: they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant
dialog: and have no idea what's going on. But on the
dialog: other hand ...
dialog: (Clears his throat)
dialog: the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.

speaker_heading: ROBIN

speaker_heading: ALVY

speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient
dialog: out. Every time some group disagrees with

speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Don't you see? The rest of the country looks

speaker_heading: ROB

speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: No, no, no, no, you just ... just watch

speaker_heading: ALVY

speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Uh, narcolepsy.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So,
dialog: anyway, so ...
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: George, uh, went to the union, see, to

dialog: Anyway, so, so ...
dialog: (Laughing through the speech)
dialog: George is standing in line, oh, just a sec
dialog: ...uh, getting his free turkey, but the
dialog: thing is, he falls asleep and he never

dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: so, he's dead ...
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well,
dialog: terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I

speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower
text: in a public place.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: 'Cause I don't like to get naked in front

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: Oh, I see, I see.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: You know, I don't like to show my body

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
speaker_heading: ALVY

speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Clearing his throat)
dialog: Oh, thank you.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: Yeah, well ... you-She hates Jews. She
dialog: thinks that they just make money, but let

dialog: So, did you do shoot the photographs
dialog: in there or what?
speaker_heading: ANNIE

dialog: 
dialog: As do Alvy's: You are a great-looking girl
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Well, I-I-I would-I would like to take
text: a serious photography course soon.
text: Again, Annie's thoughts pop on: He probably thinks I'm a yo-yo
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Photography's interesting, 'cause, you
dialog: know, it's-it's a new art form, and a,
dialog: uh, a set of aesthetic criteria have
dialog: not emerged yet.
dialog: And Alvy's: I wonder what she looks like naked?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Aesthetic criteria? You mean, whether
dialog: it's, uh, good photo or not?
dialog: I'm not smart enough for him. Hang in there
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: The-the medium enters in as a condition
dialog: of the art form itself. That's-
dialog: I don't know what I'm saying-she senses I'm shallow
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Well, well, I ... to me-I ... I mean,
dialog: it's-it's-it's all instinctive, you
dialog: know. I mean, I just try to uh, feel
dialog: it, you know? I try to get a sense of
dialog: it and not think about it so much.
dialog: God, I hope he doesn't turn out to be a shmuck like the others
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Still, still we- You need a set of
dialog: aesthetic guide lines to put it in
dialog: social perspective, I think.
dialog: Christ, I sound like FM radio. Relax
text: They're quiet for a moment, holding wine glasses and sipping. The sounds of
text: distant traffic from the street can be heard on the terrace. Annie, laughing,
dialog: speaks first.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess-I
dialog: guess you must be sorta late, huh?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: You know, I gotta get there and begin
dialog: whining soon ... otherwise I- Hey ...

text: Bright light is focused on her; the rest of the club is in darkness. There

scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET-NIGHT.
text: Alvy and Annie walk quickly down the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't
dialog: sing.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad
dialog: restless.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh,
dialog: my God, I mean, they hated me.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: No, they didn't. You have a wonderful
dialog: voice.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: No, I'm gonna quit!
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: No, I'm not gonna letcha. You have a
dialog: great voice.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Really, do you think so, really?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Yeah!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: It's terrific.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Overlapping)
dialog: Yeah, you know something? I never even
dialog: took a lesson, either.
text: They stop in the middle of the sidewalk. Alvy turns Annie around to face him.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Hey, listen, listen.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Gimme a kiss.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna
dialog: go home later, right?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: And-and uh, there's gonna be all that
dialog: tension. You know, we never kissed before
dialog: and I'll never know when to make the right
dialog: move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll
dialog: get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh, all right.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: And we'll digest our food better.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah.
text: They kiss.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: So now we can digest our food.

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: We can digest our-
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Okay. Yeah.
scene_heading: INT. DELI-NIGHT
text: Annie and Alvy sit down in a booth. The deli is fairly well lit and crowded.
text: Conversation, plates clattering, can be heard over the dialogue. The waiter
text: comes over to them to take their order.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (To the waiter)
dialog: I'm gonna have a corned beef.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (To the waiter)
dialog: Yeah ... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a
dialog: pastrami on white bread with, uh,
text: mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.
text: (Alvy involuntarily makes a face
dialog: as the waiter leaves)
dialog: Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you
dialog: and, uh, were you depressed about that?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't
dialog: cure.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: My first... Yes, she was nice, but you
dialog: know, uh, it was my fault. I was just...
dialog: I was too crazy.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh.
scene_heading: INT. DARKENED BEDROOM-NIGHT
text: Alvy and Annie in bed together.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: As Balzac said ...
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: H'm?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: "There goes another novel."
dialog: (They laugh)
dialog: Jesus, you were great.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh, yeah?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: No.
text: (She turns and looks at Alvy,
dialog: then laughs)
dialog: You're a wreck.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play
text: the piano again.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Lighting a joint and laughing)
dialog: You're really nuts. I don't know, you
dialog: really thought it was good? Tell me.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Good? I was-
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Overlapping)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: No, that was the most fun I've ever
dialog: had without laughing.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: Here, you want some?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any
dialog: major hallucinogenics because I took
text: a puff like five years ago at a party and
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: -tried to take my pants off over my
dialog: head ...
dialog: (Annie laughs)
dialog: ... my ear.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I
dialog: don't do it very often, you know, just
dialog: sort of, er ... relaxes me at first.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: M'hm.
text: (He pushes himself up from the
text: bed and looks down at Annie)
dialog: You're not gonna believe this, but-
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: What? What?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BOOKSTORE-DAY
text: Annie and Alvy browsing in crowded bookstore. Alvy, carrying two books,
text: "Death and Western Thought" and "The Denial of Death", moves over to where
text: Annie is looking.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Hey?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: H'm?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I
dialog: think, because I-I think you should
dialog: read them. You know, instead of that
dialog: cat book.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Looking at the books Alvy
dialog: is bolding)
dialog: That's, uh ...
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: that's pretty serious stuff there.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm,
dialog: I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death,
dialog: I think. Big-
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Overlapping)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: -big subject with me, yeah.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah?
text: They move over to the cashier line.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Gesturing)
dialog: I've a very pessimistic view of life.
dialog: You should know this about me if we're
dialog: gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that
dialog: life is-is divided up into the horrible
dialog: and the miserable.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: M'hm.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Those are the two categories ...
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: M'hm.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: ... you know, they're- The-the horrible
dialog: would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal
dialog: cases, you know?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: M'hm.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: And blind people, crippled ...
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: I don't-don't know how they get through
dialog: life. It's amazing to me.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: M'hm.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: You know, and the miserable is everyone
dialog: else. That's-that's all. So-so when
dialog: you go through life you should be thankful
dialog: that you're miserable, because that's-
dialog: You're very lucky ... to be ...
dialog: (Overlapping Annie's laughter)
dialog: ... to be miserable.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: U-huh.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK-DAY
text: It's a beautiful sunny day in Central Park. People are sitting on benches,
text: others strolling, some walking dogs. One woman stands feeding cooing pigeons.
text: Alvy's and Annie's voices are heard off screen as they observe the scene before
text: them. An older man and woman walk into view.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Look, look at that guy.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: M'hm.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: There's-there's-there's-there's Mr.
dialog: When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there,
dialog: you know?
dialog: (Over Annie's laughter)
dialog: He's the latest! just came back from
dialog: the gin-rummy farm last night. He
dialog: placed third.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: M'hm. Yeah. Yeah.
text: The camera shows them sitting side by side relaxed on a bench.
speaker_heading: ALVY
text: (Watching two men approach, one
dialog: lighting a cigar)
dialog: Look at these guys.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Oh, that's hilarious. They're back
dialog: from Fire Island. They're ... they're
dialog: sort of giving it a chance-you know what
dialog: I mean?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh! Italian, right?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business
dialog: or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: Oh, yeah.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: No, I'm serious.

scene_heading: EXT. STREET-NIGHT
text: Alvy and Annie walk almost in silhouette along the dock, the New York City
text: skyline in the background. Alvy has his arm around Annie and they walk slowly.
text: No one else is around.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You see, like you and I ...
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: You are extremely sexy.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: No, I'm not.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are.
dialog: Because ... you know what you are?
dialog: You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Well, what does-what does that mean?
dialog: I don't know what that is.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Uh ... uh, you're-you're exceptional
dialog: in bed because you got -you get pleasure
dialog: in every part of your body when I touch you.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Ooooh!
text: They stop walking. Holding Annie's arms, Alvy turns her to face him. The
text: South Street Bridge, lit up for the night, is in the background.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: You know what I mean? Like the tip
dialog: o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth
dialog: or your kneecaps ... you get excited.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Come on.
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: Yeah. You know what? You know, I
dialog: like you, I really mean it. I really do
dialog: like you.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: You- Do you love me?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Do I love you?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: That's the key question.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: I know you've only known me a short
dialog: while.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Well, I certainly ... I think that's
dialog: very- Yeah, yeah ...
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: yeah. Do you love me?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word
dialog: for what...
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: - I ... I love you.
dialog: (Over Annie's laughter)
dialog: You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.
dialog: (Over Annie's laughter)
dialog: I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ALVY
text: (Putting his arms around her neck)
dialog: Don't you think I do?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I dunno.
text: They kiss as a foghorn sounds in the distance.
scene_heading: INT. ALVY'S APARTMENT
text: Alvy, somewhat distraught, is following Annie around his apartment, which is
text: filled with boxes and suitcases, clothes and framed pictures. They both carry
dialog: cartons.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give
dialog: up your own apartment, are you?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Putting down the carton)
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you,
dialog: that's why.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I have a tiny apartment.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Yeah, I know it's small.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: (Picking up the suitcases and
dialog: walking into the bedroom)
dialog: That's right, and it's got bad plumbing
dialog: and bugs.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Picking up some pictures and
dialog: following Annie into the bedroom)
dialog: All right, granted, it has bad plumbing
dialog: and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a
dialog: negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh,
dialog: entomology is a ...
text: (Annie, reacting, tosses the
text: suitcases and some loose clothing
text: onto the bed. She sits down on the
text: edge, looking away. Alvy walks in,
text: pictures and carton in band, still
dialog: talking)
text: ... rapidly growing field.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You don't want me to live with you?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: How- I don't want you to live with me?
dialog: How- Whose idea was it?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Mine.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Ye-ah. Was it ... It was yours actually,
dialog: but, uh, I approved it immediately.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I guess you think that I talked you into
dialog: something, huh?
dialog: (putting pictures on the mantel)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: No-what, what ...? I ... we live together,
dialog: we sleep together, we eat together. Jesus,
dialog: you don't want it to be like we're married,
dialog: do yuh?
text: He moves over to the carton of books on the window seat and reaches in. He
text: starts tossing books off screen.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Looking up at Alvy)
dialog: How is it any different?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Gesturing)
dialog: It's different 'cause you keep your own
dialog: apartment.
text: (Holding a book, he starts walking
dialog: around the room)
dialog: Because you know it's there, we don't
dialog: have to go to it, we don't have to deal
text: with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating
dialog: life raft ... that we know that we're not
dialog: married.
text: He tosses the book on the bed and walks back to the window seat.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Still sitting on the bed)
dialog: That little apartment is four hundred
dialog: dollars a month, Alvy.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Looking at Annie)
dialog: That place is four hundred dollars a month?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yes, it is.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Whistling)
dialog: It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus,
dialog: I'll-My accountant will write it off as a
dialog: tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Shaking her head)
dialog: You don't think I'm smart enough to be
dialog: serious about.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Hey, don't be ridiculous.
text: Alvy moves over to the bed and sits down next to Annie.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Then why are you always pushing me to take
dialog: those college courses like I was dumb or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: ALVY
text: (Putting his hand to his forehead)
dialog: 'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing.
dialog: You meet a lotta interesting professors.

scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - DAY
text: Annie and Alvy, in Annie's VW, driving to their summerhouse. The camera moves

dialog: background.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Annie, sitting cross-legged on a wooden chest in the bedroom, is browsing
text: through a school catalogue. Alvy lies in bed reading.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Reading)
dialog: Does this sound like a good course?
dialog: Uh, "Modern American Poetry"? Uh, or,
dialog: uh-let's see now ... maybe I should, uh,
dialog: take "Introduction to the Novel."
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Just don't take any course where they
dialog: make you read Beowulf.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: What?
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: Hey, listen, what-what do you think? Do
dialog: you think we should, uh, go to that-that
dialog: party in Southampton tonight?
text: Alvy leans over and kisses her shoulder.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: No, don't be silly. What-what do we need
dialog: other people for?
text: (He puts his arms around her neck,
text: kissing her, Annie making muffled
dialog: sounds)
dialog: You know, we should-we should just turn
dialog: out the lights, you know, and play hide
dialog: and seek or something.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get
dialog: a cigarette, okay?
speaker_heading: ALVY
text: (Yelling out to her as she leaves
dialog: the room)
dialog: Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that
dialog: it will make a white woman more like
dialog: Billie Holiday.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Off screen)
dialog: Well, have you ever made love high?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Me, no. You ... I-I-you know, if I
dialog: have grass or alcohol or anything I
dialog: get unbearably wonderful. I get too,
dialog: too wonderful for words. You know,
dialog: I don't-I don't know why you have to,
dialog: uh, get high every time we make love.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: (Moving back into the room and
dialog: lighting a joint)
dialog: It relaxes me.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Oh, you-you have to be artificially
dialog: relaxed before we can go to bed?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Closing the door)
dialog: Well, what's the difference, anyway?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium
dialog: pentothal. You can sleep through it.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've
dialog: been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.
text: (She gets into bed and takes a
dialog: puff of marijuana)
dialog: You should smoke some o' this. You'd be
text: off the couch in no time.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Oh, come, you don't need that.
text: Alvy, sitting down on the bed, moves over to Annie and takes the weed from her.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Kissing her)
dialog: No, no, no, what ... You can once, you
dialog: can live without it once. Come on.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.
dialog: (Laughing and making sounds)
dialog: M'mrnm.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: M'm, wait, I got a great idea.
text: (He gets up and goes over to the
text: closet, taking out a light bulb.
text: He goes back to the bed and turns
text: out the lamp on the night table)
dialog: Hang in there for a second. I got a
dialog: little-little artifact. A little erotic
dialog: artifact, that-that I brought up from the
dialog: city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.
text: (He turns the lamp back on, having
dialog: replaced the bulb with the red one
dialog: from the closet)
dialog: I just ... there ... There's a little Old
dialog: New Orleans ... essence. Now-now we can go
dialog: about our business here and we can even
dialog: develop photographs if we want to. There,
dialog: now there.
text: (He undresses and crawls into bed,
dialog: taking Annie in his arms)
dialog: M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Uh-uh-why?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: I don't know. You- It's like you're-
dialog: you're removed.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: No, I'm fine.
text: As Annie speaks, her inner self (ghostlike, moves up from the bed and) sits
text: down on a chair, watching.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: U-huh.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Let's just do it, all right?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Kissing and caressing Annie)
dialog: Is it my imagination or are you just
dialog: going through the motions?
speaker_heading: ANNIE'S SPIRIT
dialog: Alvy, do you remember where I put my
dialog: drawing pad? Because while you two are
dialog: doing that, I think I'm gonna do some
dialog: drawing.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Reacting)
dialog: You see, that's what I call removed.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh, you have my body.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Yeah, but that's not-that's no good.
dialog: I want the whole thing.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Sighing)
dialog: Well, I need grass and so do you.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass
dialog: (Clearing his throat)
dialog: because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Overlapping)
dialog: M'hm.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Overlapping)
dialog: -so if I get a laugh from a person who's
dialog: high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause
dialog: they're always laughin'.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Were you always funny?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Hey, what is this-an interview? We're
text: supposed to be making love.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE.
text: A typical old-fashioned theatrical agency in a Broadway office building.
text: Autographed 8 X 12 is plastered in the sloppy room. The agent, chewing a

text: stands with his hands in his pockets. A young Alvy sits stiffly in a chair
text: nearby watching.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: This guy is naturally funny. I think
dialog: he can write for you.
speaker_heading: COMIC
dialog: (Buttoning his jacket)
dialog: Yeah, yeah. Hey, kid, he tells me you're
dialog: really good. Well, lemme explain a little
dialog: bit o' how I work. You know, you can tell
dialog: right off the bat that I don't look like
dialog: a funny guy when I come-you know, like some
dialog: o' the guys that come out. You know, right
dialog: away
dialog: (Gesturing)
dialog: they're gonna tell yuh their stories, you're
dialog: gonna fall down, but I gotta be really
dialog: talented. Material's gotta be sensational
dialog: for me 'cause I work, you know, with very,
dialog: very ... Come on, I'm kinda classy, you
dialog: know what I mean? Uh ... uh ... lemme
dialog: explain. For instance, I open with an
text: opening song. A musical start like
dialog: (Ad-lib singing)
dialog: and I walk out
dialog: (Ad-lib singing)
dialog: "Place looks wonderful from here and
dialog: you folks look wonderful from here!
dialog: (Singing)
dialog: "And seein' you there
dialog: With a smile on your face
dialog: Makes me shout
dialog: This must be the place."
text: Then I stop right in the middle and then
dialog: I open with some jokes. Now, that's where
dialog: I need you, right there. For instance, like
dialog: I say, "Hey, I just got back from Canada,
dialog: you know, they speak a lotta French up
dialog: there. The only way to remember Jeanne
dialog: d'Arc means the light's out in the bathroom!"
text: (He laughs. Seated Alvy looks
dialog: up smiling)
dialog: "Oh, I met a big lumberjack ..."
speaker_heading: ALVY'S VOICE
dialog: (To himself)
dialog: Jesus, this guy's pathetic.
speaker_heading: COMIC
dialog: (Overlapping above speech)
dialog: ... big lumberjack ...
speaker_heading: ALVY'S VOICE
dialog: (To himself while the comic
dialog: continues his routine)
text: Look at him mincing around, like he
dialog: thinks he's real cute. You wanna throw
dialog: up. If only I had the nerve to do my
dialog: own jokes. I don't know how much longer
text: I can keep this smile frozen on my face.
dialog: I'm in the wrong business, I know it.
speaker_heading: COMIC
dialog: (Overlapping above speech)
dialog: "'Cherie, come back. I love you.
dialog: (Shaking his lips and mimicking)
dialog: But, uh, Cheri, what will I do with this,
dialog: uh?' He says, 'Aw, Marie, sometime you
dialog: make me so mad."'
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: Oh, they scream at that. Now, write me
dialog: somethin' like that, will yuh? Kinda
dialog: French number, can yuh do it? Huh, kid?
scene_heading: INT. THEATER - NIGHT
text: The darkened auditorium is filled with college students applauding and cheering,

dialog: I'm tense and ... uh, when I'm playin' a
dialog: col- I've a very bad history with colleges.
dialog: You know, I went to New York University and,
dialog: uh, tsch, I was thrown out of NYU my freshman
dialog: year ... for cheating on my metaphysics final.
dialog: You know, I looked within the soul of the

dialog: -and when I was thrown out, my mother,
text: who's an emotionally high-strung woman,

dialog: overdose of mah-jongg tiles.
dialog: (More applause and laughter)
dialog: And, uh, tsch, I was depressed. I was ...
dialog: in analysis, I-I, uh, was suicidal; as a
dialog: matter of fact, uh, I would have killed

text: Students mill around Alvy banding him pens and paper for autographs.
text: Annie is next to him, talking over the chattering fans.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Alvy, you were ... Alvy, you were just
dialog: great, I'm not kidding. It was- You
dialog: were so neat.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah. Yeah. And you know something?
dialog: I think that I'm starting to get more
dialog: of your references, too.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Are yuh?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Well, the twelve o'clock show is
text: completely different than the nine.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: (Interrupting)
dialog: May I have your autograph?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Over lapping above speech)
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (To Annie, while autographing)
dialog: You're so sure about it.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to
dialog: tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that
dialog: it'll be really nice to meet Mother and
dialog: Father.
text: They start moving toward the exit, a girl snapping a picture of Alvy with a
text: flash camera as they walk through the crowd.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately.
dialog: (To one of his fans)
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: No, I don't think so. No, I don't think
dialog: they're gonna hate you at all. On the
dialog: contrary, I think-
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice
dialog: dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think
dialog: they're gonna really like you.
scene_heading: EXT. ANNIE'S PARENTS' HOME-DAY
text: The camera shows a neat two-story house surrounded by a well-manicured green
text: lawn, then cuts to:
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM.
text: Alvy and the Halls are eating Easter dinner. The sun is pouring through a big
text: picture window, shining on a large, elegantly laid out table. Alvy sits, at one
text: end,- rubbing his nose and chewing, the Halls flanking him on either side: Mr.
text: and Mrs. Hall, Grammy, and Annie's brother, Duane.
speaker_heading: MOM HALL
dialog: (Holding her wine glass)
dialog: It's a nice ham this year, Mom.
text: Grammy Hall takes a sip of her wine and nods.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Smiling at Duane)
dialog: Oh, yeah. Grammy always does such
dialog: a good job.
speaker_heading: DAD HALL
dialog: (Chewing)
dialog: A great sauce.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: It is.
dialog: (Smacking his lips)
dialog: It's dynamite ham.
text: Grammy Hall stares down the table at Alvy; a look of utter dislike. Alvy tries
dialog: not to notice.
speaker_heading: MOM HALL
dialog: (To Dad Hall, smoothing her hair)
dialog: We went over to the swap meet. Annie,
dialog: Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: We really had a good time.
text: Grammy continues to stare at Alvy; he is now dressed in the long black coat and
text: hat of the Orthodox Jew, complete with mustache and heard.
speaker_heading: MOM HALL
dialog: (Lighting a cigarette and turning
dialog: to Alvy)
dialog: Ann tells us that you've been seeing a
dialog: psychiatrist for fifteen years.
speaker_heading: ALVY
text: (Setting down his glass and coughing)
dialog: Yes. I'm making excellent progress.
text: Pretty soon when I lie down on his couch,
dialog: I won't have to wear the lobster bib.
text: Mom Hall reacts by sipping from her glass and frowning. Grammy continues to
dialog: stare.
speaker_heading: DAD HALL
dialog: Duane and I went out to the boat basin.
speaker_heading: DUANE
dialog: We were caulkin' holes all day.
speaker_heading: DAD HALL
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: Randolph Hunt was drunk, as usual.
speaker_heading: MOM HALL
dialog: Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember
dialog: Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir
dialog: with you.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh, yes, yes.
text: Alvy, leaning his elbow on the table, looks out toward the camera.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (To the audience)
dialog: I can't believe this family.
dialog: (Making chewing sounds)
dialog: Annie's mother. She really's beautiful.
dialog: And they're talkin' swap meets and boat
text: basins, and the old lady at the end of
dialog: the table
dialog: (Pointing to Grammy)
dialog: is a classic Jew hater. And, uh, they,
dialog: they realty look American, you know,
dialog: very healthy and ... like they never
dialog: get sick or anything. Nothing like my
dialog: family. You know, the two are like oil
dialog: and water.
text: The screen splits in half - on the right is Alvy's family - his mother, father,
text: aunt and uncle-busily eating at the crowded kitchen table. They eat quickly
text: and interrupt one another loudly. On the left the Halls in their dining room.
text: Both dialogues overlap, juxtaposed.
speaker_heading: ALVY'S FATHER
dialog: Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his
dialog: business?!
speaker_heading: ALVY'S MOTHER
dialog: His wife has diabetes!
speaker_heading: ALVY'S FATHER
dialog: Di-diabetes? Is that any excuse?
dialog: Diabetes?
speaker_heading: ALVY'S UNCLE
text: The man is fifty years old and doesn't
dialog: have a substantial job.
speaker_heading: ALVY'S AUNT
dialog: (Putting more meat on her
dialog: husband's plate)
dialog: Is that a reason to steal from his father?
speaker_heading: ALVY'S UNCLE
dialog: Whatta you talkin' about? You don't
dialog: know what you're talking about.
speaker_heading: ALVY'S AUNT
dialog: Yes, I know what I'm talking about.
speaker_heading: ALVY'S MOTHER
dialog: (Interrupting)
dialog: George, defend him!
speaker_heading: ALVY'S UNCLE
dialog: (Over Alvy's father's muttering)
dialog: No Moskowitz he had a coronary.
speaker_heading: ALVY'S AUNT
dialog: You don't say.
speaker_heading: ALVY'S MOTHER
dialog: We fast.
speaker_heading: MOM HALL
dialog: Stupid Thelma Poindexter ... to the
dialog: Veterans Hospital.
speaker_heading: DAD HALL
dialog: My God, he's the new president of the
dialog: El Regis. Let me tell you, the man is
dialog: somethin' else.
speaker_heading: MOM HALL
dialog: That's Jack's wife. We used to make
dialog: that outta raisins.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see
dialog: the new play?
speaker_heading: MOM HALL
dialog: Oh, you remember her, Annie.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yes, I do.
text: The two families start talking back and forth to one another. The screen is
dialog: still split.
speaker_heading: MOM HALL
dialog: How do you plan to spend the holidays,
dialog: Mrs. Singer?
speaker_heading: DAD HALL
dialog: Fast?
speaker_heading: ALVY'S FATHER
dialog: Yeah, no food. You know, we have to
dialog: atone for our sins.
speaker_heading: MOM HALL
dialog: What sins? I don't understand.
speaker_heading: ALVY'S FATHER
dialog: Tell you the truth, neither do we.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DUANE'S BEDROOM-NIGHT
text: Duane, sitting on his bed, sees Alvy walking past the open door.
speaker_heading: DUANE
dialog: Alvy.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Walking in)
dialog: Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
speaker_heading: DUANE
dialog: This is my room.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Looking around)
dialog: Oh, yeah?
dialog: (He clears his throat)
dialog: Terrific.
speaker_heading: DUANE
dialog: Can I confess something?
text: Alvy sighs and sits down, leaning his arm on Duane's dresser. Duane's face is
text: big lighted by a single lamp.
speaker_heading: DUANE
dialog: I tell you this because, as an artist,
dialog: I think you'll understand. Sometimes
dialog: when I'm driving ... on the road at night
text: ... I see two headlights coming toward me.
dialog: Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn
text: the wheel quickly, head-on into the
dialog: oncoming car. I can anticipate the
text: explosion. The sound of shattering glass.
text: The ... flames rising out of the flowing
dialog: gasoline.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Reacting and clearing his throat)
dialog: Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have
dialog: t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due
text: back on the planet earth.
text: He slowly gets up and moves toward the door.
scene_heading: INT. THE HALLS' LIVING ROOM.
text: Mom and Dad Hall walk into the living room; Annie is with them.
speaker_heading: MOM HALL
dialog: Now, don't let it be so long, now.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DAD HALL
dialog: And look up Uncle Bill, you promise.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Okay. Okay.
speaker_heading: MOM HALL
dialog: Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You think so? Do you really?
speaker_heading: MOM HALL
dialog: We're going to take them to the airport.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD HALL
dialog: Oh, no-Duane can. I haven't finished
dialog: my drink.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yes, Duane is. I'll be right-
speaker_heading: MOM HALL
dialog: M'mmm.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I just have time to get the, uh-
text: She walks out of the room as Mom and Dad Hall kiss.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
text: Duane, behind the wheel, stares straight ahead. It is raining very hard, the
text: windshield wipers are moving quickly. The headlights of another car brightens
text: the interior of Duane's car as the camera shows first Duane, then Annie, then
text: Alvy tensely staring straight ahead.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET- DAY
text: The camera bolds on a quiet New York City street; the buildings, brownstones.
text: It's a warm day-people sit on front stoops, window boxes are planted. Annie
text: walks into the frame first, then Alvy, who is walking to her right. They walk
text: quickly, side by side, their voices heard before they move into the frame.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Off screen)
dialog: You followed me. I can't believe it!
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Off screen)
dialog: I didn't follow you!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You followed me!
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Why? 'Cause I ... was walkin' along
dialog: a block behind you staring at you?
dialog: That's not following!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Well, what is your definition of
dialog: following?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Gasping)
dialog: Following is different. I was spying.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Do you realize how paranoid you are?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You
dialog: got your arms around another guy.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: That is the worst kind of paranoia.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying.
dialog: I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you
text: up after school.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the
dialog: relationship flexible, remember?
dialog: It's your phrase.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Oh, stop it. But you were having an
dialog: affair with your college professor.
dialog: That jerk that teaches that incredible
dialog: crap course "Contemporary Crisis in
dialog: Western Man"!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: "Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"!
dialog: You're really close.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: What's the difference? It's all mental
dialog: masturbation.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Stopping for a moment)
dialog: Oh, well, now we're finally getting to
dialog: a subject you know something about!
text: She walks away.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Catching up to her)
dialog: Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's
dialog: sex with someone I love.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Continuing to walk quickly)
dialog: We're not having an affair. He's married.
dialog: He just happens to think I'm neat.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Still walking next to her)
dialog: "Neat"! There's that- What are you-twelve
dialog: years old? That's one o' your Chippewa
dialog: Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Who cares? Who cares?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Next thing you know he'll find you keen
dialog: and peachy, you know? Next thing you
dialog: know he's got his hand on your ass!
text: They both stop in the middle of the street.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You've always had hostility toward
dialog: David ever since I mentioned him!
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: David? You call your teacher David?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: It's his name.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's
dialog: a biblical name. Right? W-What does
dialog: he call you? Bathsheba?
text: He walks away.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Calling after him)
dialog: Alvy! Alvy! You're the one who never
dialog: wanted to make a real commitment. You
dialog: don't think I'm smart enough! We had
dialog: that argument just last month, or don't
dialog: ou remember that day?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN.
text: Alvy is at the sink washing dishes as the screen cuts to the scene of last
text: month's argument. Annie's voice is heard.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Off screen)
dialog: I'm home!
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Turning)
dialog: Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Comes into the kitchen and puts
text: down a bag of groceries on the
dialog: kitchen table)
dialog: Oh, it was ...
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: And I didn't have to lie down on the couch,
dialog: Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her
dialog: about-about the-the family and about my
dialog: feelings toward men and about my
dialog: relationship with my brother.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: M'm.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: And then she mentioned penis envy ...
dialog: Did you know about that?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who
dialog: suffers from that, so, so ... you know.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: M'hm.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: G-go on, I'm interested.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Well, she said that I was very guilty
dialog: about my impulses toward marriage,
dialog: and-and children.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: M'hm.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: And then I remembered when I was a kid
dialog: how I accidentally saw my parents making
dialog: love.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the
dialog: first hour?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: M'hm.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: That's amazing. I-I-I ... I've been
dialog: goin' for fifteen years, I-you know,
dialog: I don't got ... nothing like that in-
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: You cried? I've never once cried.
dialog: Fantastic ...
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Taking groceries from the bag)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: In-in ... Alvy, in my dream Frank
text: Sinatra is holding his pillow across
text: my face and I can't breathe.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Sinatra?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah, and he's strangling me ...
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: ... and I keep, you know, it's-
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Taking a bottle of juice and
dialog: some celery from the bag)
dialog: Well, well, sure ... because he's a
dialog: singer and you're a singer, you know,
dialog: so it's perfect. So you're trying to
dialog: suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect
dialog: sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic
dialog: ... kind of insight.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Pointing her finger at Alvy)
dialog: She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Turning to Annie)
dialog: Whatta you mean? Me?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the
dialog: dream ... I break Sinatra's glasses.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Putting his band to his mouth)
dialog: Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra
dialog: had glasses. So whatta you saying that
dialog: I-I'm suffocating you?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: (Turning, ajar in her hand)
dialog: Oh, and God, Alvy, I did ... this really
dialog: terrible thing to him. Because then when
dialog: he sang it was in this real high-pitched
dialog: voice.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Thinking)
dialog: Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Putting away some groceries)
dialog: Well, she said that I should probably
dialog: come five times a week. And you know
dialog: something? I don't think I mind analysis
dialog: at all. The only question is, Will it
dialog: change my wife?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Will it change your wife?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Will it change my life?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Yeah, but you said, "Will it change
dialog: my wife"!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: No, I didn't.
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: You said, "Will it change. . ." Wife.
dialog: Will it change ...
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Yelling out, angry)
dialog: Life. I said, "life."
text: Alvy turns toward the camera.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (To the audience)
dialog: She said, "Will it change my wife." You
dialog: heard that because you were there so I'm
dialog: not crazy.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: And, Alvy ... and then I told her about
dialog: how I didn't think you'd ever really take
dialog: me seriously, because you don't think that
dialog: I'm smart enough.
text: She walks out of the room.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (To Annie's back, gesturing)
dialog: Why do you always bring that up? Because
dialog: I encourage you to take adult-education
dialog: courses? I think it's a wonderful thing.
dialog: You meet wonderful, interesting professors'.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: Annie stands at the open door of a cab, Alvy next to her gesturing as people
text: and cars move by.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Adult education is such junk! The
dialog: professors are so phony. How can you
dialog: do it?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: A bit rapidly. I don't care what you
dialog: say about David, he's a perfectly fine
dialog: teacher!
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Interrupting)
dialog: David! David! I can't believe this!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: And what are you doing following me
dialog: around for, anyway?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: I'm following you and David, if you-
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Interrupting)
dialog: I just think we oughta call this
dialog: relationship quits!
text: Annie gets into the cab; Alvy leans over and closes the door.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: That's fine. That's fine. That's great!
text: (He turns toward the camera as the
dialog: cab drives away)
dialog: Well, I don't know what I did wrong.
dialog: (Gesturing)
dialog: I mean, I can't believe this. Somewhere
dialog: she cooled off to me!
text: (He walks up to an older woman
text: walking down the street carrying
dialog: groceries)
dialog: Is it-is it something that I did?
text: WOMAN ON THE STREET
dialog: Never something you do. That's how
text: people are. Love fades.
text: She moves on down the street.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Scratching his head)
dialog: Love fades. God, that's a depressing
dialog: thought. Have to ask you a question.
text: (He stops another passer-by,a man)
dialog: Don't go any further. Now, with your
dialog: wife in bed, d-d-does she need some kind
dialog: o' artificial stimulation like-like marijuana?
text: MAN ON THE STREET
text: We use a large vibrating egg.
text: He walks on.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Continuing to walk)
dialog: Large vibrating egg. Well, I ask a
dialog: psychopath, I get that kind of an answer.
dialog: Jesus, I-I, uh, here ...
text: (He moves up the sidewalk to
text: a young trendy-looking couple,
dialog: arms wrapped around each other)
dialog: You-you look like a really happy couple.
dialog: Uh, uh ... are you?
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Yeah! So ... so h-h-how do you account
dialog: for it?
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Uh, I'm very shallow and empty and I
dialog: have no ideas and nothing interesting
dialog: to say.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: And I'm exactly the same way.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: I see. Well, that's very interesting.
dialog: So you've managed to work out something, huh?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Oh, well, thanks very much for talking
dialog: to me.
text: He continues to walk past some other passersby and moves into the street. A
text: mounted policeman comes by and stops near him. Alvy looks at the horse, as if
dialog: to speak.
scene_heading: ALVY'S VOICE-OVER
dialog: You know, even as a kid I always went
dialog: for the wrong women. I think that's my
dialog: problem. When my mother took me to see
dialog: Snow White, everyone fell in love with
dialog: Snow White. I immediately fell for the
dialog: Wicked Queen.
text: The scene dissolves into a sequence from the animated Snow White and the Seven
text: Dwarfs. The Wicked Queen, resembling Annie, sits in the palace before her
text: mirror. Alvy, as a cartoon figure, sits beside her, arms crossed in front of
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: WICKED QUEEN
dialog: We never have any fun anymore.
scene_heading: CARTOON FIGURE ALVY
dialog: How can you say that?
speaker_heading: WICKED QUEEN
dialog: Why not? You're always leaning on me
dialog: to improve myself.
scene_heading: CARTOON FIGURE ALVY
dialog: You're just upset. You must be getting
dialog: your period.
speaker_heading: WICKED QUEEN
dialog: I don't get a period! I'm a cartoon
dialog: character. Can't I be upset once in
dialog: a while?
text: Rob, as a cartoon figure, enters and sits down on the other side of the Wicked
dialog: Queen.
speaker_heading: CARTOON FIGURE ROB
dialog: Max, will you forget about Annie? I
dialog: know lots of women you can date.
scene_heading: CARTOON FIGURE ALVY
dialog: I don't wanna go out with any other women.
speaker_heading: CARTOON FIGURE ROB
dialog: Max, have I got a girl for you. You are
dialog: going to love her. She's a reporter-
text: The cartoon figures of Alvy and Rob walk past the Wicked Queen; the screen
text: dissolves into the interior of a concert ball. Rob's voice carries over from
text: the cartoon scene as the screen shows Alvy with the female reporter. It's very
text: crowded, noisy; policeman and reporters are everywhere. Alvy stands with his
text: hands in his pockets, watching the commotion.
scene_heading: CARTOON FIGURE ROB'S VOICE-OVER
dialog: -for Rolling Stone.
speaker_heading: FEMALE REPORTER
dialog: I think there are more people here to
dialog: see the Maharishi than there were to see
dialog: the Dylan concert. I covered the Dylan
dialog: concert ... which gave me chills.
dialog: Especially when he sang "She takes just
dialog: like a woman And she makes love just
dialog: like a woman Yes, she does And she aches
dialog: just like a woman But she breaks just
dialog: like a little girl."
text: (They move toward the aisles as
text: a guard holds up his hands to stop
dialog: them)
dialog: Up to that I guess the most charismatic
dialog: event I covered was Mick's Birthday when
dialog: the Stones played Madison Square Garden.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: Man, that's great. That's just great.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: You catch Dylan?
speaker_heading: ALVY

dialog: Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that

speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: You have a raccoon?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Gesturing)
dialog: Tsch, a few.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: The only word for this is trans-plendid.
dialog: It's trans-plendid.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: I can think of another word.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's
dialog: got millions of followers who would crawl
dialog: all the way across the world just to touch
text: the hem of his garment.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Are you?
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: I can't get with any religion that

dialog: (The Maharisbi, a small, chunky
text: man, walks out of the men's room,
text: huge bodyguards flanking him while
dialog: policemen bold back the crowds)
text: there's God coming outta the men's room.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was
dialog: at the Stones concert in Altamount when
dialog: they killed that guy, remember?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Yeah, were yuh? I was-I was at an Alice
dialog: Cooper thing where six people were rushed
text: to the hospital with bad vibes.
scene_heading: INT. ALVY'S BEDROOM-NIGHT

dialog: be silly. You know,

dialog: I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some
text: feeling back in my jaw now.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque
dialog: experience.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: I mean that as a compliment.
speaker_heading: ALVY

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: My God, I mean, you know how I am about

dialog: room.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Sighing)
dialog: I told you a thousand times you should

dialog: You never know who's gonna crawl over.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Following him)
dialog: I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and
text: a fire extinguisher.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine.
dialog: I- 'cause I'm a little tired.
dialog: (While Annie goes of to find
dialog: him a magazine, Alvy, still
text: talking, glances around the
text: apartment. He notices a small
text: book on a cabinet and picks it up.)
dialog: You know, you, you joke with-about me,
dialog: you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for
dialog: anything. An emergency, a tidal wave,
dialog: an earthquake. Hey, what is this?
dialog: What? Did you go to a rock concert?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Oh, yeah, really? Really? How-how'd
dialog: you like it? Was it-was it, I mean,
dialog: did it ... was it heavy? Did it achieve
dialog: total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: It was just great!
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Thumbing through the book)
dialog: Oh, humdinger. When- Well, I got a

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I called you; you wanna help me ... or

speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Looking down at the magazine)
dialog: What is this? What are you, since

dialog: What are you turning in to?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: (Turning to a nearby chair for
dialog: some gum in her pocketbook)
dialog: Well, I like to try to get all points
dialog: of view.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get
dialog: William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: (Spinning around to face him)
dialog: Alvy, you're a little hostile, you
dialog: know that? Not only that, you look
text: thin and tired.
text: She puts a piece of gum in her mouth.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Well, I was in be- It's three o'clock
dialog: in the morning. You, uh, you got me
dialog: outta bed, I ran over here, I couldn't
dialog: get a taxi cab. You said it was an

dialog: the stairs. Hell - I was a lot more
dialog: attractive when the evening began.
dialog: Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you
dialog: going with a right-wing rock-and roll
dialog: star? Is that possible?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: (Sitting down on a chair arm
dialog: and looking up at Alvy)
dialog: Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean?
dialog: I-I came over TV --_
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Touching his chest with her hand)
dialog: I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Yeah, where is the spider?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Is he in the bathroom?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Rising from chair)
dialog: Hey, don't squish it, and after it's
dialog: dead, flush it down the toilet, okay?
dialog: And flush it a couple o' times.
speaker_heading: ALVY
text: (Moving down the hallway to
dialog: the bathroom)
dialog: Darling, darling, I've been killing
dialog: spiders since I was thirty, okay?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: (Upset, hands on her neck)
dialog: Oh. What?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Coming back into the living room)
dialog: Very big spider.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: ALVY

dialog: There's two of 'em.
text: Alvy starts walking down the ball again, Annie following.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Two?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Opening a closet door)
dialog: Yep. I didn't think it was that big,
dialog: but it's a major spider. You got a
dialog: broom or something with a-
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh, I-I left it at your house.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Overlapping)
dialog: -snow shovel or anything or something.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Overlapping)
dialog: I think I left it there, I'm sorry.
text: Reaching up into the closet, Alvy takes out a covered tennis racquet.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Holding the racquet)
dialog: Okay, let me have this.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Well, what are you doing ... what are
dialog: you doing with-
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom
text: the size of a Buick.
text: He walks into the bathroom, Annie looking after him.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Well, okay. Oooh.
text: Alvy stands in the middle of the bathroom, tennis racquet in one band, rolled
text: magazine in the other. He looks over at the shelf above the sink and picks up
text: a small container. He holds it out, shouting off screen to Annie.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Off screen)
dialog: It's for my complexion.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show?
dialog: Geez.
text: (Alvy turns and starts swapping
text: the racquet over the shelf, knocking
dialog: down articles and breaking glass)
dialog: Don't worry!
text: (He continues to swat the racquet
text: all over the bathroom. He finally
text: moves out of the room, hands close
text: to his body. He walks into the
text: other room, where Annie is sitting
text: in a corner of her bed leaning against
dialog: the wall)
dialog: I did it! I killed them both. What-what's
dialog: the matter? Whatta you-
text: (Annie is sobbing, her band over
dialog: her face)
dialog: -whatta you sad about? You- What'd you
dialog: want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate
dialog: 'em?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Sobbing and taking Alvy's arm)
dialog: Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Sitting down next to her)
dialog: Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta-whatta
dialog: -what's the matter? Whatta you expecting
dialog: -termites? What's the matter?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Sobbing)
dialog: Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.
text: She beats her fist on the bed. Reacting, Alvy puts his arm around her shoulder
text: and leans back against the wall.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Oh, Jesus, really?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Leaning on his shoulder)
dialog: Oh, yeah. Oh.
dialog: (They kiss)
dialog: Oh! Alvy?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: What?
text: He touches her face gently as she wipes tears from her face.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Was there somebody in your room when
dialog: I called you?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: W-w-whatta you mean?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I mean was there another- I thought I
dialog: heard a voice.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Oh, I had the radio on.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: I'm sorry. I had the television set

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't
dialog: wanna be apart.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too
dialog: mature for something like that.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: It's all right for me, it's been terrific,
dialog: you know? Better than either one of my
dialog: marriages. See, 'cause. . . 'cause there's
dialog: just something different about you. I
dialog: don't know what it is, but it's great.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Snickering)
dialog: You know I think that if you let me, maybe
dialog: I could help you have more fun, you know?
dialog: I mean, I know it's hard and ... Yeah.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Alvy, what about ... what if we go away

speaker_heading: ADULT ALVY

scene_heading: INT. MOVIE THEATER.
text: The screen is projecting the beginning of "The Sorrow and the Pity": a street
text: filled with fleeing cars, belongings tied on top and piled in the back seats.
dialog: Subtitles pop on:
dialog: "The Jewish warmongers and
dialog: Parisian plutocrats tried
dialog: to flee with their gold and jewels"
text: as a narrator explains in German.
speaker_heading: CUT TO.
text: Split screen: Annie and her psychiatrist on the left; Alvy and his on the
text: right. Annie, talking, sits in a white molded chair, as does her doctor.
text: The office is very modern: stark, white and chrome. Alvy, talking to his
text: psychiatrist, lies on a deep leather sofa, the doctor seated away from him.
text: This office looks more like a well-worn den: bookcases overflowing, dark wood.
text: The dialogue is separated in each screen, though no one talks simultaneously.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (To her doctor)
dialog: That day in Brooklyn was the last day
dialog: I remember really having a great time.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (To his doctor)
dialog: Well, we never have any laughs anymore,
dialog: is the problem.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied.
scene_heading: ALVY'S PSYCHIATRIST
dialog: How often do you sleep together?
scene_heading: ANNIE'S PSYCHIATRIST
dialog: Do you have sex often?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Constantly! I'd say three times a week.
dialog: Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have
dialog: sex.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: She would not sleep with me the other
dialog: night, you know, it's-
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: And ... I don't know ... I mean, six months
dialog: ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it,
dialog: just to please him.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: I mean ... I tried everything, you know,
dialog: I-I-I put on soft music and my-my red light
dialog: bulb, and ...
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: But the thing is-I mean, since our
dialog: discussions here, I feel I have a right
dialog: to my own feelings. I think you woulda
dialog: been happy because ... uh, uh, I really
dialog: asserted myself.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: The incredible thing about it is, I'm
dialog: paying for her analysis and she's making
dialog: progress and I'm getting screwed.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I don't know, though, I feel so guilty
dialog: because Alvy is paying for it, so, you
dialog: know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go
dialog: to bed with him. But if I do go to bed
dialog: with him, it's like I'm going against my
dialog: own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Simultaneously, with Annie)
dialog: You know ... it's getting expensive
dialog: ...my analyst ... for her analyst. She-
dialog: she's making progress and I'm not making
text: any progress. Her progress is defeating
dialog: my progress.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Simultaneously, with Alvy)
dialog: Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I
dialog: should just live with a woman.

speaker_heading: WOMAN FRIEND
dialog: Wow, I don't believe it ... you mean to
dialog: tell me you guys have never snorted coke?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Well, I always wanted to try, you know,
dialog: but, uh, Alvy, uh ... he's very down on it.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Hey, don't put it on me. You kn- Wh-what
dialog: is it, I don't wanna put a wad of white
dialog: powder in my nose 'cause the-the nasal
dialog: membranes ...
text: They all start talking at once.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Counting on his fingers)
dialog: How can you say that? I mean,
dialog: (Making sounds)
dialog: who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that
dialog: girl from your acting class should sleep
text: together in a threesome.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Reacting)
dialog: That's sick!
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new.
dialog: You know, you didn't say it couldn't be
dialog: sick.
text: Annie laughs, chatters.
speaker_heading: WOMAN FRIEND
dialog: Just come on, Alvy.

dialog: Do your body a favor. Try it, come on.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Oh, yeah?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Moving forward on the couch)
dialog: Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause
dialog: the Incas did it, you know, and-and
dialog: they-they-they were a million laughs.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: Alvy, come on, for your own experience.
dialog: I mean, you wanna write, why not?
speaker_heading: MALE FRIEND
dialog: It's great stuff, Alvy. Friend of mine
dialog: just brought it in from California.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh, do you know something-I didn't tell
dialog: yuh, we're going to California next week.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Oh, really?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah ...
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: ... I'm thrilled. As you know, uh ...
dialog: uh, on my agent's advice I sold out,
dialog: and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Interrupting)
dialog: No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's
text: giving an award on television. Gee, he
dialog: talks like he's violating a moral issue
dialog: sitting here.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: You're kidding?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: It's so phony, and we have to leave New

speaker_heading: MAN

text: Annie laughs.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Over Annie's laughter)
dialog: Sure, sure, I'll be glad to. I-I'll just
dialog: put it in a-a-a h-h-hollow heel that I
dialog: have in my boot, you know.
text: (Alvy picks up the small open
dialog: gold case of cocaine base the man
text: placed on the coffee table and
text: looks at it, reacting)
dialog: H-h-how much is this stuff?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: It's about two thousand dollars an ounce.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: God.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Really? And what is the kick of it?

scene_heading: CALIFORNIA. BEVERLY HILLS STREET-DAY
text: It's a warm, beautiful day. Rob, Annie and Alvy in Rob's convertible are

speaker_heading: VOICES

speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: ALVY

text: They pass a large house with spacious lawn. Sitting on the lawn is a Santa
text: Claus complete with sleigh and reindeer. Voices continue to sing Christmas
text: carols; Annie continues to take pictures.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You know, it was snowing-it was snowing
dialog: and really gray in New York yesterday.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: No kidding?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Right-well, Santa Claus will have

speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
speaker_heading: ALVY

speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: While you're out here, Max, I want you

speaker_heading: VOICES

scene_heading: INT. TV CONTROL ROOM.
text: Several monitors line the wall in front of an elaborate console. Rob and Alvy,
text: along with Charlie, the technician, stand in the small room watching the

text: analyzing the footage, over the sounds of the taped television comedy.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Overlapping the chatter)
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Look, now, Charlie, give me a big
dialog: laugh here.
speaker_heading: ROB ON TV SCREEN
dialog: A limousine to the track breakdown?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: (Watching)
text: A little bigger.
text: TV monitors go black as the technician turns of the monitors to fix the laugh

speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Do you realize how immoral this all is?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Max, I've got a hit series.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Yeah, I know; but you're adding fake

speaker_heading: ARNIE

speaker_heading: ROB ON TV SCREEN
dialog: Arnie.
speaker_heading: ARNIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ROB

dialog: Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Look, uh ...
text: Loud laughter from the TV monitors.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: (To Alvy)
dialog: We do the show live in front of an
dialog: audience.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause
dialog: your jokes aren't funny.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Yeah, well, that's why this machine
dialog: is dynamite.
speaker_heading: ROB ON TV SCREEN
dialog: You better lie down. You've been in

speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: (To the technician)
dialog: Yeah ... uh, now give me a like a
dialog: medium-size chuckle here ... and
text: then a big hand.
text: The sounds of laughter and applause are heard from the TV.
speaker_heading: ALVY

dialog: rubbing his face)
dialog: Is there booing on there?

speaker_heading: WOMAN

speaker_heading: ALVY

speaker_heading: ALVY

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM.
text: Alvy lies in bed, one elbow propped up, a doctor sitting next to him looking
text: concerned. The doctor bolds out a plate of chicken; Alvy listlessly stares at
text: it. Annie, in the background, is on the phone.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Talking into the phone)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (Holding out the food)
dialog: Why don't you just try to get a little
dialog: of this down? This is just plain chicken.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Taking a piece of chicken and
dialog: holding it)
dialog: Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this.
dialog: I'm nauseous.
dialog: (He gasps and makes sounds)
dialog: If you could-if you could just give me
dialog: something to get me through the next two
dialog: hours, you know I-I have to go out to
dialog: Burbank ... and give out an award on a
dialog: TV show.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (On the phone, overlapping the

dialog: Well ... H-h huh ... Oh, good ... Yes,
dialog: I'll tell him.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Well, there's nothing wrong with you
dialog: actually, so far as I can tell. I mean,
dialog: you have no fever, no ... no symptoms
dialog: of anything serious. You haven't been

text: Annie bangs up and moves over to Alvy.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Sitting on the edge of the bed)
dialog: Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor.
dialog: Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They
dialog: said everything is fine. They found a
dialog: replacement, so they're going to tape
dialog: without you.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Making sounds)
dialog: I'm nauseous.
text: (He sighs and gasps)
dialog: Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the
dialog: TV show?
text: Reacting, Alvy puts up his band in disgust, then starts eating the piece of
text: chicken he has been holding. The doctor and Annie watch him, reacting.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yeah. Listen, Doctor, I'm worried.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Now, Mrs. Singer, I can't find anything --
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Christ!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Nothing at all?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: No, I think I can get a lab man up here.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Grabbing the rest of the chicken
dialog: from the plate)
dialog: Oh, jesus. Can I have the salt, please?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: What do you mean? Do you think he's-
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (Handing the salt to Alvy)
dialog: Yes, excuse me.
dialog: (To Annie)
dialog: Perhaps it would be even better if we
dialog: took him to the hospital for a day or two.
text: Alvy begins to eat.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Uh-huh ... Oh, hospital?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Well, otherwise, there's no real way to

dialog: Yeah, yeah. I forgot my mantra.
text: As they come down stairs the party is still in big gear. People are looser
text: now; conversations are more animated, some talk quietly in more intimate
text: corners, some couples are dancing. Alvy stands alone sipping a drink near the
text: huge Christmas tree. A tall woman, passing by, shakes his hand, then leaves.
text: He continues to sip his drink, alone, watching Tony and Annie in the center of
dialog: the room dancing.
text: The screen shows a plane in flight, Los Angeles far below, then:

scene_heading: AIRPLANE. INT. AIRPLANE
text: Annie and Alvy sit, the stewardess behind them serving other passengers. Annie
text: stares out the window bolding a coffee cup; Alvy reads. Both are preoccupied,

scene_heading: ANNIE'S VOICE-OVER
dialog: (To herself)
dialog: That was fun. I don't think California
dialog: is bad at all. It's a drag coming home.
scene_heading: ALVY'S VOICE-OVER
dialog: (To himself)
dialog: Lotta beautiful women. It was fun
dialog: to flirt.
scene_heading: ANNIE'S VOICE-OVER
dialog: (As she sips coffee)
dialog: I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy,
dialog: but our relationship doesn't seem to
dialog: work anymore.
scene_heading: ALVY'S VOICE-OVER
dialog: (An open magazine lies in
dialog: his lap)
dialog: I'll have the usual trouble with Annie
dialog: in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
scene_heading: ANNIE'S VOICE-OVER
dialog: If only I had the nerve to break up,
dialog: but it would really hurt him.
scene_heading: ALVY'S VOICE-OVER
dialog: If only I didn't feel guilty asking
dialog: Annie to move out. It'd probably
dialog: wreck her. But I should be honest.
text: He looks over at Annie.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Looking back at Alvy)
dialog: Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know
dialog: something, don't think our relationship
dialog: is working.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Tsch, I know. A relationship, I think,
dialog: is-is like a shark, you know? It has
dialog: to constantly move forward or it dies.
dialog: (He sighs)
dialog: And I think what we got on our hands
dialog: (Clearing his throat)
text: is a dead shark.
scene_heading: INT. ALVY'S LIVING ROOM-DAY
text: A lighted Christmas tree stands in the middle of boxes, books, and the general
text: disarray of packing and figuring out what belongs to whom as Alvy helps Annie
dialog: move out.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Holding up a book)
dialog: Whose "Catcher in the Rye" is this?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: (Walking into the room with an
dialog: armload of books)
dialog: Well, let's see now ... If it has my
dialog: name on it, then I guess it's mine.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Reacting)
dialog: Oh, it sure has ... You know, you wrote
dialog: your name in all my books, 'cause you
dialog: knew this day was gonna come.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Putting down the books and
dialog: flipping back her hair)
dialog: Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up
dialog: just as much as I do.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Riffling through the books)
dialog: There's no-no question in my mind. I
dialog: think we're doing the mature thing,
dialog: without any doubt.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: (Holding a framed picture and
dialog: moving about)
dialog: Now, look, all the books on death and
dialog: dying are yours and all the poetry books
dialog: are mine.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Looking down at a book)
dialog: This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh-
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: This is the first book that I got you.
text: Annie goes over to Alvy. They both look down at the book; the fireplace,
text: burning nicely, is behind them.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: -God.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Remember that day?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Right. Geez, I feel like there's a
dialog: great weight off my back. M'mmm.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Thanks, honey.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Patting Alvy's shoulder)
dialog: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, you
dialog: know, no, no, no, I mean, I think it's
dialog: really important for us to explore new
dialog: relationships and stuff like that.
text: She walks away.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: There's no-there's no question about
dialog: that, 'cause we've given this ... uh,
dialog: uh, I think a more than fair shot,
dialog: you know?
text: He tosses the book into the carton.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Off screen)
dialog: Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is
dialog: keen for me.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Off screen)
dialog: Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust
dialog: her, because my-my analyst recommended
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Walking in with another
dialog: armload of books)
dialog: Well, why should I put you through all
dialog: my moods and hang-ups anyway?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Right. And you-and you know what the
dialog: beauty part is?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Holding a small box of buttons)
dialog: We can always come back together again.
dialog: Because there's no-there's no problem.
dialog: 'Cause ... Right.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Overlapping)
dialog: Exactly, but ... exactly. Ooooh!
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: You know, I-I-I don't think many couples
dialog: could handle this. You know, they could
text: just break up and remain friends.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Taking a button from a box)
dialog: Hey, this one's mine, this button.
dialog: This one, you rem-
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Interrupting)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I guess these are all yours. Impeach, uh,
dialog: Eisenhower ... Impeach Nixon ... Impeach
dialog: Lyndon Johnson ... Impeach Ronald Reagan.

text: A couple, walking down the street, stops as the man talks to Alvy.
text: MAN ON THE STREET
dialog: She's living in Los Angeles with
dialog: Tony Lacey.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Oh, yeah? Well, if she is, then the
dialog: hell with her! If she likes that
dialog: lifestyle, let her live there! He's
dialog: a jerk, for one thing.
text: MAN ON THE STREET
dialog: He graduated Harvard.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Yeah. He may- Listen, Harvard makes
dialog: mistakes too, you know. Kissinger
dialog: taught there.
text: The couple strolls away as an older woman walks up to Alvy while others walk by.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Don't tell me you're jealous?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Yeah, jealous. A little bit like Medea.
dialog: Lemme, lemme-can I show you something,
dialog: lady?
text: (He takes a small item from his
dialog: pocket to show the woman)
dialog: What I have here ... I found this in the
dialog: apartment. Black soap. She used to wash
dialog: her face eight hundred times a day with
dialog: black soap. Don't ask me why.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Well, why don't you go out with other
dialog: women?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Well, I-I tried, but it's, uh, you know,
dialog: it's very depressing.
scene_heading: RECENT FLASHBACK - INT. ALVY'S COUNTRY KITCHEN
text: Alvy's arms and legs fill the screen as he slowly gets up from the floor

speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Pointing to the lobster)
dialog: This always happens to me. Quick, g-go
dialog: get a broom.

speaker_heading: GIRL DATE
dialog: (Smoking)
dialog: What are you making such a big deal about?
text: (As she talks, the lobster drops
text: from the tray to the floor. Alvy
text: jumps away, then gingerly scrapes
text: the tray toward the lobster)
dialog: They're only lobsters. Look, you're a
dialog: grown man, you know how to pick up a
dialog: lobster.
speaker_heading: ALVY
text: (Looking up in stooped-over
dialog: position)
dialog: I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
speaker_heading: GIRL DATE

speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Mocking)

speaker_heading: GIRL DATE

scene_heading: ALVY'S VOICE-OVER
dialog: Well, where-wherever you wanna meet, I

scene_heading: EXT. OUTDOOR CAF - DAY
text: People sit at umbrellaed tables with checkered tablecloths at a Sunset
text: Boulevard outdoor cafe. Street traffic goes by while they dine. There's a
text: mild California breeze. The restaurant is somewhat crowded as Alvy makes his
text: way around the tables looking about. He finally sits down at an empty table;
text: nearby sits a woman with a younger man. A waitress brings Alvy a menu and
text: waits for his order.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (To the waitress)
dialog: I'm gonna...I'm gonna have the alfalfa
text: sprouts and, uh, a plate of mashed yeast.
text: Annie, wearing a flowered dress and wide hat, moves into view. Alvy,

dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Hi.
text: Alvy wipes at his nose as he stares. He smiles, the street traffic moving
text: behind him. Annie smiles back.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: You look very pretty.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh, no, I just lost a little weight,
dialog: that's all.

dialog: Well, you look nice.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Nodding his head)
dialog: You see, I-I've been thinking about it
dialog: and I think that we should get married.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Adjusting her sunglasses)
dialog: Oh, Alvy, come on.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Why? You wanna live out here all year?
dialog: It's like living in Munchkin Land.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Looking around)
dialog: Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's
dialog: perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's
dialog: very nice and, uh, well, I meet people

dialog: for me, you know? I mean ...
text: (Reacting, Alvy looks down at

dialog: I'm able to enjoy people more.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Sadly)
dialog: So whatta you ... You're not gonna come
dialog: back to New York?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: What's so great about New York? I mean,
dialog: it's a dying city. You read "Death in
dialog: Venice."
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice"
dialog: till I bought it for yuh.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: That's right, that's right.
dialog: (Still smiling)
dialog: You only gave me books with the word
text: "death" in the titles.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Nodding his head and gesturing)
dialog: That's right, 'cause it's an important
dialog: issue.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life,
dialog: you know that? I mean, your life is New
dialog: York City. You're just this person.
dialog: You're like this island unto yourself.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Toying with his car keys)
dialog: I can't enjoy anything unless I ... unless
dialog: everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is
dialog: starving someplace, that's ... you know,
dialog: I-I ... it puts a crimp in my evening.
text: (Looking down at his hands, sadly)
dialog: So wanna get married or what?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Seriously)
dialog: No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (In disbelief)
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (Louder, to the waitress)
dialog: Check, please. Can I -can I ...
dialog: Can I ... Can I ...
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Interrupting)
dialog: You're mad, aren't you?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Shaking his head)
dialog: No.
dialog: (Then nodding)
dialog: Yes, of course I'm mad, because you
dialog: love me, I know that.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Alvy, I can't say that that's true at
dialog: this point in my life. I really just
dialog: can't say that that's true. I mean,
dialog: you know how wonderful you are. I
dialog: mean, you know ... you're the reason
dialog: that I got outta my room and that I
dialog: was able to sing, and-and-and, you know,
dialog: get more in touch with my feelings and
dialog: all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't

dialog: h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Shrugging his shoulders)
dialog: The usual, you know. Uh, tryin't'write.

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (Nodding)
dialog: No!

dialog: Look, I gotta go.
text: She starts to rise.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: You mean that ...
text: (He gets up and starts following
text: her past diners at other tables)
dialog: I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to
dialog: see you.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I'm late.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Air miles, you know. I mean, you
dialog: know what that does to my stomach?
text: They move down the steps of the cafe' toward the parking lot.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: If you must know, it's a hectic time

speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: The what?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: The Grammys. He's got a lotta records
dialog: up for awards.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: You mean they give awards for that

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh!
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: I thought just earplugs.
text: Annie gets into her car. Alvy moves over to his rented convertible.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Just forget it, Alvy, okay? Let's
dialog: just forget the conversation.

speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Yelling after her)
dialog: Awards! They do nothing but give out
dialog: awards! I can't believe it. Greatest,
dialog: greatest fascist dictator, Adolf Hitler!
text: Annie drives away. Alvy gets behind the wheel, starts the motor. Putting the
text: car in gear, he inadvertently moves forward, hitting a bunch of trash cans with
text: a loud crash. Putting the car in reverse, Alvy notices a beige car that has
text: just turned into the parking lot. For a brief moment, the screen shows a
text: flashback of the bumper-car ride at the Brooklyn amusement park. Alvy's father
text: is on the Platform directing traffic; young Alvy is in a small car bumping
text: others right and left. Alvy, hack in the parking lot, backs up his convertible,
text: purposefully smashing the side of the beige car as another flashback of bumper-
text: car ride appears, this time-as, Alvy's father directs traffic-a Marine in a
text: small car bits the back end of a soldier's car, and Alvy, back in the parking
text: lot, moves his car over to another parked car and bits it full force.
text: Another flashback appears. people in the small cars really racing around the
text: track now, bumping into one another over and over again, Alvy's father
text: directing the flow, as the film cuts back to the parking lot, where Alvy
text: reverses the convertible and rams it into the front end of yet another car.
text: He sits behind the wheel as people rush out of various cars and as sirens
text: start blaring, coming closer and closer, stopping finally as a motorcycle cop
text: gets off beside Alvy's car and walks over to him.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: (Getting out of the car)
dialog: Officer, I know what you're gonna say.
dialog: I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know,

speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: (Interrupting)
dialog: May I see your license, please?
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Sure.
dialog: (Searching, he finally fishes
dialog: his license out of his pocket)
dialog: just don't-don't get angry, you know
dialog: what I mean? 'Cause I-I have - I have
dialog: my-my license here. You know, it's a

text: He drops the license and it falls to the ground.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Don't give me your life story
dialog: (Looking at the piece of paper
dialog: on the ground)
dialog: -just pick up the license.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Pick up the license. You have to ask
dialog: nicely 'cause I've had an extremely
dialog: rough day. You know, my girl friend-
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: (Interrupting)
dialog: Just give me the license, please.
speaker_heading: ALVY
dialog: Since you put it that way.
dialog: (He laughs)
dialog: It's hard for me to refuse.
text: (He leans over, picks up the
text: license, then proceeds to rip
text: it up. He lets the pieces go;

speaker_heading: ROB

speaker_heading: ALVY

speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max.
dialog: I got mugged. I was playing Richard the

speaker_heading: ACTRESS
dialog: What is so incredibly great about New

speaker_heading: ACTRESS
dialog: Well, you only give me books with the

text: The camera pulls back, showing Alvy sitting with two men at a table set up
text: near the actors. A mirror, running the whole width of the wall, reflects the
text: two actors, a script lying on the table between them. It is obvious now that
text: they are rehearsing a scene that Alvy wrote.
speaker_heading: ACTOR
dialog: (In mirrored reflection)
dialog: It's an important issue.
speaker_heading: ACTRESS
dialog: (In mirrored reflection)
dialog: Alvy, you are totally incapable of

speaker_heading: ACTRESS

speaker_heading: ACTOR
dialog: (Rising with emotion)
dialog: Okay, if that's all that we've been
dialog: through together means to you, I guess
dialog: it's better if we just said goodbye,

dialog: play. You know, you know how you're
dialog: always tryin' t' get things to come out
dialog: perfect in art because, uh, it's real
dialog: difficult in life. Interestingly, however,
dialog: I did run into Annie again. It was on the
dialog: Upper West Side of Manhattan.
text: Annie, singing "Seems Like Old Times, " overlaps Alvy's speech and continues
text: over the next scene, where Alvy, standing in front of a Manhattan theater,
text: shakes hands with Annie and her escort. The theater marquee reads "OPHULS
text: PRIZE FILM: 'THE SORROW AND THE PITY'."
speaker_heading: ALVY'S VOICE
dialog: (Over the theater scene and,
dialog: Annie's singing)
dialog: She had moved back to New York. She was
dialog: living in SoHo with some guy.
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: And when I met her she was, of all things,
dialog: dragging him in to see "The Sorrow and the

dialog: triumph. Annie and I ...
text: (Alvy's voice continues over the

text: Annie and Alvy in the Hamptons house kitchen, Annie banding a live lobster to

text: Annie and Alvy walking side by side by the shoreline.
text: Alvy at the tennis club, packing his bag, as he looks over his shoulder and
text: sees Annie, hands on her face, then clapping, as she offers him a ride home
text: in her car.
text: Annie opening the door to Alvy the night he came over to kill the spider; Annie
text: and, Alvy in the bookstore buying the "Death" titles; Annie and, Alvy in
text: their Hamptons house, Annie reading a school catalogue, the night Alvy puts
text: in the red light.
text: The memories continue to flash on the screen: Annie and Alvy at a friend's
text: house, Alvy blowing the cocaine all over the sofa; Annie and Alvy playing
text: tennis; Annie and Alvy having a picture taken backstage at the college
text: performance in Annie's hometown; Alvy bolding Annie close, the night he came
text: over to kill the spider.
text: And continue: Annie carrying her luggage and clothes into Alvy's bedroom, Alvy
text: following, the day she first moved into his apartment. Annie holding up her
text: sexy birthday present from Alvy, then leaning over and kissing him; Annie and
text: Alvy walking down a city street, holding each other close; sitting on the park
text: bench, observing the people; and kissing, on the FDR Drive, the New York City
text: skyline behind them.
text: The music stops.
text: Returning to the present, the camera, focusing through the cafe window, shows
text: Annie and Alvy across street. They look about at the city traffic. Lunch is
dialog: over; it's time.
text: Alvy and Annie shake hands and kiss each other friendly like. Annie crosses
text: the street, Alvy watching her go. Then he turns, and slowly walks down the
text: street off screen. His voice is heard over the scene:
scene_heading: ALVY'S VOICE-OVER
