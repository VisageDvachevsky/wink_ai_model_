scene_heading: INT. AUDIENCE ROOM - GRANADA - DAY
text: We start on a man's elegant slipper. He is seated in a
text: splendid chair. Moving up the stocking leg, we pass the
text: garter of Castile, coming to rest on a pair of delicate
text: hands. His fore finger impatiently plays with a large
text: topaz ring. Over this, we hear distant footsteps, echoing
text: on marble floors.
text: CUT TO:
text: A Castilian face: aquilaine profile, olive complexion,
text: dark eyebrows and meticulously sculpted beard. This is
speaker_heading: TREASURER SANCHEZ.
text: A door slams somewhere, the footsteps getting closer. We
text: can now here a subdued conversation.
text: TREASURER SANCHEZ stands up as:
text: The door opens at the far end of the large gilded room.
text: A WOMEN, magnificent in somber taffeta, enters. QUEEN
text: ISABEL OF SPAIN moves towards him.
text: He bows slightly as she sits at the end of the large
text: table. She is followed by a PRIEST, BROTHER BUYL, and
dialog: three dignitaries of Church and State.
text: All sit beside her. TREASURER SANCHEZ takes a document
text: and starts to read aloud.
text: On screen the words: GRANADA - SPAIN - 1500
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: Your Majesty would wish to know the
dialog: true facts concerning the island of
dialog: Hispanola, our first settlement in
dialog: the New World, and the activities
dialog: there of your servant, Christopher
dialog: Columbus, Admiral of the Ocean Sea,
dialog: Governor of that Island. You will
dialog: remember with what hopes and
dialog: promises he beguiled us -- the truth
dialog: is that he now presides over a state
dialog: of chaos, degradation and madness
dialog: beyond imagining.
text: SANCHEZ punctuates each word carefully.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: From the beginning, Columbus proved
dialog: himself incapable of managing the
dialog: affairs of the island. He appointed
dialog: his brothers to important positions,
dialog: at once injuring the pride and
dialog: dignity of the nobles who had gone
dialog: with him. He promised to build a
dialog: city, the City of Isabel, named
dialog: after Your Majesty. What he
dialog: actually built was nothing but a
dialog: collection of huts, and that in the
dialog: wrong place, for all of it was
text: easily swept away by rain and mud.
dialog: Is that not so, Brother Buyl?
text: The PRIEST nods.
speaker_heading: BROTHER BUYL
dialog: Yes, Your Honor.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: He promised gold. Not finding the
dialog: easy quantities he promised,
dialog: Columbus commanded each Indian to
dialog: pay an annual tribute. Most being
dialog: unable to, they were barbarously
dialog: punished, against the express wish
dialog: of Your Christian Majesties...
text: ISABEL lowers her eyes.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: Since provocation and injustice
dialog: never ceases, many of the Indians
dialog: have fled to the forests, or have
dialog: begun to slay the Christians.
text: ISABEL looks over at BROTHER BUYL.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Could it be so?
speaker_heading: BROTHER BUYL
dialog: Yes, Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: But there is worse. From the
dialog: beginning, he forced the nobles to
dialog: undergo physical labor, treating
dialog: them equally with the Indians, all
dialog: of them reduced to slavery. When
dialog: the nobleman Adrian de Moxica
dialog: protested against such treatment...
dialog: (he pauses)
dialog: ... he was executed.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Is that not true also, Brother
dialog: Buyl?
speaker_heading: BROTHER BUYL
dialog: Yes, Your Honor. It is all true.
dialog: All of it. I saw it with my own
text: eyes.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: He has lost control. His great
dialog: arrogance has led him into
dialog: depravity. He encourages our
dialog: soldiers to marry the native women.
dialog: He promised a paradise, but he has
dialog: made a hell full of all its horrors.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Is that the man I knew, Treasurer
dialog: Sanchez?
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: Yes, Your Majesty.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HUT - ISLAND - DAY
text: CLOSE ON the FACE: COLUMBUS is stretched on a bed,
text: sweating heavily in fever, clearly delirious. Insects
text: crawl over his face, he makes no effort to swat them away.
text: There is a dripping sound of water.
speaker_heading: FERNANDO (V.O.)
dialog: Of all the words my Father wrote and
dialog: there were many, I remember these
dialog: the most. "Nothing that results
dialog: from human progress is achieved with
dialog: unanimous consent..."
text: Rain is falling into the room over documents spread on a
text: table. COLUMBUS stands up and moves to the table. Some
text: of the walls have been blackened with smoke and flames. A
text: lizard scuttles into the shadows.
speaker_heading: FERNANDO (V.O.)
dialog: "And those who are enlightened
dialog: before the others are condemned to
dialog: purse that light in spite of
dialog: others..."
text: COLUMBUS stares down at the documents, moving them away
text: from the rain drips. He stares out by the window, and we
dialog: see:
text: A devastated landscape. Flooded roads, half-destroyed
text: huts, broken trees... A dog picks its way through the mud.
speaker_heading: FERNANDO (V.O.)
dialog: There was a time when the New World
dialog: didn't exist...
text: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - DAY
text: A vast stretch of ocean. It fills the screen. Unbroken,
text: infinite, luminous, mysterious -- it stretches away,
text: meeting and blending with the sky in pale ribbons of pearl
text: and misty light.
speaker_heading: FERNANDO (V.O.)
dialog: ... The sun set in the west on an
dialog: ocean where no man had dared to
dialog: venture. And beyond that,
dialog: infinity...
text: Pulling back, we discover:
text: A TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY and a strongly built man in his middle
text: thirties, are riding a mule. The MAN'S weather-beaten
text: face frames unusually bright eyes.
text: On the screen these words: ANDALUSIA, 1491
text: COLUMBUS AND HIS SON are following a windthrashed path at
text: the top of the hill. COLUMBUS hums a song, and FERNANDO
text: looks up at him in adoration.
speaker_heading: FERNANDO (V.O.)
dialog: Once I asked my Father where he
dialog: wanted to go. And he replied: "I
dialog: want to travel all over the seas. I
dialog: want to get behind the weather..."
text: FERNANDO laughs. He then starts to hum along with his
speaker_heading: FATHER.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HILLSIDE APPROACH TO LA RABIDA - DAY
text: A rugged landscape, remote and steep, with lines of stone
dialog: walls and thousands of sheep.
text: FERNANDO, rushes down a slope, barking like a dog, chasing
text: the sheep who fan out in droves in front of him. High-
text: spirited and wild, FERNANDO laughs and tumbles over.
text: COLUMBUS rides his mule along the narrow track, watching
text: his SON'S antics with amusement. In the distance, the
text: solitary figure of A MONK SHEPHERD.
text: COLUMBUS calls out to his son:
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Fernando!
text: FERNANDO runs over. COLUMBUS lifts him up onto the mule.
text: As they move along the track we now see, perched on a
text: distant hill, isolated and austere, the Monastery of La
dialog: Rabida, their destination.
scene_heading: EXT. CLOISTER - LA RABIDA - DAY
text: As they dismount and walk into the quiet cloisters,
text: FERNANDO suddenly spots a familiar FIGURE, standing under
text: the ROMAN arches.
speaker_heading: FERNANDO
dialog: Diego!
text: He rushes over, full of joy, to kiss his BROTHER -- an
text: adolescent dressed in the novice-robe, with a solemn,
text: delicate face. DIEGO'S response is constrained.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Diego! Aren't you going to kiss
dialog: your brother?
text: DIEGO smiles a little, and kisses FERNANDO -- who is
text: immediately distracted by a procession of hooded MONKS,
text: hurrying to the refectory, as a bell begins to chime.
text: The MONKS all turn to greet ANTONIO DE MARCHENA, a white-
text: haired, elderly man -- and a monk cosmographer.
text: MARCHENA'S gesture is broad and elegant as he opens his
text: arms to greet COLUMBUS. He pats FERNANDO'S head and turns
text: to DIEGO.
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: Diego, take Fernando to the dining
dialog: hall. He must be hungry.
speaker_heading: DIEGO
dialog: Yes, Father.
text: Both CHILDREN leave under the arched roof. COLUMBUS and
text: MARCHENA begin to walk across the cloister.
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure
dialog: to teach -- but so serious...
dialog: Brothers should be raised together,
dialog: Colon. Even brothers from different
dialog: mothers...
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Father, I am doing what I think is
dialog: the best for him. And he has the
dialog: teacher I would have chosen for
dialog: myself.
text: MARCHENA laughs at the compliment.
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: Just be careful you don't lose him.
text: They have crossed the cloister. MARCHENA pushes open a
text: door.
scene_heading: INT. A HUGE LIBRARY - LA RABIDA - DAY
text: Hundreds of books lined up on the shelves, displaying the
dialog: miracle of printing, a recent German discovery. Several
text: MONKS, perched on high stools behind lecterns, are busily
text: "ILLUMINATING" some of these massive volumes, delicately
text: painting around the letters in bright colors and gold
dialog: leaf.
text: Rays of light fall diagonally through high openings,
text: projecting geometric patterns on the tiled floor. As
text: MARCHENA and COLUMBUS move forward their conversation is
text: punctuated by light and shadow.
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: (fumbles in a pocket
dialog: under his robe)
dialog: I have something for you.
text: Almost casually, he hands COLUMBUS a letter.
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: You will be heard at the University
dialog: of Salamanca...
text: COLUMBUS stops dead in his tracks. Almost frantically he
text: tears open the letter, hardly able to believe his eyes.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: God... That's in a week!
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: That's what it says.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: How did you manage it?
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: With some difficulty. I had to
dialog: promise them you were not a total
dialog: fool.
text: MARCHENA pushes open a second door, hidden behind a wooden
text: panel.
scene_heading: INT. STUDY - LA RABIDA - DAY
text: MARCHENA is not a tidy man. Books are piled up on the
text: floor, the desk, on every shelf, along with maps,
dialog: instruments of astronomy... the visible evidence of an
text: inquiring mind.
text: With practiced familiarity, as if they had done this a
text: hundred times -- which indeed they have -- MARCHENA sits
text: behind his desk, and COLUMBUS opposite him. MARCHENA
text: lights a candle and considers the mess. Then
text: methodically, he slowly sweeps it from in front of him
text: with his sleeve, exposing a large map underneath.
text: When he looks up again, there is a new severity in his
text: expression. He turns over an hourglass.
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: Why do you wish to sail west?
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: To open a new route to Asia. At the
dialog: moment there are only two ways of
text: reaching it...
text: He leans forward, and points to the map spread out on the
dialog: desk.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: By sea, sailing around the African
text: Continent -- the journey takes a
dialog: year...
text: His finger traces the journey, from west to east.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Or by land...
text: We are CLOSE now on the map, as we watch his finger
text: tracing a line between Europe and the Far East.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS (O.S.)
dialog: ... But the Turks have closed this
dialog: route to all Christians. Trading
dialog: with the Orient has become arduous,
dialog: if not dangerous.
dialog: (he pauses)
dialog: There is a third way...
text: We notice that the outline of the European continent is
text: familiar. But we also notice that, in that great expanse
dialog: of ocean, the whole American continent is missing.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: By sailing West across the Ocean
dialog: Sea.
text: CLOSE ON MARCHENA'S FACE, touched by the mystery.
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: How can you be so certain? The
dialog: Ocean is said to be infinite.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Ignorance! I believe the Indies are
dialog: no more than 750 leagues west of the
dialog: Canary Islands.
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: How can you be so certain?
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: The calculations of Toscanelli Marin
dialog: de Tyr, Esdras...
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Esdras is a Jew.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: So was Christ!
text: MARCHENA throws his quill in the air in frustration. He
text: glances at the hourglass:
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: Two minutes... and already you're a
dialog: dead man. Don't let passion
dialog: overwhelm you, Colon.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (mockingly)
dialog: I'll try to remember that,
dialog: Marchena...
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: Father Marchena!
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (ignoring this)
dialog: Passion is something one cannot
dialog: control!
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: (heatedly)
dialog: You get so carried away when you are
dialog: being contradicted!
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: I've been contradicted all my
dialog: life... Eternity!
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Only God knows the meaning of such
dialog: words, my son.
scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD - LA RABIDA - EVENING
text: DIEGO and FERNANDO wait in the courtyard. COLUMBUS
text: appears and lifts FERNANDO onto the mule. DIEGO turns to
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Diego.
text: COLUMBUS walks over to him, squats down so their eyes
text: meet. He looks at his SON for a moment.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Would you like to come and stay with
dialog: us?
text: Uncomfortable with the proposition, DIEGO cannot find an
dialog: answer.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: I'll do whatever makes you happy.
speaker_heading: DIEGO
dialog: I am happy, Father.
text: COLUMBUS reaches out -- and touches his shoulder.
text: He climbs up behind FERNANDO, who waves back to his
text: BROTHER as they ride off.
scene_heading: EXT. CADIZ - STREETS AND CATHEDRAL SQUARE - NIGHT
text: COLUMBUS leads the mule, carrying the sleeping FERNANDO,
text: through narrow streets. There's a clamorous noise in the
text: air. Suddenly a large group of YOUNG MEN, shouting with
text: excitement, run up the street and brush past them. Then
text: more people. FERNANDO sits up straight. The noise grows,
text: rowdy, rumbling, sharp with excitement and violence.
text: Huge CROWDS have thronged the massive old square outside
text: the cathedral. Holding the mule by its reins, COLUMBUS
text: tries to push his way through... Suddenly, as a gap opens
text: in the crowd, we see the cause of the excitement: in the
text: center of the square stand three pyres, already alit.
text: HOODED EXECUTIONERS are busy around the fires.
speaker_heading: FERNANDO
dialog: Look, Father!
text: Before COLUMBUS can stop him, FERNANDO has slipped off the
text: mule and into the crowd.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Fernando!
text: But the BOY has been swallowed into the mass of people.
text: COLUMBUS tries to follow him. Flames leap into the night
text: sky with a terrible crackling, lighting up the square with
text: a lurid glow. Prayers are being chanted somewhere.
text: FERNANDO has elbowed his way to the front of the crowd.
text: A PRIEST brandishes a crucifix in front of the face of a
text: MAN bound to a post. The heretic wears the "sambenito", a
dialog: robe made of coarse fabric on which his sins have been
text: crudely illustrated -- we see cabalistic signs,
text: indicating that the man is Jewish.
text: THE MAN'S eyes are mad with fear. But he refuses to kiss
text: the crucifix, as a sign of his repentance.
text: FERNANDO is transfixed by the scene, but still doesn't
text: realize what is happening. He is too close to the
text: platform to see what is in the flames of the other pyres.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Fernando!
text: He motions to his son, takes the BOY'S hand, and drags him
text: away from the scene. But FERNANDO looks back. The
text: distance now allows him to see inside the flames.
text: A HALF-CHARRED FIGURE -- THE MAN'S face is distorted in a
text: silent scream... The neck snaps like burning wood, and the
text: head falls on one shoulder. Then the whole body collapses
text: into the fire.
scene_heading: INT. BEATRIX'S HOUSE - HALLWAY AND STABLE - NIGHT
text: COLUMBUS and FERNANDO lead the mule into the white-washed,
text: stone-floored hallway of the modest house. FERNANDO is
text: mute, shocked by what he just witnessed. COLUMBUS takes
text: the mule into its stall, and as he does so, his mother,
text: BEATRIX, appears from the kitchen to greet them. She is a
text: beautiful woman in her twenties, a calm, strong, domestic
text: personality. COLUMBUS tousles the BOY'S hair. FERNANDO
text: glances at his MOTHER but looks subdued and doesn't say
dialog: anything.
scene_heading: INT. BEATRIX'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: COLUMBUS joins BEATRIX in the kitchen, where a MAID is
text: cooking. He explains Fernando's subdued manner.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Executions. In the square.
text: BEATRIX nods. He goes to the stone butt and pours water
text: on his hands.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: They've agreed to see me in a week.
text: BEATRIX puts the candle on the table. Her face lights up
text: with a smile. He walks to her, and kisses her.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: I could be gone for years.
speaker_heading: BEATRIX
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: I haven't given you much of a life.
speaker_heading: BEATRIX
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Well... that's true. I have a child
dialog: by a man who won't marry me! Who's
dialog: always leaving...
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Are we going to argue?
speaker_heading: BEATRIX
dialog: I'd love to argue with you
dialog: sometimes. But you're never here!
text: They laugh and kiss.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Perhaps I was never meant to live
dialog: with a woman...
speaker_heading: BEATRIX
dialog: (still kissing him)
dialog: I find that hard to believe.
text: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEATRIX'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: They are eating around the table, and FERNANDO is
text: unusually silent and thoughtful. COLUMBUS pours a little
text: wine into FERNANDO'S water, to distract him. FERNANDO
text: looks up at him, surprised. COLUMBUS smiles, then looks
text: over at BEATRIX.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Fernando, don't you think we are
dialog: lucky to live with such a beautiful
dialog: woman?
text: He winks at FERNANDO. BEATRIX smiles.
scene_heading: INT. BEATRIX'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The room is dark. As COLUMBUS approached the bed with a
text: candle, it illuminates the naked body of BEATRIX. BEATRIX
text: looks up at him intently. A drop of wax falls on her
text: skin. She flinches, murmurs...
text: They make love.
scene_heading: EXT. SALAMANCA UNIVERSITY - DAY
text: A medieval "campus". Students-novices are playing
text: "pelote", with basket-gloves and a hard ball. They run
text: with their robes tucked around their waist, revealing
text: white legs. Others are studying, reading, hurrying to
dialog: their class.
text: We find COLUMBUS watching the game from the steps above
text: the court. Others are waiting with him. A MONK comes
text: from a door, and looks around the group.
speaker_heading: MONK
dialog: (hesitant)
dialog: Christopher Columbus?
scene_heading: INT. AUDIENCE ROOM - UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY
text: An El Greco painting. A tableau of twenty MEN sitting on
text: dark, sculpted seats. Candles throw a gloomy light on
text: their faces. Some are Churchmen, others are dressed in
text: bourgeois outfits.
text: Only one of them is richly dressed in the grand Spanish
dialog: fashion -- he is SANCHEZ, Treasurer of the House of
text: Aragon. A MONK (Don AROJAZ) holds a stick with an ivory
text: claw at the top. Languidly, he scratches his back -- his
text: off-hand manner only makes him more impressive than his
dialog: peers.
speaker_heading: AROJAZ
dialog: You say Asia can be found by sailing
dialog: west?
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Yes, your Eminence. The voyage
dialog: should not take more than six or
dialog: seven weeks.
speaker_heading: AROJAZ
dialog: Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is
dialog: precisely where our opinions
dialog: differ...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Are you familiar with the work of
dialog: Aristotle? Erathostene? Ptolemeus?
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: I am, Your Eminence
speaker_heading: AROJAZ
dialog: Then you cannot ignore that
dialog: according to their calculations, the
dialog: circumference of the Earth is
dialog: approximately...
dialog: (he leans forward)
dialog: 22,000 leagues or more. Which makes
dialog: the ocean... uncrossable.
text: He leans back, satisfied, and pauses for effect.
speaker_heading: AROJAZ
dialog: But you may have found new evidence
dialog: proving that these men of knowledge
dialog: are totally mistaken!
text: A ripple of mirthless laughter.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Your Excellencies are aware of the
dialog: statements of Marin de Tyr?
speaker_heading: HERNANDO DE TALAVERA
dialog: We are.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Then you are also aware that his
dialog: theories contradict Ptolemeus... De
dialog: Tyr believes the Ocean to be only
dialog: 750 leagues...
text: A murmur of protest spreads among the members of the
dialog: Commission. But Columbus is determined to press his
dialog: theories.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: The Florentine Toscanelli and the
dialog: French Cardinal Pierre d'Ailly both
dialog: think that Marin de Tyr is accurate
dialog: in his calculations. And therefore,
dialog: that the ocean can be crossed.
text: Indignant and amused murmurs. DIEGO DE DEZA raises his
text: voice to quiet the assembly.
speaker_heading: DIEGO DE DEZA
dialog: Gentlemen, let us suppose Marin de
dialog: Tyr is right...
dialog: (the laughter
dialog: subsides)
dialog: Are we here to examine this proposal
dialog: or not?
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: DIEGO DE DEZA
dialog: (to Columbus)
dialog: In your opinion, how long would the
dialog: voyage be?
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Seven weeks. Six, during the summer
dialog: months.
text: The murmur increases.
speaker_heading: AROJAZ
dialog: Marin de Tyr is wrong -- and has
dialog: been corrected many times over the
dialog: centuries by the finest geographers.
dialog: Your voyage, Don Colon, would take a
dialog: year!
text: A MAN of simple bearing, that COLUMBUS identifies as
text: being a seaman, interrupts.
speaker_heading: VICUNA
dialog: How would the crew survive without
dialog: being able to land for fresh water?
dialog: Water is undrinkable after six
dialog: weeks! You'd never be able to turn
dialog: back!
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: We wouldn't have to turn back! We
dialog: would find land at this point!
speaker_heading: AROJAZ
dialog: Senor Colon, an experienced captain
dialog: such as yourself will understand our
dialog: concern with the crew. I am not
dialog: willing to have on my conscience the
dialog: loss of men who would have relied
dialog: upon our judgment.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Excellency, you are right.
text: Instantly, the protests stop.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: I am a seaman, not a scholar... But
dialog: as a simple man craving for
dialog: knowledge, I have read all the work
dialog: of these renowned geographers and
dialog: discovered that none of them could
dialog: agree on the exact width of this
dialog: ocean...
text: He pauses, and starts walking in front of the experts, as
dialog: a lawyer before a grand jury.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Therefore, as a modest man, I
dialog: wonder: who is right?
text: The experts listen. CLOSE ON SANCHEZ'S FACE, impressed by
dialog: the boldness.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Who is right? This question remains
text: unanswered.
text: He walks and stops before TALAVERA, and catches the look
text: of SANCHEZ, sitting just behind him.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Your Eminence, there is only one way
dialog: to settle the matter. And that is
dialog: to make the journey.
dialog: (to the assembly,
dialog: with passion)
dialog: I am ready to risk my life to prove
dialog: it possible.
speaker_heading: AROJAZ
dialog: Your life, and that of others!
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: If they agree to follow me, yes.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ (O.S.)
dialog: Suppose you cross this ocean.
dialog: Suppose you reach Asia. What would
dialog: Spain do there?
text: Conscious of a friendlier voice, COLUMBUS sees the
text: Treasurer SANCHEZ, an imposing man in his fifties.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Trade, Your Excellency. According
dialog: to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China
dialog: is one of the richest of the world.
dialog: Even the meanest buildings are
text: roofed with gold.
speaker_heading: AROJAZ
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Is that all that interests you?
dialog: Gold?
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: No. The Portuguese have already
dialog: discovered black-skinned people. I,
dialog: too, will find other populations --
dialog: and bring them to the word of God.
text: THE MONK smiles thinly.
speaker_heading: AROJAZ
dialog: Christopher -- Christo Ferens -- the
dialog: Bearer of the Cross!
speaker_heading: MONK
dialog: (ironic)
dialog: And Colon -- the one who populates!
text: Another small rill of laughter.
speaker_heading: AROJAZ
dialog: If God intended our proximity to
dialog: Asia, do you believe he would have
dialog: waited for you to show it to the
dialog: world?
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Did He not choose a carpenter's son
dialog: to reveal Himself to the world?
text: A hum of interest. CLOSE ON SANCHEZ -- watching COLUMBUS
text: intently, a hint of an admiring smile on his lips.
speaker_heading: AROJAZ
dialog: So you consider yourself the chosen
dialog: one?
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: AROJAZ
dialog: Don't you realize your words could
dialog: be considered heretical?
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: Blind faith is what I consider
dialog: heresy!
text: The murmur turns to an audible gasp. AROJAZ gets to his
text: feet and leans forward, threateningly, the flame of a
text: candle only inches from his face.
text: There is absolute silence. COLUMBUS meets the MONK'S gaze
text: unflinchingly.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Asia can be found to the west -- and
dialog: I will prove it.
speaker_heading: AROJAZ
dialog: IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
scene_heading: EXT. TERRACE - UNIVERSITY - DAY
text: The JURY is alone to deliberate. Food and wine has been
text: laid out on tables. In the distance, students' cries
text: carry over the conversation.
text: SANCHEZ approaches.
speaker_heading: AROJAZ
dialog: The Treasurer of Spain honors us
text: with his presence.
text: SANCHEZ bows slightly.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: The State has some reason to be
dialog: interested in this man's
dialog: proposition, Your Eminence...
speaker_heading: AROJAZ
dialog: The Judgment is ours!
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: Naturally. But I would really
dialog: deplore the loss of such a potential
dialog: opportunity for Spain for a...
dialog: dispute over a point of geography.
text: SANCHEZ helps himself to some grapes, looks round at the
dialog: other members of the committee, who pretend not to be
text: listening.
speaker_heading: AROJAZ
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: He is a mercenary! Did he not
dialog: already try to convince the King of
dialog: Portugal of his absurd notions?
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: Indeed. The world is full of
dialog: mercenaries -- and states often make
dialog: use of them, when it benefits them.
dialog: (casually)
dialog: My only concern is the welfare and
dialog: prosperity of Spain.
text: AROJAZ understands the hint, and stops smiling.
speaker_heading: AROJAZ
dialog: You would use your influence to
dialog: assist this... intriguer?
text: SANCHEZ reaches for a decanter of sherry.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: You know, Your Eminence, the
dialog: fascinating thing about power, is
dialog: that what can be given so
dialog: effortlessly...
text: He offers the decanter to AROJAZ, who automatically lifts
text: his glass. But instead, SANCHEZ pulls back the decanter,
text: pours himself a drink, and replaces it on the table,
text: leaving AROJAZ staring at his own empty glass.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: ... can so easily be taken away.
text: And he drinks with a smile.
scene_heading: INT. LA RABIDA - MARCHENA'S STUDY - EVENING
text: MARCHENA reads aloud the Commission's letter.
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: ... and therefore nothing could
dialog: justify the participation of Your
dialog: Highnesses in the venture that
dialog: relies upon such feeble assumptions,
dialog: and which any man of knowledge
dialog: would take to be impractical... if
dialog: not impossible.
text: He shakes his head, puts the letter down. COLUMBUS looks
text: appalled; devastated.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: They didn't listen. They didn't
dialog: want to listen!
text: He paces about the book-lined room.
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: You mustn't give way to despair.
dialog: You must wait.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Wait! I've waited seven years
dialog: already! How much longer do you
dialog: want me to wait?
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: If God intends you to go, then you
dialog: will go.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: Damn God!
text: MARCHENA is shocked.
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: Colon!
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Damn all of you! You all set up
dialog: theories based on what? You never
dialog: leave the safety of your studies!
dialog: Go out! Find out what the world is
dialog: about and then tell me something I
dialog: can listen to!
text: He seizes a beautiful book from MARCHENA'S desk.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: These don't mean anything! They're
dialog: full of assumptions! Out of the
dialog: heads of old men who've never been
dialog: past the end of their gardens!
text: He hurls the book across the room. MARCHENA is horrified.
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: No...! My books...!
text: COLUMBUS seizes more books from the shelves, just sweeping
text: them to the floor.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: All of them! Just lies!
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: Colon! Don't!
text: MARCHENA tries to stop him. In his fury, COLUMBUS
text: accidentally knocks the poor old MAN to the ground. His
text: cries bring three MONKS rushing into the room.
text: As COLUMBUS continues to rage and scatter books
text: everywhere, they try to stop him, struggling with this
text: big, powerful man -- to almost comical effect. Finally, a
text: short, muscular MONK delivers a quick punch that sends
text: COLUMBUS crashing to the floor.
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL OF LA RABIDA - EVENING
text: COLUMBUS lies face down on the stone floor. He is dressed
text: in a homespun robe. His arms are stretched out in
text: penance. FERNANDO and DIEGO look down at him.
speaker_heading: FERNANDO
dialog: Father?
speaker_heading: DIEGO
dialog: Sssshhhh...! One can't speak to a
dialog: man doing penance.
speaker_heading: FERNANDO
dialog: What can you do?
speaker_heading: DIEGO
dialog: Nothing. That's the point,
dialog: Fernando.
text: A pause -- and then FERNANDO lies face down on the floor
text: beside his FATHER, and stretches out his arms in the same
text: way. DIEGO is left looking on, unable to bring himself to
dialog: join them.
scene_heading: EXT. CLOISTER - LA RABIDA - DAY
text: Along the cloister, maps are drying, hanging like laundry
text: in the light breeze. COLUMBUS pins up a new addition.
text: Another MONK works nearby, in silence.
speaker_heading: PINZON (O.S.)
dialog: Senor Colon?
text: COLUMBUS turns, to see a small, stocky MAN approaching: a
text: middle-class gentleman. He nods.
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: Ah, thank God! I've been looking
dialog: all over Seville for you! Never
dialog: expected to find a sailor in a
dialog: monastery, eh?
text: He laughs. COLUMBUS smiles, but doesn't say anything.
text: PINZON is clearly a little surprised.
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: Name's Pinzon, by the way. Martin
dialog: Alonzo Pinzon. I'm a ship owner
dialog: from Palos...
text: COLUMBUS glances around cautiously, and walks a little way
text: down the cloister, away from the other MONK, gesturing for
text: PINZON to follow him. PINZON is yet more surprised by
dialog: this strange behavior.
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: (indicating the
dialog: monk)
dialog: Is he a spy?
text: COLUMBUS shakes his head. PINZON stares at him,
text: perplexed.
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: What is it? Are you a Trappist?
text: COLUMBUS shakes his head again.
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: Vow of silence...? Penance?
text: COLUMBUS nods vigorously.
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: Jesus! Just my luck!
text: He takes off his hat, wiping his forehead with a silk
dialog: cloth.
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: Listen. I'll do the talking for
dialog: both of us. You just nod. Agreed?
dialog: Just as I do with the wife.
text: COLUMBUS nods.
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: I know that the Commission turned
dialog: you down, right? What do you
dialog: expect? You're a foreigner... But I
dialog: want to help you.
text: COLUMBUS gives him a glance like one throws a question in
text: the air.
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: You wonder why I believe in you?
dialog: Hey, I am a seaman. And we don't
dialog: like to be told where to go, and
dialog: where not to go.
text: COLUMBUS looks at him, and bursts out laughing. The other
text: MONK looks round severely. COLUMBUS ducks behind a map,
text: PINZON following him. PINZON lowers his voice.
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: I don't look like it, but I have
dialog: friends at the Court. The Treasurer
dialog: of Aragon, for example. He finances
dialog: me. His name's Santangel. Ever
dialog: heard of him?
text: COLUMBUS shakes his head, but looks increasingly
text: interested by what he's hearing.
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: He can get you an audience with the
dialog: Queen! You know why...? She owes
dialog: him money. That's how it is. You
dialog: -- me -- the Queen -- the world and
dialog: his mistress -- agreed?
text: COLUMBUS nods.
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: So. What do you say?
text: COLUMBUS looks around, catches the disapproving face of
text: the MONK, crosses himself, then speaks:
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Where can I meet this man?
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: (indicating with a
dialog: nod)
dialog: Immediately.
text: COLUMBUS turns and sees an elegant Lord in his fifties,
text: examining the maps.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF GRANADA - DAY
text: A huge Islamic Crescent being pulled down from the minaret
text: of a mosque. SOLDIERS are holding back a crowd at the
text: foot of the tower. To the ecstatic cries of the crowd, a
text: Cross is hoisted up in its place... Astride horses,
text: COLUMBUS and the Treasurer SANTANGEL are watching the
text: scene.
text: They push through an extraordinary scene. The city of
dialog: Granada has just been reclaimed from the moors after
text: several years of siege. All around them, SPANISH SOLDIERS
text: are herding, bedraggled columns of the defeated MOORS,
text: bearing only a few possessions. Ragged, half-starved men,
dialog: women and children.
speaker_heading: SANTANGEL
dialog: These people built Granada...
dialog: Centuries ago! It is a great
dialog: victory over the Moors, Don Colon --
dialog: and yet what a tragedy it is!
text: The THREE HORSEMEN pass a procession of grateful
text: PENITENTS, who are crawling on their knees, chanting
text: psalms and flagellating themselves. At the head of the
text: procession, HOODED PRIESTS carry a statue of the Virgin
text: Mary swathed in silk and lace.
text: The gates of the Alhambra Palace are in sight.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Is this a good time to meet her?
speaker_heading: SANTANGEL
dialog: It couldn't be better. Victors
dialog: can't say no.
text: Bells are pealing triumphantly. The noise is tumultuous.
text: They ride towards the magnificent palace.
scene_heading: EXT. ALHAMBRA PALACE - GARDENS - DAY
dialog: Fabulous Moorish gardens: ponds filled with golden carp;
text: exotic bird cages hang from lemon trees... The distant
text: sounds of victory.
text: SANTANGEL and COLUMBUS walk through the gardens, escorted
text: by HALBERDIERS. SOLDIERS pass by, carrying coffers or
text: piles of documents.
text: As they approach the inner sanctum, however, there are
text: fewer people. They stop by the Lion's Fountain, where
text: several DIGNITARIES are waiting patiently for an audience.
text: SANCHEZ appears. They bow. SANTANGEL approaches to
dialog: murmur a compliment.
speaker_heading: SANTANGEL
dialog: Your Excellency... truly grateful...
dialog: your help... as ever...
text: SANCHEZ protests softly, and looks over at COLUMBUS, a
text: half-smile forming on his lips. Then a DUENA appears, and
text: motions for COLUMBUS to follow.
scene_heading: INT. ALHAMBRA PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY
text: An ornate Moorish door is pushed open by the DUENA'S hand.
text: We enter the Throne Room -- sculptured colonnades,
text: mosaics... At the far end, windows open onto a view of
text: Granada's rooftops.
text: Against this dazzling light, the delicate silhouette of
text: QUEEN ISABEL OF SPAIN. The light in her blonde hair
text: creates a halo around her head as she turns. COLUMBUS
text: falls to his knees.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Rise...! Come forward!
text: He approaches the window, stopping close to her. ISABEL
text: scrutinizes him quickly.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: I should not even be listening to
dialog: you, since my council said no. But
dialog: Santangel tells me you are a man of
dialog: honor and sincerity... And Sanchez,
dialog: that you are not a fool.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (bold)
dialog: No more than the woman who said she
dialog: would take Granada from the Moors.
text: ISABEL smiles, enjoying the lack of obsequiousness.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: The ocean is uncrossable?
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: What did they say about Granada
dialog: before today?
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: That she was impregnable.
text: ISABEL smiles again.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: I cannot ignore the verdict of my
dialog: council.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Surely you can do anything you want.
text: A direct challenge. She doesn't know what to make of this
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: How little you know.
text: This little hint of vulnerability subtly reverses their
text: positions for a moment. Now we sense COLUMBUS
text: scrutinizing her.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: May I speak freely?
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: You show no inclination to speak
dialog: otherwise!
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: I know what I see. I see someone
dialog: who doesn't accept the world as it
dialog: is. Who's not afraid. I see a
dialog: women who thinks... "What if?"...
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: (amused at his
dialog: familiarity)
dialog: A woman?
text: A slight pause.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Forgive me... but you're the only
dialog: Queen I know.
text: She bursts out laughing.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Then we are equal... since you are
dialog: the only sailor I know!
dialog: A beat.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: How old are you, Senor Colon?
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And
dialog: you?
text: Once again taken off guard, ISABEL flushes, and turns away
text: slightly to hide it.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Thirty eight...
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: You will be informed of our
dialog: decision.
text: COLUMBUS bows and goes to leave. As the DUENA opens the
text: door for him, he turns back.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Actually, I thought you were younger
dialog: than me!
text: And he goes out, leaving her stunned.
scene_heading: EXT. SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - TREE-LINED ROAD - DAY
text: A chalk white road, lined with trees. Two liveried
text: SERVANTS are walking down the road, one carrying a large
text: silver tray, the other a smaller tray.
text: They are overtaken by an ADMINISTRATOR who hurries along
text: the road, with documents under his arm.
scene_heading: EXT. SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - STABLE BLOCK AND PADDOCK - DAY
text: The CLERK enters an imposing stable block.
text: In the paddock, SANCHEZ is training a magnificent young
text: horse, making it step sideways, bending it to his will.
text: The ADMINISTRATOR watches him, unable to interrupt.
text: Behind him the two SERVANTS can be seen bringing in the
text: silver trays, with covered dishes of food, a decanter of
text: wine. They begin to lay them out on a table.
scene_heading: EXT. SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - STABLE BLOCK AND PADDOCK - LATER
text: SANCHEZ pours himself some wine, tucks into his his food,
text: while the ADMINISTRATOR, clearly working himself up into a
text: frenzy, reads from a document.
speaker_heading: ADMINISTRATOR
dialog: ... and he demands... he DEMANDS to
dialog: be made a Knight, with the right to
dialog: bear the Golden Spurs! He will
dialog: receive the title of Don Cristobal
dialog: Colon -- which will be extended to
dialog: his descendants for ever more...
text: The ADMINISTRATOR looks up. He is reading the contract
text: that COLUMBUS has proposed. SANCHEZ, his mouth full,
text: gestures for him to continue.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: Go on!
speaker_heading: ADMINISTRATOR
dialog: He will be named Great Admiral of
dialog: the Ocean Sea. Viceroy of the West
dialog: Indies... Governor of all islands or
dialog: lands discovered or as will be
dialog: discovered with his help...
text: The ADMINISTRATOR looks up again.
speaker_heading: ADMINISTRATOR
dialog: The highest titles of nobility, Your
dialog: Excellency! To an immigrant
dialog: sheltered by monks!
text: SANCHEZ gestures for the document. Wipes his mouth.
text: Continues reading, calmly:
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: Furthermore he will receive one
dialog: eight of all wealth or monies,
dialog: precious gems, pearls, metals,
dialog: spices and other lucrative sources
dialog: conquered within the boundaries of
dialog: his admiralty...
text: He smiles, hands the document back.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: It's very underdone.
speaker_heading: ADMINISTRATOR
dialog: (exploding)
dialog: Underdone! It's monstrous,
dialog: Excellency!
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
text: No, the pheasant. It's almost raw.
text: And he carries on eating.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: You worry too much, Carvajal... The
dialog: man will have to lower his demands.
dialog: Believe me, he WILL!
scene_heading: INT. ALHAMBRA PALACE - A RECEPTION ROOM - DAY
text: Close up on COLUMBUS.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: I WON'T!
text: A WOMAN'S HAND quietly, carefully opens a cover of a spy
text: hole in the wall. Two beautiful eyes peer through a
text: grille, into the next room.
dialog: What they see:
text: SANCHEZ and COLUMBUS together. COLUMBUS is visibly upset.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: We have considered your -- demands
dialog: very carefully, Senor Colon... Your
dialog: expectations are... excessive, in
dialog: every way.
text: COLUMBUS tightens his fists, tries to remain calm.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: If I am right, my requests are fair!
text: SANCHEZ holds up a document.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: We have prepared our own contract...
text: He offers the document to COLUMBUS, who takes it, scans it
text: quickly, shakes his head.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: NO...! I have waited too long,
dialog: fought too hard. Now you expect me
dialog: to take all the risks while you take
dialog: the profit! No... I will not be
dialog: your servant!
text: The eyes behind the screen -- the mouth, forming a little
text: smile.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: I remind you, Senor Colon, that you
dialog: are in no position to bargain with
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: I'm not bargaining!
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: (steely)
dialog: Then you are too ambitious.
text: COLUMBUS leans over the table, faces him.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: And were you never ambitious,
dialog: Excellency? Or is ambition only a
dialog: virtue among the nobles, a fault for
dialog: the rest of us?
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: (abrupt)
dialog: If you won't accept our proposal,
dialog: we'll simply find someone who will.
text: COLUMBUS smiles.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: If you can do that, Excellency --
dialog: I'll become a monk!
text: He turns, strides towards the door. We hear a WOMAN'S
text: muffled laughter.
text: As COLUMBUS goes out, ISABEL appears through a secret
text: door. SANCHEZ bows.
text: ISABEL goes over to the window and looks out.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: You were right, Don Sanchez... His
dialog: demands could never be granted.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: Never, Your Majesty. Although...
text: She turns, questioningly, towards him.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: ... Although one may always
dialog: renegotiate a contract. Especially
dialog: signed by Royal Hands.
scene_heading: EXT. ALHAMBRA PALACE GARDENS - POV - DAY
text: SANCHEZ joins ISABEL at the window. They see COLUMBUS
text: striding out and away.
scene_heading: INT. ALHAMBRA PALACE - A RECEPTION ROOM - DAY
text: BACK TO SANCHEZ
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: ... Into a monk...
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: Yes. It would be a pity, wouldn't
dialog: it?
dialog: (turning to Sanchez)
dialog: Call him back!
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - EVENING
text: Teeming life. COLUMBUS pushing his way through crowds.
text: He is expressionless and distracted.
text: He looks around him, stops walking. And then,
text: unexpectedly, shouts.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: YEEEEEEES!
text: All heads turn as if he were totally insane. He walks on
text: as if nothing happened.
scene_heading: INT. BEATRIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: COLUMBUS is sitting at the kitchen table, by himself, with
text: a glass of wine. There is a movement behind him. BEATRIX
text: is standing at the foot of the stairs, in a night-shirt.
text: COLUMBUS turns and looks at her, almost sad.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: She said yes.
speaker_heading: BEATRIX
dialog: (moved)
dialog: Thank God...
text: She smiles. But he seems to be unable to share her
dialog: happiness.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: If I ever come back, I swear I
dialog: will...
text: She crosses to him quickly, placing her hand gently on his
text: mouth.
speaker_heading: BEATRIX
dialog: (softly)
dialog: I'm not asking you to swear to
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: I don't want you to wait for me.
speaker_heading: BEATRIX
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: That's something you can't decide.
text: COLUMBUS kisses her.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - BEATRIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Strange, unearthly music... A flickering light in a dark
text: tunnel. FERNANDO, holding a candle in front of him, walks
text: slowly down the dark corridor.
text: Quietly opening a door, he walks into COLUMBUS' study.
scene_heading: INT. COLUMBUS' STUDY - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON: A huge illustrated map of western Europe and
text: Asia. FERNANDO'S candle moves slowly across the Atlantic
text: Ocean, to the edge of the map. There, the illustrator's
dialog: imagination has created monsters: terrifying demons;
dialog: creatures half-human, half-animal.
text: Sitting at his desk, COLUMBUS is looking at the map.
speaker_heading: FERNANDO (O.S.)
dialog: You can't go there!
text: Turning, COLUMBUS finds his son beside him.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Why not?
text: FERNANDO points at the monsters. He pulls the boy to him.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: There aren't any monsters, Fernando.
dialog: The only monsters are in here...
dialog: (he taps his own
dialog: forehead)
dialog: Watch!
text: He takes a pen, and draws a smile on one of the terrible
text: monsters, transforming it at once. FERNANDO laughs
dialog: immediately.
speaker_heading: FERNANDO
dialog: I want to go with you!
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: There'll be a time.
speaker_heading: FERNANDO
dialog: You promise?
dialog: (Columbus nods his
dialog: head)
dialog: Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
text: FERNANDO pulls the chain with the St. Christopher medal
text: from under COLUMBUS' shirt.
speaker_heading: FERNANDO
dialog: Do you swear on all the Holy Saints
dialog: in heaven?
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
text: And he hugs his SON tightly.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLSIDE AND GATE - PRE-DAWN
text: A luminous procession passes through a Moorish stone gate,
text: down to the harbor. We see the faces of the SAILORS and
text: their FAMILIES -- COLUMBUS, PINZON AMONGST THEM -- We
text: sense the fervor and apprehension of the departure. The
text: procession is lead by MARCHENA and four young NOVICES
text: carrying the Madonna. All hold long, burning tapers,
text: saying the rosary. A SAILOR pushes through the crowd, and
text: kisses the Madonna's feet.
scene_heading: EXT. PALOS HARBOR - DAWN
text: Hundreds of candles flicker in the pre-dawn light, held by
text: the FAMILIES and FRIENDS of the SAILORS.
text: The SANTA MARIA the PINTA and the NINA nestle against the

dialog: fishing craft, returning from night fishing, accidentally
dialog: witness this event.
scene_heading: EXT. MAKESHIFT CONFESSIONAL - DOCKSIDE - DAWN
text: MARCHENA sits on a barrel and crosses himself. Behind a

speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: In Nomine Patris et Filius, et
dialog: Spiritus Sancti.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Forgive me, Father. For I have
dialog: sinned.
text: MARCHENA recognizes COLUMBUS' voice.
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: I am listening, my son.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Father, I have betrayed my family.
dialog: I betrayed my men. And I betrayed
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: What are you saying?
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: I lied. The journey will be longer
dialog: than I said.
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: How long?
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: I am not sure... It could be twice
text: the distance.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: May God forgive you...! You must
dialog: tell them! You must tell your men!
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: If I tell them, they won't follow
dialog: me. You know that I am right,
dialog: Father. You trust me...
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: My son, my son...
dialog: (he shakes his head)
dialog: Your certitudes are sometimes
dialog: frightening...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Christopher, you must speak to them.
dialog: And if you don't I will.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: You are bound by an oath, Father.
text: A long silence.
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: I believed in you...
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Give me absolution.
text: No response.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Give me absolution, Father!
text: Devastated, MARCHENA reluctantly makes the sign of the
text: cross.
scene_heading: EXT. HARBOR AND SHIPS - PALOS - DAWN
text: COLUMBUS walks over to where BEATRIX and FERNANDO are
text: waiting. He kisses and hugs FERNANDO.
speaker_heading: MARCHENA (O.S.)
dialog: Ispo Te Absoluto. May God forgive
dialog: you and have mercy on your soul,
dialog: Christopher Columbus. Go in peace.
text: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HARBOR AND SHIPS - DAWN - LATER
text: The CROWDED QUAYSIDE. COLUMBUS stands in front of
text: FERNANDO.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Be good to your mother, Fernando.
dialog: Do you promise?
text: FERNANDO nods, tears in his eyes. Then COLUMBUS embraces
text: BEATRIX tightly. She whispers into his ear.
speaker_heading: BEATRIX
dialog: Speak to Diego.
text: But COLUMBUS and DIEGO are unable to find words, and
text: instead they clumsily hug. Someone taps COLUMBUS'
text: shoulder. He turns around to see SANTANGEL. Wordlessly,
text: they hug.
text: CUT TO:
text: Activity on the ships, orders are being shouted, ropes
text: fore and aft are cast off, splashing into the water... Now
text: the SHIPS are slowly moving parallel to the quayside. The
text: CROWD starts walking abreast to the VESSELS. WOMEN
text: holding up babies, blowing kisses, old PARENTS crying...
text: BEATRIX, HER SONS, AND SANTANGEL are among them.
text: COLUMBUS suddenly unties the chain around his neck, and
text: throws it at DIEGO.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Diego! Here!
text: DIEGO catches it. Opening his hand he looks at the
text: medallion. Then looks up at his FATHER, elated.
text: THE SANTA MARIA is now two meters from the QUAY.
text: SANTANGEL is now opposite COLUMBUS.
speaker_heading: SANTANGEL
dialog: (casually)
dialog: Take care of my investment, wherever
dialog: you're going!
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (ambiguous)
dialog: I have to tell you Santangel. I
dialog: don't know where on earth I am
dialog: going!
text: They both laugh.
text: A FISHERMAN, standing in his shrimp-boat lets his hand
text: slide gently along the gigantic hull. He stares up at the
text: SAILORS leaning on the rail.
speaker_heading: SAILOR
dialog: Vaya con Dios! (Go with God!)
text: They wave back.
text: CUT TO:
text: MARCHENA walking towards the Moorish gate. He finally
text: turns, sad and distraught. He sees:
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SHIPS AT SEA - WHALES - DAY
text: THREE SHIPS ON A BOUNDLESS OCEAN.
text: The sea resembling a DORMANT MONSTER, holding its breath.
dialog: A living being, all powerful, capable of unpredictable
text: metamorphosis. Music reflects the loneliness, the anxiety
dialog: of the crew, the fear of the unknown...
text: ENORMOUS WHALES moving slowly alongside, surging
text: majestically through the waves. Sinking back,
text: disappearing, their cries taking precedent over the music.
scene_heading: EXT. DECK - DAY
text: A SHIP'S BOY is throwing buckets of water on the deck.
text: A SAILOR is busy clearing the ropes around the mast.
text: A COOK is blowing life into a brazier, in preparation of

text: TEN MEN heaving on a heavy rope, raising the top sail,

scene_heading: EXT. SANTA MARIA - NIGHT
text: The crystalline north star -- as if seen through an
dialog: instrument.
text: COLUMBUS' silhouette, by an oil lamp, standing at the
text: prow. Holding a quadrant he is aiming at the stars.
text: SOME SAILORS are watching with curiosity. One of them is
text: ALONSO, a rough, stocky Basque.
text: Near COLUMBUS, on a tressel, various books and charts. He
text: makes an entry in the log. Then goes back to his
text: quadrant. He senses MENDEZ standing next to him.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Due west, Captain Mendez. And may
dialog: God be with us...
speaker_heading: MENDEZ
dialog: God be with us admiral.
text: MENDEZ doesn't move, continuing to observe COLUMBUS.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: What is it Mendez? Speak!
text: MENDEZ is hesitant. He nervously clears his throat.
speaker_heading: MENDEZ
dialog: Well... It's the men, Sir. They
dialog: wonder how you know our position.
dialog: We've lost sight from land days
dialog: ago...
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (still taking
dialog: readings)
dialog: And what do you think Mendez?
speaker_heading: MENDEZ
dialog: Well, I surely know what a quadrant
dialog: is! But I've never seen it used at
dialog: night before.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Come over here.
text: MENDEZ hesitates, then motions to COLUMBUS. The SAILORS
text: are watching, and some approach to hear the conversation.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Now, find the North Star. Do you
dialog: have it?
text: CUT TO:
text: The picture swims across the heavens, until we see the
text: north star.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS (O.S.)
dialog: Steady yourself...! Keep the plumb
dialog: line vertical...
text: The picture steadies.
text: CUT TO:
text: MENDEZ nods -- and loses equilibrium. The plumb line
dialog: swings.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Don't move! A mistake of one degree
dialog: and we'll be off 6,000 leagues!
text: MENDEZ tries again.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: What do you read?
speaker_heading: MENDEZ
dialog: Twenty eight.
text: MENDEZ turns to COLUMBUS.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: That's it. The twenty eighth
dialog: parallel. And we'll follow it until
dialog: we reach land.
text: ALONSO does not seem convinced.
speaker_heading: ALONSO
dialog: How do you know land is on the
dialog: twenty eighth parallel?
scene_heading: EXT. SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY
text: A blazing sun. The ship is like a furnace, its brass
text: fittings too hot to touch, the blistering heat making the
text: air shimmer over the decks.
text: Desperate for shade, sailors are sheltering under the
text: sagging prow sail.
text: The SHIP'S BOY throws an empty bucket attached to a rope
text: over the side and hauls it back up again, brimming with
text: water. As he turns, we see his face, disfigured by a hair
text: lip. He drenches himself... From the shade, ALONSO
text: watches him.
speaker_heading: ALONSO
dialog: Chicken-ass face!
text: The others laugh. The BOY, ashamed, tries to ignore them.
text: ALONSO'S hand accidentally touches a brass fitting; he
text: reacts like he was burnt.
speaker_heading: ALONSO
dialog: Shit!
text: He sucks his blistered fingers.
speaker_heading: ALONSO
dialog: I never seen heat like this! Not
dialog: even in Las Minas!
speaker_heading: SAILOR
dialog: The water's going putrid in the
dialog: barrels.
speaker_heading: ALONSO
dialog: You'll be drinking your own piss...
dialog: For the glory of Spain... and
dialog: Admiral Colon...! Bastard!
text: The SHIP'S BOY glances round at them.
speaker_heading: ALONSO
dialog: What are you listening to, chicken
dialog: ass?
speaker_heading: SAILOR
dialog: Ah, leave him alone. He's doing no
dialog: harm.
speaker_heading: ALONSO
dialog: With a face like that?
dialog: (to boy)
dialog: I don't want you looking at me. You
dialog: hear?
text: The BOY turns away, dropping the bucket back into the sea.
speaker_heading: ALONSO
dialog: He's the devil's child...
speaker_heading: SAILOR
dialog: We'll all go crazy...
text: The BOY throws more water over the deck. A SAILOR takes
text: his guitar, and starts singing an improvised song.
speaker_heading: SAILOR
dialog: Culo de galina es el hijo del
dialog: demonio... (Chicken ass mouth is the
dialog: devil's child... Born from the loins
dialog: of a stinky old goat etc...)
text: They all laugh. The BOY, hearing this, climbs to the
dialog: crow's-nest like a monkey.
scene_heading: EXT. SANTA MARIA - RIGGING AND CROW'S-NEST - DAY
text: We experience a sense of vertigo as we near the top of the
text: main mast, high above the rolling deck.
text: The BOY curls like a fetus in the swinging crow's-nest,
text: exhausted by the heat, and scared. His eyes are turning
text: white. He begins to piss himself...
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY
text: Piss is dripping on the deck. THE SAILORS do not seem to
text: care. THE COOK takes a chicken from a cage. He breaks
text: its neck, and starts plucking it. The OTHERS continue
text: their bitter conversation.
speaker_heading: ALONSO
dialog: We should have seen land.
speaker_heading: SAILOR
dialog: We left three weeks ago, Alonso.
dialog: Can't be that near.
speaker_heading: ALONSO
dialog: Can't be that far, I say. Also, I
dialog: don't like the smell of the sea
text: around here. Smells like a cunt.
dialog: Bad sign...
text: The COOK starts laughing. They turn to him.
speaker_heading: COOK
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: Of course it smells like it! That's
dialog: why sailors take to the sea!
text: They all laugh. Alonso looks up at COLUMBUS standing on
text: the poop deck, scrutinizing the horizon, waiting for the
text: land to appear.
speaker_heading: ALONSO
dialog: And why does this one take to the
dialog: sea? Nobody knows. Never says a
dialog: word...
text: MENDEZ has sensed the danger of this lack of respect. He
text: approaches them.
speaker_heading: MENDEZ
dialog: To your post! At once!
text: They split in silence.
scene_heading: EXT. SANTA MARIA - DECK - NIGHT
text: The SHIP is plowing on, pushed by a hot wind -- SAILORS
dialog: sleep on deck.
text: The SHIP'S BOY is singing to himself. Despite his hair
dialog: lip he has a pure, melancholy voice...
text: COLUMBUS, leaning over the prow rail, staring ahead, hears
text: it carry over the darkness.
scene_heading: EXT. SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY
text: CLOSE UP ON AN HOUR-GLASS, nearly through its time.
text: The SHIP'S BOY throws an "ampoulette" over board. We
text: follow the bulb attached to a rope, passing the full
text: length of the hull. As it reaches the poop deck, another
text: SAILOR shouts "MARK". A very primitive system of
dialog: calculation for distance and speed.
text: Sitting near the SHIP'S BOY, COLUMBUS is making entries in
text: a log-book, watching the hourglass.
speaker_heading: SHIP'S BOY
dialog: Mark. Twenty nine, Sir!
text: THE HOUR-GLASS runs out. COLUMBUS converts the mark into
dialog: a daily average for distance and speed.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Six hundred and twenty nine.
text: THE SHIP'S BOY cups his hands to his mouth to shout.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PINTA - DAY
text: PINZON, his OFFICERS beside him, looks across at the SANTA
speaker_heading: MARIA.
speaker_heading: SHIP'S BOY
dialog: Six hundred and twenty nine!
text: AN OFFICER turns to PINZON to repeat the message.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Six hundred and twenty nine, Sir!
text: PINZON does not seem too pleased.
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: I heard.
text: THE OFFICER examines his own calculations.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Captain, I don't understand.
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: I think I do.
text: He goes back to his cabin.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SHIPS - SARGASSO SEA - DAY
text: ABSOLUTE STILLNESS. A FURNACE. The three ships like
text: dots, on what seems to be a prairie of weed.
text: The caravels are being towed by three rowing boats.
text: CLOSE ON THE MEN, rowing, drenched with sweat.
text: FROM THE PROW, COLUMBUS is staring at the horizon.
text: ALONSO pulling at his oars stares at COLUMBUS' distant
text: figure with hate and resentment.
text: ALONSO suddenly ships his oars, throwing the whole boat
dialog: into disarray. Chaos.
text: Total silence. MENDEZ and ALONSO stare at each other.
speaker_heading: MENDEZ
dialog: Continue rowing!
speaker_heading: ALONSO
dialog: To where?
text: ALONSO defiantly stares at MENDEZ. He then starts to beat
text: a rhythm on the hull with his fist, followed by the
text: others. In the two other boats, the MEN begin to follow
text: suit, beating a rhythm of protest on the hulls.
text: MENDEZ looks up to COLUMBUS, in panic.
text: ON BOARD PINZON'S SHIP, an OFFICER cups his hands to his
text: mouth.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Captain Pinzon requests permission
dialog: to board.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SANTA MARIA - DAY
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Granted.
scene_heading: INT. COLUMBUS' CABIN - DAY
text: PINZON enters. He looks furious.
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: You lied! You cheated! We're way
dialog: past 750 leagues!
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: Six days ago, yes.
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: You must be mad...!
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: We have to keep the hopes of these
dialog: men alive!
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: We're on the verge of a mutiny,
dialog: Colon!
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: You think I don't know that?
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: We're lost!
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: The land is there. I know it!
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: You don't know anything! Listen
dialog: Colon, these are my ships, right?
dialog: So I'm telling you we're turning
dialog: back!
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: And then what? Half of the water
dialog: has gone, the rest is nearly putrid!
dialog: You know that!
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: (apoplectic)
dialog: Jesus Maria! I should have never
dialog: listened to you!
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: You never did. You did all the
dialog: talking for both of us, remember?
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: You bloody...
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now
dialog: is go forward! Think about that!
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: You tell that to them!
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: You're right. Let the men decide.
text: COLUMBUS moves to the door. As an afterthought, he takes
text: his scarlet-embroidered jacket from a hook.
scene_heading: EXT. SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY
text: Most of the men are now back on board.
text: They go silent as COLUMBUS appears. He walks slowly over
text: to them. All, including ALONSO, are surly, threatening...
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Who gave you the order to come on
dialog: board?
text: He looks up and down the line, finishing on ALONSO. They
text: stare at one another.
speaker_heading: ALONSO
dialog: God doesn't want us to cross the
dialog: ocean...! This voyage is cursed!
text: Some of the MEN murmur their agreement.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Cursed?
speaker_heading: ALONSO
dialog: We set sail for greed. God has
dialog: abandoned us. The voyage is cursed.
text: There are signs...
text: ALONSO glances towards the SHIP'S BOY, with his hair lip.
text: The BOY lowers his eyes. COLUMBUS moves towards him,
text: pulls him forward, stands him in front of ALONSO.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: This boy has the voice of an angel.
text: What comes out of his mouth is
dialog: blessed, Alonso. What comes out of
dialog: your is evil.
text: Some of the men laugh at this statement. ALONSO is ill at
text: ease. COLUMBUS pauses, looks around at all the MEN.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Listen to me! Every man is afraid
dialog: who does something for the first
dialog: time. But those who overcome their
dialog: fears, will find their rewards. I
dialog: do not know if it is God's will that
dialog: we cross this ocean -- but I am
dialog: certain it is the devil who puts
dialog: fears into our hearts...
text: The MEN are listening. We sense a subtle change of
dialog: mood...
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: This jacket to the first man who
dialog: sights land! I want a man up that
dialog: mast day and night.
text: COLUMBUS points at the SHIP'S BOY.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: You start first.
text: The SHIP'S BOY rushes up the mast. As he climbs, the
text: mainsail starts to fill with wind. The deck begins to
text: move under their feet.
text: This movement under their feet seems to imperceptibly
dialog: erase the fears and the angers.
speaker_heading: MENDEZ
dialog: Alonso! Jaime! Don't let this wind
dialog: escape us.
text: CRIES from the other ships, as the sails snap taut,
text: filling with wind. MEN rush to their posts. PINZON
text: stares at COLUMBUS, shaking his head in disbelief.
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: (murmuring)
dialog: You lucky bastard...
text: COLUMBUS walks away to his cabin, then turning back to
speaker_heading: PINZON.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Pinzon, the more I sail, the luckier
dialog: I get.
text: Turning abruptly, he enters his cabin.
scene_heading: EXT. SANTA MARIA - PROW - MISTY NIGHT
text: COLUMBUS is seated, isolated at the prow, wrapped in his
text: cape, struggling against the sleep. MENDEZ approaches him
text: with a bowl of soup.
speaker_heading: MENDEZ
dialog: Shall I take my turn?
text: COLUMBUS shakes his head no, and starts drinking from the
dialog: bowl.
text: CUT TO:
text: COLUMBUS' head nods lower and lower to his chest. He is
text: asleep. We become aware of a sharp buzzing sound. It
text: becomes louder as we move closer to COLUMBUS' face.
text: A mosquito lands on his temple. COLUMBUS reflexively
text: slaps it. He wakes up, and looks at his fingers -- a spot
text: of blood, a crushed mosquito. He stares at it for a
text: moment. Then slowly gets to his feet.
scene_heading: EXT. SANTA MARIA - DECK - NIGHT
text: In the luminous moonlight, COLUMBUS is standing, staring
text: up at thousands of insects that wheel around the mast
text: lantern. We hear the flutter of their wings and see the
text: bats as they swoop and dive in a feeding frenzy.
text: COLUMBUS turns, stares into the darkness, desperate to see
dialog: the land that must be close.
text: He kneels by MENDEZ, wrapped in a blanket. He touches his
text: shoulder.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (murmuring)
dialog: Mendez! Mendez!
text: MENDEZ grimaces, and opens one eye.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Land...
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SHIP - DAWN
text: An opaque dawn. COLUMBUS, riveted, staring forward as if
text: to pierce the mist. The entire crew are clinging to the
text: rail, and standing on the shrouds.
text: Suddenly, the SHIP BOY'S voice cracking with emotion.
speaker_heading: SHIP'S BOY
dialog: TIERRA...! TIERRA!
text: COLUMBUS strains his eyes; he still can not see anything.
text: The entire CREW stand and stare, silent, holding their
text: breath.
text: As the sun begins to rise, the fog dissipates -- slowly,
text: exquisitely, revealing a single palm, so close it seems
text: almost as though they could touch it. Then a white slash
text: of beach.
text: Near COLUMBUS, a SAILOR falls to his knees and burst into
text: tears. Others laugh with joy. COLUMBUS watches this
text: vision in disbelief, his mouth open as if it were
text: difficult for him to breathe. Tears come to his eyes. He
text: closes them. Then opens them again. The land is there --
dialog: a green paradise.
text: On screen the words: OCTOBER 12, 1942. GUANAHAN ISLAND
scene_heading: EXT. BOATS - DAY
text: Three row boats plunging through the surf towards the
text: beach. COLUMBUS stands in the prow of the first boat.
text: MENDEZ is in the second. PINZON the third. They stare
text: entranced at the lushness of the foliage, and the blue
dialog: clarity of the water...
text: As the first boat beaches, COLUMBUS leaps out and wades
text: ashore. Behind him the rest of the landing party splash
text: through the sun-dazzled water, carrying the banner of
dialog: Castille and Aragon.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - DAY
text: They stand on the beach, almost in a dream. There is
text: silence. The ROYAL NOTARY, ludicrously overdressed, now
text: wet through, stumbles over to COLUMBUS and holds out his
text: contract and a pen. COLUMBUS scrawls his name.
text: The MEN stare at him, filled not only with new respect,
text: but with something amounting to awe.
text: COLUMBUS turns to them, tries to speak.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: By the... by the Grace of... God...
text: He swallows. Tears have sprung to his eyes. He is so
text: moved he cannot continue. Coming to his rescue -- THE
text: SHIP'S BOY starts to roll the drum. He then stops.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (pulling himself
dialog: together)
dialog: In the name of their Gracious
dialog: Majesties of Castille and Aragon,
dialog: and by all the powers vested in me,
dialog: I claim this island and name it San
dialog: Salvador.
text: The MEN cheer as the flags are rammed into the sand,
text: flapping in the wind.
text: COLUMBUS starts to walk towards the jungle, and in silence
text: the rest follow.
scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY
text: Immediately they are met by an incredible wall of SOUND!
text: The jungle is filled with NOISE. The impossibly-loud
text: CRIES of EXOTIC BIRDS, the CHATTERING of MONKEYS. The
text: SPANIARDS are overwhelmed.
text: They move forward. Rays of sunlight pierce through the
text: high canopy of leaves, like the roof of a magnificent
text: cathedral. The sounds and smells intoxicate their senses.
text: They are filled with wonder.
text: Then PINZON stops. He has seen something. Another stops,
text: then a third, staring ahead of them...
speaker_heading: MENDEZ
dialog: (whispering
dialog: urgently)
dialog: Arquebuses!
text: Several of them raise their weapons to their shoulders,
text: pointing them into the jungle.
text: From COLUMBUS' POV we slowly scan the face of the thick
text: jungle ahead. For a moment we don't see anything -- and
text: then, with a shock, we see the first INDIAN. Naked,
text: painted like an idol, carrying a hunting lance.
text: As if they had materialized from nowhere: the rest of the
text: HUNTING PARTY, with their bows and spears. Silent.
text: Watchful. They stare back at us.
text: The SPANIARDS nervously finger their weapons.
text: COLUMBUS slowly lifts his hand into the air: a clear
text: signal not to fire. Then, removing his sword, he drops it
text: on the ground, and starts to walk forward, fixing his gaze
text: upon the first INDIAN he saw.
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: (warningly)
dialog: Colon!
text: COLUMBUS ignores him, even though some of the INDIANS have
text: raised their weapons. He stops in the no-man's land
text: between them. The INDIANS don't move -- but something
text: excites them.
text: The SHIP'S BOY, wearing COLUMBUS' embroidered jacket and
text: the drum, has followed COLUMBUS and now stands close to
dialog: him. He is the cause of their interest. COLUMBUS puts
text: his arm around the BOY, and this gesture of affection
text: seems to put the INDIANS at their ease. They start
text: talking and pointing. They come forward slowly, start to
text: tentatively touch the BOY'S jacket. Then, now laughing,
text: they touch COLUMBUS, pulling at his beard. COLUMBUS
text: laughs too.
text: Sensing their innocence, the rest of the MEN lower their
text: weapons. Some of them laugh.
text: An apparition: a beautiful young INDIAN GIRL, totally
text: naked, walks out of the jungle.
text: She is pregnant and holds a child. We begin to hear
text: Indian music, played on a flute.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY
text: A large post is lifted from the ground by two SPANIARDS
text: pulling on ropes. The post is fixed into position -- and
text: then we see that it is a large wooden cross... The INDIAN
text: VILLAGERS watch the ceremony with some interest and
dialog: amusement.
text: COLUMBUS looks over at the men and gestures at the
text: INDIANS.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: We have come here in peace, and we
dialog: will behave with honor. They are
dialog: not savages and neither will you be.
dialog: Treat these people as you would your
dialog: own wives and your own children.
dialog: Neither are you free to take what
dialog: you will; for a seashell you give a
dialog: bandana. You will respect their
dialog: beliefs. Pillage will be punished
dialog: by the whip. Rape by the sword.
scene_heading: EXT. VILLAGE - SUNSET
text: The smoke from fires. Laughter. Music playing. The
text: INDIANS have prepared food for the SPANIARDS, who are
text: drinking and enjoying themselves in this strange world.
text: COLUMBUS sits with MENDEZ, PINZON, the INDIAN CHIEF,
text: ELDERS OF THE VILLAGE. Other INDIANS stand around,
text: smiling, curious.
text: The INDIANS talk among themselves. The ELDERS smoke
dialog: primitive cigars -- and offer them, with good humor, to
text: their guests. The SPANIARDS cough and choke at first...
text: and laugh. In return, they offer the INDIANS wine...
text: Dogs roam around the campfires. The WOMEN openly suckle
text: their babies. The MEN are entranced.
text: PINZON draws out attention, for the first time, to a small
text: gold ornament on the nose of one of the INDIANS. He
text: points to it, indicates his interest in it.
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: Gold...! Gold!
text: The INDIANS says the word in his own language, laughing.
text: We see that some of the other INDIANS also have small gold
dialog: ornaments.
text: PINZON repeats the INDIAN word for gold. The INDIAN
text: removes the ornament from his nose, gives it to PINZON,
text: who indicates that he wants to have it. The INDIAN nods
text: -- but points to PINZON'S dagger, indicating that he wants
text: it in return. PINZON shakes his head, stops the INDIAN
dialog: from taking it.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (to Pinzon)
dialog: Give it to him!
text: PINZON looks at him, about to argue -- but COLUMBUS
text: insists. PINZON takes out the dagger and offers it to the
speaker_heading: INDIAN.
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: By God! That's the worst trade of
dialog: my life!
text: His friends laugh. Innocently, the INDIAN has taken it by
text: the blade. He yelps, looks down at the blood welling
text: up... A moment of tension... Then MENDEZ laughs at his
text: clumsiness, and the ELDERS laugh too... and the INDIAN
text: laughs.
text: Just outside this circle, we see the first INDIAN we saw,
text: squatting on his haunches, watching. This is UTAPAN.
scene_heading: INT. TENT - DAWN
text: The first light outside -- the strange, wonderful sounds
text: of the jungle all around. COLUMBUS writes in his journal.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS (V.O.)
dialog: October 21st, 1492. I think we have
dialog: returned to Eden. Surely this is
dialog: how the world once was, before the
dialog: beginning of time. I believe no man
dialog: will ever see this land again as we
dialog: do, for the first time...
text: He looks up. UTAPAN is squatting in the doorway of the
text: hut. He's been there all night. COLUMBUS takes more ink
text: on his quill and begins to sketch UTAPAN'S face in the
text: margin of his log-book. He draws well.
text: He gets up and walks over to UTAPAN and shows him the
text: drawing. It's an electrifying moment. UTAPAN is shocked
text: and amazed. At first he is rather frightened of his own
text: image... Then he is happy, and laughs... and COLUMBUS
text: laughs with him and puts a hand on his shoulder in a
dialog: gesture of friendship.
text: UTAPAN gets up, and indicates that he too has something he
dialog: wishes to offer.
scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE - MORNING
text: UTAPAN expertly scampering through the jungle. COLUMBUS
text: follows him.
text: UTAPAN orders COLUMBUS to sit. COLUMBUS obeys. UTAPAN
text: looks up at the tops of the trees. The sun is rising, and
text: filters through the foliage. As if the time had come,
text: UTAPAN stands up, and COLUMBUS does the same.
text: A gap in the dense vegetation. Something is glittering.
text: Gold. A mass of gold. As they approach, COLUMBUS
text: discovers --
text: A large pool of fresh water. The morning sunlight has
text: turned the water into liquid gold. The surface ripples
text: with the breeze. UTAPAN smiles. It the stranger
dialog: satisfied? Isn't this what he came for?
text: COLUMBUS plunges into the pool. As he emerges, he fills
text: his palms with liquid gold.
text: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER - DAY
text: Wide shot -- A flotilla of canoes are going upstream.
text: INDIANS AND SPANIARDS are traveling together in the
text: canoes. UTAPAN leads the expedition in COLUMBUS' craft.
text: THE SHIP BOY'S cranium is shaved like UTAPAN'S, and we
text: notice that some other crew members are beardless, some
dialog: even wearing tribal patterns.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERSIDE - DAY
text: INDIAN VILLAGERS confronting the SPANIARDS, UTAPAN talks
text: to an ELDER MAN, watched by COLUMBUS, MENDEZ and PINZON.
text: UTAPAN repeats several times the word for GOLD, showing
text: some artifacts. The OLD INDIAN shakes his head no,
text: indicating another distant place.
speaker_heading: OLD INDIAN
dialog: Cuba! Cuba!
text: THE OLD MAN nods, points into the distance, chatters away
text: to UTAPAN.
speaker_heading: UTAPAN
dialog: Say not here! Cuba!
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: What is it? A tribe? An island?
speaker_heading: UTAPAN
dialog: Island. Far.
scene_heading: EXT. SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY
text: Standing at the prow of the ship, his long dark hair
text: floating in the wind, UTAPAN rejoicing at the speed.
scene_heading: EXT. THICK JUNGLE - CUBA - DAY
text: Led by UTAPAN, the SPANIARDS hack their way through thick
text: jungle. It's hard work. The MEN sweat. This is
text: inhospitable terrain. Even the noises of the jungle seem
dialog: somehow more sinister...
text: CUT TO:
text: RESTING PLACE - ALONSO is seated under a tree. He takes
text: off his boot, and grabs his foot, examining the blisters
text: on his toes. As he puts his foot back into the boot, he
text: jumps screaming in pain.
text: ALONSO yelps, grasping his ankle.
text: CLOSE ON a snake sliding out of the empty boot.
text: While his COMPANIONS rush to him, a SAILOR spots the
text: snake, and decapitates it with his sword. UTAPAN glances
text: at the dead snake. He then goes and kneels -- he sees the
text: bite on ALONSO'S ankle.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Help him!
text: ALONSO is quiet and silent. His eyes are looking around
text: at his companions. UTAPAN shakes his head. There is
dialog: nothing he can do.
text: ALONSO is now leaning back, supported by one of his
text: friends. He has grabbed the forearm of a SAILOR. His
text: look is already far away. His companion shouts at UTAPAN.
speaker_heading: SAILOR
dialog: Do something! Help him!
speaker_heading: UTAPAN
dialog: He dead.
text: ALONSO starts convulsing. HIS FRIENDS hold him, desperate
text: in their helplessness. Others simply move away,
text: horrified. One of them cries.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER - DAY
text: Standing in the stream up to his thighs, A SPANIARD (a
text: gold expert) examines some stones. He then looks up at
text: COLUMBUS and PINZON and just throws the stones back into
text: the water without a word.
text: The group of SPANIARDS are resting, exhausted by the
text: humidity. Some are drinking from the river, others soak
text: bandanas, and tie them around their necks...
text: One after another, they stand up slowly -- they look
dialog: discouraged, tired, and beaten.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAINOUS JUNGLE - DAY
text: UTAPAN and the SPANIARDS are trekking in the hills. Fully
text: armed, they are now suffering intensely from the heat and
text: the vicious insect bites.
text: COLUMBUS doggedly keeps up with UTAPAN, who tirelessly
text: trots forward.
text: Finally, COLUMBUS turns around and sees... nobody. He
text: calls out to UTAPAN.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Utapan! Wait!
text: UTAPAN stops obediently, and rushes back to COLUMBUS with
text: comical energy.
text: On their way back, they find one SOLDIER sitting, leaning
text: against a tree. He has removed his helmet. His hair
text: sticking to his forehead.
text: As COLUMBUS and UTAPAN walk back, they find another
text: SAILOR, then another, then the whole group gathered around
text: PINZON. Ashen, he burns with fever. He attempts a smile.
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: Well... You'll have to continue
dialog: without me...
text: COLUMBUS looks around him -- what he sees: exhausted men
dialog: and jungle, as far as one can see.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: No. It's enough. What would you
dialog: say to a drop of Jerez, Pinzon?
text: PINZON grins.
speaker_heading: PINZON
dialog: And a nice slice of Santa Fe lamb!
dialog: I'd sell my soul for it.
dialog: (to his officer)
dialog: Help me up. I've got to piss, gold.
text: They all laugh as the OFFICER helps PINZON to his feet.
text: PINZON walks a few yards into the jungle -- starts to
text: urinate. It is red. Suddenly dizzy, he reels and
text: collapses.
scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY
text: A line of SPANIARDS and INDIANS threading their way down a
text: mountainside. PINZON is being carried on a makeshift
text: stretcher. His eyes are closed, his face thick with
text: sweat.
text: They enter a village, to the surprise of the INDIANS.
text: UTAPAN once again at the front as the ambassador.
scene_heading: INT. HUT - NIGHT
text: A INDIAN SHAMAN is forcing a milky fluid into PINZON'S
text: mouth. COLUMBUS attempts a gesture to prevent him. But
text: UTAPAN stops him.
speaker_heading: UTAPAN
dialog: He cures.
text: COLUMBUS nods -- he obviously trusts UTAPAN.
scene_heading: INT. CHIEF GUARIONEX'S HUT - NIGHT
text: In the half-light, figures wreathed in smoke -- COLUMBUS,
text: MENDEZ and UTAPAN watch the CHIEF GUARIONEX putting a
text: Spanish helmet on his head. The helmet is too big, almost
text: covering his eyes. The ELDERS appraise the gift with
text: solemn wonder.
text: In return, GUARIONEX hands COLUMBUS a parcel made of
text: leaves. COLUMBUS unwraps them. Inside: a GOLD grimacing
text: mask. The first real piece of gold. COLUMBUS is unable
text: to conceal his excitement at this first real evidence of
text: the metal.
text: He waits for the CHIEF to speak, but the CHIEF only looks
text: at him. On the ground, we see other presents offered by
text: the SPANIARDS -- trinkets, and necklaces...
speaker_heading: UTAPAN
dialog: (to Columbus)
dialog: You come! You speak first!
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Tell the Chief we thank him.
speaker_heading: UTAPAN
dialog: Chief knows.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Tell him his country is very
dialog: beautiful. Tell him we are leaving
dialog: men here -- to build a fort.
text: UTAPAN translates.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Tell him we will return very soon.
dialog: Many of us.
text: UTAPAN translates. The CHIEF GUARIONEX asks a simple
dialog: question.
speaker_heading: UTAPAN
dialog: Chief says -- how many?
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Thousands.
speaker_heading: UTAPAN
dialog: Why?
text: COLUMBUS doesn't seem to understand the question. For the
text: first time he seems to be caught short.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: To bring the word of God.
speaker_heading: UTAPAN
dialog: Chief says -- he has a God.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (pursuing)
dialog: ... and also to bring medicine.
speaker_heading: UTAPAN
dialog: Chief says...
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: He has medicine.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Tell him we admire his people.
text: UTAPAN translates.
speaker_heading: UTAPAN
dialog: Chief says he knows you like his...
dialog: (searches for the
dialog: word)
dialog: Women...
text: And the CHIEF gets up, awards COLUMBUS with a smile, and
text: walks out of the hut, the ELDERS following, leaving
text: COLUMBUS alone.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (with a little
dialog: smile)
dialog: That's a beginning...
scene_heading: EXT. SHORE - DAY
text: Watched from the shore by the INDIANS and by about forty
text: of the SPANIARDS, who are staying behind, the boats pull
text: out towards the two remaining ships.
text: PINZON is laid out in the bottom of the boat. COLUMBUS,
text: UTAPAN, and four other INDIANS are in the same boat.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS (V.O.)
dialog: March 1493... Thirty nine of my men
dialog: volunteered to stay behind. God
dialog: willing we will be back in less than
dialog: a year...
text: The boats continue to pull away, the figures on the shore
text: growing smaller.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. COLUMBUS' CABIN - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON: a golden mask... the lamp in the cabin swings
text: violently back and forth, creating strange shadows, as if
text: the mask was alive... COLUMBUS is writing with difficulty
text: in his log-book.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS (V.O.)
dialog: ... Several men are ill. We did not
dialog: find signs of civilization. No
dialog: cities, no temples... Nothing that
text: resembles Marco Polo's descriptions.
dialog: My ships are not filled with the
dialog: spices and the gold that Spain was
dialog: hoping for. But this land
dialog: intoxicates the senses like the
dialog: strongest of perfumes... And all I
dialog: can think of, is to return to these
dialog: untamed lands...
text: Suddenly the cabin seems to lurch over. Things fall from
text: the table, smashing on the floor... COLUMBUS nearly falls.
scene_heading: EXT. SEA - NIGHT
text: We are in the middle of a violent storm -- of terrifying
text: proportions. The thunder is deafening. Light irradiates
text: the darkness. We see the two caravels, dwarfed by the
dialog: massive seas.
scene_heading: EXT. DECK - NIGHT
text: Five MEN are struggling to lash down the tiller. The deck
text: jumps and rolls. It rises five meters into the air then
text: falls into space and hits the water with a terrible crack.
text: Waves sweep over the decks. We hear desperate cries for
text: mercy from the terrified crew, loud enough to be heard
text: above the storm.
text: COLUMBUS and MENDEZ are crawling towards the mast, along a
dialog: lifeline.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (screaming to the
dialog: sailors)
dialog: Get below! All of you! Go!
text: The MEN start to scramble below decks.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (to Mendez)
dialog: Stay with me!
text: The ship rolls again. COLUMBUS and MENDEZ crawl towards
text: the mast. Another gigantic wave crashes over them, tons
text: of water falling like cement. They reach the mast. The
text: wood groans.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: We may have to cut it!
text: MENDEZ nods... COLUMBUS grabs some rope. The ship rises
text: into the air again, crashes down, the deck disappearing
text: beneath them for a moment.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (screaming out)
dialog: I'll stay here -- to decide if we
dialog: cut it. Help me!
text: With MENDEZ'S help, COLUMBUS is tied to the mast: one
text: rope under his arms, the other around his waist. MENDEZ
text: hands him a horn.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Now go!
text: MENDEZ seems to hesitate. COLUMBUS screams at him again.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: I said -- below deck, Mendez!
text: MENDEZ crawls away.
text: Another huge wave washes over COLUMBUS. He emerges,
text: almost suffocated. The storm rages, its eerie light
text: making it seem at times like bright daylight. But as the
text: lightning flashes, COLUMBUS begins to count:
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: One... two... three... four...
text: There's an enormous thunderclap on "four" -- it indicates
text: how close they are to the eye of the storm.
text: The ship keels over again, dropping down and down, seeming
text: never to rise... COLUMBUS lifts his head to the heavens,
text: screams out:
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Damn you!
text: As if in answer, another flash of lightning that
text: illuminates the sky and the sea. COLUMBUS starts counting
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: One... two... three... four...
dialog: five...
text: Another terrible clap of thunder on "five" -- COLUMBUS
text: starts laughing, knowing the storm is moving on.
text: Then, in the strange light, something seems to move
text: through the air towards him; it looks like some kind of
text: projectile, a craft, with a trail of vapor.
text: COLUMBUS stares up at it... amazed. We start to hear the
text: "Te Deum", majestic and heavenly.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CATHEDRAL OF CORDOBA - SPAIN - DAY
text: COLUMBUS looks up at the vast roof, to see an incense
text: burner, swinging, gliding swiftly across the ceiling,
text: trailing a think vapor of incense.
text: A magnificent "Te Deum" is being sung -- in honor of
text: COLUMBUS' achievements and return. The whole cathedral is
text: packed with nobles and dignitaries in their gorgeous
text: robes.
text: BEATRIX, FERNANDO and DIEGO are staring in fascination at
text: COLUMBUS' triumph -- somewhat separated by the grandeur of
text: this occasion. COLUMBUS passes by, walking proudly down
text: the long central alley, beside KING FERDINAND and QUEEN
text: ISABEL and other GRANDEES. He turns to his family,
text: keeping his eyes on BEATRIX until she is out of his
text: vision.
text: The procession is followed by UTAPAN, and other INDIANS in
dialog: tribal regalia...
text: As they move through the crowds, all eyes are upon
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROOM - SEVILLE (PINZON'S DEATH) - DAY
text: In a simple room, a PRIEST finishes giving the Last Rites
text: and a sheet is pulled over the head of MARTIN PINZON. His
text: WIFE and CHILDREN weep at the bedside.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CATHEDRAL - DAY
text: A stool passes from hands to hands. It is placed at the
text: Queen and King's side. COLUMBUS sits on it -- a supreme
dialog: privilege.
text: To one side sit AROJAZ and SANCHEZ. AROJAZ leans over to
dialog: whisper to him.
speaker_heading: AROJAZ
dialog: It won't be easy to get rid of your
dialog: prophet now, Don Sanchez.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: On the contrary, Your Eminence. It
dialog: seems to me the man is preparing his
dialog: own cross.
scene_heading: INT. ALCAZAR'S PALACE IN SEVILLE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON: the face of a young, SPANISH NOBLEMAN, ADRIAN
text: DE MOXICA. Hesitantly, he brings a lighted cigar to his
text: lips -- then pauses.
text: We discover other people around the magnificent candle-lit
text: table. NOBLE MEN and NOBLE WOMEN. SANCHEZ. COLUMBUS.
speaker_heading: QUEEN ISABEL.
text: COLUMBUS takes the cigar from MOXICA. The rest watch him
text: with rapt curiosity. COLUMBUS inhales deeply then, to
text: their astonishment, blows out the smoke through his nose.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: You must not inhale, but simply
dialog: allow the palate to enjoy the flavor
dialog: of the Tobacco...
text: He hands the cigar back to MOXICA. With a casual air,
text: MOXICA himself inhales deeply -- almost chokes to death.
text: He gulps down a glass of wine... much to the amusement of
dialog: the others.
speaker_heading: MOXICA
dialog: (deeply embarrassed)
dialog: And you say this is an Indian vice?
dialog: By God! I don't see any kind of
dialog: pleasure that would make this a sin.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: The Indians have no such word, Don
dialog: Moxica.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Do they have such thoughts?
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: They come and go as naked as the day
dialog: God created them...
text: ISABEL blushes slightly.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: They don't see sin in their
dialog: nakedness. They live according to
dialog: nature, in a never ending summer.
text: The islands are covered with trees,
text: filled with blossoms and fruits.
dialog: And...
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Forgive me, Don Colon. But what
dialog: about gold?
text: COLUMBUS nods, turns and whispers something to a SERVANT
text: standing just behind his chair. The SERVANT goes to open
text: the door -- and in comes UTAPAN, dressed as a tribesman,
text: carrying a casket. The WOMEN around the table fan
text: themselves furiously at the sight. UTAPAN puts the casket
text: down in front of the QUEEN, and steps back.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: These are gifts for Your Majesty.
text: ISABEL opens the casket, revealing the gleam of gold
text: inside. She takes out some of the little golden
text: ornaments... a bracelet and then the mask.
text: She holds it, somehow moved by its crude beauty.
text: ISABEL raises the mask to her face, looking across at
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS.
text: The image is somehow powerful enough to reduce even the
text: ARISTOCRATS to silence. She speaks from behind the mask.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: We are more than gratified.
text: The guests laugh obsequiously. COLUMBUS bows a little --
text: looks up and meets the eyes of SANCHEZ, who is staring at
text: him, coldly.
scene_heading: INT. ROTUNDA - DAY
text: A SWORD MASTER advances towards us with determination, his
text: sword flashing. He is fighting an adversary we do not
text: see, and comments his movements.
speaker_heading: MASTER
dialog: Si! Si! Muy bien! Excellente!
dialog: (Yes! Yes! Good! Excellent!)
text: We discover the SWORD MASTER is fencing with COLUMBUS. A
text: dozen duellists are practicing in the magnificent rotunda,
text: surrounded with a two-tiered colonnade.
text: Out of breath, COLUMBUS stops the exercise, and removes
text: his protective canvas padding. He bows at his teacher,
text: who salutes him in return.
text: COLUMBUS walks to a tressel laden with food and beverages.
text: SANCHEZ, in a fencing outfit and boots, is having a glass
text: of wine. Upon seeing COLUMBUS approaching, he hands him a
text: glass.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: You defend yourself admirably...
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: ... for a commoner?
text: SANCHEZ laughs and raises his glass.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: To your second expedition.
text: They drink. A short, somewhat ugly man, with some kind of
text: imposing energy, approach them.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: Don Colon -- Don Alonso de
dialog: Bobadilla. A man who knows our
dialog: laws.
text: BOBADILLA bows.
speaker_heading: BOBADILLA
dialog: I understand that you will soon be
dialog: appointing Governors for the
dialog: islands? Is it not so?
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those
dialog: positions have already been taken.
speaker_heading: BOBADILLA
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: May I ask by whom?
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
text: SANCHEZ looks at him in surprise. BOBADILLA reddens.
speaker_heading: BOBADILLA
dialog: I trust they are men of quality.
text: BOBADILLA glances at SANCHEZ.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: But we do have a lack of notaries.
dialog: You should contact my
dialog: administration.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my
dialog: Dear Don Cristobal.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Good! We are also in need of
dialog: judges. Except there are no
dialog: thieves!
text: A grin disfigures the face of BOBADILLA.
speaker_heading: BOBADILLA
dialog: (to Sanchez)
dialog: I see I was mistaken. Don Colon
dialog: has no need for my services...
text: And he walks off. SANCHEZ fills his mouth with a slice of
dialog: ham.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: (amused)
dialog: You seem to have a special talent
dialog: for making friends.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: What...? Do I have so many already?
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: (seriously)
dialog: To rise so high, in so short a time,
dialog: is a dangerous occupation.
dialog: (kindly)
text: A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM - ADMINISTRATION - DAY
text: COLUMBUS with two MEN: the oldest, around thirty, is a
text: strong-looking man. The youngest, no more than twenty
text: five, is thin and fit. There is obvious tension in the
text: room. These are BARTOLOME and GIACOMO COLON, COLUMBUS'
text: brothers. BARTOLOME is angry, and GIACOMO thoughtful.
speaker_heading: BARTOLOME
dialog: You might have given us a choice!
speaker_heading: GIACOMO
dialog: Bartolome is stronger, more capable
dialog: than I will ever be...
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: I need both of you. What are you
dialog: afraid of? We are living what we
dialog: always dreamt of.
speaker_heading: GIACOMO
dialog: You know I never shared those dreams
dialog: with you.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Are you saying you refuse to help?
text: COLUMBUS looks at them with such pained surprise...
speaker_heading: BARTOLOME
dialog: (amused)
dialog: You bastard... you always had your
dialog: own way...
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Let me show you something.
text: He opens the door to a terrace.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GALLERY - DAY
text: The large gallery courtyard is crowded with PEOPLE --
text: applicants for the voyage. As COLUMBUS appears, they all
text: press forward, calling out his name, trying to get his
text: attention, touching his sleeves as if he were a saint.
text: They crowd around COLUMBUS and his BROTHERS. COLUMBUS
text: nods, murmurs vaguely, here and there...
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Of course... Of course... We'll see
dialog: to it... Yes... Thank you... Soon...
dialog: Soon...
text: Fighting their way through, the BOTHERS press their way,
text: reaching the other side of the gallery. We get glimpses
text: of the incredible activity down below. ADMINISTRATORS,
text: MILITARIES, MERCHANTS are busy around tressels covered
dialog: with documents, plans, maps... preparing the second
dialog: expedition.
text: COLUMBUS puts his arms around them.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (indicating the
dialog: applicants)
dialog: Now -- you tell me. Who can I
dialog: trust?
dialog: (almost amused)
dialog: We're brothers! We must be a House.
dialog: A bloodline! In this country one
dialog: can't exist alone! I need you...!
dialog: Both of you!
text: He walks then to the balustrade. The cries from the
dialog: courtyard down below subside... some of the applicants
text: begin to look up, aware of his presence.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Where is the Admiral? Has anyone
dialog: seen the Admiral?
text: Everybody laughs.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: He is here! What is it?
text: He leans over the balcony. In the middle of the
text: overcrowded courtyard, the SOLDIER who was shouting is
text: brandishing a document.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Admiral! The horses have arrived.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: I know. I saw them! Who did we
dialog: hire today?
text: ANOTHER ASSISTANT raises his eyes.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: Thirty blacksmiths, twenty eight
dialog: halberdiers, twenty carpenters, a
dialog: hundred farmers, twenty miners...
dialog: and Doctor Chanca, the royal
dialog: surgeon.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: The royal surgeon? Then we can
dialog: count on royal health!
text: The whole courtyard bursts out laughing.
scene_heading: EXT. ORANGERY - VICEROY'S HOUSE - DAY
text: UTAPAN is lying in his hammock. FERNANDO turns him over.
text: UTAPAN falls to the ground.
text: COLUMBUS walks beside BEATRIX.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (looking at his son)
dialog: He's growing up!
text: BEATRIX smiles, nods. They walk on.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Beatrix, I want to ask you
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: BEATRIX
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: You don't usually ask.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: I can arrange for the Queen to take
dialog: Fernando and Diego into her service.
text: BEATRIX stops in her tracks, looks at him.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: It is a great honor. We could not
dialog: hope for anything better.
text: BEATRIX nods, but bites her lip, and looks back at
text: FERNANDO.
speaker_heading: BEATRIX
dialog: For once I wish you weren't right.
text: COLUMBUS puts his arm around her waist, pulling her
text: closer, they move away.
scene_heading: EXT. FAR END OF THE ORANGERY - DAY
text: FERNANDO is now swinging expertly in the hammock. UTAPAN
text: is pushing him gently. He slowly straightens up to watch
text: COLUMBUS and BEATRIX disappear, somehow sensing there is a
text: dilemma. FERNANDO noticing UTAPAN'S reaction, turns to
text: his parents. The arbor is empty. FERNANDO becomes
text: pensive.
text: We become aware of the rustling of the jungle.
text: SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH AND EDGE OF JUNGLE - DAY
text: FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEN spread along the beach, looking
text: towards the jungle. COLUMBUS stands beside his BROTHERS,
dialog: and MENDEZ, and UTAPAN.
text: MOXICA, astride a magnificent black horse, prances back
text: and forth across the sand. All are waiting.
text: A signal cannon is fired from one of the ships. Birds
text: scatter into the air from the jungle -- but then silence,
text: complete and ominous. COLUMBUS stares into the jungle.
text: Nothing. No one to greet them -- no welcoming party from
text: the MEN they left behind.
text: COLUMBUS glances at MENDEZ.
text: MENDEZ looks at him, but can't answer.
text: MOXICA suddenly spurs on his horse, and guides it into the
text: trees. The order is given for the rest to follow, fanning
text: out as they do so, weapons at the ready.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEARING - JUNGLE - DAY
text: Ruins. The camp has been burned to ashes. A strange
text: sight: arrows are stuck vertically into the ground, each
text: with a moldering tuft of human hair attached to the
dialog: flight.
text: In silence the SOLDIERS pick their way through the
dialog: devastation.
text: The ground is littered with coconuts. Kicking one over
text: with his shoe, a SOLDIER discovers that his coconut is
text: actually a human skull. The gaping mouth has been filled
text: to the brim with gold.
text: But of the living, there is no sign.
speaker_heading: MOXICA
dialog: Is this your new world, Don Colon?
text: COLUMBUS looks around in dismay. A YOUNG NOBLEMAN,
text: HERNANDO DE GUEVARA, takes out his sword.
speaker_heading: GUEVARA
dialog: These animals should be shown what
dialog: savagery can be!
text: Other SPANIARDS join in, repeating this last word.
speaker_heading: NOBLEMAN
dialog: Three heads for every life taken.
dialog: No mercy before God!
speaker_heading: GUEVARA
dialog: No mercy! Let's find them.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: No Guevara. There will be no
dialog: revenge.
text: Silence. Everyone looks at COLUMBUS.
speaker_heading: MOXICA
dialog: We lost cousins, friends. We will
dialog: wash this in blood.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: If you want to keep your head on
dialog: your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
dialog: They are all listening.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Moxica, I lost friends too... Thirty
dialog: nine brave men who trusted me.
text: He walks among them.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: You want a war? Fine. We are a
dialog: thousand. They outnumber us by ten!
dialog: Who will you kill? Which tribe?
speaker_heading: MOXICA
dialog: We don't need to know.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: We came here to stay! To build!
dialog: Not to start a crusade. In this
dialog: forest, there is enough danger to
dialog: sweep us away in days! So we will
dialog: be brave and swallow our grief. And
dialog: in the name of those who died, we
dialog: will accomplish what we came for.
scene_heading: EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY
text: MOXICA mounted on his magnificent BLACK STALLION canters
text: to the edge of the deserted village and enters the
text: village. UTAPAN is terrorized by the absence of anything
dialog: living.
text: All we can hear is the breathing of the horse. The
text: animal, an impressive mass of muscle, prances nervously.
text: UTAPAN calls out in dialect.
speaker_heading: UTAPAN
dialog: They here.
text: Slowly, they begin to appear, one after the other --
text: materializing from the jungle. Shy and scared.
text: They stare at this "Centaur" (the HORSE and the HORSEMAN
dialog: seem to be one -- a God).
text: To impress them even more, MOXICA makes the beast move
text: sideways and backwards, rearing, its front hoofs pawing
text: the air. THE INDIANS retreat in terror, except for one,
text: who stands his ground, brandishing his lance.
text: UTAPAN encourages the YOUNG WARRIOR to approach the
text: centaur. He places his hand onto the shoulder of the
text: animal. The muscles shudder. THE INDIAN jumps back
text: comically, accompanied by the rest of the tribe.
text: Without warning, MOXICA climbs down from the saddle. More
text: INDIANS step back in fear and absolute astonishment. Now
dialog: more have ventured from the jungle. The bravest of them
text: approach MOXICA, daring to touch him, and the horse,
text: retreating then touching until they fill the compound.
text: At this moment, COLUMBUS and his SOLDIERS appear all
text: around them, pointing their muskets, and their crossbows.
text: A moment of tension.
text: COLUMBUS walks forward, towards the CHIEF (GUARIONEX) we
dialog: meet before.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Ask the Chief what happened to my
dialog: men?
text: The CHIEF answers.
speaker_heading: UTAPAN
dialog: Another tribe made war on them...
dialog: came by sea... took them away...
speaker_heading: BROTHER BUYL
dialog: God have mercy on their souls...
speaker_heading: MOXICA
text: The monkey is lying.
text: A pause. The SPANIARDS shifting, eager for blood.
speaker_heading: MOXICA
dialog: We should kill them, Don Colon.
text: UTAPAN looks anxiously at COLUMBUS.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: No...! you'll do it my way.
dialog: (to Utapan)
dialog: Tell the Chief we will not harm his
dialog: people, even though we have the
dialog: power to do it.
text: UTAPAN translates. The CHIEF listens in silence.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: We will work with his people. We
dialog: want peace. Ask the Chief if he
dialog: understands?
speaker_heading: UTAPAN
dialog: He understands.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Ask him if he will help.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WATERMILL AND DAM UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAY
text: It is raining hard. COLUMBUS is floundering in the mud,
text: supervising a mixed work-force of SPANISH and INDIANS.
text: They are attempting to raise the huge wheel of a
dialog: watermill.
text: Despite COLUMBUS' shouts of encouragement, it's clear the
dialog: wheel is far too heavy and the mud too deep.
text: Close by, on horseback, MOXICA watches the scene.
text: COLUMBUS, plastered with wet mud, clambers out of the pit
text: and approaches him.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Don Moxica -- we need your horse.
text: MOXICA looks down at the sodden, dirty figure.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: We can't raise the wheel without it.
speaker_heading: MOXICA
dialog: My horse doesn't work.
text: A beat. COLUMBUS wipes some mud from his eyes.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
speaker_heading: MOXICA
dialog: You did not hear me, Don Colon. Not
dialog: my horse.
text: He starts to turn away; COLUMBUS grabs hold of the reins.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Forgive me, Don Moxica. But it was
dialog: your horse I was talking about.
text: A beat. MOXICA stares down at an equally determined
text: COLUMBUS. Then, in front of everyone, MOXICA has to
dialog: dismount, and suffer the disgrace of it.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Thank you, Don Moxica.
text: COLUMBUS leads the horse away.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WATERMILL AND DAM UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAY
text: Harnessed, the horse pulls, with COLUMBUS and the MEN.
text: The wheel is raised into position.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WATERMILL AND DAM - DAY
text: Water thundering into the new canal. The huge wheel
text: begins to turn. The MEN cheer and congratulate each
text: other. MOXICA looks at his mud-splattered and foaming
text: horse, his eyes full of hatred.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY OF ISABEL - TWILIGHT
text: A wide, high shot of the new "City", dominated by a huge
text: wooden cross -- no more than a muddy main street bordered
text: by a hundred bamboo and stone shanties, with candles
text: burning in the doorways. A main square with the
text: Governor's Mansion, and the foundations of a church.
text: In the twilight, COLUMBUS and the other WORKERS returning,
dialog: dirty and tired.
scene_heading: EXT. VERANDA OF MOXICA'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT
text: MOXICA and GUEVARA sit out on the "veranda", watching the
text: MEN return. MOXICA raises his glass in an ironic salute.
speaker_heading: MOXICA
dialog: To the Governor of the Mosquitoes!
text: They laugh. We see the smoke and flames from a fire.
text: Four or five INDIANS are squatting on the earth nearby,
text: cooking for them, talking quietly in their own language.
text: MOXICA calls out something in their language, and a naked
text: YOUNG INDIAN GIRL comes out of the house, bringing more
text: wine. GUEVARA stares at her lasciviously. MOXICA,
text: letting his hand casually brush against her flank, smiles
text: at him.
speaker_heading: MOXICA
dialog: Do you want her?
text: He turns the GIRL round so that GUEVARA can admire her
text: properly. GUEVARA nods. MOXICA lets the GIRL go with a
text: peremptory order, and she disappears back inside.
text: GUEVARA suddenly stands up -- unsteadily -- and sweeping
text: his arm round in a broad gesture, says ironically:
speaker_heading: GUEVARA
dialog: To the new world, my friend! To the
dialog: new world!
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT
text: In an already Spanish-colonel dining room, COLUMBUS is
dialog: having dinner with his brothers, BARTOLOME and GIACOMO,
text: served by an INDIAN WOMAN -- NIMA. GIACOMO eats with
dialog: gusto.
speaker_heading: GIACOMO
dialog: (as Nima pours the
dialog: wine)
dialog: Nima's a good cook!
speaker_heading: BARTOLOME
dialog: She's more than that!
text: Seeing GIACOMO'S sudden blush and discomfort, as NIMA
text: smiles at him, the other BROTHERS laugh.
text: To cover his embarrassment, GIACOMO returns to the topic
text: of the food.
speaker_heading: GIACOMO
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Eat! I'll tell you later.
text: As he sees BARTOLOME stifling a laugh, GIACOMO pauses.
speaker_heading: GIACOMO
dialog: I'd like to know what I'm eating.
text: COLUMBUS eats a mouthful, glances at BARTOLOME.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Iguana.
text: A look of horror crosses GIACOMO'S face; he wretches
text: slightly, puts down his fork, and gulps down some wine.
text: The BROTHERS laugh again.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: What wrong with it? The Indians eat
dialog: it!
speaker_heading: GIACOMO
dialog: I'm not an Indian.
speaker_heading: BARTOLOME
dialog: He wishes he were back in the
dialog: seminary. Priests always eat well.
dialog: (tasting his wine,
dialog: grimacing)
dialog: And they have very good cellars.
speaker_heading: GIACOMO
dialog: Nothing grows here! Everything rots
dialog: in the ground. The wheat and vines
dialog: wither before we can harvest them.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: We've got to learn to live like the
dialog: Indians.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Eat your Iguana!
text: Reluctantly this time, GIACOMO goes back to his dinner.
scene_heading: EXT. BALCONY - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT
text: They are drinking and smoking cigars. From the balcony
text: they can see the dark mass of the jungle stretching away.
text: GIACOMO is already dozing in his chair. BARTOLOME sees
text: it, and elbows COLUMBUS. They both smile at their younger
text: brother's exhaustion. Then COLUMBUS gets up and leans on
text: the balustrade, looking down at the city, the jungle
dialog: beyond.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: How much gold have we found?
speaker_heading: BARTOLOME
dialog: Not enough to justify a single
dialog: shipment.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Perhaps it doesn't exist anywhere
dialog: but in my imagination.
speaker_heading: BARTOLOME
dialog: Then let's hope not...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: What will happen if we can't find
dialog: enough gold?
text: They begin to hear the sound of a flute -- a melancholy
text: sound. COLUMBUS looks out over the jungle, and kills a
text: mosquito by slapping his arm.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (jokingly)
dialog: Then I'm Governor of the Mosquitoes.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. INFIRMARY - CITY OF ISABEL - NIGHT
text: An INDIAN is playing the flute.
text: In the gloomy interior of the long hut, in the most
text: primitive conditions, DOZENS OF SPANIARDS lie sick. On a
text: segregated part of the room are the INDIANS, several
text: coughing.
text: They are attended by a doctor, DOCTOR CHANCA, BROTHER
text: BUYL, and other NOVICES.
text: A NOVICE attends to an INDIAN, gently lifting his head,
text: helping him to drink -- there is so little they can do.
text: BROTHER BUYL looks down at the body of a SPANIARD, covered
text: in open sores. The NOVICE joins him.
speaker_heading: BROTHER BUYL
dialog: What kind of disease is this?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR CHANCA
dialog: I don't know. It seems almost as if
dialog: we have exchanged diseases with the
dialog: Indians. They die of our most
dialog: common cold, and we of their plague.
speaker_heading: BROTHER BUYL
dialog: God forgive us!
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROYAL HOSPITAL - COURTYARD - SPAIN - DAY
text: A MAN covered with sores is screaming, thrashing in his
text: agony. He is held down, his voice muffled. ISABEL turns
text: away, shocked.
text: She is in a ward full of patients, attended by a DOCTOR,
text: SANCHEZ and other members of her court.
text: The patients are emaciated, their faces and bodies covered
text: with virulent sores. NUNS move between the beds.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: It seems to be caused by intimacy
dialog: with the native women, Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Will he survive?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: No, Your Majesty. They go mad --
dialog: then they die. There is nothing we
dialog: can do.
text: ISABEL looks around at SANCHEZ, appalled.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: Every ship returns with a cargo of
dialog: sick and dying. But with no gold!
dialog: The new world proves expensive, Your
dialog: Majesty.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: We weren't expecting immediate
dialog: profits, were we? We must have
dialog: faith. We must give time for time.
text: SANCHEZ bows in acknowledgement. But ISABEL, despite her
text: words, looks distressed.
scene_heading: EXT. MINE - NEW WORLD - DAY
text: Excavations carved into a hillside.
text: It is a blisteringly hot day. At the foot of the hill,
text: GIACOMO sits at a table beneath an awning, with MOXICA and
text: several CLERKS. ONE HUNDRED FIFTY INDIANS standing in
text: line at the table.
text: In turn, they hand over a small quantity of gold. The
text: CLERK weighs it on a scale, and notes down each
dialog: contribution.
text: MOXICA impatiently gestures the INDIANS to move faster
text: with a thonged crop. An INDIAN approaches the table. He
text: is nervous. He doesn't produce anything. The INDIAN
text: shakes his head, gesticulates, starts to speak rapidly.
speaker_heading: TRANSLATOR
dialog: He says he has not found any!
speaker_heading: MOXICA
dialog: He's lying!
text: Again the INDIAN pleads and gesticulates. MOXICA hits him
text: across the face with the thonged crop. The INDIAN tries
text: to run away -- but is held by a SPANISH SOLDIER.
speaker_heading: MOXICA
dialog: Bring him here!
text: The frightened INDIAN is brought back to the table. One
text: of the CLERKS slips away.
speaker_heading: MOXICA
dialog: Tell him to put his hands on the
dialog: table. Like this!
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OTHER SIDE OF THE SITE - DAY
text: At the other end of the site, the CLERK sprinting to
text: GIACOMO, who was talking to a FOREMASTER.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Don Giacomo, you'd better come at
dialog: once!
scene_heading: EXT. MINE - DAY
text: MOXICA turns, looks back at the long line of INDIANS,
text: still passively waiting.
speaker_heading: MOXICA
dialog: Tell them I want them to watch this!
text: The terrified TRANSLATOR speaks to the INDIANS.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Don't Moxica! You can't...
text: CUT TO:
text: GIACOMO and the CLERK running to the scene.
text: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: MOXICA
dialog: (to the clerk)
dialog: I can't? I can't?
text: With a single swift action, MOXICA draws his sword and
text: cuts off the INDIAN'S hands.
text: ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. The INDIANS flee, disappearing
text: into the jungle. GIACOMO arrives at this moment. He
text: stares at the dismembered hands in horror.
scene_heading: INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - EVENING
text: A tribunal. Sitting behind a table with his brothers, and
text: flanked by his council, COLUMBUS presides. MOXICA stands
text: before them.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: In one act of brutality, you have
dialog: created chaos. Tribes who were
dialog: fighting each other are now joining
dialog: forces against us! All that because
dialog: of your criminal savagery!
speaker_heading: MOXICA
dialog: (casually)
dialog: Savagery is what monkeys understand.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: You'll be held in detention,
dialog: deprived of your privileges and
dialog: possessions. Until you are returned
dialog: to Spain where you will be judged.
dialog: Have you anything to say?
speaker_heading: MOXICA
dialog: (with exquisite
dialog: insolence)
dialog: You will regret this.
text: He strolls to the GUARDS at the back of the room.
scene_heading: EXT. BARRACKS - NIGHT
text: Everything is quiet on the mine site.
text: On the terrace, TWO SOLDIERS are drinking in turn, and
text: cracking jokes. One of them leans against the wooden
text: wall. He laughs as he hears repeated banging behind him.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT
text: A THIRD SOLDIER is fucking an INDIAN WOMAN against the
text: wall.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BARRACKS - NIGHT
text: On the terrace, his two COMPANIONS laugh and encourage
dialog: his efforts.
text: A whooshing sound. An arrow embeds itself in the chest of
text: the SOLDIER who was leaning against the wall. He is
text: nailed to the wood behind him.
text: THE OTHER SOLDIER stares at him, transfixed, until an
text: arrow pierces his throat. He collapses, unable to cry
dialog: out for help.
scene_heading: INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT
text: FOUR INDIANS in full warrior outfit, their faces painted,
text: burst into the room. Still busy with the WOMAN, his eyes
text: facing the wall, the SOLDIER believes the intruders to be
dialog: his friends.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: (without stopping)
dialog: You animals! Can't you wait!
text: Discovering the FOUR TERRIFYING FIGURES staring at her,
text: the INDIAN WOMAN starts screaming and pushes back the
text: SOLDIER. He turns around, jumps off the WOMAN, and starts
text: to scramble to the front door, trying to put on his
dialog: trousers.
text: THE FOUR INDIANS catch him, and force him to lay on the
text: ground. THE MAN struggles, his eyes rolling in terror.
text: TWO INDIANS force his mouth open. A THIRD ONE kneels and
text: starts stuffing it with gold dust. THE SOLDIER chokes and
text: suffocates.
text: THE WOMAN still stands half naked against the wall,
text: terrified. AN INDIAN takes his knife from his leggings,
text: slowly. She starts sobbing and imploring in her language.
text: THE INDIAN slowly walks to her, and plants the knife in
text: the lower part of her belly.
scene_heading: EXT. MINE - DAY
text: PAIRS of bloody red legs hanging still, high in the air.
text: Pulling back, we discover:
text: A DOZEN SPANIARDS have been crucified on the scaffolding
text: of the excavations. Some hands and noses have been
dialog: removed.
text: UTAPAN is standing, uncomfortable among the SPANIARDS.
text: A SOLDIER removes a huge iron nail from a wrist. One of
text: the CRUCIFIED BODIES is gently laid on the ground. He is
dialog: still alive -- not for long.
text: COLUMBUS and BARTOLOME are silent with rage.
speaker_heading: BARTOLOME
dialog: (aggressively)
dialog: Moxica is right. Our ways don't
dialog: work!
text: BARTOLOME turns to UTAPAN.
speaker_heading: BARTOLOME
dialog: (aggressively)
dialog: Can you find them?
text: UTAPAN looks distraught -- this is the first time he is
dialog: being asked to do something against his own people. He
text: looks up at COLUMBUS for help in confusion.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: You have to find them, Utapan. Look
dialog: what they did!
speaker_heading: UTAPAN
dialog: You did the same to your God!
text: COLUMBUS is caught short.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: We have to stop this war.
text: UTAPAN nods. He walks and takes an arrow. He examines
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Do you know them?
text: UTAPAN nods, uncomfortable.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HILL AND VALLEY - DAY
text: Around a campfire, two dozen INDIANS are squatting. They
text: are arguing over a musket and some woolen hats they stole
text: from the mine. CLICK! CLICK! The INDIANS raise their
text: heads. All around them, crossbows and muskets are pointed
text: at them. Two INDIANS try to run away. They are shot.
text: This sound triggers the SPANIARDS' response. They start
text: shooting at random. UTAPAN is horrified. COLUMBUS stands
text: up shouting.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Stop! Stop this!
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT
text: MOXICA and a group of rebels (GUEVARA among them),
text: silently approach the entrance of the mansion.
text: A GUARD is stabbed and falls on his knees with a cry.
scene_heading: INT. COLUMBUS' STUDY - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT
text: MOXICA tears COLUMBUS' plans of the city from the wall.
text: On the table, the model of the future city.
text: Watched by the other ARISTOCRATS, MOXICA sets fire to the
text: parchment he has rolled up. He blows the flames from the
text: torch onto the model. Fire races up and down the streets
text: of the miniature, as if burning the city of Isabel.
text: A mad gleam in MOXICA'S eyes...
scene_heading: EXT. SQUARE OF ISABEL - NIGHT
text: The half-burnt remains of the Mansion. COLUMBUS stands in
text: the square, looking up at it. Behind him, his SOLDIERS,
text: his BROTHERS and about thirty captured INDIANS.
text: GIACOMO walks slowly across the square. COLUMBUS looks at
text: him in disbelief.
speaker_heading: GIACOMO
dialog: (through cracked
dialog: lips)
dialog: Moxica...
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER BANK - JUNGLE - DAWN
text: COLUMBUS leads his party of SOLDIERS through the jungle,
text: looking for the MUTINEERS.
text: They reach the river -- scan the far bank. Nothing.
text: COLUMBUS nods. His MEN start to enter the river, led by a
speaker_heading: HALBERDIER.
text: Others follow, wading across, their weapons held above
text: their heads.
text: A crossbow arrow pierces the HALBERDIER. Without a cry he
text: falls forward into the water, and is carried away by the
dialog: current.
text: Two more MEN are hit. One cries out, thrashes around in
text: the water, an arrow protruding from his side. The river
text: stained with blood.
text: Still no sign of the enemy. COLUMBUS' MEN nevertheless
text: start to return fire from the bank, creating a shield...
text: others continue to wade across the river. A MUTINEER is
dialog: shot down from the branches of a tree...
text: The first MEN come ashore. Musket fire. An exchange of
text: arrows. COLUMBUS is now wading across. The MAN next to
text: him is killed, and carried away by the current.
dialog: Now, on the far shore, the enemy have shown themselves.
text: There is hand to hand fighting, with swords and other
text: weapons. MOXICA kills one of COLUMBUS' men -- but his own
dialog: are outnumbered and outmatched. Already, some are
text: beginning to surrender.
text: In the midst of the fighting, COLUMBUS, sword drawn, pulls
text: himself out of the river: A MUTINEER lunges at him.
text: COLUMBUS kills him with a thrust of his sword -- and walks
text: forward into the jungle. He spots MOXICA at the foot of a
dialog: cliff.
scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE CLIMB TO CLIFF TOP - DAY
text: MOXICA starts scrambling up the rocks behind him, with
text: COLUMBUS following. The climb through the dense
text: undergrowth is so exhausting, they are now almost climbing
text: in slow motion.
scene_heading: EXT. TOP OF CLIFF - DAY
text: MOXICA bursts out of the undergrowth. He is at the edge
text: of emptiness, swept by a violent offshore wind. He turns
text: frantically, to see COLUMBUS coming up behind him.
text: Knowing he is lost, MOXICA regains his natural arrogance.
text: He steps backwards towards the edge.
speaker_heading: MOXICA
dialog: You know what they will say in Spain
dialog: about my death -- don't you?
text: He takes another step backwards, as COLUMBUS moves towards
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MOXICA
dialog: You are nothing! You bastards will
dialog: never inherit your titles. We are
dialog: everything. We are immortal!
text: He smiles, and steps back into space.
scene_heading: EXT. ROCKS BELOW CLIFF TOP - DAY
text: His body falls, bounces off the rocks below, crashes into
text: the water.
scene_heading: EXT. TOP OF CLIFF - DAY
text: COLUMBUS stares down as his body is swept away.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SQUARE OF ISABEL - DAY
text: CLOSE ON COLUMBUS' expressionless face.
text: CUT TO:
text: A MUTINEER -- his face is white, he is crying and
text: trembling. His arms are tied behind his back. He is held
text: fast, a rope is put around his neck.
text: COLUMBUS, sitting not far away beside his BROTHERS, gives
text: a signal.
text: Drums begin to beat. BROTHER BUYL looks on impassive.
text: A grimace suddenly transform THE YOUNG MAN'S face. He is
text: being garroted -- his throat crushed with a rope. The
text: YOUNG MAN'S feet dance frenziedly. We hear the choking.
text: The drums cease. BROTHER BUYL crosses himself and murmurs
text: a prayer, deeply distraught. GIACOMO has covered his
text: eyes.
text: A wider view shows the bodies of three other ARISTOCRATS
text: from the rebellion, attached to chairs affixed to a pole,
text: their heads straight, the rope still tight around their
text: necks.
text: Justice has been done. The members of the COUNCIL rise in
text: silence, COLUMBUS stands up.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ISABEL - QUAYSIDE - DAY
text: CLOSE ON several large wooden cages. Inside we see the
text: INDIANS that COLUMBUS captured. They are packed together.
text: They stare out with vacant eyes. SOLDIERS guard them. A
text: ship against the pier. BUYL at his side, COLUMBUS stares
text: at the INDIANS.
speaker_heading: BROTHER BUYL
dialog: I wish to go back with them, Don
dialog: Colon. I have no desire to remain
dialog: in this godless place.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: You may do as you please, Brother
dialog: Buyl -- though your departure will
dialog: not help me to make it more Godly.
text: BROTHER BUYL looks at him, almost with astonishment.
speaker_heading: BROTHER BUYL
dialog: You treat Christians equally with
dialog: heathen savages. You execute
dialog: members of the nobility. And what
dialog: do you offer in return?
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: A new world, Brother Buyl.
speaker_heading: BROTHER BUYL
dialog: Nobody wants one...! Only you!
text: And he walks away.
scene_heading: EXT. ISLAND - EVENING
text: Against the livid horizon, three black waterspouts join
text: the sky to the sea. A gust of wind disturbs the roof of
dialog: the jungle.
scene_heading: INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - EVENING
text: The wind grows stronger. Doors bang inside the
text: building... a melancholy sound.
text: COLUMBUS sits on the balcony with his BROTHERS. They are
text: silent. After a few moments, COLUMBUS begins to speak
text: quietly, almost as if he were speaking to himself.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Perhaps hope only exists in the
dialog: journey. When it begins, everything
dialog: is still possible -- every
dialog: expectation; every dream...
text: The BROTHERS do not answer.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: This is not how I imagined it to be.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE - NEAR ISABEL - NIGHT
text: UTAPAN begins to shave his head...
scene_heading: EXT. BALCONY - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - DAWN
text: The sky is dark and threatening, the wind even stronger.
text: We find COLUMBUS where we left him, but now alone. He has
dialog: sat here all night.
text: Shutters bang violently.
text: He looks up -- and sees a few yards from him: the naked
text: FIGURE OF AN INDIAN, his face and body painted, staring at
text: him. COLUMBUS realizes who it is...
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Utapan!
text: UTAPAN is still and silent. A strange and mysterious
text: figure now.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Utapan, won't you speak to me? You
dialog: used to know how to speak to me.
speaker_heading: UTAPAN
dialog: (sadly, in his own
dialog: language)
dialog: You never learned how to speak my
dialog: language.
text: UTAPAN is gone.
scene_heading: EXT. SQUARE - DAWN
text: The wind is whipping the trees now, stronger and stronger.
text: Groups of INDIANS look up at the sky. Then, above the
text: sound of the wind, they hear another noise. Like a
text: collective murmur, almost in one voice, the INDIANS
text: repeat, over and over.
speaker_heading: INDIANS
dialog: Urracan... Urracan... Urracan...
dialog: Urracan...
dialog: (the wrath of God)
text: With a loud thunderclap, the storm suddenly breaks. In a
text: few seconds it has risen to violent proportions, and the
text: landscape is drenched in torrential rain. The wind
text: doubles its strength... and all hell breaks loose...
scene_heading: EXT. CITY OF ISABEL - DAY
text: The hurricane is full force. Trees are being ripped up by
text: their roots. Rivers of mud are washed down from the
text: hills, carrying everything away in their paths: houses,
dialog: carts, equipment, horses...
scene_heading: EXT. MINE - ISABEL - DAY
dialog: The mine workings flooded with mud...
scene_heading: EXT. APPROACH TO DAM AND WATERFALL - DAY
text: COLUMBUS, BARTOLOME and MENDEZ struggle through the teeth
text: of the hurricane towards the dam.
scene_heading: EXT. DAM - DAY
text: Timbers creak and strain. COLUMBUS, BARTOLOME, MENDEZ and
text: a DOZEN other MEN are trying to save the dam.
text: Suddenly, frighteningly, the dam begins to crash.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Let it go! Let it go!
text: The MEN scramble away as the dam wall buckles, and burst
text: open. Water floods over them; a roaring torrent. From
text: the bank, MENDEZ, BARTOLOME and COLUMBUS survey the ruins
dialog: of their dreams.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GOVERNOR'S PALACE - BEDROOM - DAY
text: COLUMBUS is stretched out on his bed, in his devastated
text: bedroom. A column of ants is threading its way across the
text: floor, each ant carrying a piece of leaf. Rain falls over
text: a table covered with documents.
text: COLUMBUS' face is covered in dried mud.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ (V.O.)
dialog: He promised us gold but has failed
dialog: to find it. He subjects the natives
dialog: to violence, provocation and
dialog: injustice. He sent them to Spain
dialog: against the express wishes of Your
dialog: Majesty...
scene_heading: INT. AUDIENCE ROOM - ALHAMBRA PALACE - DAY
text: We are back to the first scene. In the vast, opulent,
text: glittering room, ISABEL listens impassively to the voice
text: of SANCHEZ. Also present, other GRANDEES, representatives
dialog: of the church and state.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: ... But there is worse. He ordered
dialog: the execution of five members of the
dialog: nobility...
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Is this true, Brother Buyl?
speaker_heading: BROTHER BUYL
dialog: Yes, Your Majesty. It is all true.
dialog: I saw it with my own eyes.
text: A pause. ISABEL seems to struggle inwardly with her
text: emotions. SANCHEZ waits, expressionless, but on the point
dialog: of victory.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Then, what do you suggest, Don
dialog: Sanchez?
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: He must be replaced.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: And who would you think of, for such
dialog: a task?
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. QUAYSIDE - ISABEL - DAY
text: We see a buckled shoe -- as it rises, it slips into a
text: stirrup. The horse is mounted. The shoe digs into its
text: flank. The sound of hoofbeats...
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ (V.O.)
dialog: I am thinking of a man. A devotee
dialog: to Your Majesties. A man extremely
dialog: motivated...
text: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF ISABEL - DAY
text: FIVE MEN on HORSEBACK, dressed in fashionable clothes,
text: canter down what used to be the main street of Isabel.
dialog: Through some has been rebuilt, the effects of the
dialog: hurricane are still visible...
text: People look at them curiously. We see them stop near the
text: Governor's mansion. The MEN dismount and walk into the
dialog: Palace.
scene_heading: INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - DAY
text: One of the MEN in black clothes removes his hat and steps
text: forward. We recognize him as ALONSO DE BOBADILLA, the man
text: COLUMBUS humiliated at the rotunda.
text: COLUMBUS is sitting at his desk, studying plans with
text: GIACOMO. Some other MEMBERS of the COUNCIL are with them.
speaker_heading: BOBADILLA
dialog: Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Yes... I remember...
text: BOBADILLA turns, gestures to one of the other MEN, who
text: comes forward and gives him a roll of parchment, bearing
text: the royal seal.
speaker_heading: BOBADILLA
dialog: My letters of appointment.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Appointment to what?
speaker_heading: BOBADILLA
dialog: Viceroy of the West Indies.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Congratulations. Then I am free to
dialog: search for the mainland.
text: BOBADILLA smiles wickedly, happy to give COLUMBUS a low
dialog: blow.
speaker_heading: BOBADILLA
dialog: Didn't you learn? The mainland was
dialog: discovered. Weeks ago. By another
dialog: Italian. I forgot his name.
text: A MAN IN BLACK
dialog: Amerigo Vespucci, Excellency.
text: COLUMBUS pales. Then...
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: How far from here?
speaker_heading: BOBADILLA
dialog: I am not a seaman. But I heard it
dialog: is no more than a week at sea. I
dialog: hope you are not too disappointed.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: How could I be? The mainland has
dialog: been found. Exactly as I said it
dialog: would.
speaker_heading: BOBADILLA
dialog: I am afraid this is not the worst
dialog: news.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CELL - SEVILLE PRISON - DAY
text: All is dark. We can just make out COLUMBUS' face as he
text: lies on the hard bed. He is sweating heavily; his beard
text: is filthy and matted, like his hair. He looks feverish.
text: A key turns in the lock.
text: The JAILER lets in two fashionably dressed YOUNG MEN.
text: COLUMBUS, blinking in the light, turns his head to stare
text: at them. His eyes are reddened with infection at the
text: corners. The YOUNG MEN come forward into the light.
speaker_heading: FERNANDO
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Father?
text: Unable to believe it, COLUMBUS slowly sits up.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Fernando...! My God...!
text: He laughs, overcome with joy. Embraces DIEGO.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: A man! Diego, how did this happen?
speaker_heading: DIEGO
dialog: Santangel is going to see the Queen.
dialog: We are going to get you out of here.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Good! I have to go back!
text: DIEGO and FERNANDO look at one another, then back at
text: COLUMBUS, incredulously, seeing his filthy clothes, his
text: eyes rimmed with dried mucus.
speaker_heading: DIEGO
dialog: Go back?
text: There's a new excitement in COLUMBUS' voice. He walks
text: over to the table. The candlelight illuminates maps,
dialog: charts, drawings, figures...
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: I have to explore the mainland.
speaker_heading: FERNANDO
dialog: This time with me!
text: COLUMBUS laughs and DIEGO looks at them both in
text: astonishment.
speaker_heading: DIEGO
dialog: In your present state it is madness,
dialog: Father!
text: FERNANDO glances at DIEGO.
speaker_heading: FERNANDO
dialog: Nobody is forcing you to come with
dialog: us.
text: DIEGO is hurt.
speaker_heading: DIEGO
dialog: I can't go anyway.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: FERNANDO
dialog: She's very beautiful! The Queen has
dialog: very good taste. Diego is getting
dialog: married.
text: DIEGO seems saddened by his brother's attitude. Once
text: again DIEGO feels like the outsider.
text: COLUMBUS hugs him.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: I am happy for you, Diego.
scene_heading: INT. ALHAMBRA - AUDIENCE ROOM - DAY
text: Like Lucifer and Gabriel, SANTANGEL and SANCHEZ sit on
text: either side of ISABEL.
speaker_heading: SANTANGEL
dialog: Granted his faults. Yes, a hundred
dialog: times! But the man is still
dialog: remarkable.
text: ISABEL looks at him, then at SANCHEZ, MOVED BUT CLEARLY
text: UNDECIDED. SANTANGEL presses his point.
speaker_heading: SANTANGEL
dialog: All he asks is a chance to explore
dialog: this... mainland.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: It does not belong to him.
speaker_heading: SANTANGEL
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: In a way, it does, Don Sanchez.
dialog: (to the Queen)
dialog: I beg Your Majesty to receive him.
dialog: To hear him... He will make no more
dialog: demands. He has changed. He is
dialog: penitent.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: Penitent...? He is suing us for
dialog: breach of contract!
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Is he?
text: She starts to laugh.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Really?
text: SANTANGEL tries to stop himself laughing.
scene_heading: INT. AUDIENCE ROOM - ALHAMBRA PALACE - DAY
text: COLUMBUS is shown into the room. ISABEL is waiting for
dialog: him.
text: He drops to his knees before her. This time she walks
text: towards him, clearly moved by his white-hair, and other
text: signs of physical deterioration.
text: Her hand hovers over his head, as if it means to console
text: him. Her hand is dying to comfort. But instead, she
text: offers her hand for him to kiss.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Rise... Please...
text: COLUMBUS gets slowly to his feet -- but his eyes, as they
text: meet hers, are as clear as before. ISABEL smiles with
text: relief to see it. He looks back at her.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Now I do look older than you.
text: She smiles -- then again, tries to restrain it, and keeps
text: her dignity.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: We have decided to allow you to
dialog: undertake another voyage to the new
dialog: world...
text: COLUMBUS starts to interrupt; she stops him with a
text: gesture.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: But without your brothers. Nor are
dialog: you to return to Santo Domingo or
dialog: any of the other colonies. You may
dialog: explore the continent.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: There is one thing I'd like to
dialog: understand... Why do you want to go
dialog: back, after all this?
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Your Majesty -- some men are content
dialog: to read about things. I must see
dialog: them with my own eyes. I cannot be
dialog: other than I am.
text: She almost bursts out laughing -- only pauses, turns
text: slightly, then goes out.
scene_heading: INT. ALHAMBRA PALACE - ROOM NEXT TO THRONE ROOM - DAY
text: SANCHEZ is standing alone in the next room; he has
text: obviously been listening. He looks at her.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: I know, I should not tolerate his
dialog: impertinence.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: Then why?
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Because he is not afraid of me.
scene_heading: INT. ALHAMBRA PALACE - CORRIDOR - DAY
text: SANCHEZ, in another direction, along a corridor, towards
text: his office. As he reaches a corner with a wide window, a
text: hand seizes him. COLUMBUS.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: All I have to do is call the guards.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Call them.
text: SANCHEZ looks at him -- and doesn't call. COLUMBUS lets
dialog: go of him.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: I am not afraid of you. You are
dialog: nothing but a dreamer.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Look out of that window.
text: Surprised, SANCHEZ nevertheless turns, looks out.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: What do you see?
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: Roofs... towers, palaces...
dialog: spires...
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: All of them created by people like
dialog: me.
text: SANCHEZ turns round again to face him.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: No matter how long you live,
dialog: Sanchez, there's something that will
dialog: never change between us. I did it!
dialog: You didn't!
text: COLUMBUS turns abruptly and walks away, vanishing down the
text: echoing corridor.
scene_heading: EXT. COLUMBUS' MANOR HOUSE - DAY
text: COLUMBUS dismounts in the courtyard. Everything seems
text: deserted. There's no one about, no sign of life...
scene_heading: INT. MANOR HOUSE - DAY
text: COLUMBUS walks slowly through the great rooms. There is
dialog: nothing left: no furniture, rugs, pictures... nothing.
text: He turns, sees BEATRIX standing in a doorway, looking back
text: at him. They are both moved.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: God... you're so beautiful! I can't
dialog: believe no other man has ever taken
dialog: you away from me...
speaker_heading: BEATRIX
dialog: They tried... but I didn't let them.
text: She smiles. They don't dare to touch. BEATRIX looks
text: round the empty room.
speaker_heading: BEATRIX
dialog: They took everything...
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (looking at her)
dialog: Not everything... Do you think I
dialog: care? I'm a free man again. Riches
dialog: don't make a man rich, they only
dialog: make him busier...
text: They laugh. There's a pause.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: God, how much I've missed you!
text: And they throw themselves into each other's arms.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - MANOR HOUSE - EVENING
text: All that has been left is a simple table and one chair.
text: They are having supper by candlelight in the vast, empty
text: room, though the candles throw a warm, sensuous glow on
dialog: the figs and hams and wine... and on their faces, as
text: BEATRIX sits on his lap.
speaker_heading: SANTANGEL (O.S.)
dialog: One chair. One table. What more
dialog: can a man expect, when he tries to
dialog: sue the Crown?
text: They laugh. With only a little embarrassment, BEATRIX
text: gets off COLUMBUS' knee. SANTANGEL comes forward, and
text: COLUMBUS embraces him like an old friend. BEATRIX goes to
text: the kitchen.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: I owe you everything, Santangel...
dialog: but as you see, I can't repay you.
speaker_heading: SANTANGEL
dialog: On the contrary. It is I who owe
dialog: you everything. Through you, I have
dialog: been an adventurer, an explorer!
dialog: It's true I shall never see the new
dialog: world... but it's here...
dialog: (he points to his
dialog: head)
dialog: And here...
dialog: (pointing to his
dialog: heart)
text: COLUMBUS smiles. BEATRIX returns with a plate and glass
dialog: for SANTANGEL.
speaker_heading: SANTANGEL
dialog: What you are, Colon, is a sailor, a
dialog: discoverer, a man of imagination...
dialog: not a politician. You weren't meant
dialog: to govern -- You cannot be all
dialog: things to all men.
text: He takes the wine BEATRIX offers, and raises his glass.
speaker_heading: SANTANGEL
dialog: I wish you could have compromised.
dialog: It would have made your life
dialog: easier...
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: But as least we haven't been bored,
dialog: have we?
text: They all laugh, and drink.
scene_heading: EXT. SHIP'S DECK - FERNANDO'S POV - NIGHT
text: Night on the open sea -- the moon shines on the waves and
text: we hear the creaking of ropes and timbers -- the
text: loneliness and mystery of the night passage.
speaker_heading: SAILOR'S VOICE
dialog: West... southwest, Captain Mendez...
speaker_heading: MENDEZ (O.S.)
text: Steady as she goes...
text: COLUMBUS walks over to FERNANDO, who is leaning against
text: the rail. He is smoking a cigar... as the smoke blows
text: over FERNANDO'S face, FERNANDO wretches... It's clear he's
text: feeling seasick, trying to control it.
text: COLUMBUS leans against the rail next to him, staring out
text: at the darkness. Then looks at his SON again. FERNANDO
text: won't give in to the sickness, but COLUMBUS knows he'd
dialog: feel better if he did.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: How are you feeling, Fernando?
speaker_heading: FERNANDO
dialog: (in a strangled
dialog: voice)
dialog: Not bad.
text: COLUMBUS nods meditatively, puffs out some smoke.
text: FERNANDO winces, gags slightly.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (almost casually)
dialog: You know what I always used to do?
text: FERNANDO shakes his head.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Swallow a piece of pork fat on a
dialog: string. It always worked.
text: At the thought of the pork fat, FERNANDO jerks his head
text: over the side, and vomits copiously. COLUMBUS smiles,
text: pats him on the back.
scene_heading: EXT. SHIP'S DECK - DAY
text: As it plows through heavy seas. COLUMBUS, a coat wrapped
text: around him, is sitting on a chair topside, directing
text: operations despite an obvious fever.
text: Suddenly a cry from the mast head:
speaker_heading: SAILOR (O.S.)
dialog: Tierra...! Tierra!
text: SAILORS and FERNANDO rush to the side of the ship, peering
text: through the spray. FERNANDO wipes his eyes, and then he
text: sees it: there in the distance, a speck of land.
text: FERNANDO and his FATHER stand together, watching the low
text: cloud formation sitting on the horizon.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: The mainland...
text: FERNANDO looks excited. Discreetly, COLUMBUS watches his
text: SON, enjoying his happiness.
scene_heading: EXT. PANAMA (SURREAL IMAGES) - DAY
text: A most wonderful and surreal image. A heavy mist lies
text: over the forest. We move above it slowly.
text: A FIGURE emerges from the mist. At first only a
text: silhouette -- then, slowly, a golden figure... an INDIAN,
text: covered in gold... gold artifacts, golden paste on his
text: body.
text: The GOLDEN FIGURE turns, and points, into an unknown
text: distance.
scene_heading: EXT. TREEHOUSE - DAY
text: From the INDIAN treehouse, COLUMBUS, FERNANDO, MENDEZ and
text: several INDIANS are gazing west over a necklace of
dialog: magnificent lakes.
text: The INDIANS point and talk gently. FERNANDO has never
dialog: seen anything so fresh, so beautiful.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMP - SUNSET
text: A magnificent sunset. A fire is burning, food cooking.
text: COLUMBUS looks over his maps, trying to figure out where
text: they are. We see the outline of the continent of Asia.
text: An OLD INDIAN squats beside him, silent, also looking at
text: the map. Then, slowly and very deliberately, he takes a
text: piece of charcoal from the fire and begins to draw on the
text: map. Ignoring the Asian continent, he sketches the
text: Panamanian coastline -- an isthmus. MENDEZ and FERNANDO
text: gather round. COLUMBUS watches the OLD INDIAN with
text: initial puzzlement, then growing excitement.
speaker_heading: MENDEZ
dialog: What's he doing?
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
text: He's drawing an isthmus... He's
dialog: saying we're on an isthmus.
speaker_heading: MENDEZ
dialog: We can't be.
text: FERNANDO is still confused. The OLD INDIAN continues to
text: sketch, talking quietly all the time. An INDIAN
text: TRANSLATOR listens.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Tell me what he's saying.
speaker_heading: TRANSLATOR
text: He says -- water on the other side.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Ask him if he means a lake. A big
dialog: lake.
text: The TRANSLATOR asks. The OLD INDIAN shakes his head,
text: laughs, points to the west, way beyond the other lakes,
dialog: emphatically.
speaker_heading: TRANSLATOR
dialog: No. Says those are lakes. Water on
text: other side big -- as wide as here.
text: Above and below, much land.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: An ocean...? He's says it's an
dialog: ocean?
speaker_heading: FERNANDO
dialog: I don't understand.
text: COLUMBUS is too stunned for a moment to explain. The
text: INDIANS laugh.
text: Then COLUMBUS takes the charcoal, and begins to draw on
dialog: the map, for his son.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Here is Europe... and over here, the
dialog: continent of Asia. But there's
dialog: something in between! Another
dialog: continent! We've found... another
dialog: continent!
text: FERNANDO stares west, then back at his FATHER. COLUMBUS
text: looks very feverish, his face bathed with sweat.
speaker_heading: FERNANDO
dialog: Father...
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: There must be a passage to that
dialog: other ocean.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SHIP - COLUMBUS' CABIN - NIGHT
text: COLUMBUS, feverish, lies on the bunk. He shivers
text: violently. FERNANDO anxiously watches over him, bathes
text: his eyes.
text: Suddenly THE TRANSLATOR enters.
speaker_heading: TRANSLATOR
dialog: I help.
text: A little reluctantly, FERNANDO lets him go to his FATHER.
text: The INDIAN crouches over the bed, takes out a handful of
text: leaves from a pouch. He chews the leaves himself for a
text: moment, until they form a sticky pulp, then opens
text: COLUMBUS' mouth and puts the pulp inside, encouraging
text: COLUMBUS to chew with the motions of his hands.
text: COLUMBUS chews, quickly falling asleep.
scene_heading: EXT. MOONLIT VISION OF VAST LAND MASS - NIGHT
text: We see things from COLUMBUS' hallucination. We are
text: plunging through layers of clouds, the speed accelerating,
text: giving us a sickening sensation of falling to land, closer
dialog: and closer...
text: COLUMBUS wakes up with a jolt. Everything is silent.
text: COLUMBUS walks outside.
scene_heading: EXT. DECK - NIGHT
text: COLUMBUS' fever has subsided. He raises his head and
text: stares at the mainland passing in the night. He smiles.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE AND BAY - HIGH WIDE SHOT - DAY
text: The roof of the jungle, the bay beyond, the caravel at
dialog: anchor.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER - DAY
text: Two canoes going upstream, deeper and deeper into the
dialog: jungle.
scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE AND VILLAGE - DAY
text: Smoke rises lazily above the trees.
text: CUT TO:
text: The boats reaching the bank. THE FIRST HUTS of a village.
text: THE SOLDIERS spread out into the empty village.
text: FERNANDO, COLUMBUS and MENDEZ preceded by TWO ARMED
text: SOLDIERS enter one of the huts. The remains of a meal is
text: still warm in bowls on the matted floor.
text: A famished SOLDIER dips his hand in one of the bowls and
text: devours its contents: some kind of stew. Stepping back
text: accidentally, FERNANDO bumps into a large earthen jar
text: behind him. It rolls and crashes, revealing the remains
text: of meat marinating in liquid. There is something
text: disturbing about the appearance of the content.
speaker_heading: FERNANDO
dialog: Oh my God...
text: The remains of human beings.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (approaching)
dialog: What is...?
text: He stares at the remains, stunned. THE SOLDIER stops
text: chewing. He drops the half-empty bowl he was still
text: holding. He runs at the back door, rams his fingers deep
text: in the back of his throat, and vomits.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Oh Virgen Maria... Oh Madre de
dialog: Dios...
dialog: (Oh Virgin Mary... Oh Mother of
dialog: God...)
text: But as he vomits and cries, he notices:
text: A HEADLESS HUMAN TRUNK spread open, like a sheep carcass.
text: Disturbed flies rise in clouds.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Jesus, Maria, y todos los Santos...
dialog: (Jesus, Mary, and all the Saints...)
text: CUT TO:
text: COLUMBUS and the SPANIARDS meet in the center of the
text: village. All have made the same horrific discovery.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (urgently)
dialog: Out! Get out!
text: THE SPANIARDS back out of the village, crossbows pointed
text: at the invisible enemy hidden in the jungle.
text: They are running through the dense forest for the river
dialog: bank.
text: The CANNIBALS materialize among the trees, running
text: alongside. Bounding, skipping, frightening FIGURES, their
text: brutal faces painted in black. They release arrows at the
text: running SOLDIERS. A SOLDIER stops, kneels to the ground,
text: fires his crossbow and kills one of the CANNIBALS... but
text: he is pierced by a spear. TWO CANNIBALS drag him and cut
text: his throat to finish him.
text: ELSEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE -- CRIES AND CONFUSION, SPANIARDS
text: and CANNIBALS moving in hand to hand combat.
text: A CANNIBAL comes sprinting at FERNANDO, brandishing his
dialog: lance.
text: COLUMBUS jumps on the man, and plants a knife in his
text: abdomen. Blinded in sweat, he stabs the CANNIBAL, who
text: collapses. Frenzied, COLUMBUS stabs over and over again.
text: He stops and looks at his forearm -- soaked in blood.
text: Shocked by his own fury, he raises his hand and stares at
dialog: it.
text: A GIANT BLACK BUTTERFLY alights gently on his bloody
text: fingers, COLUMBUS staring fascinated at its palpitating
text: wings. FERNANDO, screaming at his FATHER, drags him to
text: his feet. They run...
text: CUT TO:
text: THE SPANIARDS, COLUMBUS, MENDEZ, FERNANDO... all running
text: hard to the boat. ARROWS whistle around them as they leap
text: into the canoes, nearly capsizing them, launching them
text: into the current.
text: SOME CANNIBALS still follow them along the riverbank. But
text: the canoes are faster, and soon, they are left behind.
scene_heading: EXT. SHIP AT SEA - DAY
text: Endless seascape, the caravel plowing.
scene_heading: EXT. SHIP'S DECK - DAY
text: FERNANDO is crouched on the poop deck, wrapped in a
text: blanket. He seems in a state of shock: he is pale and
text: shaking. As COLUMBUS goes and sits near his son, he hands
text: him a flask of alcohol.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: (kindly)
dialog: Take it. Come on. Drink.
text: As COLUMBUS insists, brandishing the flask, FERNANDO
text: notices that his hands are shaking too. His FATHER'S
text: forehead is dripping with sweat.
text: FERNANDO drinks a gulp and grimaces. He drinks again and
text: hands the flask back to his FATHER, who does the same.
text: FERNANDO notices dried blood on his FATHER'S fingers.
text: COLUMBUS immediately hides his hand and stands.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: I... I have to see Mendez.
text: Then, with sudden anger.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Your brother was right. I should
dialog: have never taken you with me. I'll
dialog: never forgive myself. Never!
text: He walks a few steps, lurches, and has to lean against the
text: rail. He raises his hand to his eyes, grimacing in pain,
text: as if they were burning. FERNANDO scrambles to his feet
text: and rushes to him. COLUMBUS' eyes are already fixed
text: somewhere -- fever is eating him up.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Will you ever forgive me?
text: FERNANDO turns around for help.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Captain Mendez!
scene_heading: INT. SHIP'S CABIN - DAY
text: COLUMBUS is lying on his couch. FERNANDO is bathing his
text: eyes, sweeping off the pus that continuously forms in
text: them. COLUMBUS is drenched in sweat.
text: CUT TO:
text: FERNANDO is writing under his FATHER'S dictation.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: I came to Your Highness with honest
dialog: purpose and sincere zeal. I did not
dialog: undertake these voyages for honor or
dialog: wealth -- that is certain. After
dialog: years of service to the Crown, I do
dialog: not have a roof to put over my
dialog: head... Your Majesty allowed me to
dialog: explore the continent, believed to
dialog: be Asia. I now believe that it is
dialog: an new Land, of unknown proportions
dialog: and wealth... Life has more
dialog: imagination than we carry in our
dialog: dreams...
text: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. ALCAZAR PALACE - GARDENS - DAY
text: The DUENA, sitting beside ISABEL, quietly continues to
text: read COLUMBUS' letter aloud.
speaker_heading: DUENA
dialog: "I should be judged as a Seaman who
dialog: by Divine Will discovered a New
dialog: World, and thereby placed it under
dialog: the sovereignty of Your Majesties.
dialog: I humbly beseech Your Majesties that
dialog: if it pleases God to remove me
dialog: hence, you will help the name of
dialog: Columbus to be remembered with
dialog: honor... Weep for me, whoever has
dialog: charity, truth and justice."
text: She stops reading. ISABEL turns her face away.
scene_heading: INT. UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY
text: An ivory-sculptured hand -- the end of the back scratcher
text: belonging to AROJAZ -- indicates a line across a large
dialog: globe: the route between Europe and America.
speaker_heading: AROJAZ (O.S.)
dialog: The sunset route to the new
dialog: continent is now well-established...
text: We see a large amphitheater, filled with PEOPLE attending
text: a lecture of "Nova Geographica" -- the new geography.
text: AROJAZ stands in front of the assembly. Facing him,
text: enthroned, is KING FERDINAND, surrounded by COURTIERS,
dialog: including SANCHEZ.
text: We slowly move across the arena, passing attentive faces.
speaker_heading: AROJAZ
dialog: ... West by south west for 750
dialog: leagues to Santo Domingo. From
dialog: there, west north west, leaving San
dialog: Juan to the north, reaching the
dialog: island of Hispanola on the northern
dialog: cape of San Raphael... Then onto the
dialog: mainland, at the Cape called Gracias
dialog: a Dios...
text: We continue to rise up the tiers of seats...
speaker_heading: AROJAZ
dialog: Spain -- by Your Majesty's grace --
dialog: has confirmed for all humanity the
dialog: existence of an unknown continent...
dialog: Tierra Incognita...
text: On a highest tier, we stop on the face of CHRISTOPHER
text: COLUMBUS, listening impassively.
speaker_heading: AROJAZ
dialog: ... This continent was first
dialog: discovered by a sailor commissioned
dialog: by your Majesty...
text: CLOSE ON COLUMBUS' eyes.
speaker_heading: AROJAZ
dialog: His name... Amerigo Vespucci...
dialog: On COLUMBUS.
scene_heading: EXT. UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY
text: Around the KING, on horseback, surrounded by the KNIGHTS,
text: a CROWD is kept back by SOLDIERS. AROJAZ is mounting his
text: horse. SANCHEZ is waiting for him.
text: COLUMBUS stands among the students at the back of the
text: CROWD.
text: CUT TO:
text: AROJAZ rides next to SANCHEZ. AROJAZ suddenly spots
text: COLUMBUS in the crowd, as they move off.
speaker_heading: AROJAZ
dialog: My God...! I thought he was dead.
text: They pass close enough to touch COLUMBUS. But he does not
dialog: see them.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: You can see for yourself.
speaker_heading: AROJAZ
dialog: What a tragedy... what a waste of a
dialog: life...
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: A waste...? Let me tell you
dialog: something, Arojaz. If your name, or
dialog: mine, is ever remembered -- it will
dialog: only be because of his.
text: AROJAZ looks at SANCHEZ in surprise -- then cranes his
text: neck round, and looks back at COLUMBUS -- now a FACE IN
text: THE CROWD.
scene_heading: EXT. LA RABIDA MONASTERY - KITCHEN GARDEN - DAY
text: ANTONIO DE MARCHENA, a very old man now, is taking a
text: siesta next to his grapes. He is sitting in a simple
text: armchair, a rosary wrapped around his fingers.
text: The presence of someone wakes him. After a moment, he
text: recognizes COLUMBUS and smiles. Both MEN are very moved.
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: I suppose we're both old men now.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: You'll always be older than me,
dialog: Father.
text: They laugh. COLUMBUS sits down. Bees drone lazily in the
text: sunlight.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Have you ever forgiven me?
text: MARCHENA nods his head.
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: Yes. I forgave you a long time ago.
dialog: You see, I was proud of you. You
dialog: were like a willful child. You
dialog: wouldn't accept what others told
dialog: you. You had to find things out for
dialog: yourself, hurting yourself -- and
dialog: others -- in the process.
text: MARCHENA looks at his plants, sighs contentedly.
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: Do you remember when you said that
dialog: people talk about the world, but
dialog: never leave their gardens.
text: COLUMBUS nods.
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: More than ever I wonder what it is
dialog: we do achieve by leaving our
dialog: gardens... The world changes -- and
dialog: yet it seems the same. We find new
dialog: worlds, but fill them with the same
dialog: people...
text: He pauses, looks across at COLUMBUS, smiles again gently.
text: MARCHENA, tiring, leans back in his chair, and looks up
text: towards the sun.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: I have to disagree.
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: I knew you would.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: New worlds create new people.
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: Oh? So you are a new man?
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: I don't know... I have the
dialog: impression that I didn't change that
dialog: much. I still can't accept the
dialog: world as it is!
text: MARCHENA starts laughing.
speaker_heading: MARCHENA
dialog: God bless you, and those like you!
text: They both laugh.
scene_heading: EXT. BEATRIX'S HOUSE BALCONY - EVENING
text: FERNANDO is sitting in front of his FATHER, examining
text: documents and letters. COLUMBUS has wrapped a shawl
text: around his legs. He looks even older now, with his mass
text: of pure white hair.
text: BEATRIX comes out with a tray, carrying grapes and a
text: decanter of water. She places it on a small table near
text: COLUMBUS and touches his shoulder.
text: As she is ready to return inside the house, he holds her
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: Can't you stay with us a little?
speaker_heading: BEATRIX
dialog: I am busy inside.
text: He smiles. She looks at him smiling, intrigued.
speaker_heading: BEATRIX
dialog: What is it, now? Tell me...
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: I can't keep my eyes off you. I
dialog: would like to catch up with all the
dialog: moments I didn't spend with you.
text: FERNANDO looks up at them above his letters, amused and
text: slightly embarrassed. COLUMBUS looks at him with a fake
text: air of reproach.
speaker_heading: COLUMBUS
dialog: What are you listening to?
speaker_heading: FERNANDO
dialog: I am not listening, Father. But I
dialog: can't help hearing.
text: FERNANDO opens a letter and reads it quickly.
speaker_heading: FERNANDO
text: It's Diego... He is at the Court,
dialog: with Santangel... He says they hope
dialog: to get your privileges restored...
dialog: And maybe the house.
