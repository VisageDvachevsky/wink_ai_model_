scene_heading: SHOCK-CUT TO:
text: A SILENT DETONATION OF WHITE LIGHT
text: which builds to a blinding, nuclear intensity.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ORBITING SPACESHIP
text: through whose windows the same light lividly illuminates
text: three space-suited and helmeted ASTRONAUTS -- afraid
text: and curiously hesitant at the controls. We establish a
dialog: Dual Date Meter showing the year in terms both of "EARTH
text: TIME" and "SELF-TIME". Both panels read: 3955.
speaker_heading: ASTRONAUT 1 (MALE)
dialog: Were we wise ... ?
speaker_heading: ASTRONAUT 2 (MALE)
dialog: We were agreed. Whoever wins the
dialog: war, there be no place on Earth
dialog: for us. We've escaped.
speaker_heading: ASTRONAUT 1 (MALE)
dialog: And where are we escaping?
speaker_heading: ASTRONAUT 3 (FEMALE)
dialog: (briskly)
dialog: Probably to our death. But just
dialog: possibly--
speaker_heading: OUT
scene_heading: P.O.V. SHOT - EARTH'S RIM WHITENS TO INCANDESCENCE
text: and a soundless explosion sends a column of fire and
text: cloud mushrooming up towards us.
speaker_heading: SPACESHIP
text: Appalled silence. Through the ship's windows the
text: ASTRONAUTS are watching (and we with them) the nuclear
text: ‘disintegration of Earth. In awed voices:
speaker_heading: ASTRONAUT 2

dialog: themselves.

speaker_heading: A-4
text: The spaceship begins to shudder.
speaker_heading: ASTRONAUT 2
dialog: But for how long? Here comes the
text: shock wave.
text: The shock wave of the huge, megatonic explosion hits
text: the spaceship from below.
text: Chaos and pandemonium inside. We multiply normal air
text: turbulence a thousandfold and are bashed, buffeted,
text: whirled, twirled, lifted a hundred miles and dropped
text: fifty, before slowly flattening out to some semblance
text: of equilibrium on (presumably) anew orbit. The Date
text: Meter digits under "EARTH TIME" have begun to click
text: and race erratically.
text: Meanwhile, the bright, white light of Earth’s final
text: holocaust has slowly faded, as the spaceship's windows
text: fog and blacken. All that can now be heard is frenzied
text: static on the ship's radio. The static begins to
text: cross-fade into (unbelievably yet unmistakably!) a
text: single human voice.
speaker_heading: VOICE

text: More static, then the radio goes dead.
speaker_heading: ASTRONAUT 2
dialog: He's speaking our language! I
dialog: don't understand ...
dialog: But we, perhaps, begin to. For we notice that the "EARTH
text: TIME" year-digits on the spaceship's Date Meter have been
text: simultaneously clicking back from 3955 to 1973.
speaker_heading: ASTRONAUT 2
dialog: The shock must have ... unbalanced
dialog: the mechanism. I still don't understand.

scene_heading: ILLUMINATED PANEL LABELED "AUTOMATIC RE-ENTRY SEQUENCE"
text: Across it curves the descending graphline which traces

text: We START on CLOSE SHOT of the deer with pneumonia, cradled

dialog: for the sick animals must get their rest. We PAN past a
text: recumbent camel and mauled fox cub, into whose small sleeping
text: pody the rubber tube of a suspended flask is intravenously
text: dripping plasma; and END on a white-coated KEEPER (with
text: flashlamp) inspecting our APE TRIO, now installed in one of
text: two large, contiguous cages at the dim room's center: straw
dialog: for them to lie on; a bowl of water for drinking; and a
dialog: generous supply of oranges and bananas, one of which he
text: cautiously proffers to ZIRA through the bars, while playfully
text: patting her head. ZIRA rejects the banana and sleps his
text: face. Taken aback but still amicably:
speaker_heading: KEEPER
dialog: Have it your own way, mate.
text: Clang! He locks them in and exits. When the light from his
text: flashlamp has faded to near-darkness, we hear an outer door
text: more distantly locked.

dialog: (outraged whisper
dialog: to Cornelius)
dialog: I'm not his mate. I'm yours.
speaker_heading: CORNELIUS
dialog: Zira, please control yourself.
dialog: I think they're trying to be kind.
speaker_heading: ZIRA
text: This cage stinks of gorilla.
text: She sits down disconsolately on the straw. Instantly
text: CORNELIUS sits by her and takes her hand. In undertones:
speaker_heading: ZIRA
dialog: Cornelius -- where are we? What's
dialog: happened?
text: CORNELIUS helplessly shrugs. From the shedows, very softly:
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: I know where we are. I know what

dialog: we have returned to Earth almost
dialog: two thousand years before its

dialog: That is another reason for keeping

dialog: Okay, I'll be careful. Set up the
dialog: Wisconsin Multiphasic.
text: This is a screen which can be lowered and raised (like
text: @ window shade) between the Investigator on one side
text: and the Subject on the other. ZIRA winks knowledgeably
text: at CORNELIUS, who winks back. MILO gestures them into
text: more discreet behavior. KEEPER sets up apparatus during:
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: (to Stevie)
dialog: Unless the spacecraft was remotely
dialog: controlled, they must have been
dialog: conditioned to press at least some
dialog: of the right buttons. They can't
dialog: be morons.
dialog: (to Keeper)
dialog: The female first, Arthur. And set
dialog: up Tic-Tac-Toe.
text: To everyone's surprise and KEEPER's reliet, ZIRA promptly
text: squats down on her side of the raised screen. The hyper-
text: cautious MILO disapprovingly shakes his head.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: She knows this one. All right --
dialog: let's make it difficult.
text: He lowers screen and displays a single red cube for
text: three seconds before reraising screen to mask ZIRA's
text: view. When he lowers it again, he is simultaneously
text: displaying a blue pyramid, a green cone, a yellow sphere,
text: @ blue cube, a red octohedron and the red cube. ZIRA
text: instantly selects the red cube, which she offers
text: courteously back to LEWIS. LEWIS gives an astonished
text: whistle; rewards ZIRA with a handful of raisins, which
text: she promptly eats; and STEVIE retrieves her notepad
text: which has fallen from her hand.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: (indicating screen
dialog: to Stevie)
dialog: You can take that away.

speaker_heading: 32 Cont.1
text: CORNELIUS, in obedience to a warning glance from MILO,
text: permits himself to be led by the KEEPER's hand to one
text: side of the Tic-Tac-Toe screen. ZIRA is already seated
text: enthusiastically at the other, ready to press panel-
dialog: button combinations which will dictate the positioning
text: of the noughts and crosses; and after a brief skirmish
text: with CORNELIUS, ZIRA achieves a row of noughts. Whereat
text: she rises to her feet, clasps her hands above her head
text: like a boxer acknowledging victory and retires to a
text: corner, where she sits in triumph on one of a half-a-
text: dozen oddly constructed wooden boxes.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: (rewarding Zira with
dialog: raisins)
dialog: Get her off that box, Arthur.
dialog: (determined to win)
dialog: We're going to need it.
text: KEEPER cautiously approaches ZIRA, who puts a hand on
text: his proffered arm and graciously rises -- while STEVIE
text: scatters the boxes about the cage and puts a banana
text: well out of ZIRA's reach between the upper bars.
text: This is a test unfamiliar to ZIRA, who responds to its
text: challenge. She speculatively eyes the banana; then
text: stoops to prowl among the boxes, which she carefully
text: examines without touching them. Then she straightens
text: +. and thinks. The tension is insupportable. Suddenly
text: ZIRA, moving into action, interlocks all the boxes so
text: that they form a somewhat eccentric staircase leading
text: to the banana. Having done so, she folds her arms and
text: smugly stands at the "staircase's" foot.

text: As though in a slow nightmare, STEVIE sags and faints.
text: Somehow, LEWIS catches her and lowers her to the cage
text: floor. Somehow, KEEPER sluices water from the (refilled)
text: drinking bowl over her upturned face. As she recovers:
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: (sweating)
dialog: Help me get her away. I'l] come
dialog: back.

dialog: Are you mad?
speaker_heading: ZIRA
dialog: I hate deceit.

speaker_heading: CHAIRMAN
dialog: May we be told which is the --

speaker_heading: CRONKITE
dialog: Dr. Hasslein, do you believe that?
speaker_heading: HASSLEIN
dialog: Absolutely. It is the only explanation.
speaker_heading: CRONKITE
dialog: But the explanation itself needs
dialog: explaining. Doctor, you've written
dialog: learned dissertations on the Nature
dialog: of Time. Could you explain, in

dialog: or persons could travel from Time

speaker_heading: HASSLEIN

speaker_heading: CRONKITE
dialog: So infinite regression is --
speaker_heading: HASSLEIN
dialog: --The moment when our artist, having

text: himself becomes a part of the picture
dialog: he has painted and is both the Observer
dialog: and the Observed.

speaker_heading: CRONKITE
dialog: What, in that peculiar condition,
dialog: would he observe if he were observing
dialog: Time?
speaker_heading: HASSLEIN
dialog: Imagine for the moment that Time
dialog: is like a simple circle -- because
dialog: a circle, like Time, has no beginning
dialog: and no end.

dialog: I have to announce that the
dialog: President of the United States
dialog: has ratified the following
dialog: final recommendations made by

dialog: of the C.I.A. tape recordings
dialog: delivered to us by Dr. Hasslein.

speaker_heading: CHAZRMAN
dialog: (reading)
dialog: One: By a majority vote the
dialog: Commission finds no solid evidence
dialog: for hostility by either Ape towards
dialog: the Human Race as at present
dialog: constituted in this year of our
dialog: Lord, nineteen seventy-three.
text: The MINORITY (including, alas, the CARDINAL) becomes
text: sufficiently vocal for the CHAIRMAN to hammer for silence.
speaker_heading: CHAIRMAN
dialog: (emphatically reading)
text: The male's attitude is that of
dialog: a@ deeply interested and well-
dialog: disposed academician who studied
dialog: the alleged future downfall of
dialog: the Human Race with the true
dialog: objectivity of a good historian.
dialog: The female's case is different,
dialog: in that she undoubtedly committed
dialog: actions against the Human Race of
dialog: a sort which, if they were to be
dialog: committed today, would be called
dialog: atrocities. ut would they be
dialog: so-called in two thousand years!
dialog: time, when it is alleged that
dialog: Humans will have become dumb brutes
dialog: with the restricted intelligence
dialog: of animals? It has been pointed
dialog: out that what Apes will do to
dialog: Humans is no more than what Humans
dialog: are now doing to beasts.
dialog: We hunt aninals for sport. If
dialog: they are edible we eat them, which
dialog: the Apes do not -- since they are
dialog: vegetarians. For the purpose of
dialog: promoting education, we lock animals
dialog: in zoos. We dissect their dead
text: bodies and experiment on their live
dialog: ones in the cause of scientific
dialog: research. ‘This does not argue that
dialog: we hate animals -- only that we use
dialog: them for such philanthropic (though
text: admittedly selfish) ends as the
dialog: defeat of human diseases like cancer.
dialog: Cont.
dialog: 234
dialog: 62
speaker_heading: 75 Cont.1
dialog: 76
speaker_heading: CHAIRMAN (Cont. )
dialog: On these grounds the Commission,
text: by a majority vote, deems it morally
dialog: unjust and indeed impolitic that
dialog: the two Apes under scrutiny should
dialog: be extermineted.
text: Dubious murmurs from the MINORITY.
speaker_heading: CHAIRMAN
dialog: (holding up hand)
dialog: Nonetheless the Commission is
text: sympathetic to Dr. Hasslein's
dialog: conviction that the progeny of
dialog: these Apes could, in the centuries
dialog: to come, prove an increasing
dialog: threat to the Human Race and
text: conceivably end by dominating it.
dialog: This is a risk we dare not ignore.
dialog: Therefore:
dialog: Two: The Commission unanimously
dialog: recommends that the birth of the
dialog: female Ape's unborn child should
dialog: be prevented; and that, after its
dialog: prenatal removal, both the male
dialog: and the female should humanely be
dialog: rendered incapable of begetting
dialog: or bearing enother. Thus, the
dialog: parents can still be employed to
dialog: serve the community in a manner to
dialog: which their undoubted talents are
dialog: best suited.
text: He raises his gevel.

speaker_heading: ORDERLY
dialog: Sir. Matam. It's chow time.

speaker_heading: ZIRA
dialog: I'm not hungry.
speaker_heading: ORDERLY
dialog: (genuinely concerned)
dialog: But maybe someone else is who
dialog: can't talk yet. Come on, ma'am.

text: CORNELIUS loses his temper. Pushes tray (upwards, from
text: beneath) into ORDERLY's face, which the hot soup scalds,
text: as the glass pitcher splinters at his feet and the oranges
text: roll across the floor. CORNELIUS wrests the heavy tray
text: from ORDERLY and crashes it down on his head. As ORDERLY
text: staggers forward, his foot trips over an orange and he
text: falls -- hitting the side of his head on a corner of the
text: metal table and landing face downwards in the splintered
text: pitcher's jagged glass.

text: under the hot midday sun. We INTERCUT:
text: - HANDLERS struggling to restrain their hysterically
text: yapping bloodhounds.
text: - FINGERPRINT EXPERTS insufflating the telltale girder.
text: - A POLICE SQUAD, in extended order, combing the downward
text: hill slope and noting signs of disturbance.
dialog: Meanwhile:
text: ON THE SUMMIT OF THE HILL STANDS HASSLEIN...
text: ... lowering angled-down binoculars to reveal cold,
text: triumphant eyes. As a distant whistle blows, he sees:
scene_heading: P.O.V. LONG SHOT - BLOODHOUNDS STARTING TO FOLLOW SCENT...
text: +..with POLICE in jeeps behind.
scene_heading: SHOOTING UP (MED. CLOSE) AT HASSLEIN ON SUMMIT
text: He consults a map, whose indications his eyes compare
text: with the direction of the chase. Then he briskly folds
text: up map and disappears behind summit in what we know to
dialog: be the direction of the highway.
speaker_heading: WEARY APES (WITH BABY) HALT
dialog: and look up at:
speaker_heading: FADED SIGN
speaker_heading: MCKINLEY & SONS
speaker_heading: NAVAL SCRAPYARD
text: We TILT DOWN from sign to the tall wire fence beneath.
dialog: It has long since ceased to fulfill its protective
text: function. A second sign ("NO TRESPASSING") -- so pocked
text: with rust that it is almost illegible -- dangles
text: diagonally from eroded wire mesh in which spiders may
text: safely spin. TILT ENDS on torn gap at fence's base.
text: CORNELIUS's hand reaches into LOWER RIGHT of FRAME and
text: tugs at wire above gap. It snaps like trellis with dry
text: rot; and we PULL BACK to see CORNELIUS tugging away
dialog: enough wire to widen the gap -- through which he and
text: ZIRA (with BABY) now enter:

dialog: 145
dialog: 92
scene_heading: OUTER SCRAPYARD
text: We PAN APES along a rutted road past mountainous dumps
text: of nautical trash: mildewed timber, huge propellers
text: leprous with dead mollusks, metal tubes that look as if
text: they would snap like cheese sticks, and, all alone, a
text: smashed glass dial that used to register "FULL SPEED
text: AHEAD" but now registers ... "STOP". At the road's end,
text: which is the water's edge, CORNELIUS and ZIRA halt and
text: look uneasily ahead.
speaker_heading: ZIRA
text: The ship's graveyard.
speaker_heading: CORNELIUS
dialog: Only for tonight.
scene_heading: ESTABLISHING SHOTS - GRAVEYARD
dialog: A shanty town of ships that have died'without burial --
text: beached on the mud or berthed in scummy water to rot
text: and rust under the sun and the salt air. Laid out
text: haphazardly, like corpses after a plague, they still
text: carry traces of their former finery about them, as a
text: skeleton may wear jewels: jet-black mussels choking
text: the iron neck of an anchor; a bollard's head, tiara'd
text: with barnacles; limpet-rings round the two splayed
text: fingers of a cleat; and a gangway (which the APES now
text: gingerly cross) jumping and swinging like the necklace
text: on a Balinese dancer. Perhaps the ships are not quite
text: dead. For sometimes, on the slack tide, they move with
text: an arthritic creak or touch one another with a groan --
text: these poor, amputated hulks who once rode the ocean as
text: proudly and delicately as dolphins.
dialog: The APES step aboard and survey:
speaker_heading: THE SHIP
text: A decrepit coastal craft, sawn off clean at the stern
text: which is wedged against the sea wall, her aft super-
text: structure (whose paint has flaked like an old whore's)
text: rises in three tiers of arched entrances to cabins. We
dialog: CLOSE to one of these and:

scene_heading: 147 INT. HASSLEIN'S BLACK MERCEDES
dialog: He is driving at speed - we know not whither.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
speaker_heading: 148 APES
text: ZIRA sits in the cabin entrance, her blanketed BABY on
text: her lap, her legs dangling over the top-tier catwalk --
dialog: for all the world like a grandmother taking the sun on
text: her stoop. We INTERCUT shots of putrescence and pollution,
dialog: during:
speaker_heading: ZIRA
dialog: Did Lewis really play here?
speaker_heading: CORNELIUS
dialog: Perhaps it was cleaner then.
speaker_heading: ZIRA
text: It stinks of Man.
speaker_heading: CORNELIUS
dialog: (charitably)
dialog: That's oil. And dead fish.
speaker_heading: ZIRA
dialog: Is that what Man wanted oil for?
dialog: To kill fish?
text: The BABY begins to cry. She absently rocks it.
speaker_heading: CORNELIUS
dialog: You don't like them, do you?
speaker_heading: ZIRA
dialog: We've met hundreds here -- and
dialog: I trust three,
dialog: (to Baby)

speaker_heading: CORNELIUS

dialog: (looking about)
dialog: All's quiet.
speaker_heading: cuT TO:

speaker_heading: CORNELIUS
text: denuding a dusty bush of its few dusty berries, which he

text: looks landward and seaward; then moves off -- maybe in
text: search of more berries, maybe to go "home".
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: SHOOTING BEHIND AND THROUGH WIRE FENCE
text: including the back of the diagonally dangling "NO
text: TRESPASSING" sign. Through mesh we see HASSLEIN's
text: Mercedes (dusty now) slowly approaching us from MED.
text: to CLOSE SHOT. It stops just short of fence. HASSLEIN
text: alights; peers speculatively about him; looks up at
text: big sign; then lower at small sign; then down at the
text: fence's foot ... where the freshly torn wire intrigues
text: him, for he touches and feels it. He enters through
text: gap and, passing CAMERA, moves cautiously out of shot.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: ZIRA IN CABIN ENTRANCE
text: The BABY asleep on her lap. The sun is very hot. ZIRA
text: herself begins to nod into a doze; then (with a start)
text: realizes that she must not sleep exposed, but only in
text: concealment. She rises with BABY and enters:
scene_heading: INT. CABIN
text: Pretty dark, for the sunlight barely filters through the
dialog: two filthy scupper panes. And you wouldn't know it was
text: a cabin, because all the furniture has long since been
text: removed. She adjusts the blanket so that it will serve
text: both as a wrap and a pillow for the BABY; then herself
text: lies down on the bare boards (from which a cockroach
text: scuttles) with her head near the BABY. We SLOW-TRACK
text: IN to CLOSEUP of her tired eyes. The heavy lids blink
dialog: ++. droop ... and fall.
speaker_heading: cuT TO:
scene_heading: HASSLEIN APPROACHING THE WATER'S EDGE
text: He looks speculatively at the ship. A possibility? He
text: approaches the gangway. Tests it with his foot. The
text: timber is serviceable and it holds. He starts walking
text: up the gangway -- and at his fourth step realizes that,
text: though it holds, it sways ... and rattles.

scene_heading: CLOSEUP - ZIRA'S EYES
text: They are open but not alarmed. She has woken but is not
text: aware that anything waked her. We STAY on her eyes for
text: three long seconds. Then the gangway rattles again --
text: louder. Alert, she rises on one elbow.
speaker_heading: ZIRA
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Cornelius?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: HASSLEIN...
text: ...Kbaving achieved the deck, stops dead in his tracks.
text: He was moving, with his back to us, in the wrong
text: direction. Now he turns into CAMERA; and from his face
dialog: we Know that he has heard not only the call but the
text: name that was called. He heads noiselessly in the vague
text: direction of the sound's source, passing CAMERA, which
text: PANS to his stealthily receding back and FOLLOWS him as
text: he climbs towards the seaward end of the catwalk.
speaker_heading: cuT TO:
scene_heading: LOOKING ALONG CATWALK FROM SEAWARD END
text: HASSLEIN, still with his back to us, walks from seaward
text: towards landward end.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CABIN
text: ZIRA hears the footsteps with relief. It must be her
text: husband, home again. She rises, picks up BABY and makes
dialog: for the cabin door.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: LOOKING LANDWARD ALONG CATWALK
text: HASSLEIN is approaching the landward end in b.g., when
text: ZIRA in f.g. (with BABY) peers out of cabin entrance and
text: looks seaward, where the footsteps were coming from.
speaker_heading: ZIRA
dialog: Cornelius?
text: Hearing the quick scrape of a shoe suddenly turning, she
text: spins round to confront:
scene_heading: P.0.V. FLASH - HASSLEIN

speaker_heading: ZIRA
text: Quick glance into cabin door. No, she'd be trapped
text: there. Swiftly she backs to catwalk's seaward end;
text: stoops and sets the crying BABY down on the Catwalk,
text: a little to one side and behind her so she can step
text: in front to protect it. As she straightens:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: FLASH - HASSLEIN FIRES TWICE
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: THE BLANKET TWITCHES TWICE...
text: .»..and, as the crying cuts out, is still.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: HASSLEIN WITH REVOLVER AIMED
text: advances step by step on ZIRA. At his second step, we
text: may or may not notice the o.s. gangplank rattle once.
text: At his fourth step, a gun fires. The bullet hits him
text: in the RIGHT side of the neck. For a second, he stands
text: quite still. Then, almost apologetically to ZIRA:
speaker_heading: HASSLEIN
dialog: Somebody had to begin to ... care.
text: The last word is less a word than a cough; and the cough
text: is bloody. HASSLEIN's eyes glaze, as he pitches forward.
text: Over the thud of his fall:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: CORNELIUS ON GANGWAY
text: Lowering Lewis's pistol. On SOUND, we reprise CRESCENDO
text: MUSIC mimicking the high-string "scream" in his head
dialog: (which he heard when he knew he had killed the Orderly)
text: and we HOLD "scream" until he speaks.
text: Now he staggers dumbly up the swaying, clattering gangway;
text: crosses the cluttered deck to the seaward rail, and clambers
text: up the catwalk companionway to:
scene_heading: ZIRA BY SHIP'S SEAWARD RAIL
text: As CORNELIUS precipitately enters shot, the "scream™
dialog: thins and FADES for:
speaker_heading: CORNELIUS

dialog: 169
dialog: 170
dialog: 171
text: Hysterically he hurls LEWIS's offending pistol into the
text: sea. We hear the splash as she takes him in her arms.
text: And, in the first silence, we (but not yet they) become
text: aware of the faint barking of bloodhounds.
text: Now, with shamed, down-hanging head profiled against
text: ZIRA's breast, CORNELIUS sees:
scene_heading: P.O.V. SHOT - THE STILL BLANKET
text: Between the ship's rail and ZIRA's feet. Over this:
speaker_heading: CORNELIUS'S VOICE
dialog: Is the baby...?
text: He cannot say the word "dead". And now our blood crawls.
text: For ZIRA's RIGHT foot jabs savagely backwards, kicking
text: the blanket and its small corpse under the ship's rail
text: and into the sea. Over a splash louder than the pistol's:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: CORNELIUS
text: Still profiled against his wife's breast and looking up
dialog: questioningly at:
scene_heading: P.0O.V. BIG HEAD - ZIRA LOOKING DOWN
text: She is sneering. And we hold this inexplicable reaction
text: until the barking bloodhounds and the wailing sirens grow
text: loud enough to wipe it off her face, as we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: TWO SHOT
text: ZIRA imperiously beckoning CORNELIUS to the seaward
text: companionway's head.
scene_heading: SHOCK CUT TO:
scene_heading: POLICE SEARCH ERUPTS INTO GRAVEYARD AREA
text: Bloodhounds, handlers, jeeps, an ambulance and blue-winking,
text: shrill-sirened cars which eject more Police Officers.
text: The noise deafens. We PICK OUT one bloodhound hauling
text: its handler up the landward companionway to nose out ...
text: HASSLEIN's corpse.
speaker_heading: HANDLER
dialog: (yelling down)
dialog: They're armed!

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: REVERSE SHOTS - A WHISTLE BLOWS - THE HANDLERS UNLEASH
scene_heading: THEIR BLOODHOUNDS
text: which converge, in a snarling torrent, on the gangway.
text: ZIRA is only halfway down it, when the "torrent" hits
text: her and she goes under. When the bloodhounds disperse,
text: she lies on the gangplank, lacerated, bleeding and in
text: mortal pain. A CAPTAIN and a POLICE OFFICER clatter up
text: the gangway. The CAPTAIN looks down.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: (curtly)
dialog: Put her out of her misery.
text: We STAY on POLICE OFFICER only, as he shoots her.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: CORNELIUS

speaker_heading: CORNELIUS
dialog: Scum! Filthy, smooth-skinned,

speaker_heading: CuT TO:
scene_heading: DOCKSIDE - E.1. (ARMED) PUSHES THROUGH POLICE

dialog: Come quietly, Cornelius.
speaker_heading: CORNELIUS
dialog: Quietly? We all came quietly,
dialog: wanting to be your friends and

dialog: We know the pistol is in the sea. We know CORNELIUS is
text: suicidally drawing their fire. But the POLICE know
text: nothing, and E.1. fires -- accurately at CORNELIUS's
text: right hand. CORNELIUS looks at the hand in scorn.
speaker_heading: CORNELIUS
dialog: I said kill me.
text: Bloody hand in pocket, he begins to walk down towards
text: the gangway, simulating a gun-muzzle with two (pocketed)
text: fingers. E.1.'s gun fires twice -- hitting CORNELIUS
text: in the chest and shoulder. CORNELIUS walks on. The
text: CAPTAIN turns to the POLICE OFFICER.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: (it could be with
dialog: compassion)
dialog: Let him have it.
text: POLICE OFFICER aims and fires his rifle. The bullet
text: hits CORNELIUS above the heart. At the gangway's head,
text: he halts, sways, takes his maimed right hand (unarmed)
text: out of his pocket and holds it over the death wound.
speaker_heading: CORNELIUS
dialog: (looking down gangway)
dialog: You can't break my heart any more.
dialog: You broke it when...
text: He pitches forward. The gangway clatters as he slides
text: down it, face foremost, until his dead cheek touches
speaker_heading: ZIRA's.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: STATION WAGON VIOLENTLY HALTING IN REAR OF POLICE
text: LEWIS and STEVIE push through, to confront:
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - DOCKSIDE AND SHIP
text: As an ambulance draws up at the foot of the gangway

text: small body, and naked. The OFFICER sets it down between
text: ZIRA and CORNELIUS.

dialog: (throwaway )
dialog: Intelligent creature! But then,
dialog: SO...
dialog: (crossing himself)
dialog: ...were your mother and father.
dialog: (shouting o.s.)
dialog: Ready to move in five minutes ... !
text: He walks out of shot between cage and CAMERA, unmasking
text: (as we CLOSE) an infant CHIMPANZEE. It stands, clutching
text: the bars of the cage through which it stares intently and
text: alertly. Then, in an opportune silence:
speaker_heading: BABY CHIMP
dialog: (triumphantly)
dialog: Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma...
text: It continues with increasing enthusiasm to declaim the
dialog: first words (if you can call them that) ever uttered by
