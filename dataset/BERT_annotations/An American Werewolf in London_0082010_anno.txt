dialog: 
text: An American Werewolf In London script by John Landis
speaker_heading: FADE IN
scene_heading: 1 MAN'S FOOTPRINT
text: on the moon.
scene_heading: EXT. MOON
text: Camera begins to pull back slowly, straight up - the
text: song "Moon Shadow" by Cat Stevens begins. Once we are
text: high enough to see the entire moon, the main title is
text: superimposed.
dialog: An American Werewolf in London
text: We continue to retreat from the moon, looking on as it
text: grows farther from us, continuing credits until the
text: full moon is the size it appears to us from earth.
scene_heading: 2 EXT. CROSSROADS ON THE MOORS - NIGHT
text: Tree branches enter into the frame, the camera pans
text: down and we see a truck approaching. We are at a
text: crossroads in the moors, looking sinister enough to
dialog: have earned their literary reputation.
text: The truck stops at the crossroads, the DRIVER,
text: mustached and wearing tweeds, boots, and a muffler,
text: climbs down.
text: "Moon Shadow" ends.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Loud bang of the back grating on the truck as it slams
text: down. Revealed among the sheep are two rudely-awakened
text: young American boys. They look exhausted. They both
text: carry backpacks, two American kids on a jaunt in
text: Europe. They are both in their late twenties.
text: It is very cold and they clamber out of the truck none
text: too happily. Pushing sheep aside they step out and
dialog: stretch.
text: JACK GOODMAN AND DAVID KESSLER
text: They've been cramped for hours.
speaker_heading: TRUCK DRIVER
dialog: Here, lads, East Proctor and
dialog: all about are the moors. I go
dialog: east here.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yes, well thank you very much
dialog: for the ride, sir. You have
dialog: lovely sheep.
speaker_heading: TRUCK DRIVER
text: (as he clambers back
dialog: up on his truck)
dialog: Boys, keep off the moors.
dialog: Stay on the road. Good luck
dialog: to you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thanks again!
text: He drives off. LONG SHOT of the two boys as the lorry
text: pulls away. Surrounding them are the moors. They put
text: on their packs, David points to the signpost pointing
text: towards East Proctor.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD ON THE MOORS - NIGHT
text: As they walk, their breath visible:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Are you cold?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Good.
text: They walk on, finally:
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You're not having a good time
dialog: are you?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, I don't know. I mean look
dialog: around. Isn't this a fun
dialog: place?
text: The camera shows us the moors - desolate, cold,
text: foreboding.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, I like it here.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm sorry. Northern England
dialog: first, Italy later.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Right.
text: They walk on.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Do you think she'll meet me in
dialog: Rome?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I think Debbie Klein is a
dialog: mediocre person with a good
dialog: body.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Debbie is not mediocre and she
dialog: has one of the great bodies of
dialog: all time.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: She's a jerk.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're talking about the woman
dialog: I love.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm talking about a girl you
dialog: want to fuck, so give me a
dialog: break.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, anyway, do you think
dialog: she'll be there?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (like an announcer)
dialog: Rendezvous in Rome starring
dialog: Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein.
dialog: The love affair that shocked
dialog: Europe! See torrid lovemaking
dialog: at its most explicit! See
text: Jack and Debbie expose their
text: lust in the sacred halls of
dialog: the Vatican! Never has the
dialog: screen dared....
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: If you don't stop, I'm going
dialog: to kill you.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I have to make love to her.
dialog: It's very simple. She has no
dialog: choice really.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It just fascinates me that you
dialog: can spend so much energy on
dialog: someone so dull.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It is impossible for a body
dialog: like that to be dull.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We've known Debbie what, since
dialog: the eighth grade? How many
dialog: years of foreplay is that?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She says she `likes me too
dialog: much'.
text: David just laughs and laughs and laughs.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
dialog: TO:
scene_heading: 3 EXT. EAST PROCTOR MAIN STREET - NIGHT
text: David and Jack entering East Proctor. It is brightly
text: moonlit. East Proctor consists of a few shops, all
text: closed, a petrol pump and a pub. East Proctor has a
text: very small population and the place looks empty. David
text: and Jack enter the middle of town and look about. The
text: camera sees what they see. A few shops, dark and
text: shuttered. Light and laughter come from the pub.
scene_heading: 4 EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT
text: Its traditional shingle shows a ferocious wolf's bloody
text: head on a pike, and tells us the pub's name, "The
text: Slaughtered Lamb".
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The Slaughtered Lamb?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Of course, The Slaughtered
dialog: Lamb. Why else would they
text: have a severed fox head on a
dialog: spear as their symbol?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: That's a wolf's head.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Of course, The Slaughtered
dialog: Lamb. Why else would they
text: have a severed wolf's head on
dialog: a spear as their symbol?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That's not a spear. It's a
dialog: pike.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: A severed wolf's head on a
text: pike as their symbol.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: David, before we go in there I
dialog: want you to know that - no
dialog: matter what happens to us -
dialog: it's your fault.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I assume full responsibility.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Shall we?
scene_heading: 5 INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT
dialog: The pub was apparently "modernized" sometime in the mid-
text: fifties. Its traditional Englishness combines with
text: greasy stainless steel and glass. It is populated by
text: mostly pale young men with longish hair. Several older
text: men are ruddy complexioned and sport large mustaches.
text: Four or five are watching a chess game. Two men are
text: playing darts. The conversation is loud and there is
text: often laughter. But there is something unsavory about
text: these people. A look of leanness and poverty. They
text: seem inbred and somehow sullen. We establish the types
text: and the general level of noise in the room.
text: The door opens revealing David and Jack. There is dead
text: silence and all are staring in a not friendly way at
text: the two boys who are made uncomfortable by all the
text: strange attention. They give each other a "what?"
text: look, then turn to the assembled populace.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Nice to see you.
speaker_heading: FACES
text: Silent and staring.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: DAVID AND JACK
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: It's very cold outside. May
dialog: we come in?
text: The WOMAN BARKEEP nods. The boys walk carefully over
text: to a table and very self-consciously remove their
text: packs, place them on the floor, and sit down at the
text: table. There is a long, awkward wait. The Woman
text: finally comes over to them.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Do you have any hot soup?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, do you have any coffee?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hot chocolate?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: We've got spirits and beer.
dialog: If it's something hot you
dialog: want, you can have tea.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Then you have some hot tea?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: But I can heat some up for you
dialog: if you'd like.
speaker_heading: DAVID & JACK
dialog: Yes, please.
text: As the Woman turns to prepare the tea, everyone resumes
text: what they were doing; talking, drinking, playing chess
text: and darts, and the boys breathe easier.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Nice looking group.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Listen, at least it's warm in
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Look at that.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: JACK'S P.O.V.
text: On the wall is painted a red pentangle (a five-pointed
text: star) and on either side burns a yellow candle.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What about it?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: It's a five-pointed star.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Maybe the owners are from
dialog: Texas.
text: The Woman brings them their tea.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to Woman)
dialog: Remember the Alamo?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He was joking. Thank you.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Joking? I remember The Alamo.
dialog: I saw it once in London, in
dialog: Leicester Square.
text: Jack and David look startled. One of the CHESS PLAYERS
dialog: explains:
speaker_heading: CHESS PLAYER
dialog: She means in the cinema, that
dialog: film with John Wayne.
dialog: (turns to board)
dialog: Checkmate.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, yes, of course.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Right, with Laurence Harvey
dialog: and everybody died in it. It
dialog: was very bloody.
speaker_heading: CHESS PLAYER
dialog: Bloody awful if you ask me!
text: This sends everyone into gales of laughter. Jack and
text: David smile politely.
speaker_heading: CHESS PLAYER
dialog: Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you
dialog: hear the one about the
dialog: crashing plane?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: No, but we're about to.
text: Laughter.
speaker_heading: CHESS PLAYER
dialog: You be quiet, woman, and let
dialog: me speak.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (heavy sarcasm)
dialog: Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
text: Uproarious laughter.
speaker_heading: CHESS PLAYER
dialog: All right, laugh then. I
dialog: shan't tell it.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Oh, come on, tell us.
speaker_heading: CHESS PLAYER
dialog: No. You've had your chance.
text: The men all coax him to tell the joke.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to David)
dialog: Ask them what the candles are
dialog: for.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: You ask them.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to David)
dialog: Listen, that's a pentangle, a
text: five-pointed star. It's used
dialog: in witchcraft. Lon Chaney,
dialog: Jr. and Universal Studios
dialog: maintain it's the mark of the
dialog: wolf man.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: I see. You want me to ask
dialog: these people if they're
dialog: burning candles to ward off
dialog: monsters.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to David)
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: Wrong.
text: The drinkers have gotten the Chess Player to tell the
dialog: joke as everyone knew he would.
speaker_heading: CHESS PLAYER
dialog: Oh, all right. There was this
text: airplane over the Atlantic on
dialog: its way to New York. It was
dialog: full of men from the United
dialog: Nations.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: That's very funny, that is.
text: Uproarious laughter.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to David)
dialog: Go on, ask them.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: You ask them.
speaker_heading: CHESS PLAYER
dialog: Here now, let me finish! So
text: halfway over the ocean the
text: engines run low on petrol so
dialog: they have to lighten the
text: plane. So they heave out all
text: the baggage, but it's still
text: too heavy. So they chuck out
text: the seats, but it's still too
dialog: heavy! Finally this Froggy
text: steps up and shouts "Viva la
text: France" and leaps out. Then
dialog: an Englishman....
scene_heading: DART PLAYERS
dialog: Hear! Hear!
speaker_heading: CHESS PLAYER
dialog: (undaunted)
text: ...steps up and shouts `God
dialog: save the Queen!' and leaps
text: out. But the plane is still
dialog: too heavy. So the Yank
dialog: delegate from Texas steps up,
dialog: shouts, `Remember the Alamo!'
text: and chucks out the Mexican.
text: This is apparently the funniest joke the inhabitants of
text: East Proctor have ever heard. The laughter is
text: uproarious, choking, knee-slapping, incredible. As the
text: Chess Player goes to take a drink of beer, the Dart
text: Player gasps out...
scene_heading: DART PLAYER
dialog: Remember the Alamo!
text: ...causing the Chess Player to spit out his beer
text: causing even harder laughter. Complete hilarity.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Excuse me, but what's that
dialog: star on the wall for?
text: Dead silence. A dart lands in the wall. David and
text: Jack are understandably bewildered. The villagers look
dialog: hard indeed.
scene_heading: DART PLAYER
dialog: (angry)
dialog: You've made me miss.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm sorry.
scene_heading: DART PLAYER
dialog: I've never missed the board
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jack, we'd better go.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What do you mean? I'm
dialog: starving.
scene_heading: DART PLAYER
dialog: There's no food here.
text: The villagers look threatening and David's voice is a
text: bit urgent.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Apparently so.
text: The boys pick up their backpacks and move uncertainly
dialog: for the door.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (to men)
dialog: You can't let them go.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (worried)
dialog: How much do we owe you?
speaker_heading: CHESS PLAYER
dialog: Nothing, lads. Go, God be
dialog: with you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Uh, thank you.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Wait! You just can't let them
dialog: go!
scene_heading: DART PLAYER
dialog: Go! And stay on the road.
dialog: Keep clear of the moors.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes, well, thanks again.
speaker_heading: CHESS PLAYER
dialog: Beware the moon, lads!
text: David pushes Jack out.
scene_heading: 6 EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT
text: It is very cold.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What the hell was that all
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't know. Let's see if
dialog: there's an inn or something up
dialog: the road.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Beware the moon?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Come on, I'm freezing.
text: They start up the road into the night.
scene_heading: 7 INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT
text: It is quiet.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: You can't let them go.
scene_heading: DART PLAYER
dialog: (angry)
dialog: Should the world know our
dialog: business?!
speaker_heading: CHESS PLAYER
dialog: It's murder then.
scene_heading: DART PLAYER
dialog: Then murder it is! It's in
dialog: God's hands now.
text: The wax drips from the Pentangle's candles onto the
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
dialog: TO:
scene_heading: 8 EXT. A ROAD ON THE MOORS - NIGHT - DAVID AND JACK
text: walking on the road surrounded by darkness.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That was weird. I guess
dialog: leaving was the best idea.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't know. Now that we're
dialog: out here and it's three
dialog: degrees, I'm not so sure I
dialog: wouldn't rather face a blood-
text: thirsty mob.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, not quite a blood-
text: thirsty mob.
text: They keep walking.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What do you think was wrong?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I have no idea.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Maybe that pentangle was for
dialog: something supernatural.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I see and they were too
dialog: embarrassed to talk about it,
dialog: because they felt so silly.
text: There is a flash of lightning that sends a ghostly
text: illuminating sheet of light over the boys' faces. The
text: clap of thunder follows loud and rumbling.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Please don't rain.
text: Downpour. The boys are walking in a deluge.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Of course.
text: They walk getting soaked.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Say, David....
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm well aware of how pleasant
dialog: the weather is in Rome at the
dialog: present time thank you.
text: Jack spreads his arms and sings.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Santa Lucia...Santa Lucia.
scene_heading: 9 INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT
text: The rain is loud on the roof and beating on the
text: windows. The gathered continue to drink, play chess
text: and darts, but all are silent and contemplative.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Perhaps they'll be safe in the
dialog: rain.
text: The Chess Player slams his hand on the table. Shouts:
speaker_heading: CHESS PLAYER
dialog: No one brought them here! No
dialog: one wanted them here!
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: You could have told them!
scene_heading: DART PLAYER
dialog: Are you daft? What do you
dialog: think they'd say? They'd
dialog: think us mad.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Listen!
text: The rain is subsiding. There is a very faint howl.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Did you hear it? We must go
dialog: to them.
scene_heading: DART PLAYER
dialog: I heard nothing.
speaker_heading: CHESS PLAYER
dialog: Nor I.
text: The camera lingers as the Chess Player's hard face
text: shows the man's struggle. Another howl. The Chess
text: Player turns suddenly.
scene_heading: 10 EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT
text: David and Jack are now completely out of sight from
text: East Proctor surrounded by darkness and wet. There is
text: a light drizzle. They are standing, listening. The
text: drizzle stops.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Did you hear that?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I heard that.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What was it?
text: David begins to walk, Jack with him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Could be a lot of things.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: A coyote.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: There aren't any coyotes in
dialog: England.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: The Hound of the Baskervilles.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Pecos Bill.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Heathcliffe.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Heathcliffe didn't howl.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: No, but he was on the moors.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's a full moon, `beware the
dialog: moon'.
text: Another howl, this one long and loud. It is a very
text: inhuman noise, terrifying, and closer this time.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I vote we go back to The
text: Slaughtered Lamb.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah.
text: They are both visibly worried and walk briskly back
dialog: from where they just came. Although after a bit of
text: fast walking they are getting nowhere. They stop out
text: of breath.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We're lost.
text: Another bloodcurdling howl.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Shit! David, what is that?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't know. Come on.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Come on, where?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Anywhere! I think we should
dialog: just keep moving.
text: A growl. A low guttural growl comes from out of the
text: darkness. We stay on the boys, but we hear something
text: out there. It starts to walk.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: It's moving.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: It's circling us.
text: And indeed it is. The boys strain to hear its four
text: footfalls and they turn slowly, following it. A snarl.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Fuck.
text: We hear the wolf-monster stop (for that's what it is -
text: we know it's there even though we've not seen it). It
text: sits breathing heavily.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What's the plan?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: Plan?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (not too relaxed
dialog: himself)
dialog: Let's just keep walking.
text: They do and David keeps talking as they walk.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That's right, a lovely stroll
text: in the moors. Tra-la-la,
dialog: isn't this fun?
text: The thing stalking them seems to speed up. The boys
text: hesitate as they sense it run past them. It stops.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: It's in front of us.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Do you think it's a dog?
text: Jack and David strain to see what waits ahead of them.
speaker_heading: BOYS' P.O.V.
text: Something is waiting in the darkness. Its hulking
text: shape is barely discernible, but its eyes glow eerily
text: and its breath is visible.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh shit. What is that?
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: A sheep dog or something.
dialog: Turn slowly and let's walk
dialog: away.
text: The boys keep talking as they move faster and faster.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Nice doggie. Good boy.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Walk away, Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Walking away, yes, sir. Here
text: we are walking away.
text: They are in a full-out run by now. After a few minutes
text: flight they stop, panting.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: See anything?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No.
text: A moment of quiet, then a howl.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: It sounds far away.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Not far enough. Come on.
text: They walk briskly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jack?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'll tell you when we get
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well. I'm glad we...WHOAA!!
text: David shouts as he slips suddenly in the mud, scaring
dialog: Jack, and us, and himself a great deal. He lays
text: startled on the wet ground for a moment, then he and
text: Jack laugh.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You really scared me, you
dialog: shithead.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Are you going to help me up?
text: Jack takes David's extended hand to help him up when
text: THE WOLF MONSTER SPRINGS!
scene_heading: EXT. MOORS - NIGHT
text: The lunging beast brings Jack down in one fell swoop.
text: David falls back on his ass. Jack is screaming and
text: struggling as he is torn to shreds. David scrambles to
text: his feet and runs in complete panic. Jack's screams
text: and the wolf's roars combine.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Jesus fuck! David! Please
dialog: help me! Please! David!
dialog: Shit! Help me! Oh God!
scene_heading: EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT
text: David runs and runs. Finally he falls, out of breath.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jack? Oh my God, Jack!
text: He gets up and runs back to find Jack a torn and bloody
text: mess on the ground. He stares in horror.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jack....
scene_heading: EXT. NIGHT - VARIOUS FLASH CUTS
text: THE WOLF SPRINGS! The camera adopts David's P.O.V. as
text: he fights the dark savage shape on top of him. Fangs
text: clamp down on his shoulder when shots ring out and the
text: hulking form rolls off of him.
scene_heading: EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT
text: David, dazed and bloody, looks and sees the men from
text: The Slaughtered Lamb armed with shotguns and torches
text: running towards him. Looking over at his attacker,
text: instead of a wolf he sees a very old, naked man laying
text: in the mud riddled with bullet holes. As the villagers
text: crowd around, David falls back and faints.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
speaker_heading: FADE IN
scene_heading: 11 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: David is in a small, clean and very white hospital
text: room. He lays on his back in bed, his shoulder
text: bandaged and his arm plugged into a bottle of plasma.
text: There are several cuts and abrasions on his arms and
text: face, but he really doesn't look too bad. He opens his
text: eyes slowly, blinks, and tries to sit up and look
text: around, but is unable to because of the pain. He calls
dialog: out....
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jack?!
text: ...and passes out. However his shout has fetched a
text: nurse. She is ALEX PRICE, very English, very
text: beautiful. She goes to the bed.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Mr. Kessler?
text: She looks into his eyes, lifting the lids with her
text: thumb, and then checks his chart at the end of the bed.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Mr. Kessler?
text: David remains unconscious. Another young nurse, MISS
text: GALLAGHER, comes in.
scene_heading: MISS GALLAGHER
dialog: He all right?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yes, I should think. He
text: called out just now.
scene_heading: MISS GALLAGHER
dialog: He's an American, you know.
text: Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch
dialog: round one of those Embassy
dialog: fellows to see him.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Chart says he's from New York.
scene_heading: MISS GALLAGHER
dialog: I think he's a Jew.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Why on earth do you say that?
scene_heading: MISS GALLAGHER
dialog: I looked.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Really, Susan, I don't think
dialog: that was very proper, and
dialog: besides, it's common practice
dialog: now.
text: A voice startles the girls.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Yes, Miss Gallagher, Miss
dialog: Price is quite right.
text: DR. HIRSCH enters. He is an older man wearing the
text: customary lab coat. A very commanding and reassuring
text: presence. The girls are embarrassed.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried
text: out a minute ago.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Miss Gallagher, surely you
dialog: must perform some function
text: here at the hospital.
scene_heading: MISS GALLAGHER
dialog: Yes, Doctor.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Then get on with it.
scene_heading: MISS GALLAGHER
dialog: Yes, Doctor.
text: She exits. Dr. Hirsch begins to examine David. Alex
text: watches. Dr. Hirsch turns to Alex.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Can I be of service, Miss
dialog: Price?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Dr. Hirsch?
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Go about your duties.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yes, Doctor.
text: She starts to exit.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Oh, Miss Price?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yes, Doctor?
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: What exactly did he call out?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: He said `Jack'.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: That would be Jack Goodman,
text: the boy who was killed.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What happened to them?
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: The police report said an
text: escaped lunatic attacked them.
dialog: He must have been a very
dialog: powerful man. Although I
dialog: really don't see that it is
dialog: any of your concern, Miss
dialog: Price.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No, sir. Of course, sir.
dialog: Good day, Doctor.
text: She exits as Dr. Hirsch continues his examination,
text: looking into David's eyes.
scene_heading: 12 EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY
text: The camera is handheld, running furiously through the
text: almost dense greenery. On the soundtrack are the
text: footfalls and heavy breathing of the runner. The
text: camera abruptly stops and turns, sharply looking about,
text: the panting continuing. The breathing gets louder and
dialog: harder, then too loud when we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 13 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: David opens his eyes quickly, the silence and whiteness
text: contrast sharply with the preceding fantasy. Standing
text: beside the bed are Dr. Hirsch and MR. COLLINS. Mr.
text: Collins wears a bow tie and is holding a briefcase.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch
dialog: and this is a countryman of
dialog: yours, Mr. Collins.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Where am I?
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: You're in a hospital in
dialog: London.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: London? Where's Jack? I had
text: a strange dream.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: I should think so after your
dialog: recent traumatic experiences.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The guy I was with. Is he all
dialog: right? How did I get to
dialog: London?
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Now, David, I want you to
dialog: prepare yourself; your friend
text: is dead.
text: David jolts up in bed and shouts.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What?
text: The sudden exertion and strain hurt.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Ow, shit!
text: He sinks back down.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jack's dead?
scene_heading: MR. COLLINS
dialog: Mr. Kessler, I am Mr. Collins
dialog: of the American Embassy here
text: in Grosvenor Square. Both Mr.
dialog: Goodman's parents and your
dialog: parents have been notified of
dialog: your injuries and everything's
dialog: in order.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Everything's in order? What
dialog: are you talking about?
scene_heading: MR. COLLINS
text: Mr. Goodman's body has been
text: air-freighted back to New York
dialog: for burial and your parents
dialog: have wired funds for your stay
dialog: in the hospital until you are
dialog: well enough to fly home.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (controlled tears)
dialog: You don't crate and ship Jack
text: like some side of beef.
dialog: (approaching hysteria)
dialog: Who the hell are you people?
dialog: What's going on here? Where
dialog: is Jack? I demand to see him!
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: (holds David down,
dialog: calls out)
dialog: Miss Price! Miss Price,
dialog: please!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Get your fucking hands off me!
dialog: What the hell is going on
dialog: here?
text: Alex enters amidst David's shouting and confusion.
scene_heading: MR. COLLINS
dialog: (distraught, clutching
dialog: his briefcase)
dialog: I realize how upsetting this
dialog: must be for you, Mr. Kessler,
dialog: but please try to refrain from
text: hysterics.
text: David continues shouting and struggling.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Prepare a hypodermic, please,
dialog: Miss Price.
text: The shot is administered and David is held down by Dr.
text: Hirsch and Alex until his breathing becomes more
dialog: normal.
scene_heading: MR. COLLINS
dialog: Now, Mr. Kessler, try not to
dialog: excite yourself. Everything
dialog: has been arranged. I shall
dialog: come back to check on your
dialog: progress and send a report to
dialog: your parents. The police have
dialog: requested to interview you and
dialog: I have given them permission
dialog: to do so.
text: Dr. Hirsch walks Mr. Collins to the door.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Thank you very much, Mr.
dialog: Collins. He'll rest now and
dialog: I'm sure everything will be
dialog: fine once he's adjusted. He's
dialog: had quite a shock.
scene_heading: MR. COLLINS
dialog: These dumb-ass kids never
dialog: appreciate anything you do for
dialog: them.
text: Mr. Collins exits. Dr. Hirsch crosses back to the bed.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How long have I been here?
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: You've been unconscious since
dialog: you were brought in two weeks
dialog: ago.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Two weeks?
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: You've suffered some rather
dialog: severe cuts and bruises, lost
dialog: a bit of blood, but nothing
dialog: too serious; black and blue
dialog: for a while. You'll have some
text: dueling scars to boast of.
dialog: That lunatic must have been a
dialog: very fierce fellow. They say
text: a mad man has the strength of
dialog: ten.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (softly, as the drugs
dialog: take hold)
dialog: Lunatic?
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Now we've just given you a
dialog: pretty strong sedative, so try
dialog: to get some rest now. Miss
dialog: Price will see to your needs.
dialog: Rest now.
text: Dr. Hirsch watches as Alex straightens David's covers.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (softly)
dialog: It wasn't a lunatic.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: It was a wolf.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (bends down close
dialog: to hear)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: A wolf.
text: David passes out. Alex looks to Dr. Hirsch.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Did he say a wolf?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yes, I believe he did.
text: Dr. Hirsch regards David thoughtfully.
scene_heading: 14 INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Dr. Hirsch is on the phone, he is referring to a desk
dialog: calendar.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: But Roger is so terribly
dialog: boring. Yes, dear, but
dialog: couldn't we...I see.
dialog: (he makes a note)
dialog: Thursday at eight, dinner with
dialog: boring Roger. Yes, I'm sure I
dialog: will; if I survived Rommel, I
dialog: suppose I'll survive another
text: excruciating evening with
dialog: Roger Mathison. Be a good
dialog: girl. Bye.
text: He hangs up very disgruntled. The intercom buzzes.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: SECRETARY (V.O.)
text: Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus
dialog: are here to see you, Doctor.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Send them in.
text: He rises to greet the two police officers, one tall,
text: the other rather pudgy.
scene_heading: LT. VILLIERS
dialog: Dr. Hirsch?
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Come in, come in. Please sit.
dialog: Some tea?
text: The cops sit down, Lt. Villiers immediately produces a
text: small notebook.
scene_heading: LT. VILLIERS
dialog: No, thank you.
scene_heading: SGT. McMANUS
dialog: I'd like some tea, please.
text: Lt. Villiers shoots the sergeant a withering look.
scene_heading: SGT. McMANUS
dialog: Maybe not. No thanks. Maybe
dialog: later.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: It's no problem.
scene_heading: LT. VILLIERS
dialog: No, thank you, Doctor.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Well, then, what can I do for
dialog: Scotland Yard?
scene_heading: SGT. McMANUS
dialog: We understand the Kessler boy
text: has regained consciousness.
text: Lt. Villiers glares at McManus.
scene_heading: SGT. McMANUS
dialog: Sorry.
scene_heading: LT. VILLIERS
dialog: Has Mr. Kessler said anything
dialog: regarding the attack on the
dialog: moors?
text: The intercom buzzes.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Excuse me. Yes?
speaker_heading: SECRETARY (V.O.)
dialog: Roger Mathison, Doctor.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: What here?
speaker_heading: SECRETARY (V.O.)
text: He's on the telephone.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Tell him I'm out. No, tell
dialog: him I've passed away. An old
dialog: war wound or something. Tell
dialog: him I'm dead. And no more
dialog: calls!
text: He turns from the intercom back to the cops.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: You were saying?
scene_heading: LT. VILLIERS
dialog: Has David Kessler anything to
dialog: say concerning the attack on
dialog: the moors?
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Why don't we ask him?
scene_heading: 15 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: David sits up in bed. Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus
text: stand by his side. Dr. Hirsch sits observing.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm sorry if I conflict with
dialog: your report, but Jack and I
text: were not attacked by a man.
scene_heading: LT. VILLIERS
dialog: So you've said.
scene_heading: SGT. McMANUS
dialog: He may have a point,
text: Lieutenant. Two strong boys
dialog: would be able to defend
dialog: themselves against one man.
scene_heading: LT. VILLIERS
dialog: Sgt. McManus, are you
dialog: suggesting that David and Jack
dialog: were, in fact, attacked by
dialog: some animal and that the
dialog: officialdom of East Proctor
dialog: has conspired to keep it a
dialog: secret? We have an autopsy
dialog: report on the murderer who was
text: shot in the act by the local
dialog: police. We have two witnesses
dialog: to the crime. You'll forgive
dialog: me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider
dialog: your testimony as coming from
dialog: someone who has gone through a
text: terrible shock.
scene_heading: SGT. McMANUS
text: Lieutenant, the boy seems
dialog: pretty lucid to me and....
scene_heading: LT. VILLIERS
dialog: And what, Sergeant?
scene_heading: SGT. McMANUS
dialog: (defeated)
dialog: I don't rightly know, sir.
scene_heading: LT. VILLIERS
dialog: That is precisely my point.
dialog: David, as far as we are
dialog: concerned, the matter is
dialog: closed. We won't trouble you
dialog: any further. Good day.
text: The lieutenant goes for the door. The sergeant smiles
text: at David and follows.
scene_heading: LT. VILLIERS
dialog: Doctor.
text: The cops exit. Dr. Hirsch crosses to David's bed.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: There were witnesses?
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: So they said.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How could there have been
dialog: witnesses? It was so dark.
dialog: We were running and I fell and
dialog: Jack went to help me up and
dialog: this thing came from
dialog: nowhere...I don't understand
dialog: what they're talking about.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: In time I'm sure it will all
dialog: come back to you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Doctor, my memory is fine.
dialog: It's my sanity I'm beginning
dialog: to worry about.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 16 EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY
text: Again the handheld camera is running furiously through
text: the woods. Heavy breathing and the sounds of the
text: runner crashing through the foliage. The camera runs
text: for a while then suddenly stops short near a tree.
text: David abruptly enters frame, animal-like, the tenseness
text: of a startled cat. His head makes sudden movements,
text: looking about.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP
text: of his flared nostrils and perked up ears accenting his
dialog: animalness.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: takes off and now we run with him. He runs fast and
text: gracefully, taking long strides and leaps. We run with
text: him faster and faster sharing in his exhilaration. We
text: see him completely as the animal, study his movement
text: and grace as if watching a gazelle. Suddenly he stops
text: again, alert, listening. He moves with stealth, slowly
text: he pushes some leaves aside.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP
text: of his eyes.
speaker_heading: DAVID'S P.O.V.
text: Several deer in the forest; they sense something and
text: freeze, the camera noting a fawn next to a doe. The
text: buck turns his head, feeling the danger.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Shots showing the muscles in his legs and shoulders
text: tensing.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP
text: of David's eyes.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP
text: of the frightened deer.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK
dialog: TO:
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP
text: of David's eyes.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK
dialog: TO:
speaker_heading: THE FAWN
text: as it is leapt upon, its terrified face leaving frame
text: as David forces it down. David's head reenters frame,
text: his mouth full of flesh, his face and hands covered
text: with blood. He howls in triumph.
scene_heading: 17 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
text: The lights are subdued and David's asleep. The door
text: opens, a shaft of light penetrates the room. Miss
text: Gallagher enters with a small tray. She crosses to
text: David, turns on the bed light and touches him.
scene_heading: MISS GALLAGHER
dialog: Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (awakened)
dialog: I was having a nightmare.
dialog: Miss Gallagher is very efficient in administering the
text: pills and pouring a glass of water.
scene_heading: MISS GALLAGHER
dialog: Yes, well these should help
dialog: that. That's right, drink up.
text: David takes the pills.
scene_heading: MISS GALLAGHER
dialog: Now go back to sleep so you'll
dialog: be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What time is it?
scene_heading: MISS GALLAGHER
dialog: It's nearly eight. I'm off
dialog: duty shortly, then I'm off to
dialog: the films with Alex.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Alex?
scene_heading: MISS GALLAGHER
text: Miss Price, the other nurse
dialog: that attended you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What are you going to see?
scene_heading: MISS GALLAGHER
dialog: An American film about the
dialog: Mafia called `See You Next
dialog: Wednesday', and I want to see
dialog: it badly, so you give me no
dialog: problems and go to sleep.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (dropping off)
dialog: Do you have bad dreams, too?
scene_heading: MISS GALLAGHER
dialog: Some, everyone does.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes, but does everyone kill
dialog: Bambi?
scene_heading: MISS GALLAGHER
dialog: Bambi?
text: David has fallen asleep. Miss Gallagher turns off the
text: light, picks up her tray and pauses in the doorway.
scene_heading: MISS GALLAGHER
dialog: Kill Bambi?
text: She exits, closing the door plunging the room into
dialog: darkness.
scene_heading: 18 INT. HOSPITAL NURSES' STATION - DAY
text: The corridor is busy with orderlies pushing gurneys
text: about, doctors, visitors, and patients all performing
dialog: appropriate background actions. Behind the Nurses'
text: Counter, Alex is typing some forms and an older,
text: obviously senior nurse is filling some paper cups with
text: different sizes and colors of pills she is taking from
text: the drug cabinet. She is MRS. HOBBS, the chief nurse.
speaker_heading: MRS. HOBBS
dialog: Miss Price.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
speaker_heading: MRS. HOBBS
dialog: Take these round now, will you
dialog: please? The American boy in
dialog: twenty-one is only to have
dialog: these after he's eaten. Will
dialog: you be sure of that?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Has he been refusing food?
speaker_heading: MRS. HOBBS
dialog: Nothing quite as dramatic as
dialog: that, Miss Price. He just
dialog: doesn't eat enough of what is
text: put before him. He suffers
dialog: from nightmares. I'd think he
dialog: just needs a hand to hold.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
text: Alex takes the cups handed to her and makes her way
text: down the hallway, pausing a moment to straighten her
text: appearance. She enters.
scene_heading: 19 INT. CHILDREN'S WARD - DAY
text: A ward with seven or eight beds in it, all occupied.
text: She goes to a little Pakistani boy named BENJAMIN.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Hello, Benjamin.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No what?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Well, all right then, be that
dialog: way. Here, swallow this.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: No.
text: Alex pours a glass of water, gives the pill to Benjamin
text: who promptly takes it and then drinks the water,
text: handing Alex back the glass.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Feeling better?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: The doctor will be round
dialog: later. Would you like a
dialog: picture book to look at? We
dialog: have some lovely funny Beanos.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Right.
text: She exits, pausing in the hall to speak to a black
text: Jamaican ORDERLY pushing a cart of lunch trays into
dialog: Benjamin's ward.
scene_heading: 20 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Has the patient in twenty-one
dialog: gotten his tray yet?
speaker_heading: ORDERLY
dialog: The American? Yes, duck.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: How did he look?
speaker_heading: ORDERLY
dialog: What do you mean, `how did he
dialog: look'?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You know, did he seem
dialog: depressed? Do you think he'll
dialog: eat the food?
speaker_heading: ORDERLY
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: I'm an orderly, not a bleeding
dialog: psychiatrist! I push things
dialog: about, but I've little say
dialog: what happens to them.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Thank you.
text: Alex holds up her head and proceeds to David's room.
text: She hesitates, then peeks in.
scene_heading: 21 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: The curtains are drawn and David's lunch waits
text: patiently on its tray alongside of the bed. David is
text: apparently asleep. Alex enters softly.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Mr. Kessler?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (lifeless)
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You haven't eaten your lunch.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm not very hungry, thank
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I'm afraid you have to eat
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Please, really. I'm not
text: hungry.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You put me in an awkward
dialog: position, Mr. Kessler.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How is that?
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: (she shakes the paper cup)
dialog: Well, you're to take these
dialog: after you've eaten. Now what
dialog: kind of nurse would I be if I
dialog: failed in so simple a task as
dialog: giving out some pills?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Leave the pills. I'll take
dialog: them later.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Sorry.
text: She opens the curtains, daylight fills the room.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Aw come on, Miss Price!
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Call me Alex.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Aw come on, Alex!
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Shall I be forced to feed you,
dialog: Mr. Kessler?
text: David is getting interested.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Call me David.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Shall I be forced to feed you,
dialog: David?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: This is absurd. I'm not
dialog: hungry. I don't want any
dialog: food.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Right.
text: Alex efficiently removes the covers from the dishes and
text: sits on the edge of the bed. Taking knife and fork in
text: hand, she neatly cuts David's food into pieces. David
text: watches all this amused. She places a napkin under
text: David's chin and holds up his first bite on his fork.
text: David folds his arms and refuses to open his mouth.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Let's try a little harder,
dialog: shall we?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Will you give me a break?
text: Alex grabs David's nose forcing his mouth open quickly,
text: shoving the fork in it. David is startled, but amused
text: and chews his food slowly and swallows it. Alex holds
text: up another bite.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Will I have to take such
dialog: drastic action again, David?
text: David opens his mouth obediently. Alex almost smiles.
text: She feeds him for a while; they are both sizing each
dialog: other up. Finally:
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: May I have a glass of milk?
text: Alex smiles.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
speaker_heading: FADE IN
scene_heading: 22 EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY
text: Again we are running fast and faster. David again
text: running naked, flying through the green forest. He
text: stops suddenly, ears perked, he looks about and then we
text: hear Jack's o.s. screams. The voice of Jack screams:
speaker_heading: JACK (O.S.)
dialog: David! David! Please help
dialog: me! Oh God! David! Oh my
dialog: God!
text: David turns in blind panic, he runs (and we run with
text: him) desperately trying to find the source of Jack's
text: screams.
text: He comes to a clearing in the woods, light streaming
text: through the tall trees. Jack's screams halt in mid-
text: word. David looks in disbelief at the clearing. There
text: is a hospital bed with someone in it. It is the same
dialog: as David's.
text: David walks toward it slowly. The figure in the bed
text: lays still. It grows dark, very dark, and David looks
text: up at the full moon. There is a howl identical to the
text: one heard earlier back on the moors. David approaches
text: the bed slowly, fearfully. We hear ocean noises on the
text: soundtrack, the sound of crashing surf. David reaches
text: out to pull back the covers, lightning and thunder
text: cause him to hesitate for a second. Silence. The
text: camera remains on David as he pulls off the covers.
text: His face registers total disbelief and increasing
dialog: horror.
text: We cut to the bed to find - DAVID. He lies there, pale
text: white with purple lips and death pallor.
text: The camera begins to move in on the corpse of David.
text: Cut back to the standing David's terrified face; then
text: continue until David's death mask fills the screen.
text: The face remains still for several beats, then suddenly
text: opens its bright yellow eyes and red mouth revealing
text: fangs in a bloodcurdling wail which carries over in
dialog: the....
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 23 INT. HOSPITAL NURSES' STATION - NIGHT
text: Mrs. Hobbs hears David's screams and efficiently calls
dialog: out....
speaker_heading: MRS. HOBBS
dialog: Orderly! Miss Gallagher!
text: Miss Gallagher and an ORDERLY appear at once.
speaker_heading: MRS. HOBBS
dialog: Orderly, go at once to twenty-
text: one and restrain the patient.
text: The orderly exits.
speaker_heading: MRS. HOBBS
dialog: Miss Gallagher, remain here at
dialog: the desk. I'll be in twenty-
dialog: one.
text: She exits.
scene_heading: 24 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: It is bright, daylight, and Dr. Hirsch gazes
text: thoughtfully out the window.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: You've never had bad dreams
dialog: before?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (upset)
dialog: Sure, as a kid. But never so
dialog: real. Never so bizarre.
text: Dr. Hirsch crosses over and sits on a chair by the bed.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Did you get a good look at the
dialog: man who attacked you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I've told you, it wasn't a
text: man. It was an animal. A big
text: wolf or something. A rabid
dialog: dog.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: (chewing on his glasses)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've
dialog: been traumatized, but Jack was
text: torn apart. I saw him. A man
dialog: can't do that to someone with
text: his bare hands.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: You'd be surprised what
dialog: horrors a man is capable of.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Did you see Jack?
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: No. In fact, your wounds were
dialog: cleaned and dressed before you
dialog: arrived here.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Did you talk to the police in
dialog: East Proctor? Did the cops go
dialog: to The Slaughtered Lamb?
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: I really don't know.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Then why the hell are you so
dialog: quick to disbelieve me? You
dialog: yourself said it must have
dialog: taken incredible strength to
dialog: tear apart a person like that.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: (rubs his forehead)
dialog: David, please. The police are
dialog: satisfied. I'm certain that
dialog: if a monster were out roaming
dialog: northern England we'd have
text: seen it on the telly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You really think I'm crazy,
dialog: don't you?
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Believe me. The Hound of the
dialog: Baskervilles was an invention
dialog: of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's.
dialog: And if you'd read the bloody
dialog: book, you'd find that Holmes
dialog: discovered your house of hell
text: a fraud, a fake.
text: There is an awkward silence as David sits and Dr.
text: Hirsch is embarrassed at raising his voice.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Now really, David. You're far
dialog: too intelligent to go on this
dialog: way. When you return to
dialog: America I want you to seek out
dialog: a competent psychiatrist or
dialog: psychologist or something and
dialog: stop this nonsense. You'll be
dialog: leaving this hospital in three
dialog: or four days, please remain
dialog: sane. At least until you are
dialog: no longer our responsibility.
text: Dr. Hirsch goes to the door.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Dr. Hirsch?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'd rather not be by myself.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Of course not, David. I'll
text: fetch in young Miss Price.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
dialog: TO:
scene_heading: 25 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Alex sits next to David's bed. Her shoes are off and
text: she has her feet tucked up under her legs on the chair.
text: The room is dark except for the lamp by which she
text: reads. She is reading A Connecticut Yankee in King
text: Arthur's Court by Mark Twain. David is asleep. Alex
text: reads for a bit, then puts down the book and yawns.
text: She gets up and stretches, a big spreading arms and
text: feet, fingers and toes stretch.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: You're a very beautiful girl.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: I thought you were asleep.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I was. What are you reading?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: `A Connecticut Yankee in King
dialog: Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Do you like it?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I've just started it. My
dialog: friend gave it to me.
text: They look at each other.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What do you dream about?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I dream of death mostly.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
dialog: asked you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's okay. I want to talk to
dialog: you.
text: They sit and look at each other for a while longer.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How old are you?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: That's not really a very
dialog: proper question.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How old are you?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Twenty-eight.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm twenty-seven.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Now what do you want to talk
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Was Jack Goodman your good
dialog: friend?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (seriously)
dialog: My best friend. My very best
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Shall I read to you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What? Oh, yes, please.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (opens book)
dialog: A Connecticut Yankee in King
dialog: Arthur's Court by Samuel L.
dialog: Clemens. This is after the
dialog: preface but before chapter
dialog: one: A Word of Explanation.
dialog: You all right?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (settles back)
dialog: Yes, go on.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (clears her throat)
text: Ahem, A Word of Explanation.
dialog: It was in Warwick Castle that
dialog: I came across the curious
dialog: stranger whom I am going to
dialog: talk about. He attracted me
text: by three things: his candid
text: simplicity, his marvelous
dialog: familiarity with ancient
text: armor, and the restfulness of
dialog: his company - for he did all
dialog: the talking. We fell together
dialog: as modest people will in the
dialog: tail of the herd....
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
dialog: TO:
scene_heading: 26 INT. KESSLER HOME - NEW YORK - NIGHT
text: We are at David's parents' house in New York. His
text: FATHER sits reading the paper in the living room as his
text: younger BROTHER and SISTER watch "The Muppet Show" on
text: television. We can see past the small dining nook
text: where David sits doing homework and into the kitchen
text: where his MOTHER is washing the dishes. A peaceful
text: lower, middle class setting. All is tranquil and
text: secure. There is a loud pounding on the front door.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: I'll get it.
text: The pounding continues.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: All right, all right! Hold
dialog: your horses.
text: (The following happens with shocking speed.) When he
text: opens the door, four beings open fire with machine
text: guns, blowing him away. The sudden burst of violence
text: is terrifying and unrelenting. The four rush into the
text: room and the family looks at them in fearsome surprise
dialog: for these men are not human at all, but loathsome,
text: bestial demons dressed as Storm Troopers. One kicks in
text: the television and fires into the kitchen, blasting
text: David's mother. David rises but is forced back into
text: his chair by one of the things and held there.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Stop!
text: He watches in horror as his little brother and sister
text: scream in terror before they are brutally murdered.
text: The monstrous Storm Troopers then set fire to the
text: rooms. The one holding David pulls a knife and quickly
text: slits David's throat.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 27 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
text: David bolts upright in bed and looks around, trying
text: desperately to gain his bearings. He sees that Alex is
text: asleep in the chair by his bed, Connecticut Yankee
text: folded on her lap. He makes a deliberate effort to
text: calm himself. He considers waking her, then decides
text: against it. He turns on the lamp by his bed and
text: reaches over to take the book from Alex's lap. David
text: takes the book as gently as possible, but Alex wakes up
dialog: anyway.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (yawns, smiles)
dialog: Hello. You all right?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm sorry I woke you up.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Don't be silly. Can I get you
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, thank you. Just keep me
dialog: company for a while.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: That's easy enough.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I keep having these really
dialog: terrible dreams. They are
dialog: getting worse and I can't seem
dialog: to stop them.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: David, your dreams will stop.
dialog: You'll leave England and your
dialog: bad memories; and then this
text: will all fade away.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Will you come with me?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I'm serious. You don't know
dialog: me and I know nothing about
dialog: you. We have a perfect
dialog: relationship.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Now, David, I said I would
dialog: keep you company, but I meant
dialog: right here and now.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Will you think about it?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: How did we get from your bad
dialog: dreams to my taking a holiday
dialog: with a patient?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (big grin)
dialog: Not just a patient -- me.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You're being awfully forward,
dialog: aren't you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Forgive me, I'm trying to
dialog: cheer myself up and an affair
text: with a beautiful nurse seemed
dialog: like just the thing to do it.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: All I am to you is a sex
dialog: fantasy then?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Now I'm embarrassed.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Good. I thought for a moment
dialog: I was the only embarrassed one
text: in the room.
text: There is an awkward pause.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Where were we in the book?
text: Alex is relieved for something to break the tension.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (looking through
dialog: the book)
dialog: Let me see here.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
speaker_heading: FADE IN
scene_heading: 28 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING
text: The black Orderly hustles in with David's breakfast
text: tray, busily setting up the tray on the table over the
text: bed. He awakens the sleeping David with his activity.
speaker_heading: ORDERLY
dialog: Ah you're up. Good morning
dialog: and a good day to you. We've
dialog: quite a meal for you here this
dialog: morning. Bacon, oatmeal,
text: orange juice, and toast with
dialog: jam. Good stuff there. Now
dialog: eat it up and I'll be back for
dialog: the dishes when you've
dialog: finished.
text: The Orderly exits. The drowsy David, who has been
text: trying to fully wake up during the Orderly's speech,
text: notices his exit.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Good morning.
text: He looks at his food none too happily. He sticks a
text: spoon into the bowl of oatmeal and tastes is gingerly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (in mock English accent)
dialog: Please, sir, I want some more.
text: He settles down to eating, reaches over to butter his
text: toast and drink his juice. While he eats, we hear
text: Jack's o.s. voice.
speaker_heading: JACK (O.S.)
dialog: Can I have a piece of toast?
text: David looks over to the o.s. Jack. Jack, behaving
text: relaxed and normal, sits in the chair last occupied by
text: Alex. However, Jack's appearance makes his casual
text: manner all the more surreal. He is as we left him
text: butchered on the moors. He is covered with dried mud
text: and open wounds. Huge glistening gashes abound on his
text: body. His face is scratched, his throat is badly torn,
text: and his hair is matted with blood. In several spots he
text: has already begun to rot. He is a remarkably gruesome
text: sight, but his physical state seems not to affect him
dialog: at all.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (pleasantly)
dialog: Nice to see you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (unbelieving)
dialog: Get the fuck out of here,
dialog: Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Thanks a lot.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (horrified)
dialog: This is too much. I can't
dialog: handle this.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm aware that I don't look so
dialog: great, but I thought you'd be
dialog: glad to see me.
text: Jack gets up and takes a piece of toast from David's
text: tray as David watches amazed. Jack returns to his seat
text: and takes a bite out of his toast. David stares at
text: Jack horrified.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: David! You're hurting my
dialog: feelings.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (astounded)
dialog: Hurting your feelings? Has it
dialog: occurred to you that it may be
dialog: unsettling to have you rise
dialog: from your grave to visit me?
dialog: Listen to me, I'm talking to a
dialog: hamburger!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm sorry to be upsetting you,
dialog: David, but I had to come.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (aghast)
dialog: Aren't you supposed to be
dialog: buried in New York someplace?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah. Your parents came to my
dialog: funeral. I was surprised at
dialog: how many people came.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (resigned)
dialog: Why should you be surprised?
dialog: You were a very well-liked
dialog: person.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Debbie Klein cried a lot.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I can't stand it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: So you know what she does?
text: She's so grief stricken she
text: runs to find solace in Rudy
text: Levine's bed.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Rudy Levine the shmuck?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Life mocks me even in death.
text: Jack takes another bite of toast.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: I'm going completely crazy.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (loud)
dialog: David!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (louder)
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: David, now I know this may be
dialog: hard for you, but I have to
dialog: warn you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Warn me? Will you get out of
dialog: here, you meat loaf?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm a grisly sight, it's true;
dialog: but I love you and that's why
dialog: I'm here. You've got to know.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: If you love me so much, Jack,
dialog: you'll realize how
dialog: disconcerting it is to share
dialog: one's breakfast with the
dialog: living dead!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We were attacked by a
dialog: werewolf.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (covers his ears)
dialog: I'm not listening!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: On the moors, we were attacked
text: by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Shut up, you zombie!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I was murdered, an unnatural
dialog: death, and now I walk the
dialog: earth in limbo until the
text: werewolf's curse is lifted.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (incredulous, furious)
dialog: What's wrong with you? Shut
dialog: up!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The wolf's bloodline must be
text: severed. The last remaining
dialog: werewolf must be destroyed.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Will you be quiet?!
text: Jack rises and comes closer to David.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's you, David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You survived and now you shall
dialog: continue the curse.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What are you talking about? I
dialog: won't accept this! Get out!
dialog: God damit!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Remember what that guy at The
dialog: Slaughtered Lamb said?
dialog: `Beware the moon.'
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Stop it, Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Beware the moon. The full
dialog: moon, David. You've got two
dialog: days.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Jack, please go away. Please
dialog: go away.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You'll stalk the streets of
dialog: London a creature of the
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (flares up)
dialog: You're talking like Boris
dialog: Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: David, please believe me. You
dialog: will kill people, David.
dialog: You've got to stop the
text: bloodshed before it begins.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (yells)
dialog: Nurse!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Listen to me! Take your own
dialog: life, David. It's our only
dialog: chance.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Nurse!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The supernatural! The powers
dialog: of darkness! It's all true.
dialog: Take your own life! Suicide,
dialog: David. Join me.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (losing it)
dialog: Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's cold, David, and I'm so
text: alone. The undead surround
dialog: me. Have you ever talked to a
dialog: corpse? It's boring! I'm
dialog: lonely! Kill yourself, David,
dialog: before you kill others.
scene_heading: 29 INT. HOSPITAL - NURSES' STATION - DAY

speaker_heading: JACK

dialog: Beware the moon, David.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: as she bursts into the room.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: laying in bed rocking from side to side, crying softly.
text: He is alone. Alex rushes over, removes the tray, sits
text: on the bed and hugs David.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: David? David!
text: David pulls away sharply, his head jerking about wildly
text: until he focuses on Alex's face and begins to breathe
dialog: easier.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: David, what's wrong?
text: David smiles and kisses her, a real kiss.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I'm a werewolf.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: A werewolf?
text: Alex holds David a moment then realizes where she is
text: and backs off a little. David composes himself.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Are you better now?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'll let you know the next
text: full moon.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You're to be discharged
dialog: tomorrow. Will you be all
dialog: right?
text: David takes Alex's hand.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: My friend Jack was just here.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Your dead friend Jack?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah. He says that I will
text: become a monster in two days.
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What do I think? You mean
dialog: about the possibility of your
dialog: becoming a monster in two days
dialog: or about visits from dead
dialog: friends?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I was dreaming again?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I would think so.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (resigned)
dialog: Yeah, I would think so, too.

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Do you have a place to stay in
dialog: London?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 35 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

text: gives him a conspiratorial look and unlocks the door.
scene_heading: 36 INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY
text: Alex enters and David follows. A small, utilitarian
text: apartment, she flicks on the kitchen light. David puts
text: his backpack on the floor.
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: The kitchen.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Very nice.
text: She proceeds to give the tour.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Closet.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Charming.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Bathroom.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Lovely.
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: The bedroom.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: There is only one bed.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (makes a face)
dialog: David, perhaps you'd like to
text: watch the telly while I take a

text: Alex enters the room and David whistles softly, rocking
text: on his heels.
scene_heading: 37 INT. BATHROOM - DAY
text: David and Alex stand facing each other under the stream
text: of water in the shower.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's nice to see you.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: It's nice to see you.
scene_heading: MONTAGE IN SHOWER - DAY
text: A sequence of soap and flesh. Van Morrison's
text: "Moondance" plays. A montage of soapy hands on
text: slippery skin. Thighs rubbing thighs, arms and
text: shoulders. David and Alex kiss again and again and....
scene_heading: 38 INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: David and Alex in a passionate, orgasmic kiss in Alex's
text: bed. David pulls out and they lay holding each other.
dialog: After a moment....
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Alex?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Will you be here in about
dialog: fifteen minutes?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (leers)
dialog: Good.
text: Alex props herself up on one elbow.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: David, you don't honestly
dialog: believe that in reality your
dialog: friend Jack rose from the
dialog: grave to breakfast with you?
dialog: Do you really?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I was awake and he was in my
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: But, David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (firm)
dialog: I wasn't hallucinating.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (smiles)
text: Tomorrow is the full moon.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That's good, Alex. Reassure
dialog: me.
text: Alex begins kissing David's neck.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's all right, I know I'm
dialog: being insane.
text: She kisses his shoulders, then his chest.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay, okay. I'm properly
dialog: reassured!
text: Alex is now kissing his stomach, her head gradually
text: lowers from frame. David reaches back over his head to
text: hold onto the headboard of the bed.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (closing his eyes)
dialog: This is very reassuring. I'm
text: feeling very reassured.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
dialog: TO:
scene_heading: INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Alex is asleep holding David. David carefully lifts
text: her arm and gets out of bed. He is naked. He tiptoes
text: out of the room and goes to the bathroom.
scene_heading: 39 INT. ALEX'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: David lifts the toilet seat and pees. He winces,
text: hoping the steady stream doesn't awaken Alex. When
text: he's finished peeing he goes to the sink. The medicine
text: cabinet door over the sink is open. When David closes
text: it he (and the audience) is terrified to see Jack
text: reflected standing behind him. (Note: This is a big
text: scare.) Bloodied and horrible, Jack has continued to
text: rot and looks even worse than when we last saw him.
text: David chokes out a strangled cry, closes his eyes
text: tightly and then reopens them. Jack is still there in
text: the mirror. When David turns around Jack is standing
text: in the doorway.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (points a trembling
dialog: finger)
dialog: You're not real.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't be an asshole, David.
dialog: Come here.
text: David, clearly troubled, follows Jack into the living
dialog: room.
scene_heading: 40 INT. ALEX'S LIVING ROOM
text: Jack sits down and motions for David to sit also. He
text: does. David's conversation is in whispers, so as not
dialog: to wake up Alex.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I wanted to see you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay, you've seen me. Now go
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: David, I'm sorry I upset you
dialog: yesterday, but you must
dialog: understand what is going on.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I understand all right.
dialog: You're one of the undead and
dialog: I'm a werewolf.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Get out of here, Jack!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: David, tomorrow night is the
dialog: full moon. You'll change,
dialog: you'll become....
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: A monster. I know, I know.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You must take your own life
dialog: now, David, before it's too
dialog: late.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jack, are you really dead?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I think I've lost my mind. I
dialog: think you're not real. I
dialog: think I'm asleep and you're a
text: part of another bad dream.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You must believe me.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What, Jack? That tomorrow
text: night beneath the full moon
dialog: I'll sprout hair and fangs and
dialog: eat people? Bullshit!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The canines will be real.
dialog: You'll taste real blood! God
dialog: damit, David, please believe
dialog: me! You'll kill and make
dialog: others like me! I'm not
dialog: having a nice time, David!
dialog: Don't allow this to happen
dialog: again! You must take your own
dialog: life!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: I will not accept this! Now
dialog: go away!
scene_heading: 41 INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: ALEX

scene_heading: 42 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: JACK

dialog: This is not pretend, David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (righteous)
dialog: I will not be threatened by a
dialog: walking meat loaf!
text: Alex enters the room.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: David, what's wrong? I heard
dialog: voices.

speaker_heading: DAVID

scene_heading: 44 INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - DAY
text: The pub is less crowded than when we were here last.

speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: A drink for a very cold man?
text: The Woman comes in from the back.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Hello, there. What can I get
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Campari and soda would do
dialog: nicely.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Sorry, love.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: I suppose Guinness will
dialog: suffice.
text: She serves him his beer. As he lays down his money...
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: A thousand thanks.
text: After a few sips.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Nasty bit of business with
dialog: those two young American boys.
text: The Dart Player stops his wiping.
scene_heading: DART PLAYER
dialog: I'm afraid I don't know what
dialog: you mean, sir.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Yes, I'm sure that's right. A
dialog: few weeks ago, the last full
dialog: moon wasn't it?
text: The Chess Player turns in his chair to get a good look
dialog: at Dr. Hirsch.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: I mean that escaped lunatic.
dialog: The one that killed the boy.
dialog: Wasn't that near here?
speaker_heading: CHESS PLAYER
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: And where are you from, sir?
text: Dr. Hirsch crosses and joins the Chess Player at his
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
text: London. Knight takes pawn.
speaker_heading: CHESS PLAYER
dialog: What?
text: Sees that Dr. Hirsch was talking about his game....
speaker_heading: CHESS PLAYER
dialog: Oh, yes, yes.
text: Dr. Hirsch points to the pentangle on the wall.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: Oh, that's been there for two
dialog: hundred years. We were going
dialog: to paint it out, but it's
dialog: traditional, so we left it.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: I see. You've heard nothing
dialog: about the incident?
scene_heading: DART PLAYER
dialog: Incident?
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: The murder?
speaker_heading: CHESS PLAYER
dialog: Are you a police officer?
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: No, no, hardly. I work in the
dialog: hospital where the Kessler boy
dialog: was brought.
text: The Dart Player and Chess Player exchange a look.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: He was talking about
dialog: werewolves and monsters and as
dialog: I was near here I thought....
scene_heading: DART PLAYER
dialog: You thought what?
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: I thought I'd look into the
dialog: boy's story.
speaker_heading: CHESS PLAYER
dialog: (scoffs)
dialog: A story about werewolves - now
dialog: really, sir.
text: Dr. Hirsch eyes the Chess Player.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH

scene_heading: 45 INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Let me go now, you'll make me

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Do me an enormous favor?
speaker_heading: ALEX

dialog: Werewolves simply do not

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (serious)
dialog: David, do you want me to stay
dialog: here tonight?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah, I do, but go to work.
text: He opens the door and they both go outside.
scene_heading: 46 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON - ALEX AND
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: walk to the sidewalk. It is rather chilly.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Listen, if you get too
dialog: anxious, call me at the
dialog: hospital, okay?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I've left those pills for you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: A doper werewolf.
text: They kiss again.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I'm off. There's food in the
dialog: fridge.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: See you later.
text: Alex goes off, turning for a last wave. David stands
text: looking after her when a LITTLE GIRL walking a dog
text: passes by. The dog, on seeing David, begins to growl
text: and snarl.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to dog)
dialog: What did I do?
text: The dog begins barking ferociously, the little girl
text: tugging on his leash.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thanks a lot, dog.
text: He realizes just how cold he is outside and runs back
text: up the steps to find the door locked.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Wonderful.
text: Cut to shot of David's bare feet on the cold stone. He
text: mutters to himself, imitating a newscaster.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: An American werewolf was found
dialog: frozen to death today in the
dialog: heart of London, England.
text: He looks around and sees that there is a small window
text: ajar on the side of the flat about eleven feet off the
text: ground, which can be reached by climbing a brick wall,
text: which he does but not without damage to his bare toes.
text: At the top of the wall is a cat that begins to hiss on
text: seeing David. The hair stands up on its arched back
text: and it glares at David, hissing and spitting. David is
text: disturbed by the cat's hostile behavior.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What did I do, cat?
text: The cat is really acting fierce. When David goes to
text: pat it cautiously, it screeches and runs away. David
text: is, by this time, not amused. David manages to pull
text: himself into the window.
scene_heading: 47 INT. ALEX'S BATHROOM - DUSK
text: David awkwardly enters the bathroom through the tiny
text: window. Finally getting both feet on the ground, he
text: steps to the sink and regards himself in the mirror.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (weakly)
text: Snarl. Growl. Grrrr.
text: He examines his mouth, touching his canines carefully.
text: After a while he sighs and goes into the kitchen.
scene_heading: 48 INT. ALEX'S KITCHEN - DUSK
text: David goes straight to the fridge and opens it. He
text: closes the fridge and walks into the bedroom.
scene_heading: 49 INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - DUSK
text: He lays down on the bed. After a few beats of staring
text: at the ceiling, he rises and goes back into the
dialog: kitchen.
scene_heading: 50 INT. ALEX'S KITCHEN - DUSK
text: He reopens the fridge.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm not hungry.
text: He closes the fridge and walks into the living room.
scene_heading: 51 INT. ALEX'S LIVING ROOM - DUSK
text: David turns on the television. On Thames is a soccer
text: match. On BBC 1 is some truly insipid children's
text: program, and on BBC 2 is a soccer match. David
text: switches off the television.
text: He sits on the chair nervously, drumming his fingers
text: and humming.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (singing)
text: `Moon River, wider than a mile
dialog: I'm crossing you in style,
dialog: Someday....'
text: David gets up, goes to the front door, and flings it
text: open. It is getting dark. David views this fearfully,
text: but still not completely convinced. He goes back
text: inside and we note that the front door is not
text: completely closed. He goes back into the bathroom and
text: looks into the mirror.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Fee fi fo fum, I smell the
text: blood of an Englishman.
text: He goes back into the living room and paces round and
text: round the room like a caged animal.
scene_heading: 52 INT. CHILDREN'S WARD - NIGHT
text: Alex is back with Benjamin, the little Pakistani.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: How are we feeling tonight?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No what?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Benjamin, have you ever been
text: severely beaten about the face
dialog: and neck?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I thought not.
text: She tucks him in.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You sleep now and have sweet
dialog: dreams.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN & ALEX
dialog: No!
text: For the first time, Benjamin smiles. As Alex tucks him
text: in, we can clearly see the full moon outside through
text: the window.
scene_heading: 53 INT. ALEX'S FLAT - NIGHT
text: David sits reading Connecticut Yankee when he suddenly
text: clutches his head in pain.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jesus Christ!
text: He stands in agony, the book falls to the floor.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (screams)
dialog: What? Christ! What?
text: He begins sweating profusely, clinging to the sides of
text: his head. He trembles violently.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm burning up! Jesus!
text: He rips at his shirt, tearing it off. His body is
text: dripping wet.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (shouts out in
dialog: pain and fear)
dialog: Jack!? Where are you now, you
dialog: fucker!?!
text: As a new spasm of pain wracks his body, he cries out in
dialog: anguish.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Help me! Somebody help me,
dialog: please! Jack!!
text: David's hair is wringing wet. He screams and grabs at
text: his legs.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (pleading, whimpering)
dialog: I'm sorry I called you a meat
dialog: loaf, Jack.
text: New bolts of agonizing pain wrack through David's body.
text: He grabs at his pants, pulling them off as if they are
text: burning him.
text: Standing naked in the center of the room, David gasps
dialog: for air.
text: He falls to his knees and then forward on his hands.
text: He remains on his hands and knees, trying to master his
text: torment; but it's no use. On all fours he gives
text: himself over to the excruciating hurt and slowly begins
dialog: to change.
text: The metamorphosis from man into beast is not an easy
text: one. As bone and muscle bend and reform themselves,
text: the body suffers lacerating pain. We can actually see
text: David's flesh move, the rearranging tissue. His mouth
text: bleeds as fangs emerge. His whole face distorts as his
text: jaw extends, his skull literally changing shape before
text: our eyes. His hands gnarl and his fingers curl back as
text: claws burst forward.
text: The camera pans up to show the full moon outside
text: through the window. David's moans change slowly into
text: low guttural growls. We hear the four footfalls as the
text: WOLF begins to walk. As the camera pans back over the
text: room, we see the front door pushed open and hear the
text: Wolf padding off into the darkness.
scene_heading: 54 EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT
text: A taxi pulls up in front of a block of flats. An
text: attractive couple gets out. The Man pays the driver
text: and the cab drives off.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Which one, Harry?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Number thirty-nine, but let's
dialog: go `round the back.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Come on, we'll give Sean a
dialog: scare.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: You're crazy, Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Come on.
text: Harry takes her hand and leads her around the side of
text: the flats. The apartments back up to a park and the
text: two walk around to the rear. The park is dark and
dialog: quiet.
scene_heading: 55 EXT. PARK - NIGHT
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Did you hear something?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Just now?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No. Here we are, Sean's is
dialog: the one....
text: THE WOLF SPRINGS! Before the Woman can scream, the
text: Wolf whirls around and goes for her throat. We can't
text: see clearly, but we see enough to realize how large the
text: Wolf is and that its wolfen features are twisted and
text: demonic. The Wolf savagely devours its two victims.
scene_heading: 56 INT. SEAN'S FLAT - NIGHT
text: Sean's wife is looking through their French windows out
text: onto the park - a middle-aged couple.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Sean, those hooligans are in

speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Aren't you ready yet? They'll
dialog: be here any minute.
speaker_heading: WIFE

scene_heading: 57 INT. HOSPITAL - NURSES' STATION - NIGHT
text: Miss Gallagher is helping Mrs. Hobbs dispense

text: He is still wearing his overcoat.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Is Miss Price on duty this
dialog: evening?
speaker_heading: MRS. HOBBS
dialog: Yes, Doctor.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Miss Gallagher, do you know if
dialog: Miss Price has seen the
dialog: Kessler boy since his release?
text: Miss Gallagher is not sure how to answer.
scene_heading: MISS GALLAGHER
dialog: Uh, I don't know if....
text: Alex has walked up and overheard the last.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: It's all right, Susan. Yes,
dialog: Doctor, I have.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Come to my office, Miss Price.
text: Alex and Susan exchange glances as she obediently
text: follows Dr. Hirsch down the hallway.
scene_heading: 58 EXT. PARK - NIGHT
text: Sean has exited the back of his flat to investigate his
text: wife's complaints. She hangs by the door. He walks
text: deeper into the park.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (calls out)
dialog: Is anyone there?
scene_heading: 59 INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Dr. Hirsch hangs up his overcoat.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Sit down, Alex.
text: Alex sits and Dr. Hirsch leans against his desk.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: I was in East Proctor today.
text: Alex looks confused. Dr. Hirsch realizes the cause of
dialog: her concern.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Oh dear girl, your
dialog: extracurricular activities are
dialog: of no consequence to me. I
dialog: don't give a damn who you
dialog: sleep with. I'm concerned
dialog: about David.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: It's a full moon. Where is
dialog: he?
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: At my flat. I'm off at
dialog: midnight and....
text: Dr. Hirsch picks up the phone.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: The number, Alex. Your
dialog: number!
scene_heading: 60 EXT. PARK - NIGHT
text: Sean carefully approaches something near the trees. He
text: steps on something and looks down to see what it is.
text: It is an arm.
scene_heading: 61 INT. ALEX'S FLAT - NIGHT - EXTREME CLOSEUP - THE
speaker_heading: TELEPHONE
text: rings loudly. (This is a scare.) It continues to ring
text: unanswered.
scene_heading: 62 INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Dr. Hirsch waits on the phone, finally hanging up.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
text: He's not there.
text: Alex grows worried.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: He's not?
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Alex, has David persisted in
dialog: his werewolf fantasies?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Well, yes, but he seems to be
text: more upset by the death of his
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Has his friend appeared to him
dialog: again?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: What did he say?
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: David says Jack comes to warn
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Warn him?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is
dialog: this more serious than I know?
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: I tried to investigate the
text: attack. There are no records.
dialog: The case was closed and now
dialog: they've `misplaced' the file.
text: David's lacerations were
dialog: cleaned and dressed when he
dialog: arrived here and yet
dialog: supposedly no doctor examined
dialog: him before I did. The Goodman
text: boy is already in the ground
dialog: so he's no good to us. So I
dialog: went to the pub in East
dialog: Proctor where I was convinced
dialog: of two things.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
text: They were lying. There were
dialog: no witnesses, no escaped
dialog: lunatic. The whole community
dialog: is hiding the truth of what
dialog: actually happened up there.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: And what else?
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: I think the village of East
text: Proctor is hiding some dark
dialog: and terrible secret. I'm
dialog: convinced that, like David,
dialog: they believe in this werewolf.
text: Alex is flabbergasted.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: You've absolutely no idea
dialog: where David might be?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No. He knows no one in
dialog: London, besides me. I
dialog: shouldn't have left him alone.
text: Suddenly.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Surely you're not
dialog: suggesting....
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: David has suffered a severe
dialog: trauma. I myself witnessed
dialog: some form of mass neurosis in
dialog: East Proctor. If all the
dialog: villagers believe that Jack
dialog: Goodman was killed by a
dialog: werewolf, why shouldn't David?
dialog: And then it follows that if he
text: survived an attack by a
dialog: werewolf, wouldn't he himself
dialog: become a werewolf the next
dialog: full moon?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (bewildered)
dialog: Dr. Hirsch?
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Oh, I don't mean running about
text: on all fours and howling at
dialog: the moon. But in such a
dialog: deranged state he could harm
dialog: himself, or perhaps others.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What shall we do?
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Let's call the police and see
dialog: if they can help us find our
text: wandering boy.
scene_heading: 63 EXT. BRICK LANE - NIGHT
text: The bombed-out ruins of this unsavory part of London
text: are stark and uninviting in the moonlight. Three old
text: DERELICTS are huddled around a trash can fire trying to
text: keep warm. A skinny dog is tied up beside them. Its
text: ears perk up and he growls in warning.
speaker_heading: DERELICT #1
text: Old Winston smells something.
speaker_heading: DERELICT #2
dialog: (calls out)
dialog: Who's there?
text: The dog begins to whine.
speaker_heading: DERELICT #2
dialog: Let `im go.
text: Derelict #1 unties Winston who takes off running in
dialog: terror.
speaker_heading: DERELICT #3
dialog: Brave dog that.
speaker_heading: DERELICT #1
dialog: (worried)
dialog: Here - who's there?
text: An unearthly howl shatters the night. We've heard this
text: sound on the moors.
speaker_heading: DERELICT #2
dialog: That's not Winston.
speaker_heading: DERELICT #3
dialog: Look there.
text: He points out into the night. They strain their eyes -
text: something is approaching them. They can just make out
dialog: its size.
speaker_heading: DERELICT #1
dialog: Mother Mary of God.
scene_heading: 64 INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT
text: A train SCREECHES to a halt. (A scare.) We are in the
text: tubes of London. Only one passenger disembarks and the
text: train goes off, leaving him alone in the cavernous
text: hallways. The PASSENGER is a young man, rather well-
text: dressed. He looks about the platform, then at his
text: watch. He walks up to a vending machine to buy a
dialog: Cadbury Chocolate Bar.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY STATION - LONG SHOT
text: as the Passenger puts his coin in the vending machine.
text: The camera is on ground level and as we watch the
text: Passenger, the Wolf's legs flash by us.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP
text: of the Passenger eating his chocolate bar. He turns
text: thoughtfully, wondering if he had heard something.
text: Satisfied that he is alone, he begins his walk down one
text: of the long serpentine tunnels that make up London's
text: tubes. He feels he's being followed and turns slowly
text: to look. There is no one and he continues, concerned
text: about his imagination.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - WOLF'S EYES
text: watching in the darkness.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Our Passenger approaches the first escalator, pauses,
text: then gets on going swiftly and silently up the moving
dialog: stairway.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - WOLF'S SNOUT
text: In profile we can see its ragged, razor-sharp fangs and
text: black tongue. It waits, panting, drool falls from its
dialog: mouth.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: The Passenger reaches the landing and walks briskly
text: down the long tunnel marked "Escalator to Street
text: Level". He is being followed. He hears it and we hear
text: it. He stops, frightened.
speaker_heading: PASSENGER
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: TUNNEL
text: Long and empty.
speaker_heading: THE PASSENGER
speaker_heading: PASSENGER
dialog: Is there someone there?
text: We hear the Wolf's heavy breathing. The Passenger is
text: beginning to panic.
speaker_heading: PASSENGER
dialog: I can assure you that this is
dialog: not in the least bit amusing!
text: He looks around wildly.
speaker_heading: PASSENGER
dialog: I shall report this!
scene_heading: PASSENGER'S P.O.V.
text: We see the Wolf at a great distance trotting down the
text: tunnel towards us.
speaker_heading: PASSENGER
dialog: Good Lord.
speaker_heading: THE PASSENGER
text: turns to flee, his jog becoming a run. He is
text: terrified.
speaker_heading: WOLF - CLOSEUP
text: of the Wolf's running steps.
speaker_heading: THE PASSENGER
text: frantically running, falls to the ground hard bloodying
text: his nose. He scrambles to his feet crying out in fear.
text: Reaching the escalator, he begins to run up the moving
text: stairs, falling several times. He sits, panting and
text: defeated, the blood trickling from his nose.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: WOLF'S P.O.V.
text: as it begins to climb the stairs. The camera tracks
text: slowly in on the increasingly horrified Passenger until
text: we are in an extreme closeup of his eyes, when we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 65 CLOSEUP - A TIGER ROARING
text: (A scare.) The tiger paces in its cage and roars
dialog: again. We are at:
scene_heading: EXT. LONDON ZOO - DAY
text: It is early morning and all the animals are aroused.
text: We cut around to roaring cats, screeching monkeys, and
text: panicky birds, etc., until we come to the Wolves' cage
text: where we find David, naked and curled up on the ground
text: by the cage, asleep. David wakes up slowly. He is
text: completely naked, his body dirty, with several
text: scratches on his torso and legs. He yawns and
text: stretches, makes a face, and with his finger picks
text: something distasteful from his teeth. He also notices
text: something under his fingernails and as he goes to clean
text: them, he suddenly does a complete Stan Laurel
text: discovering where he is. He puts his hands over his
text: eyes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Wake me up, Alex.
text: He slowly peaks through his fingers; he's still there.
text: He stands up and looks around.
text: The zoo opens and women with prams and children hustle
text: about. David sees them coming towards him, notes his
text: lack of clothes, and decides it would be better for all
text: concerned if they did not meet. He looks around for a
text: suitable hiding place and dashes behind some bushes.
text: He crouches down so that he can't be seen, scratching
text: himself on a thorn.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Ouch!
scene_heading: 66 INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY
text: Alex sits holding David's torn T-shirt. She is trying
text: to read her book, but is just too distracted. The
text: phone rings and she runs for it.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (excited, then
dialog: disappointed)
dialog: Hello? No, Dr. Hirsch, he
dialog: hasn't come back yet. Yes, I
dialog: will, doctor, but I just feel
dialog: so helpless sitting here doing
dialog: nothing. Thank you, yes,
dialog: goodbye.
text: She hangs up and looks around the empty flat. She is
text: now more worried than ever.
scene_heading: 67 EXT. LONDON ZOO - DAY
text: David is still behind the bushes. He looks to see if
text: the coast is clear, then stands up and parts the
text: bushes. He steps out to confront a DOWAGER LADY.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: DOWAGER'S FACE
text: Dumbfounded.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Excuse me, won't you?
text: He returns to the bushes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - A GORILLA EATING
text: A LITTLE BOY with four helium balloons on a string is

dialog: cage.
speaker_heading: DAVID (O.S.)
dialog: Pssst!
text: The Little Boy looks around.
speaker_heading: DAVID (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, kid! Pssst. Little boy
text: with the balloons.
text: The Little Boy pantomimes, "who me?"
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: THE BUSHES
text: David cannot be seen.
speaker_heading: DAVID (O.S.)
dialog: Come over here.
text: The Little Boy shakes his head. The bush replies:
speaker_heading: DAVID (O.S.)
dialog: If you come over here, I'll
dialog: give you a pound.
text: The Little Boy shakes his head. The bush pleads.
speaker_heading: DAVID (O.S.)
dialog: Two pounds?
text: The Little Boy shakes his head. The bush reasons:
speaker_heading: DAVID (O.S.)
dialog: Listen, two pounds is a lot of
dialog: money. It's almost five
dialog: dollars.
speaker_heading: LITTLE BOY
dialog: (very English)
dialog: I don't know who you are.
speaker_heading: DAVID (O.S.)
dialog: I'm the famous balloon thief.
speaker_heading: LITTLE BOY
dialog: Why would a thief want to give
dialog: me two pounds?
speaker_heading: DAVID (O.S.)
dialog: (losing patience)
dialog: Come here and I'll show you.
text: The Little Boy starts cautiously towards the shrubbery,
text: but stops a few feet away.
speaker_heading: DAVID (O.S.)
dialog: (pleading)
dialog: Come on!
text: The Little Boy edges forward.
speaker_heading: DAVID (O.S.)
text: A little closer.
text: When the Little Boy gets within reach, David grabs his
text: balloons and uses them to cover his crotch.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thank you.
text: David runs off through the zoo, naked but for his
text: balloons, startling several animal lovers.
scene_heading: 68 EXT. PARK - DAY
text: An ELDERLY COUPLE sits feeding birds, their coats

scene_heading: 69 EXT. LONDON ZOO - DAY
text: The Little Boy tugs at his MOTHER'S coat.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Yes, love?
speaker_heading: LITTLE BOY
dialog: A naked, American man stole my

speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LITTLE BOY
text: A naked, American man -- the

scene_heading: 70 EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY
text: The signs they always have on London newsstands
text: proclaim "Man or Monster?" Dr. Hirsch picks up a
text: newspaper with its headline, "London Murder Victims
dialog: Found Partially Devoured".
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: I'll have one of those, too.
text: He pays for the papers. The second one's headline,
text: "Death Toll Up To Six - New Jack The Ripper?"
scene_heading: 71 EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY - BUS STOP
text: in another part of town. The camera is on the crowd of
text: fifteen or twenty people waiting for the bus. When the
text: bus pulls up, they all crowd in. The camera goes to
text: floor level and slowly examines the footwear of the
text: crowded bus. Passengers are standing in the aisle and
text: the camera slowly pans on their galoshes, boots, high
text: heels, rubbers, etc., until it comes to rest on a
text: conspicuous pair of bare feet. We pan up to find David
text: clad only in a woman's rain coat with a fur collar
text: trying to look as nonchalant as possible. A man looks
text: at him oddly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (cheerfully)
dialog: A lot of weather we've been
dialog: having lately.
text: The man studies David carefully.
scene_heading: 72 INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY
text: Alex sits in the kitchen drinking tea and reading.
text: There is loud knocking on the door. Alex rushes to
text: open it and David enters quickly, closing the door
text: behind him. He is still wearing the woman's coat.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: David! Where on earth have
dialog: you been!?!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm freezing.
text: He goes into the bedroom and takes off the coat and
text: gets dressed as Alex watches in amazement. David is
text: excited, even euphoric.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Alex, I've lost my mind. I
dialog: woke up at the zoo! But you
dialog: know what? I feel terrific!
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: The zoo?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Waking up at the zoo, that's
dialog: not so insane. Having no
dialog: clothes on? That's insane.
dialog: What did I do last night,
dialog: Alex?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Don't you remember?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I said goodbye to you. I was
dialog: locked out of the flat. I
text: climbed the wall and came in
text: through the bathroom window.
dialog: I started to read and then I
dialog: was naked at the zoo!
dialog: (big smile)
dialog: I guess I am out of my fucking
dialog: mind.
text: Alex sits next to him and puts her arm around his
dialog: shoulders.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I worried about you. We
dialog: didn't know where you were.

text: with equal passion.
speaker_heading: ALEX

text: David laughs.
scene_heading: 73 INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Alex, have you heard anything?
text: Alex speaks softly so that David won't hear her.
speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Is he all right? Why didn't
dialog: you call me? Where was he?
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: He doesn't remember. He woke
text: up at the zoo.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: The zoo? Is he rational?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yes, he is. He's very excited
text: and confused, but he's not
dialog: crazy, if that's what you
dialog: mean.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Have you read the papers
dialog: today? Have you listened to
dialog: the radio or television?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No, why?
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Is David acting strangely?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No, not really.
text: Dr. Hirsch considers.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Could you get here without any
dialog: trouble?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yes, I should think so.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Right. Now listen carefully.
dialog: I want you to bring David
dialog: here. I want him in my care.
dialog: I'll notify the police that
dialog: we've found him. It is
dialog: imperative that you bring him
dialog: straight to the hospital. Do
dialog: you understand?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yes, Doctor.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: You're certain he's lucid?
dialog: You won't need any help?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: He's fine. We'll come right
dialog: over.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Shall I send a car?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No, a cab will be faster.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: I expect you shortly.
text: Dr. Hirsch hangs up, checks a piece of paper, and then
text: dials again.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Yes, Scotland Yard?
scene_heading: 75 EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY
text: Alex and David are walking.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: The next corner we can get a

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (grins)
dialog: I should be committed.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Dr. Hirsch will know what to
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (stretches)
dialog: I don't know why I feel so
dialog: good. I haven't felt this
dialog: good in a long time.
text: Alex is signaling for a taxi.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: My body feels alive, alert. I
dialog: feel like an athlete.
text: A taxi pulls up; Alex opens the door.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Get in.
scene_heading: 76 INT. TAXI - DAY
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Saint Martin's Hospital.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Right.
text: As they drive.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: It's like the days of the Mad

dialog: it?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: The murders.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: What murders?
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Last night. Haven't you
dialog: heard? Six people in
dialog: different parts of the city
dialog: mutilated. A real maniac this
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Pull over.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: But....
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (adamant)
text: Pull over.
scene_heading: 77 EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY
text: The cab pulls to the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Pay the man.
text: David gets out of the cab.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: David, wait!
text: She hurriedly hands the Driver some money and takes off
dialog: after David.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: David, what are you doing?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Six people mutilated? It had
dialog: to be me, Alex.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: David, stop!
text: He turns and faces her.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I am going to the cops.
dialog: There's a full moon tonight.
dialog: Jack was right. I....
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (angry)
dialog: Jack is dead!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jack is dead. Look, six
dialog: people have been killed. I'm
text: going to the police.
text: David takes off walking briskly down the street. Alex
text: has to jog to keep up with him.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: David, please be rational.
dialog: Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Rational!?! I'm a fucking
dialog: werewolf, for Christ's sake!
text: He strides up to a Bobbie on the corner.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Officer, I killed those people
dialog: last night.
speaker_heading: BOBBIE
dialog: (interested)
dialog: You did, did you?
text: Alex runs up.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: He's playing a stupid joke,
dialog: sir.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (dumbfounded)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: We had an argument. He's
dialog: being silly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (desperate)
dialog: I swear, I don't know this
dialog: girl.
speaker_heading: BOBBIE
dialog: All right, you two, move
dialog: along.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hey, you asshole! I want you
dialog: to arrest me!
speaker_heading: BOBBIE
dialog: There's no call for that kind
dialog: of language.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: Queen Elizabeth is a man!
dialog: Prince Charles is a faggot!
dialog: Winston Churchill was full of
dialog: shit!
speaker_heading: BOBBIE
dialog: (losing patience)
dialog: Now see here young man.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Shakespeare was French! The
text: Queen Mother sucks cocks in
dialog: hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
text: The Bobbie takes David's arm roughly as pedestrians
text: start to gather.
speaker_heading: BOBBIE
dialog: That's quite enough!
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (pleading)
dialog: David, please!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Who is this girl?
speaker_heading: BOBBIE
dialog: You're going to have to stop
dialog: this disturbance or I shall
dialog: arrest you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (frustrated, yelling)
dialog: That's what I want you to do,
dialog: you moron!
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (to Bobbie)
dialog: Sir, he's very upset. His
dialog: friend was killed and....
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Will you shut up!?!!
speaker_heading: BOBBIE
dialog: (losing his temper)
dialog: That's enough! Now go about
dialog: your business.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yes, David, let's go.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (disbelief)
dialog: You're not going to arrest me?
text: David approaches one of the ONLOOKERS.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Don't you think he should
dialog: arrest me?
speaker_heading: ONLOOKER
dialog: Well, I'm not sure. How does
dialog: he know this isn't a prank?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (despair)
dialog: A prank?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (urgently)
dialog: David....
text: The Bobbie has lost all patience.
speaker_heading: BOBBIE
dialog: I've no time for this
dialog: foolishness.
dialog: (to onlookers)
dialog: Nothing to look at. Move
dialog: along.
text: The Bobbie walks away. David is beside himself.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Hopeless. It's hopeless.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (softly)
dialog: David, let's go now.
text: David turns in a rage.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Leave me alone, dammit! You
dialog: people are crazy! I've got to
dialog: get away from here! I've got
dialog: to do something!
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (worried)
dialog: David, don't lose control.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (approaching, hysteria)
dialog: Control!?! What control!?!
dialog: Get away from me!
text: He begins to cry.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Leave me alone!
text: He runs out into the street. Cars slam on their
text: brakes, just missing him.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: David, wait!
text: It's too late. He's lost in traffic. Alex stands for
text: a moment not knowing which way to turn.
scene_heading: 78 EXT. ALLEY - DAY
text: David is running in panic. He finally comes to rest in
text: an alley. He sits down and sobs uncontrollably.
scene_heading: 79 INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Alex sits distraught in the chair opposite the desk.
text: Dr. Hirsch is talking to Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus.
scene_heading: LT. VILLIERS
text: The forensic lads seem to feel
dialog: that some sort of animal was
dialog: involved, that's true, but I
dialog: hardly think....
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: (interrupts)
dialog: Regardless of what you think,
dialog: Lieutenant, the fact remains
dialog: that David is missing and that
dialog: we must find him.
scene_heading: SGT. McMANUS
text: Before nightfall.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Precisely.
scene_heading: LT. VILLIERS
dialog: (harried)
dialog: Gentlemen, please. We shall
dialog: find Mr. Kessler as quickly as
dialog: we're able.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: He tried to have himself
dialog: arrested. He....
scene_heading: LT. VILLIERS
dialog: (interrupts)
dialog: Getting arrested isn't all
dialog: that difficult, Miss Price.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: He wants help. He....
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: (interrupts)
dialog: What can we do to assist you?
scene_heading: LT. VILLIERS
dialog: (rising)
dialog: Stay here. If we need you,
dialog: we'll know where to reach you.
text: He and Sgt. McManus pause by the door.
scene_heading: LT. VILLIERS
dialog: I cannot accept a connection
dialog: between David Kessler and last
dialog: night's murders. We will find
dialog: him, however. I can assure
dialog: you of that.
scene_heading: SGT. McMANUS
dialog: We'll find him, not to worry.
text: The two policemen exit. Dr. Hirsch looks at Alex.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (distraught)
dialog: What shall we do?
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: (comforting)
dialog: Tea would be nice.
scene_heading: 80 EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - DAY
text: David is in a telephone booth.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes, operator. I'd like to
dialog: call the United States and
dialog: reverse the charges. David
dialog: Kessler for anyone. Yes, I'll
dialog: wait. Hello? Yes, area code
dialog: 315/472-3402. Thank you.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Hello? Rachel? Just say yes,
dialog: you'll accept the charges.
dialog: Just say yes, Rachel. Is Mom
dialog: or Dad home? Where are they?
dialog: Where's Max? You're all
dialog: alone? Mom and Dad wouldn't
dialog: leave me alone when I was ten.
dialog: No, not ten and a half either.
dialog: I'm still in London. I'm all
dialog: better. Look, would you tell
dialog: Mom and Dad that I love them?
dialog: I don't care, Rachel, just do
dialog: it for me. Okay? Good. And,
dialog: Rachel, don't fight with Max.
dialog: Well, try. Look, kid, please
dialog: don't forget to tell Mom and
dialog: Dad I love them. I love Max
dialog: and you, too. Well, I do.
dialog: No, I'm not being weird, you
dialog: little creep. You promise?
dialog: Okay. Be a good girl. I love
dialog: you. Bye.
text: He hangs up in profound depression. Leaving the booth
text: he sees an outdoor clock. It is 4:15. He sighs, then
text: catches sight of something.
scene_heading: 81 EXT. CINEMA - DAY - DAVID'S P.O.V.
text: There stands Jack, now truly rotted and ghastly. He's
text: pretty much dried out, a third of his face gone
text: revealing the grinning skull. He waves to David. Jack
text: points inside the theater and goes in. David smiles,
text: walks across the intersection, and up to the box
dialog: office.
scene_heading: TICKET LADY
dialog: Two and a half quid, please.
text: David reaches in his pocket. All he has are traveler's
dialog: checks.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Will you take a traveler's
dialog: check?
scene_heading: TICKET LADY
dialog: No, sorry.
text: David signs a $100 check and hands it to her.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Keep the change.
scene_heading: TICKET LADY
dialog: Well, thank you, sir!
text: She gives him a ticket. David goes in.
scene_heading: 82 INT. CINEMA - DAY
text: A film (to be determined) plays on screen. The small
text: theater is mostly empty. A few snoring BUMS and wide-
text: eyed CHILDREN are scattered about. Jack sits in the
text: last row in the shadows. He waves to David. David
text: goes and sits next to him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hi, Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hi, David.
text: They sit for a while watching the screen.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What can I say, Jack?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You don't have to say
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Aren't you going to say, `I
dialog: told you so'?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: If I was still alive, I
dialog: probably would.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You look awful.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (apologizes quickly)
dialog: I didn't mean it. I don't
dialog: know what I'm saying. I'm not
dialog: even sure it was me who killed
dialog: those people. I don't
dialog: remember doing it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What about the zoo?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, even if I'm not the
dialog: wolfman, I am crazy enough to
dialog: do something like that. I
dialog: mean, here I sit in Leicester
text: Square talking to a corpse.
dialog: I'm glad to see you, Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I want you to meet some
dialog: people.
text: Sitting down the row from Jack is a man, GERALD
text: BRINGSLY, completely in the shadow.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: David Kessler, this is Gerald
text: Bringsly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Gerald is the man you murdered
dialog: in the subway. We thought it
dialog: best you didn't see him as
dialog: he's a fresh kill and still
dialog: pretty messy.
speaker_heading: BRINGSLY
dialog: (in shadow; very English)
dialog: Yes, I do look most
dialog: unpleasant.
text: The camera pans down to show the blood dripping from
text: the seat to a puddle on the floor.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (horrified)
dialog: Why are you doing this to me,
dialog: Jack?
speaker_heading: BRINGSLY
dialog: This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea.
dialog: He is your good friend,
dialog: whereas I am a victim of your
dialog: carnivorous lunar activities.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (appalled)
dialog: Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I
dialog: have absolutely no idea what
dialog: to say to you.
speaker_heading: BRINGSLY
dialog: You've left my wife a widow
dialog: and my children fatherless.
dialog: And I understand that I am to
dialog: walk the earth one of the
text: living dead until the wolf's
text: bloodline is severed and the
dialog: curse lifted.
text: Bringlsy leans forward almost into the light, he
text: glistens.
speaker_heading: BRINGSLY
dialog: You must die, David Kessler.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: David, this is Harry Berman
text: and his fiancee Judith Browns.
text: The two victims lean forward from their seats next to
text: Mr. Bringsly. We can just make out that Harry has one
text: arm missing.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: And these gentlemen are Alf,
text: Ted, and Joseph.
text: The Three Derelicts sit next to Harry and Judith. All
text: are slick in the darkness, the light from the screen
text: illuminating their gore.
speaker_heading: DERELICT #2
dialog: Can't say we're pleased to
dialog: meet you, Mr. Kessler.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (defeated)
dialog: What shall I do?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Suicide.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (adamantly)
dialog: You must take your own life!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That's easy for you to say -
dialog: you're already dead.
speaker_heading: BRINGSLY
dialog: No, David. Harry and I and
dialog: everyone you murder are not
text: dead. The undead.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: Why are you doing this to me?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Because this must be stopped.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How shall I do it?
speaker_heading: JUDITH
dialog: Sleeping pills?
speaker_heading: DERELICT #1
dialog: Not sure enough.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I could hang myself.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: If you did it wrong, it would
dialog: be painful. You'd choke to
dialog: death.
speaker_heading: DERELICT #3
dialog: So what? Let `im choke.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Do you mind? The man's a
dialog: friend of mine.
speaker_heading: DERELICT #3
dialog: Well he ain't no friend of
dialog: mine.
speaker_heading: BRINGSLY
dialog: Gentlemen, please.
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: A gun.
speaker_heading: DERELICT #1
dialog: I know where he can get a gun.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Don't I need a silver bullet
dialog: or something?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Be serious, would you?
text: David puts his head in his hands.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Madness. I've gone totally
dialog: mad.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: A gun is good.
speaker_heading: JUDITH
dialog: You just put the gun to your
text: forehead and pull the trigger.
speaker_heading: BRINGSLY
dialog: If you put it in your mouth,
dialog: then you'd be sure not to
dialog: miss.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thank you, you're all so
dialog: thoughtful.
text: As the conversation continues, the camera pulls back

text: suddenly.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 83 EXT. BIG BEN - NIGHT
text: The clock strikes eleven. The full moon is up.
scene_heading: 84 INT. CINEMA - NIGHT
text: David is dripping wet and shaking violently. Three

text: staring at him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (gasps out in anguish)
dialog: Go away! Please! Go away!
text: The children watch, fascinated as David's seizures grow
dialog: more severe.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (his face contorting)
dialog: Run! Please...run.
text: His hands clutch the arms of his chair. Coarse thick
text: hair splits his skin. The children's eyes widen in
dialog: fascination.
scene_heading: 85 EXT. CINEMA - NIGHT
text: Roars and screams come from inside the theater. The
text: TICKET TAKER at the door says to the Ticket Lady:
speaker_heading: TICKET TAKER
dialog: I'll check on the house.
text: He goes inside the theater.
scene_heading: 86 INT. CINEMA - NIGHT
text: The Ticket Taker enters the theater. The movie
text: continues on screen, but all else is quiet. He
text: cautiously continues down the aisle. He sees something
text: and makes his way towards it. He looks down in horror.
text: THE WOLF SPRINGS!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 87 EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - NIGHT
text: From way up high we look down on the sidewalks and
text: single out TWO BOBBIES running furiously to the cinema
text: through the busy traffic.
scene_heading: 88 EXT. CINEMA - NIGHT
text: The two cops run up, the Ticket Lady is hysterical.
scene_heading: TICKET LADY
dialog: It's horrible, horrible!
dialog: There's a beast! A mad dog!
dialog: It's killing people in there!
text: One cop stays with the lady, the other rushes inside.
scene_heading: 89 INT. CINEMA - NIGHT
text: The cop enters a side door to find several bloodied
text: corpses. He hears something, looks over to see the
text: Wolf hunched over a victim. The Wolf turns, eyes
text: blazing, mouth dripping with blood. We see it clearly
text: for the first time. It is truly a hound from hell, its
text: wolfen features a hideous sight. Its eyes fierce,
text: burning green. The Wolf roars and starts for the cop.
text: The cop rushes out and slams the door behind him.
scene_heading: 90 EXT. CINEMA
text: As the cop bolts the door shut.
speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: For God's sake, Tom, there's a
dialog: monster in there!
text: The doors shudder as the Wolf begins to batter them

speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: Call for assistance and tell
dialog: them to bring guns.
text: Pedestrians start milling around. The door is bulging.
text: The Wolf's roars continue.
speaker_heading: COP #2
dialog: Keep moving! Will you people
dialog: get out of the way!
scene_heading: 91 INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Alex is asleep. Dr. Hirsch wakes her.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Nurse Hobbs said there's a
dialog: disturbance in Leicester
dialog: Square involving some sort of

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: David?
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: I doubt it. But it's
dialog: something to do.
scene_heading: 92 INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
text: An officer unlocks a rack of rifles which are
text: distributed to uniformed men.
scene_heading: 93 INT. CINEMA - NIGHT
text: Police cars arrive, sirens blaring. Officers are
text: pushing the crowd back as other men help hold the door
text: closed against the Wolf's battering.
text: Another police car pulls up and out steps Lt. Villiers
text: and Sgt. McManus.
scene_heading: LT. VILLIERS
dialog: What the hell is going on
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: It's some kind of animal, sir.
dialog: We....
text: Suddenly the doors splinter apart and there stands the
text: Wolf, eyes blazing. It leaps on Lt. Villiers, savaging
text: him. The crowd falls back in panic.
text: The Wolf runs into traffic, a cab swerves to avoid
text: hitting it and plows into fleeing pedestrians hurling
text: one through a shop window. Mass confusion as orders
text: are shouted and the police pursue the Wolf.
text: It runs down an alleyway into a cul de sac. It stops
text: in the darkness, blocked by a brick wall. The Wolf
text: whirls around, defiant, roaring. The cops quickly
text: barricade the entrance to the alley.
scene_heading: 94 INT. TAXI - NIGHT
text: The taxi is halted by the traffic jam in Leicester
text: Square. Police vehicles roar past.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: David! It's David!

scene_heading: 95 EXT. CUL DE SAC - NIGHT

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Let me through!
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Stand clear, miss!
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I must get through!
text: Alex dodges the cop and runs into the alley. The
text: officers shout after her. Dr. Hirsch reaches the
text: police line.
speaker_heading: DR. HIRSCH
dialog: Alex!
text: Alex walks towards the dark end of the alley.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: David? Is it you? Is it
dialog: true, David?
text: She's almost to the end. The Wolf lays in wait in the
text: shadows. The police raise their weapons.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: David?
text: THE WOLF REARS UP. In that brief instant, Alex
text: realizes it will kill her.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Fire!
text: The guns blaze. The Wolf falls dead. Alex leans on
text: the wall, numb. The cops, Dr. Hirsch, and Sgt. McManus
