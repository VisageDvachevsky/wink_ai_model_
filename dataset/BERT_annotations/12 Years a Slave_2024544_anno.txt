scene_heading: -EARLY APRIL, 1841-
text: We are close on a PAIR OF BLACK HANDS as they open A
text: FINELY WRAPPED PACKET OF VIOLIN STRINGS.
text: WE CUT TO the hands stringing a VIOLIN. It's not a high
dialog: end piece, but it is quite nice.
text: WE CUT TO a wide shot of the study. Sitting in a chair
text: with violin in hand is SOLOMON NORTHUP; a man in his late
dialog: twenties. Everything about Solomon, his mien and manner,
text: is distinguished. But he, too, seems a hardy individual.
text: Someone who has known manual labor in his time.
text: Solomon begins to lightly play his violin, as if testing
text: the strings, their tuning. Satisfied, Solomon begins to
text: play vigorously. As he does, we make a HARD CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - EVENING
text: We come in on a lively affair. A dinner party is being
text: thrown within the confines of a fairly stately house. In
text: attendance are EIGHT COUPLES. All are WHITE and all are
text: FAIRLY YOUNG, in their early twenties. The men and women
dialog: are dressed in very fine attire. We should get the sense
dialog: that for the most part they are people of means.
text: The furniture has been set aside in the living room. At
text: the moment the couples are engaged in the dancing of a
speaker_heading: REEL.
text: The music they are dancing to is being played by Solomon,
dialog: having cut directly from the tune he was previously
text: playing. He plays with a light determination, and in no
text: way seems possessed with empty servitude.
text: Solomon concludes the reel, and the dancers break into
text: enthusiastic applause, which is followed by personal
dialog: thanks and congratulations from all. It should be clear
dialog: that despite their respective races there is much
dialog: admiration and appreciation for Solomon's abilities.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/BEDROOM - MORNING
text: It is a Saturday morning. Clad in her finest attire is
dialog: ANNE; Solomon's wife, a few years younger than he. We
dialog: see also the Northup children: MARGARET who is eight, and
text: ALONZO who is five. They are handsome, and well groomed
text: kids. Anne straightens up the children. She finishes,
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: 3 CONTINUED: 3
text: she rises up and stands behind them, almost as if
text: preparing to pose for a portrait.
text: They all wait a moment, then Solomon enters the foyer.
text: He stands and looks admiringly at his family. ADMIRINGLY
dialog: stressed. It isn't that he doesn't have love for them,
text: he does as well. But in the moment, he truly admires his
dialog: greatest accomplishment: a family that is healthy and
text: well and provided for. He goes to his children, and
text: hands each a coin, then goes to Anne. Gives her a kiss
text: on the cheek. The children giggle at the sight.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Solomon and his family are out walking along the streets
text: and groves of Saratoga.
text: The streets are well populated this morning with many
text: people out strolling. Most are WHITE, but there are
text: BLACKS as well. They are FREED BLACKS who mingle fairly
text: easily - though not always completely - with the whites.
text: We see, too, a few BLACK SLAVES who travel with their
text: WHITE MASTERS. These pairings are largely from the south
dialog: and - despite the fact the blacks are slaves - they are
text: not physically downtrodden, not field hands. They are
text: well dressed and "leading apparently an easy life" -
text: comparatively speaking - as they trail their masters.
text: As they walk, Solomon and his family arrive to an
text: intersection well-worn and muddied from horse and cart
text: traffic. Solomon and his children easily jump across the
text: muck. Anne stands at the lip of the puddle, calls for
text: Solomon to help her across.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Solomon...
text: Solomon, turning back to his wife with a broad smile
dialog: waving her forward:
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Come, Anne. Jump.
text: The children, now smiling as well, egg their mother on.
scene_heading: ALONZO MARGARET
dialog: Jump. You can make it. I've done it. You can make
dialog: it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: I will not ruin my dress. Catch
dialog: me!
text: Solomon moves close, holds out his arms. Yet, there's
text: still just a bit of mischievousness in his eyes. Anne
text: gives her husband a lightly stern look to which Solomon
dialog: replies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: I will catch you, Anne.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I will.
text: Again, lightly stern:
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: You will.
text: And with that Anne takes the leap. Solomon catches her,
text: swings her around grandly and sets her down lightly to
dialog: the delighted applause of the children. That done,
text: Solomon takes Anne's hand and leads her on.
text: As Solomon and his family make their way, among the
text: slaves on the street, we see one in particular; JASPER.
text: As he trails his MASTER he can't help but note Solomon
text: and his family as they enter A STORE. His intrigue of
dialog: this most handsome and harmonious group should be
dialog: obvious.
text: With his Master occupied, Jasper moves slyly toward the
text: STORE. Frozen on the spot, Jasper looks on admiringly.
text: Suddenly a voice barks out-
speaker_heading: A VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Jasper! Come on!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STORE - LATER
text: We are inside the store of MR. CEPHAS PARKER; a white man
text: and a supplier of general goods. Solomon greets him
speaker_heading: WITH:
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Mr. Parker.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Mr. Northup. Mrs. Northup.
text: With money in hand the Northup children move quickly
text: about the store looking for items to purchase.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Anne looks over some silks and fabrics. Parker suggests
speaker_heading: TO SOLOMON:
speaker_heading: PARKER (CONT'D)
dialog: A new cravat, Solomon? Pure silk
dialog: by way of the French.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: We are in need of a fresh carry
dialog: all for the Mrs's travels.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: A year's passed? Off to Sandy
dialog: Hill?
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: I am.
text: Using a long pole, Mr. Parker fetches down a CARRY ALL
text: from an upper shelf.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Something to suit your style, but
dialog: sturdy enough for the forty miles
dialog: round trip.
text: Handing the Bag to Anne, she is immediately taken by it.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: It's beautiful.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
speaker_heading: (CAUTIOUSLY)
dialog: At what price?
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: We will take it. Children, come
dialog: see what your father has just
dialog: purchased for me.
text: As the children run over - chattering excitedly about the
text: new gift - they RUN PAST JASPER who has quietly entered
dialog: the store.
text: At the checkout counter sits a portrait of WILLIAM HENRY
text: HARRISON, the edges draped in black crepe. Before the
text: book sits a LEDGER. Mr. Parker asks of Solomon:
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: If you would sign our condolence
dialog: book. My hope is to find a way to
dialog: forward it to the Widow Harrison.
dialog: Sad days for the nation.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Yes, certainly. Poor Mrs. Harris
dialog: and her children. I hope brighter
dialog: times ahead.

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 4A.

text: Jasper looks scared, timid. It's as though he'd like to

speaker_heading: SAYS:
speaker_heading: PARKER

dialog: assisted.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Ignore the gentleman's nonsense.
dialog: Now, may I interest you in a new

speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: Jasper!
speaker_heading: (TO PARKER)
dialog: My regrets for the intrusion.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: No intrusion.
text: Fitzgerald looks to Solomon. It is a cold glare as
dialog: though he wasn't speaking to, and has no interest in a
text: response from a black man. Looking back to Parker:
speaker_heading: FITZGERALD
dialog: Good day, sir.

scene_heading: INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/DINING ROOM - EVENING
text: Anne, busy in the kitchen, puts the final touches to the
text: meal, which is just about to begin. Solomon, in the
text: meanwhile, sits at the head of the table reading from a
text: NEWSPAPER. He reads to his children solemn news of the
dialog: funeral arrangements for the recently deceased President
dialog: Harrison.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: "Thus has passed away from earth
dialog: our late President."
text: Solomon starts from the top of the article.

dialog: "During the morning, from sunrise,

dialog: Then, from Margaret:
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Will you read it again?
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Not just now, darling.
text: Anne enters the dining room and places a large chicken at
text: the center of the table. As she takes a seat, all heads
dialog: are bowed.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: For food that stays our hunger,
dialog: For rest that brings us ease,
dialog: For homes where memories linger,
dialog: We give our thanks for these.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Amen.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Margaret, that was wonderful.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Thank you, Papa.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Alonzo, do you have something to

speaker_heading: ALONZO
dialog: Yes, I helped Momma make this.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Yes, and you were such a good

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Papa, I would very much like to
dialog: learn how to play the violin.
dialog: Could you teach me?
speaker_heading: ALONZO
dialog: Me too!
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yes, but I asked Papa first.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Both of you, calm down. We will

text: Silhouetted in the doorway, Solomon takes Anne in his

dialog: 
speaker_heading: 7A 7A
scene_heading: INT. NORTHUP HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Now alone together, we see Anne and Solomon wrapped in
text: each other's arms. Beyond being physically close,
text: emotionally close, they are just so very comfortable with
dialog: one another. They are the very representation of a
text: couple who are made for each other.
dialog: 
text: They look at each other for a prolonged time.

text: For her parting gift, Anne gives her husband a kiss.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON

scene_heading: EXT. PARK - DAY
text: Solomon is now out for a stroll. He passes two men - two
text: in particular - who stand outside conversing with MR.
text: MOON himself: MERRILL BROWN and ABRAM HAMILTON. Brown
text: is about 40, with a countenance indicating shrewdness and
text: intelligence. Hamilton is closer to 25, a man of fair
text: complexion and light eyes. Both are finely, if perhaps a
text: bit garishly, dressed. Hamilton, as Solomon describes
text: him, slightly effeminate.
text: Moon, spotting Solomon:
speaker_heading: MR. MOON
dialog: Call the Devil's name... There he
dialog: is now. Mr. Northup...! I have
dialog: two gentlemen who should make your
dialog: acquaintance. Messrs. Brown and
dialog: Hamilton.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Sir.
speaker_heading: MR. MOON
dialog: Mr. Northup, these two gentlemen
dialog: were inquiring about distinguished
dialog: individuals, and I was just this
dialog: very moment telling them that
dialog: Solomon Northup is an expert
text: player on the violin.
speaker_heading: HAMILTON
dialog: He was indeed.

scene_heading: EXT. PARK/PAVILION - LATER
text: We make a jump to a green space. Solomon, Brown and

speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: A circus?
speaker_heading: HAMILTON
dialog: That is our usual employee. The
dialog: company currently in the city of
dialog: Washington.
speaker_heading: BROWN
text: Circus too constricting a word to
dialog: describe the talented and merry
dialog: band with which we travel. It is
dialog: a spectacle unlike most have ever

text: Solomon sits down to write a letter; pen poised over

text: thinks better of it. WITH LITTLE THOUGHT HE TEARS THE

scene_heading: INT. PUB - EVENING
scene_heading: -MID TO LATE APRIL, 1841-
text: We find ourselves in a roadside pub. It serves the

dialog: remains cool, Hamilton and Brown put up a great show of

dialog: money was collected.
speaker_heading: HAMILTON
dialog: Not an additional tip from a one
dialog: of them. They expect to be
dialog: entertained for nothing.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: And not satisfied a bit despite
dialog: giving them more than what they

speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: It's the national mood. There's

dialog: frivolity.
speaker_heading: HAMILTON
dialog: My sincerest apologies, Solomon.
dialog: You were promised opportunity, and
dialog: you were given none.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: The opportunity is with the

dialog: promoted, what were we to expect?
text: But the circus bills itself.
speaker_heading: HAMILTON
dialog: True.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I have told you of the circus with
dialog: which we are connected. Creatures

text: Solomon stirs, then slowly awakes to his new
text: circumstances. He finds himself in a nearly lightless
text: room about twelve feet square with walls of solid
text: masonry. There is a thick and well-locked door, a small
text: window covered with iron bars and a shutter. The only
text: furniture is a wood stool and an old fashioned, dirty box
text: stove. As Solomon rises he sees that his HANDS are
text: CUFFED - the chain running to a bolt in the ground - and
text: his LEGS IN IRONS. At first Solomon is incredulous. But
text: that emotion is replaced first by fury and then panic.
text: He begins to pull on the chains, fight against them. He
text: does so with increasing desperation. Solomon flails
text: about, the sounds of the steel chains whipping and
text: beating against the masonry. He grunts and screams
text: without regard as the cuffs and irons bite into his
text: flesh, but he cannot pull himself free.
text: After several minutes of intense effort, Solomon tires,
text: slows, then finally he collapses. And in this collapsed
dialog: state he remains.

scene_heading: INT. BURCH'S DUNGEON - MORNING
text: Solomon again awakens. He hears sounds beyond the
text: door...footsteps. Eventually the door opens. Enter
text: JAMES BURCH - who runs the slave pen - and EBENEZER
text: RADBURN who works as a turnkey and overseer.
text: As the door opens, this is the first light to seep into
text: the otherwise near-black room. The shine is painful to
text: Solomon's eyes. With no salutation whatsoever, Burch
speaker_heading: ASKS:
speaker_heading: BURCH
dialog: Well, my boy, how yah feel now?
text: Solomon rises up as best he can. With all the resolve he
dialog: can put together he states what he considers to be fact:
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: I am Solomon Northup. I am a free
dialog: man; a resident of Saratoga, New
dialog: York. The residence also of my
dialog: wife and children who are equally
dialog: free. I have papers. You have no
dialog: right whatsoever to detain me--
speaker_heading: BURCH
dialog: Yah not any--
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: And I promise you - I promise -
dialog: upon my liberation I will have
dialog: satisfaction for this wrong.
speaker_heading: BURCH
dialog: Resolve this. Produce your
dialog: papers.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 17.
scene_heading: 25 CONTINUED: 25
text: With confidence Solomon goes to the pocket of his
text: trousers. He searches one, then the other, but they are
text: empty. He feels quickly about himself, but clearly his
text: papers have been lifted. Solomon's confidence shifts,
dialog: but to resolve rather than fear. Papers or none, he will
dialog: not be easily cowed. Still, Burch asserts:
speaker_heading: BURCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Yah no free man. And yah ain't
dialog: from Saratoga. Yah from Georgia.
text: A moment. Not a word spoken among the trio, but Solomon
dialog: and Burch do some serious eye fucking, neither man
dialog: yielding. Burch says again:
speaker_heading: BURCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Yah ain't a free man. Yah nuthin'
text: but a Georgia runaway.
text: Burch waits for Solomon to acquiesce. Solomon does not
text: in any way. Both men exchange a long and daring stare.
text: The two are clearly at an intellectual stand off. Burch,
text: leans to Radburn, SAYS SOMETHING WHICH WE CANNOT
scene_heading: DISTINGUISH.
text: Radburn walks off-camera and returns with a pair of
dialog: "instruments:" a PADDLE - the flattened portion, which is
text: about the size in circumference of two open hands, and
text: bored with a small auger in numerous places. He also
text: carries a WHIP. A cat-o-nine tails; a large rope of many
text: strands. The strands unraveled and a knot tied at the
text: extremity of each. Burch says again:
speaker_heading: BURCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Yah a runaway nigger from Georgia.
text: Solomon stands with a quiet stoicism. He will say
dialog: nothing of the kind.
text: As that is the case, Solomon is seized by both men. He is
text: pulled over the bench, face downward, shirt still on his
text: back. Radburn then STEPS ON HIS CHAINS, holding Solomon
text: down in a bent position.
text: With no preamble, Burch begins to beat Solomon about the
text: back with the paddle. Burch strikes him wordlessly - no
text: taunting, no sneering. Solomon screaming against each
text: blow. His back immediately SWELLING WITH WELTS AND
speaker_heading: BRUISES.
text: This beating continues on and on and on until quite
text: literally Burch WEARS HIMSELF OUT with the effort.

speaker_heading: BURCH (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: ...I...I insist...
text: Burch regrets hearing this. Not from sympathy, but
text: rather because he's nearly too tired to go back to
text: beating Solomon. Yet, as if returning to work, Burch
text: returns to pummeling Solomon. Burch punctuates the blows
speaker_heading: WITH:
speaker_heading: BURCH
dialog: Yah a slave. Yah a Georgia slave!
text: Burch continues to strike, and strike... This time until
text: the paddle SNAPS IN HALF. Burch then GRABS THE WHIP.
text: Hardly missing a stroke, he whips Solomon relentlessly,
text: the flails cutting into Solomon's back. Again, Burch's
text: arm tires before Solomon "breaks."
speaker_heading: BURCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Are yah slave?
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: ...No...
text: Burch goes back to whipping and whipping, and whipping...
text: SOLOMON'S BACK IS NOW TORN OPEN WITH LACERATIONS AND
text: OOZING WITH BLOOD. Finally Burch can whip no more. He
text: pours sweat and sucks air, leaving himself just enough
text: energy to take up his instruments and EXIT. Radburn
text: lingers for a moment. He takes the irons off Solomon's
text: legs. Opens the window some. As he makes these
text: gestures, in a patronizing and confidential manner, one
dialog: wrought with poor sincerity::
speaker_heading: RADBURN
dialog: I seen a good many of the black
dialog: kind just where yah're. Sick.
dialog: Make me sick. Often times the
dialog: situation was resolved, and I
dialog: think; what was all the beatin'
dialog: and abuse for? Things end as they
dialog: should, and the violence was for
dialog: naught. So why cause trouble when
dialog: they ain't no cause for it? Be of
dialog: a cooperative nature, and things
dialog: don't need be particularly
dialog: unpleasant.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Or, yah can carry on like yah
dialog: been, and I fear yah won't live to
dialog: see Sunday next.
text: With that thought, Radburn exits. Solomon rests. But to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 19.
scene_heading: 25 CONTINUED: (3) 25
text: on his chains. But for all his struggling, the chain
text: loosens none. Solomon calls out:
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: Help me! Someone help me!

dialog: Though a slave, Eliza was a mistress and has - to this

text: Two men - among many - are awaiting the arrival of the

text: opens up to the frenzic, busy port.
text: For the first time Solomon sees true and severe slavery.
text: These are not visiting servants, such as Jasper was back
text: in Saratoga. These are humans held in strict bondage -
text: herded like cattle, chained together as if in a "chain
dialog: gang." Slaves are evident not merely by the color of
text: their skin. The residue and accessories of slavery are
dialog: everywhere. Blacks almost universally display scars -
text: THICK AND HEAVY DEAD TISSUE FROM LACERATIONS LEFT
text: UNTREATED - brands, and are often missing limbs. Blacks
text: are held in all types of shackles, from simple chains to
text: elaborate bindings, to neck collars that are spiked.
text: Some are muzzled or forced to wear bits. One slave is
text: attacked by a dog and the slave owner. The dog pulls and
text: tears at the slave's clothes. THESE IMAGES SHOULD BE A
scene_heading: CONSTANT AND CONTINUAL CANVAS TO THE PIECE. EVER

dialog: slaves.
text: The business has the air of an etiquette class, though

text: CUSTOMERS have come to see Freeman's lot - the room all
text: gussied up with flowers. Freeman moves among them,
text: displaying them as a rancher would prize chattel.
dialog: Freeman makes the slaves hold their heads up - "look
dialog: smart" as he previously admonished them. They are made
text: to walk briskly back and forth while customers feel their
text: hands and arms and bodies, turn them about and ask what
dialog: skills they possess. The Customers routinely make the
text: slaves open their mouths and show their teeth.
text: At times a MALE or FEMALE SLAVE are taken off to the
text: side, stripped and inspected more minutely.
text: One of them, John, is stripped and inspected.
text: Cape, as he's done previously, plays his fiddle.
text: A buyer - WILLIAM FORD; a man of middle age, and an
text: attractive nature in his tone of voice - consults a list
text: he's drawn up and asks of Freeman:
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: What is the price for the ones
dialog: Platt and Eliza?
speaker_heading: FREEMAN

dialog: for Eliza. My fairest price.
speaker_heading: FORD

speaker_heading: FREEMAN
dialog: As always, from you, Mr. Ford.

speaker_heading: BUYER

speaker_heading: FORD

speaker_heading: WINSLOW
dialog: From where did you thieve this?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Suh, the book is my property.
text: The White Customer has no interest in Sam's answer. With

text: to stop him. That only makes the situation worse,
text: Solomon now the target of the man's ire.
speaker_heading: WINSLOW
dialog: Take your hands from me!
text: Ford comes running over.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: What is the commotion?
speaker_heading: WINSLOW
dialog: Your niggers are either brazen or
dialog: rebellious. This one was readin'
dialog: Scripture, and this one claims it
dialog: to be his.
speaker_heading: FORD
text: It is. A gift from his Mistress.
speaker_heading: WINSLOW

dialog: And the man who would allow a

text: Sam is at the reigns of the wagon carrying the timber to
text: Ford's WORK AREA. Slaves trudge alongside, same as it
dialog: ever was. Only...it's not quite the same. Sam brings
text: the wagon to a halt. He, and the slaves look up the road
text: ahead of them.
text: Standing in the middle of the road is a group of
text: CHICKASAWS INDIANS. They are in their "usual" dress of
text: buckskin breeches and calico hunting shirts of fantastic
text: colors, buttoned from belt to chin. They have with them
text: DOGS and HORSES. They carry with them the carcass of a
dialog: deer.
text: The two groups stare at each other for a long moment.

scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - DUSK/END OF DAY
text: The groups of slaves and Chickasaws are now intermingled.
text: They "break bread" - actually they work on the carcass of
text: the deer which is now roasting over a large fire. As
text: well the group share a smoke on a pipe.
text: One of the Chickasaws is playing a tune on an "INDIAN
text: FIDDLE." The Chickasaws perform a customary dance;
text: trotting after each other, and giving utterance to a
text: guttural, sing-song noise.
dialog: The slaves enjoy the respite from work, Solomon

scene_heading: 74 EXT. RIVER BANK - CONTINUOUS 74
text: Solomon arrives to some tall grass at the edge of the
text: river. Lowering his trousers, SOLOMON SQUATS TO
text: DEFECATE. As he does, he stares out toward the flowing
text: waters of Indian Creek. After a few moments, as though a
dialog: thought far greater than relieving himself has come to
text: him, Solomon stands and replaces his pants.
text: Oddly, Solomon stares out at the water as though he were

dialog: 
dialog: 75 75
scene_heading: EXT. FORD'S WORK AREA - DAY
text: Just beyond the WORK AREA Solomon speaks with Ford as

text: rough diagrams for Ford as he explains himself.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: The creek is plenty deep enough to
text: sail, even with a boat full of
text: load. The distance from the WORK
dialog: AREA to the point on the latter
text: bayou is several miles by water
dialog: fewer than land. It occurs to me
dialog: that the expense of the
dialog: transportation would be materially
speaker_heading: DIMINISHED--
speaker_heading: TIBEATS
dialog: "Materially diminished?"
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: If we use the waterway.
speaker_heading: TIBEATS
dialog: It's a scheme. Plenty of
dialog: engineers have schemed similarly.
text: The passes are too tight.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: I reckon them at more than twelve

text: ALONG THE BANKS, widening out the shore... It's all just
text: a trial for now. The work is diligent, but it is basic
text: to this point. Still, under Solomon's direction, the
dialog: slaves go at it like they've got something to prove. And
dialog: rightly they do.
text: Solomon also works on a narrow raft of twelve cribs with
dialog: which he will transport the timber.

scene_heading: EXT. FORD PLANTATION/GREAT HOUSE - DAY
text: As we come into the scene, Ford is presenting Solomon
text: with a fiddle. Not as grand as the one he previously

speaker_heading: TIBEATS
dialog: Tha's the one. Tha's him.
text: Dismounting, they move with menace that is tinged with
text: perverse pleasure and wordless malevolence. Solomon
text: tries to fight back, but he is strong armed and tied by
text: TIBEATS - his wrists, and then ankles bound in the same
text: manner. In the meantime the other two have slipped a
text: cord within Solomon's elbows, running it across his back
text: and tying it firmly. Solomon is then dragged toward a
text: peach tree. A lynching is in store. The naked horror of
text: it intensely palpable.
text: Solomon looks toward the piazza, but Chapin is now gone.
text: Tears of fear flow down Solomon's cheeks. He is on the
text: verge of panic; a man heading toward his own execution,
text: he begins to struggle and fight.
text: A rope goes around Solomon's neck, then is tossed over
text: the branch of the tree. The trio begin to hoist Solomon.
text: He gasps and gags as spittle flies from his mouth and the
text: life is choked from him.
text: With suddenness, Chapin comes from the house brandishing
text: a pistol in each hand - Colt Paterson .36 caliber
text: "Holster" pistols with 9" barrels. Chapin moves with

speaker_heading: CHAPIN
dialog: Gentlemen... Whoever moves that

speaker_heading: THE SITUATION:
speaker_heading: SOLOMON

speaker_heading: EPPS

dialog: I'll cut your black throat.
text: Solomon pulls away from Epps, RIPPING HIS SHIRT IN THE

text: the large pig sty, easily keeping his distance. Epps,
text: however is undeterred. He moves after Solomon as
text: speedily as he can, which isn't very speedily at all.
text: And quickly he tires. Epps is forced to bend over and
text: suck air. Solomon maintains his distance, barely
text: breathing hard. His breath returned to him, Epps starts
text: up the chase again. Solomon runs on out of reach.
text: Shortly, Epps again stops, gets his breath... And now in
text: what should be quite comical, Epps again runs after
text: Solomon. Again, Epps's vigor leaves him before he can

text: Epps extends a hand to Solomon. Cautiously, Solomon
text: moves close, but not too close. As Solomon draws within
text: striking distance, Epps lunges for him. He chases
text: Solomon on until he is again out of breath and once more
text: drops down. And again offering a treaty:
speaker_heading: EPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm all done in, Platt. I have
dialog: met my limitations, and I ain't
dialog: equal to 'em. I concede to yah,
dialog: but in the name of valor, help yer

text: Solomon cautiously moves closer to help. Again he is

text: too drunk and tired to fully open the folding blade - and
text: chased far around the field by Epps. ALL OF THE

text: Patsey does not respond in any way other than to

dialog: as still as possible. If there is such a thing, she is

text: Epps's frustration mounts until - as the Mistress Shaw
dialog: had cautioned - he crosses the line from passion to

speaker_heading: MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D)
dialog: There'll be none for you, Patsey.

speaker_heading: BASS
dialog: And bring those markers!

dialog: No letter yet.
speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: You are certain?
text: Bass takes a marker from Solomon and slides it into the

speaker_heading: BASS
dialog: I have inquired thoroughly. More

text: SOLOMON'S HAND, GRIPS IT FIRMLY, BUT LOW AND
text: SURREPTITIOUSLY knowing full well he cannot be seen
text: making contact with a slave. But in the strength of
text: their collective grip, in the emotion in which they hold
dialog: each other's eyes, we should be able to easily see how
dialog: greatly Bass wanted to be able to help Solomon. Equally,
dialog: we can see the depth of regard Solomon has for Bass. The
dialog: moment is made all the more powerful by the fact neither
text: man can openly speak his regret or thanks. A moment
text: longer, and then Bass releases his grip and makes his
text: way marching toward the gazebo, pointing instructions.

text: Solomon sits on a secluded part of the road, fiddle in

text: something that is a million miles away.
text: Slowly Solomon tunes his fiddle, turning the tuning peg
text: tighter and tighter. As the strings are taut, the sound
text: is almost unbearable as Solomon tightens bit by bit, as
text: if bones are being cracked one by one. Just beyond the
text: breaking point of sound, there is a snap.
text: He then repeats the action.
text: Solomon holds the neck of the violin. Sliding his thumb
text: and forefinger down the neck, he methodically cracks it
text: at the base. He carefully snaps the neck and removes it
text: from the body, then snaps it in two, placing it on the
dialog: ground.
text: He then starts on the body. Heaving it on the ground, it
text: falls apart. Methodically he breaks the violin into small
text: bits - silencing the instrument with a hushed display of

text: While the Sheriff makes his way to the field, Parker

speaker_heading: SHERIFF

speaker_heading: SHERIFF

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: He belongs to no man.
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: You say! You come here,

speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Not claims. I have no doubts.

speaker_heading: EPPS

dialog: I'll fight you for 'em!
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: As is your right. As it will be

text: By this time, the slaves in the plantation have overcome
dialog: their fear of penalty, and left their work and gathered
text: in the yard as witnesses. They stand behind the cabin,
text: out of sight of Epps.
text: Mistress Epps also bears witness, standing on the veranda
text: next to her house slave. Her face is of a strange mixed
dialog: emotion.
text: Epps looks to Solomon. Solomon icily, stoically holds
text: his ground. He makes it quite clear in his countenance
text: that nobody owns him. Sheriff, hand on his gun, is there
text: to back Solomon up. Epps, with no other recourse than to
speaker_heading: BACK DOWN:
speaker_heading: EPPS
dialog: You think this is the last you'll
dialog: see of me, boy? It ain't.

speaker_heading: PATSEY
dialog: Platt...
text: Disregarding Parker, Solomon crosses over to Patsey.
dialog: Under the circumstances, neither really knows how to
text: engage. Finally, suddenly, Patsey throws her arms around
text: Solomon and they embrace.
text: Epps, now mounted on his horse, witness the encounter.
text: Kicking the stirrups hard into the sides of the horse, he
text: rides off furiously.
text: Calling from the carriage, mindful of Epps:
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Solomon...if we know what's wise,
dialog: we should depart.
text: A moment longer Solomon and Patsey hold each other. They
text: separate, Solomon heading back to the carriage. He and

text: WE STAY WITH Solomon as he travels further and further

text: We now see Solomon in front of a door. A door we have
dialog: seen before at the very beginning of our story. Solomon,
text: aged significantly since then, stands nervously,
text: swallowing, and adjusting his attire. He breaths in and
text: holds his breath. He blows out and closes his eyes. A
text: tear falls from his cheek, but this is not the way he
text: wants his family to see him. He gathers himself, and
text: looks to his right. There stands Mr. Parker. He places
text: his hand on Solomon's shoulder. He says gently-

text: Margaret who is now twenty - SHE CARRIES WITH HER A
text: BUNDLE. Also present is MARGARET'S HUSBAND. The family
text: waits patiently, dutifully...but anxiously.
text: Anne rises to greet him, but holds back. All around, the
text: body language of the family is stiff and awkward. They

speaker_heading: SOLOMON
dialog: I apologize for my appearance. I
