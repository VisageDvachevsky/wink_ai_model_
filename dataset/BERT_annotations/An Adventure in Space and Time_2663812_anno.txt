dialog: Caption: 1966.
text: One car trundles to a halt and just stays there, headlights
text: carving yellow tunnels into the fog.
text: The door of the Police Box opens, throwing a shaft of light
text: into the night, and a policeman, REG, appears. He looks out
text: towards the road and sees the stationary car, its engine

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: No need for the soft-soap, Sydney.
dialog: You know me better. Who?
text: Slowly, Sydney takes out a photo from a thick file and slides

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Quite. Patrick Troughton!
dialog: Excellent choice.
dialog: Beat.

speaker_heading: BILL (CONT'D)
dialog: I said right at the start, if we're

speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: How about a nice cup of tea, eh,
dialog: love?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yes.
text: She goes into the kitchen. Bill turns back to the fireplace.
text: Suddenly, his eyes are wet with tears. He manages to stifle a
text: sob - but Heather hears and comes dashing back in.
speaker_heading: BILL (CONT'D)
dialog: I... I don’t want to go.

dialog: 
text: September 1966 - BILL is still looking up, eyes closed. He's
text: standing as he first was, by the console.
text: He lowers his head and opens his eyes to find the studio is
text: now full of CREW.
text: And three people stand facing him. MIKE and ANNEKE, the new
text: companions and the dark, beguiling PAT, the new Doctor Who.
text: He has a mop of black hair and is dressed in baggy check
text: trousers and a beaten up frock-coat.
dialog: Silence.
text: Tense silence.
text: The old Doctor and the new Doctor face each other. Then --
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Well, then. Who’s who?
text: Bill smiles. The mood is broken. Pat comes over and shakes
text: him warmly by the hand.
speaker_heading: PAT (CONT'D)
dialog: I won’t lie to you. I’m scared
dialog: stiff!

dialog: Oh, you’ll be fine. In fact, you'll
dialog: be wonderful. I told them, you
dialog: know, there’s only one man in
dialog: England who could take over.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Oh. Couldn't they find him?
text: Everyone laughs.
text: Bill looks at the stuck glass cylinder and, without a word,
text: he goes over to the console and clicks a switch. The
text: hydraulic pump goes into action and the time rotor moves
text: smoothly up and down.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RIVERSIDE STUDIO 1. GALLERY. NIGHT 38 - (19:26) 128

text: BILL gazes down at the dials, gauges and winking instruments
text: for the last time. This is it. His eyes fill with tears as he
text: contemplates the end.
text: The roar of the TARDIS engines...
text: Then Bill notices something else. On the opposite side of the
text: hexagonal console.
text: Another pair of hands, imitating his own gesture.
text: Bill looks up.
text: Facing him is -
scene_heading: THE DOCTOR.
dialog: The Eleventh in that illustrious line. Matt Smith.
text: Bill stares at the stranger.
text: Matt adjusts his bow tie and just - winks.
text: Bill smiles.
