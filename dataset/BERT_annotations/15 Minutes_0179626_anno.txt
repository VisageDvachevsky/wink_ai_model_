speaker_heading: ANGLE DOWN
text: on a tray table. Crumpled Czech bills and coins are on it.
text: Hands are counting the money. The airline hostess announces
text: the arrival at JFK - in CZECH. A hand reaches into a breast
text: pocket - pulling out two passports. One is opened. Belongs
text: to EMIL SLOVAK. The next passport belongs to OLEG RAZGUL.
text: The hand passes the Oleg Razgul passport to the man next to
text: him. We notice several empty airline bottles of vodka and a
text: small disposable camera on Oleg's tray table. The passport
text: is set down. Oleg picks it up. We hear Emil's voice in
text: CZECH. The scene is subtitled in ENGLISH.
speaker_heading: EMIL (V.O.)

text: unshaven Czech in his mid-30's. Tall, scraggly beard.
text: Piercing blue eyes. He's dressed in an outdated suit. His
text: eyes are alert, cunning and smart.
text: OLEG RAZGUL, stands in line behind Emil. Oleg is big. Not
text: tall - but wide. A wrestler's body. Emil looks at Oleg.
text: (The following is in CZECH and subtitled in ENGLISH.)
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Don't fool around.
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: Okay.
text: Oleg holds up his disposable camera - at arms length - to
text: take a picture of himself.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Did you hear what I said?
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: I want to document my trip to America.
speaker_heading: IMMIGRATION OFFICER
dialog: Next.
dialog: (Emil steps up)
dialog: Could I see your documents, please?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Yes sir.
text: He hands the passport to the officer who runs it through an
text: image swipe. Emil glances furtively back to Oleg.
speaker_heading: IMMIGRATION OFFICER
dialog: What is your intended purpose of your
dialog: visit to the United States?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Two weeks holiday.
speaker_heading: IMMIGRATION OFFICER
dialog: How much money are you carrying with
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: I have five-hundred dollars.
speaker_heading: IMMIGRATION OFFICER
dialog: Can you show me? Sir, no cameras in the
dialog: FIS area!
text: Oleg was about to take a picture of Emil and the Immigration
text: Officer. Oleg puts the camera away. Smiles sheepishly.
speaker_heading: IMMIGRATION OFFICER (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Emil)
dialog: Is he with you? Are you travelling
dialog: together?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: IMMIGRATION OFFICER
dialog: Please join us.
dialog: (to Oleg)
dialog: Come on forward.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Is there a problem?
speaker_heading: IMMIGRATION OFFICER
dialog: No, you're travelling together. I want

dialog: you? Can I take a look at your
dialog: documents?
dialog: (takes Oleg's passport)
dialog: Are you related?
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: Yes...he's my friend.
speaker_heading: IMMIGRATION OFFICER
dialog: Okay. You're a Czech national and
dialog: you're a Russian national. How do you
dialog: know one another?
text: Oleg starts to speak, but Emil cuts him off.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: We are both from Prague.
speaker_heading: IMMIGRATION OFFICER
dialog: (to Oleg)
dialog: How long are you planning to stay?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Two weeks.
speaker_heading: IMMIGRATION OFFICER
dialog: I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
speaker_heading: EMIL
text: He doesn't speak English.
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: I speak English.
speaker_heading: IMMIGRATION OFFICER
dialog: (to Oleg)
dialog: Then answer my questions. Where were

dialog: weeks that you're here?
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: New York.
speaker_heading: IMMIGRATION OFFICER
dialog: Yes, we're in New York now. But where

speaker_heading: OLEG
text: A cheap hotel.
speaker_heading: IMMIGRATION OFFICER
dialog: What are you coming here to do?
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: I'm here for movies.
speaker_heading: IMMIGRATION OFFICER
dialog: Movies...to be in the movies or to see
dialog: movies?
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: Yes. No. Both. When I was a boy, I
dialog: see movie at school called "It's a
dialog: Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra.
dialog: Ever since I want to come to America.
dialog: Land of the free. Home of the brave. A
dialog: land where anyone can be anything. As
dialog: long as they are white.
speaker_heading: IMMIGRATION OFFICER
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: He made joke, bad joke. First time on
dialog: airplane...
text: The SUPERVISOR comes over to see what the problem is:
speaker_heading: IMMIGRATION OFFICER
dialog: Well, they've got valid visas, but they
dialog: don't have much money. Uh... and I'm
dialog: not...uh, I think there's a possibility
dialog: they may be coming to live and reside.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: Look how long the line is. We gotta

text: Emil looks at Oleg, pissed.
scene_heading: INT. P.B. HERMAN'S RESTAURANT - DAY
text: The place is empty except for one table at the end of the
text: bar. EDDIE FLEMMING, Manhattan's most famous detective, and
text: his savvy, black partner, LEON JACKSON are having cocktails.
text: Eddie is smoothly handsome, tough, smart and tired. Not only
dialog: is he the best homicide detective Manhattan has ever seen,
dialog: he's continually mentioned in New York columns and has been
dialog: the subject of several magazine articles. There's even been
text: a TV movie about one of his biggest cases. Leon has been
text: with Eddie a long time and was also featured in the TV movie.
text: Sitting with Eddie and Leon is ROBERT HAWKINS, host and star
text: reporter for the tabloid show, "Top Story." Hawkins is also
dialog: the best in the business and has dealt with them all: Joey
text: Buttafuco and Amy Fisher, Lorena Bobbit and OJ.
text: Wait staff bustles in the b.g. doing the morning set up.
text: Hawkins listens as Eddie, cigar in hand, finishes a "war
text: story" and a vodka tonic at the same time.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: So we're waitin' to hit this warrant -
dialog: we got Emergency Service with the heavy
dialog: weapons standin' by - ready to go. I
dialog: say, lemme get a cigar outta the car. I
dialog: go to get the cigar and BOOM! All the
text: sudden I turn around and a kid with a
dialog: shotgun let one go. Right where I was
dialog: standin'. That coulda been it. I
dialog: coulda had my head blown off and for
dialog: what? Some stupid kid got panicky,
text: takes the safety off and it's over. If
dialog: I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for
dialog: a bad habit - I would've had my head
text: blown off.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: Jesus Christ.
text: PAULIE, the owner, walks up.
speaker_heading: PAULIE
dialog: Speakin' of bad habits, everybody okay?
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
text: Another martini.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Vodka tonic.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: (rethinks it)
dialog: Maybe you could just put in a shot of
dialog: Martell?
text: Paulie takes the drinks off the table and an empty bottle of
dialog: vodka.
speaker_heading: LEON (CONT'D)
dialog: (of Eddie's story)
dialog: It was freaky, I'll tell you. Stupid
dialog: kid.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What's the kid gonna say - sorry?
dialog: Meanwhile I'm not here anymore.
dialog: Like last week - we were at the morgue
dialog: and this guy was all chopped up - spleen
text: here - liver there - his heart in a pan.
dialog: Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his
dialog: dog or buyin' a quart of milk. Who
dialog: knows? But some kid's robbed him for $3
dialog: or some shit and shot him and now you
dialog: can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a
dialog: human being and I'm thinkin' that's me.
dialog: Sooner or later. That's me.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: Sooner or later that's everybody.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Not chopped up. Not chopped up like
dialog: that. I mean, what do I got left?
dialog: Coupla articles. A medal or two.
dialog: Plaque here and there and in a coupla
dialog: years no one remembers me anymore.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: I think you're getting a little moody
dialog: there, Eddie.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I'm not moody.
text: Hawkins and Leon share a look.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: Isn't he a little moody?
speaker_heading: LEON
text: Of course he's moody. He thinks he's in
dialog: love.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: In love? With who?
text: Paulie delivers the drinks and sets some cigars on the table.
text: Takes a seat next to Eddie. Eddie asks Hawkins.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: How old are your kids?
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: My kids? Let's see...Susan's 15.
dialog: Aundrea's 9. Don't tell me you're
dialog: thinking about having a kid! How old
dialog: are you? Never mind.
dialog: Let me just tell you this: Every stupid
dialog: cliche you hear about kids - they change
dialog: your life, they make you a better
dialog: person, they make you whole...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's all true! Before I had kids when
dialog: friends talked about their kids, I
dialog: wanted to vomit. Now -- I get it. Am I
dialog: right, Leon?
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Absomotherfuckin'lutely. You can have
dialog: all three of my ex-wives. But somebody
dialog: so much as looks sideways at my four
dialog: girls -- I'd kill 'em.
dialog: (takes out his wallet)
dialog: You haven't seen my youngest have you?
text: As he hands pictures to Hawkins his cell phone rings.
speaker_heading: LEON (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: Paulie, you've got kids, right?
speaker_heading: PAULIE
dialog: My kids don't talk to me anymore but
dialog: they were great when they were young.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Sure it's him? Great!
dialog: (collapses the phone)
dialog: Unique's home.
text: They all rise from the table.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Paulie, I need the cure.
speaker_heading: PAULIE
dialog: Step into my office.
text: Leon and Hawkins sit back down as Eddie and Paulie leave.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: So you got your kids listening to Opera?
dialog: You still singing in the church on the
dialog: weekends?
scene_heading: INT. SECONDARY IMMIGRATION OFFICE - DAY
text: Now other officers are questioning Emil and Oleg. They've
text: been there a while. The SECONDARY OFFICER is looking Oleg.
speaker_heading: SECONDARY OFFICER
dialog: Okay. You work in a vodka factory. I
dialog: understand that.
dialog: (to Emil)
dialog: And what kind of work do you do?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: I am butcher.
speaker_heading: SECONDARY OFFICER
dialog: You're a butcher? What do you use pig
dialog: intestines for?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: You stuff sausage in it.
speaker_heading: SECONDARY OFFICER
dialog: And what do you do with the bones?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Dog food.
text: Emil looks at Oleg. Blaming his stupid responses at Passport
dialog: Control for their detainment.
speaker_heading: SECONDARY OFFICER
dialog: Are you married?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: No. Are you proposing?
speaker_heading: ANGLE UP
text: through a thousand ICE CUBES. A face plunges towards us...
scene_heading: INT. MENS ROOM
text: Eddie has his back to us as he dunks his face into a sink
text: full of ice. He dries his face, looks into his bloodshot
text: eyes. Presents a small black ring box to the mirror.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Will you marry me? Wanna get married?
dialog: What are you doin' Saturday?
text: Leon enters. Eddie turns.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm gonna propose.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: Tomorrow. At lunch.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: You ready?
text: Eddie leans back and drops some Visine in his eyes. Turns.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: The thrill of the hunt. I love it.
scene_heading: EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY
text: Oleg and Emil stare at the bright lights - all the nonstop
text: action. Each stands with an old suitcase.
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: (in Russian)
dialog: Look. Times Square. Just like in the
dialog: movies!
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: (in Czech)
dialog: Don't speak Russian!
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: (in Russian)
dialog: Why? Why do I always have to speak to
dialog: you in Czech?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: (in Czech)
dialog: Because I don't like your ugly language.
dialog: I heard enough of it in school! Now
dialog: speak Czech or English. And don't fool
dialog: around anymore. You almost got us
dialog: thrown out!
text: Emil pulls out an envelope with Milos' address on it. This
text: is who they came to see. Emil hails a CAB. Oleg is staring
text: inside a camera store - at himself on a monitor. A
text: videocamera's pointed out in the street.
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: Look. New videocameras. Color
text: viewfinder. Image stabilization.
dialog: Solarization. Night vision.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: We have no money. Come on.
text: Oleg stares at the videocamera - dying to have one like this.
text: Emil slides into the cab.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Where you wanna go, buddy?
text: Emil pulls out the post-marked envelope. Points to the
text: return address on it and passes it through the slot to the
dialog: Cabbie.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Here.
text: Emil looks out the window - no sign of Oleg. Then, Oleg
text: hurries out the camera store, gripping something inside his
text: coat. He flings both suitcases in the trunk, SLAMS it shut
text: and jumps in the back seat. He opens his jacket - pulling
text: out the VIDEOCAMERA he just stole.
speaker_heading: EMIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Go!
text: Oleg smiles sheepishly at Emil.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - DAY
text: Eddie's car pulls up. Eddie, Leon and Hawkins get out.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: So what's unique?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Not what. Who.
text: Eddie passes Hawkins a Polaroid - of a woman on a bed -
text: covered in blood.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: He's from Antigua. His girlfriend was
text: taking too long to put her make-up on.
text: they were late for a party. Stabbed her
text: with a beer bottle.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: That's unique.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yeah. And he still went to the party.
text: Leon moves to a LOOKOUT - gives him a twenty.
speaker_heading: LOOKOUT
text: Top floor. Back room.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yeah. I make big cases, they make the
dialog: news and I look good. But the problem
text: with becoming a star is downtown. They
dialog: shoot at stars. Now be quiet. Shhh.
text: As they reach the doorway - Eddie surprises two crackheads.
text: Waves them off. They hurry away.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I hope this prick doesn't run. My knees
dialog: are killing me. Stay behind me.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: You're worried for my safety. I'm
dialog: touched.
text: Eddie flattens against the building - watches Unique descend
text: the fire escape.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS (CONT'D)
dialog: Ready?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Keep them out of my way.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: Okay. You ready?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yeah, yeah. Jesus.
text: Eddie closes in.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: (into his cell phone)
text: COME ON! COME ON! YOU FUCKING GUYS,
dialog: LET'S MOVE IT!
text: Unique is climbing down the fire escape - before he gets to
text: the bottom, Leon bursts through a door behind him and kicks
text: the fire escape, sending Unique flying into the alley. Where
text: he lands dropping his gun.
text: Eddie pulls him off the ground as Leon scoops the gun up.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What's your rush? Going to a party?
speaker_heading: UNIQUE
dialog: Why you chasin' me, man?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I don't know. You always come outta
dialog: your house that way?
speaker_heading: UNIQUE
dialog: It's not my house, man. I don't live
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Well, sounds like burglary to me.
text: Leon cuffs Unique who recognizes Eddie.
speaker_heading: UNIQUE
dialog: I know you man.
text: An unmarked van comes tearing into the scene. Disgorges a
text: mini-cam team that starts filming but they missed the bust.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: (to Eddie)
dialog: Any chance we can do that again?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Again? I didn't wanna do it the first
dialog: time.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. EAST SIDE - LATE DAY
text: The cab is in front of an old five-story brownstone. Oleg
text: gets the bags out of the trunk as Emil tucks the envelope
text: into his jacket, then steps up to the old building. He looks
text: back at Oleg - who's VIDEOTAPING him.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Turn that off! Get the bags.
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: Why should I carry your bag? I am not a
dialog: dog.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: For five years I paid for your
dialog: stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the
dialog: rest of my life if I say so.
dialog: (challenging)
dialog: Unless you refuse, Oleg.
text: Oleg looks at Emil. Even though Oleg is stronger than Emil,
text: he fears him. He picks up both bags. Emil searches the
text: occupant list over the buzzers to the apartment building.
speaker_heading: EMIL (CONT'D)
text: There. 5RW.
text: Emil pushes ten of the buzzers except 5RW. A BUZZER clicks
text: and Emil pushes it open.
scene_heading: INT. MILOS' APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - DAY
text: The brownstone has no elevator so Emil and Oleg climb the
text: stairs... Oleg cradling his camera. Emil notices a crack
text: pipe on the floor and picks it up. Smells the bowl.
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Smell like chemicals...for smoking
dialog: drugs.
text: Emil pockets the pipe and climbs to the top floor, moving
text: down the dirty hallway to a corner door.
scene_heading: INT. MILOS' APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY
text: He KNOCKS...FOOTSTEPS approach. The door is opened by MILOS -
text: a 40-year-old Czech, dressed in stained plumbers overalls.
text: He is surprised to see Emil and Oleg in his doorway. Oleg
dialog: films him...
speaker_heading: MILOS
dialog: Emil???!
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Surprise! Surprise!
text: Milos shoots a look across the tiny kitchen to TAMINA, his
dialog: comely wife.
scene_heading: INT. MILOS' APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: Emil pushes his way inside. Oleg follows. Milos wears
text: plumbers overalls but Emil notices sports a Rolex. Tamina
text: has on a faded dress but despite their cheaply furnished
text: apartment she wears an expensive brushed gold necklace,
text: bracelet and big pearl earrings. The room is furnished with
text: kitsch from Disney World and Las Vegas. The only anomaly is
scene_heading: a HUGE SONY TRINITRON HOME ENTERTAINMENT CENTER. (The
dialog: following is in Czech and subtitled in English.)
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Your sister said she didn't know where
dialog: you were so you shouldn't write to her
dialog: with return address if you're hiding.
speaker_heading: MILOS
dialog: Did you hurt her?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: You know me...I never hurt anybody.
dialog: Where's the money?
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: Hello, Tamina.
text: Oleg is looking Tamina over. Milos - though scared - barks
dialog: at Oleg.
speaker_heading: MILOS
dialog: Take your eyes off her, Oleg!
dialog: (to Emil)
dialog: Look. It wasn't my fault you two were
dialog: caught.
dialog: (of Oleg)
dialog: It's his fault. Trying to get the bank
dialog: clerk's phone number?! I wasn't going
dialog: to wait!!!
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Milos. Get my money!
text: Oleg videotapes the scene.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON AN AJAR DOOR
text: All we see behind it is a WOMAN'S FACE and her wet hair - she
text: obviously came from the shower and we see the towel wrapped
text: around her.
speaker_heading: MILOS
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: We spent it!
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Ha. Ha.
speaker_heading: MILOS
dialog: Look at the way we live. I'm a plumber.
dialog: You think I'd be working if I had
dialog: money?!
text: Emil, pissed, moves to a wood block and pulls out a KITCHEN
text: KNIFE. He grabs Tamina roughly, putting the blade to her
dialog: throat.
speaker_heading: MILOS (CONT'D)
text: Emil. Put down the knife.
text: Milos looks at his wife - who is terrified.
speaker_heading: MILOS (CONT'D)
dialog: Emil. I'll help you.
text: Milos closes the gap between him and Emil - trying to calm
text: him by talking softly.
speaker_heading: MILOS (CONT'D)
dialog: I can get you a job.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: A job?
speaker_heading: MILOS
dialog: Yes, the money is good.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: As a plumber?!
speaker_heading: MILOS
dialog: It's easy to learn.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: A job?? As a plumber??? You think I
dialog: come to America to work!
speaker_heading: MILOS
dialog: We started over, you can too.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: (furious)
dialog: You spent all the money while I was in
dialog: prison? Now you tell me to get a job
dialog: fixing toilets?!?
text: Emil pulls the knife away from Tamina - then angrily PLUNGES
dialog: it toward Milos' chest!
text: Oleg videotapes it. Then lowers the camera - shocked that
dialog: Emil killed Milos.
text: Blood sprays Tamina's face. She tries to run but Oleg grabs
text: her, not noticing her brushed gold bracelet falls to the
text: floor. He covers her mouth as he points the videocamera at
dialog: Emil who STABS Tamina - absolutely enraged!
scene_heading: THE WOMAN BEHIND THE DOOR
text: flees...Emil hears NOISE in the bedroom - a window opening.
text: Emil kicks the bedroom door open. Sees the window leading to
text: the fire escape. He dashes to it. Sees four flights down -
text: the WOMAN, wearing a summer dress. Barefoot. Her hair still
dialog: wet.
text: She looks up. She is beautiful and terrified. She runs
text: down the alley.
speaker_heading: EMIL (CONT'D)
dialog: She saw!
text: Emil hurries toward the bathroom. She just got out of the
text: shower. Her underwear and purse are draped over a chair.
text: Emil grabs the purse. Finds a CZECHOSLOVAKIAN PASSPORT. He
text: opens the cover, stares at her photo and name.
speaker_heading: EMIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Daphne Hanlova.
dialog: There's one stamp in the passport - from the U.S. when she
text: arrived - June 16, 1998. Underneath is written - 6 MONTH
text: STAY. Emil flips through the rest of the passport - all
text: blank pages.
speaker_heading: EMIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Six month visa. Still here two years
dialog: later. They'll deport her if she goes
dialog: to Police.
text: Emil pockets Daphne's passport and wallet, scoops up her
text: shoes and jacket - enters the kitchen and dumps them on the
text: floor. He tears through the kitchen cabinets, throwing cans
text: and bottles aside.
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: What are you looking for?
text: Emil finds nail polish remover - looks at the bodies.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: I'm going to make a bohemian barbecue.
text: Emil draws the kitchen curtains plunging the room into
dialog: darkness.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT
text: A face comes from the darkness. It's an athletically
text: handsome man, jogging out of a tunnel towards us. He's in a
text: tie and jacket in Central Park at NIGHT.
text: He is JORDAN (JORDY) WARSAW. A sensitive man of rugged
text: honesty. He runs down the hill in a hurry. A MUGGER steps
text: in his path.
speaker_heading: MUGGER
dialog: Got any spare change? How 'bout a spare
dialog: twenty?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Look, I don't have time for you, get out
dialog: of my way!!
speaker_heading: MUGGER
dialog: Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin'
dialog: money?
text: The Mugger pulls a knife - and in a whirl of movement, Jordy
text: grabs his wrist and disarms him in a deadly, professional
text: manner - hurling him down to the pavement, twisting his arm
text: behind his back. With his other hand, Jordy whips out a
text: BROWNING 9MM from his shoulder holster and places it behind
text: the mugger's head. Jordy displays his shield.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Okay, you're under arrest! Now you
dialog: happy?
speaker_heading: MUGGER
dialog: Fire Department? Firemen don't carry
dialog: guns.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Oh yeah? Guess again.
text: Jordy handcuffs the Mugger and searches the Mugger's coat
text: pockets - pulling out a handful of driver's licenses and
dialog: credit cards.
speaker_heading: JORDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Nice - how many people you ripped off
dialog: tonight?! Get up!
text: As Jordy yanks the Mugger to his feet, his BEEPER goes off.
speaker_heading: JORDY (CONT'D)
dialog: You couldn't listen to me, could you?
text: Jordy drags the Mugger to a tree. Cuffs him so his face is
text: pressed up against the bark.
speaker_heading: JORDY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll send a cop back for you.
speaker_heading: MUGGER
dialog: Hey. C'mon, you can't leave me like
dialog: this. Some freak'll come by and stab
dialog: me!
text: Jordy jogs off across the park.
speaker_heading: MUGGER (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait! Come back!!
scene_heading: EXT. MILOS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: FIRE TRUCKS from three battalions. Radios CRACKLE. There's
text: a crowd growing. Jordy pushes his way through. The top
text: floor of the brownstone where Milos and Tamina lived has been
text: reduced to smoking ruins. The trees are covered in debris
text: and soot. Jordy moves to LOUIE - Battalion Chief.
speaker_heading: LOUIE
dialog: Lieutenant - take up your line and
text: relieve Ladder Company 60 on the top
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Hey, Louie, were you first due?
speaker_heading: LOUIE

speaker_heading: KORFIN (O.S.)
dialog: Yo, Jordy!
text: BOBBY KORFIN - an overweight arson investigator with a quick
text: with and good sense of humor - comes over, pulling on a
dialog: turnout coat.
speaker_heading: KORFIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Where you been, man? We got a
dialog: celebrity!
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: I heard. Who the hell let them up
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: KORFIN
dialog: I don't know, you think Eddie will give
dialog: me his autograph?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: You see anything in the crowd? Anybody
dialog: suspicious?
speaker_heading: KORFIN
dialog: Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Oh yeah, why?
speaker_heading: KORFIN
dialog: 'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by
dialog: now!
scene_heading: INT. MILOS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: The roof is gone. The sky is exposed. It's charred ruins,
text: smoked beams and watery muck. Eddie and Leon are standing by
text: what's left of the mattress, looking at Milos and Tamina's
text: charred bodies. Eddie grips a half-smoked Cuban cigar,
text: listening to Leon.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: So, it looks to me - from the sixty-nine
dialog: position - that they were doin' each
dialog: other but were so whacked out of their
text: heads they set the pipe on the mattress,
dialog: lit it up, and they got fried. What do
dialog: you think, Eddie?
text: Jordy enters - with Korfin who's carrying a paint can.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I don't know. We got the experts here.
dialog: Show them what you found - I hope you
dialog: don't mind, we came over to see if we
dialog: could help.
text: Korfin makes a beeline for Eddie - wanting to meet the
dialog: celebrity.
speaker_heading: KORFIN
dialog: Nah, not at all. Detective Flemming -
dialog: Bobby Korfin. My Uncle Tony worked with
dialog: you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Could you put out the cigar? Part of
text: the job is picking up scents.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Oh, sure.
text: Eddie puts his cigar out. Carefully slides it into a cigar
text: holder and pockets it to finish later.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Well, I found - check it out - crack
text: pipe. Looks like they got careless.
text: Leon displays the pipe Emil found on the stairs. Korfin
text: shines the flashlight on Leon to look at the pipe.
speaker_heading: LEON (CONT'D)
dialog: Mind not shining that light in my eyes?
speaker_heading: KORFIN
dialog: Sorry, bro.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Hey, that's great you guys got it all
dialog: wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go
dialog: through the routine? It gives us
dialog: somethin' to do.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: No, we don't mind. You mind Leon?
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: No. Go ahead.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Thanks. Appreciate it.
text: Jordy throws a look at Korfin. Homicide detectives have no
dialog: respect for fire marshals' investigative skills. Eddie
text: rummages through the apartment - moving into the kitchen and
text: living room... Leon watches as Korfin sticks a pencil in a
text: charred beam, measuring how deep in it goes.
speaker_heading: KORFIN
dialog: Okay, Jordy - it was a fast fire, we got
dialog: good patterns - about thirty minutes
dialog: old.
text: Jordy moves to one of the corpses. He pulls on a white
text: rubber glove. Inserts his finger in the corpses mouth. The
text: glove comes out white.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Mouth's clean, too.
speaker_heading: KORFIN
dialog: Clean?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Don't blow your nose!
text: Jordy's looking at Leon, who was just about to blow his nose.
speaker_heading: JORDY (CONT'D)
dialog: The smoke'll permeate your nostrils -
dialog: burn 'em out. Let it run.
speaker_heading: KORFIN
dialog: But you knew that, right?
text: Leon looks at Jordy, then lowers the handkerchief. Jordy
text: turns back to the corpses on the bed. Eddie - in the other
text: room - has found Tamina's brushed gold bracelet on the floor.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: So the way you see it, two crack heads
dialog: burned themselves up?
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: That's what it looks like to me.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: And while they're burning up, they're
dialog: still goin' down on each other? You got
dialog: to hand it to them.
speaker_heading: LEON
text: (realizes he's wrong - blows it
dialog: off)
dialog: Yeah, well, some people got their
dialog: priorities straight.
text: Leon watches Jordy, quietly. With a pair of tweezers, Jordy
text: pulls a small unburned piece of cloth from behind one of the
text: heads. Korfin supplies the paint can. Jordy drops the cloth
dialog: inside.
speaker_heading: LEON (CONT'D)
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Evidence. Of a homicide.
text: That got Eddie's attention and he comes back to the bedroom.
speaker_heading: JORDY (CONT'D)
dialog: You know what that is, right?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: No, what is it?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Why don't you explain it, Bobby.
dialog: (to a fireman joking a wall)
dialog: Hey Camello! You mind punching a hole
dialog: in the floor?
speaker_heading: CAMELLO
dialog: No problem.
dialog: (to Eddie and Leon)
dialog: Excuse me, gentlemen. You might wanna
dialog: back up a little more. Don't wanna get
dialog: your pants wet.
text: Leon and Eddie move to higher ground - on top of a burnt TV
text: set. Eddie hands the brushed bracelet to Leon. As Camello
text: hacks at the floor with an ax, Jordy continues to examine the
dialog: bodies and Korfin explains:
speaker_heading: KORFIN
text: They have not soot in their mouths,
dialog: which means they weren't breathin'
dialog: before the fire and that usually means
dialog: they were deceased - and this piece of
dialog: cloth that my partner found means they
dialog: were wrapped up in something, probably
text: doused with a flammable liquid and
text: positioned like this on the bed. To the
text: untrained eye, it looks like an
dialog: accident.
text: Jordy kicks around the draining floor, reaches down for
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: What's he looking for?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: A timer.
text: Jordy finds some wires attached to an outlet, pulls them up -
text: on the other end is a timer. Korfin takes the timer from
text: Jordy and moves to Eddie.
speaker_heading: KORFIN
dialog: Here you go. A big double homicide.
scene_heading: EXT. MILOS' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
text: As Jordy and Korfin exit the brownstone, a CAMERA CREW is
text: arriving. Jumps out.
text: Korfin and Jordy cross toward Korfin's car. They open the
text: trunk. Take off their muddy boots throwing them in.
speaker_heading: KORFIN
dialog: You see Eddie's face when I gave him the
dialog: timer? Wish I had a picture of it.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: He knew all along.
speaker_heading: KORFIN
dialog: What??
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: That's why he was so quiet. He was
dialog: testing us.
text: Eddie and Leon exit - Eddie carrying a baggie with a timer
text: inside. NICOLETTE KARAS, young and attractive, pushes her
text: microphone at Eddie. She's smart, aggressive and respected
dialog: by her peers.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Detective, does it look like a murder?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: We don't know that yet. It's much too
dialog: early. There's a lot to be done.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: How many victims are up there?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: There are two bodies found at this
dialog: point.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Can we go up to the crime scene?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You know you can't do that. C'mon.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Is it drug related?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: We don't know. When I have more I'll
dialog: let you know.
text: Nicolette signals for her camera man, MIKE, to zoom in on
text: Eddie's hand. She barrels on...
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Detective...what's that you're holding
dialog: in your hand? Evidence?
text: Mike pans up to Eddie's face. Other reporters arrive,
text: hurling questions which Eddie easily answers. Cameras flash
text: as we PAN BACK TO Korfin and Jordy. Jordy is about to get in
text: the car as he notices, back behind some construction - DAPHNE
text: HANDLOVA. She's still wearing the crumpled summer dress.
text: She tentatively steps out to signal Jordy. He only catches a
text: glimpse of her. He starts toward her -- knifes through the
text: crowd - but Daphne is gone.
speaker_heading: KORFIN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: There was a woman - I think she wanted
dialog: to talk to us. She looked scared. Oh
dialog: shit! Oh no!
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER
text: Korfin's car SCREECHES to a stop. Jordy leaps out.
text: Suddenly, Jordy stops...the Mugger handcuffed to the tree is
dialog: now NAKED!
speaker_heading: MUGGER
dialog: You motherfuckin' bastard! She stripped
dialog: me! It was a bag lady! She touched me
dialog: all over, it was disgusting.
text: Jordy unlocks the handcuffs.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
text: Korfin delivers a blanket. Jordy covers him.
speaker_heading: JORDY (CONT'D)
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: MUGGER
dialog: A dog pissed on me!! I'm gonna sue you
dialog: for this! You violated my civil rights!
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Your civil rights?! You tried to rob
dialog: me! I could arrest you right now!
dialog: You're lucky you're walking away from
dialog: this. Now get outta here.
text: Jordy gives him a push. The Mugger wraps the blanket around
text: himself cursing - hurrying away.

scene_heading: EXT. 8TH AVENUE - NIGHT
text: Exhausted HOOKERS who have worked all night loiter outside a
text: sleazy hotel. CAMERA PANS up to a blinking hotel sign.
scene_heading: INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: The light is blinking an eerie green and yellow light into
text: the room. Emil is at the window pulling the blind down
text: trying to shut out the blinking light. He pulls it down
text: twice and it pops back up both times. The third time he
text: angrily pulls it so hard, it comes off the window completely.
text: He sits down in a chair in frustration - adjusting a pillow
text: behind his back. THE ROSEANNE SHOW is on TV. Roseanne has
text: been talking to a FATHER.
speaker_heading: ROSEANNE (ON T.V.)
dialog: So you slept with your son's wife!
dialog: What's that all about?
speaker_heading: FATHER (ON T.V.)
dialog: I take full responsibility for sleepin'
dialog: with my daughter in law. I had low self
dialog: esteem, I thought I had to compete with
dialog: him.
text: Emil reaches for his dictionary.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: (mutters)
dialog: Self-esteem? Self-esteem??
text: He flips through his dictionary to find the meaning of self
dialog: esteem.
speaker_heading: FATHER (ON T.V.)
dialog: Losin' my job and everything, caused my
dialog: behavioral disorder.
dialog: (turns to his son)
dialog: Forgive me, Kirk. Let me hug you?
text: The audience boos. Roseanne mediates...
text: Oleg - fresh from the shower with wet hair - sits on the bed
text: in his skivvies - staring into the videocamera's LCD screen -
text: rewinding Milos' murder. We see it now for the first time -
text: as he rewinds it. Oleg watches - a bottle of cheap vodka
text: between his legs. Emil, looks up from his dictionary. He's
text: wearing Milos' Rolex.
text: Tamina's jewelry - her brushed gold necklace and pearl
text: earrings - are in front of him with Daphne's wallet. Emil
text: looks up - Oleg is holding his videocamera.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: (Czech)
dialog: Turn that fucking thing off!
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: (Czech)
dialog: I'm not filming. I'm watching Milos
dialog: die. It's just like a move but realer.
text: Emil grabs the videocamera.
dialog: (Czech)
dialog: Don't break it! Don't break it!
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Speak English!
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: (English)
dialog: You said speak Czech!
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: How you erase this?
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: I'll do it. Don't hurt my camera!
text: Emil tosses the camera back to Oleg who drops his vodka
text: bottle in order to catch the camera. Oleg, holding the
text: camera like it's gold, goes to the dresser and puts it away.
text: Emil starts to go through Daphne's wallet.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Stupid, Milos. I didn't want to kill
dialog: him.
dialog: (noticing)
dialog: What's this?
text: Emil found the last card in the wallet. It's pink with a
text: picture of a busty globe. Printed in the middle is - WORLDLY
text: ESCORTS - and a number.
speaker_heading: EMIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Worldly escorts?
text: Emil picks up his dictionary and begins to flip the pages -
text: finding the meaning of worldly. He gets up and dials the
text: number. A soft, SEXY VOICE answers. Soft music in the
dialog: background.
speaker_heading: SEXY VOICE
dialog: Hi?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: SEXY VOICE
dialog: Are you looking for companionship?
text: Oleg, who's listening, moves to Emil.
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: Whore?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: I'm homesick. You have Eastern European
dialog: girl? A Czech girl?
speaker_heading: SEXY VOICE
dialog: Matter of fact, I have a lovely Czech
dialog: girl.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: I take her. Send her!
scene_heading: EXT. FIRE STATION 91 - NIGHT
text: Korfin's car pulls up to the station - as a fire engine is
dialog: returning.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Now that you know him, maybe you can get
dialog: extra work in the next movie they make
dialog: about him.
speaker_heading: KORFIN
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Maybe you can be his stand-in.
scene_heading: INT. FIRE STATION 91 - NIGHT
text: The men are pulling off their equipment - coming down from
text: the high of fighting a fire. Korfin and Jordy walk toward
text: the TV room. The TV is on in the background. We can see
text: Nicolette interviewing Eddie. He holds up the paint can.
speaker_heading: CHIEF DUFFY (O.S.)
dialog: What the hell is that?? You gave Eddie
dialog: Flemming the evidence?!
text: They turn. DEPUTY CHIEF FIRE MARSHAL DECLAN DUFFY - the head
text: of the arson squad - comes over. Duffy's tough, Irish and
dialog: very political.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: (pointing to the TV)
dialog: Who did cause and origin?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Who do you think, Chief?!
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Then why didn't you talk to the
dialog: reporter?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: 'Cause we got more important things to
dialog: do, like finding out who did it.
text: They walk to the back of the station and start up the stairs.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Don't you guys understand? It's all
dialog: about image. The better we look the
dialog: more money I get to pay you guys
dialog: overtime.
speaker_heading: KORFIN
dialog: Yeah, right.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: What was that, Korfin?
speaker_heading: KORFIN
dialog: I said, yeah, you're right, Chief. As
dialog: soon as we get somethin' we'll let you
dialog: alert the media.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: You do that, wiseguy. Now let's solve
text: this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
text: They all head upstairs.
scene_heading: INT. ARSON SQUAD ROOM - DAY
text: The Chief, Jordy and Korfin enter. There are posters of
text: pyros, arsonists and terrorists on the walls. GARCIA - a
text: Puerto Rican investigator - looks up from his desk.
speaker_heading: GARCIA
dialog: Hey guys, I got your torch. He just
text: gave a full confession.
text: A scruffy, unshaven white man sitting across from Garcia,
text: turns. He is MAX, a pyromaniac in his 40's with a freshly
text: scratched cross etched in his forehead. He craves attention.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: It's my fire! Screw homicide. I'll
dialog: tell you guys everything!
text: Jordy moves to his desk with Korfin. They sit across from
text: each other. Duffy keeps going to his office, not even
text: bothering to stop.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: What's that on your forehead, Max?
dialog: That's a nice attention getter.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah, I'm religious. I'm not an Atheist
dialog: like you! Now, are you guys gonna
dialog: arrest me, or not?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: How did you start the fire this time?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I used an accelerant.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Yeah? What kind?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (to Jordy)
dialog: Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about
dialog: your wife leavin' you.
speaker_heading: KORFIN
dialog: Max.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ...Yeah, and with your old man dying
dialog: last year you - what's it? Just you and
dialog: the dog now?
speaker_heading: KORFIN
dialog: Max!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Does it feel bad - I mean the new guy
dialog: your ex-wife's seeing - I hear he's a
text: big shot downtown.
text: Jordy pops out of his seat.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: That's it! You're outta here.
text: Jordy pulls Max by the collar - pushes him down the aisle.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: That's it. I'm suing.
speaker_heading: KORFIN
dialog: Get in line.
text: Korfin takes over - throwing him out. Jordy turns to Garcia
text: who is laughing.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: What's so funny. How does he know so
dialog: much about me? Who tells him my life
dialog: story?
speaker_heading: GARCIA
text: He hangs around downstairs. The guys
dialog: talk to him. He's a joke...
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: He's no joke! One day he's gonna
dialog: graduate from trash can fires and do
dialog: something big.
speaker_heading: GARCIA
dialog: Okay. Okay. We'll ban him from the

scene_heading: INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - TV SET - NIGHT
text: As the "Top Story" logo is splashed across the screen,
text: accompanied by a catchy TV THEME, Robert Hawkins introduces
dialog: America's highest rated 'news magazine' show.
scene_heading: ROBERT HAWKINS
dialog: Good evening, I'm Robert Hawkins and
dialog: this is Top Story. Tonight we bring you
dialog: an exclusive interview with Stephen
dialog: Geller - who horrified the nation two
dialog: years ago when he went berserk and
text: murdered three clerks in a Manhattan
dialog: shoe store. But now, Mr. Geller's
text: claim, spoken softly and articulately,
dialog: is that he is the victim. According to
dialog: Mr. Geller, the events of that fateful
dialog: day were not his fault but were the
dialog: fault of his psychiatrist. Hard to
dialog: believe...watch.
speaker_heading: EMIL (O.S.)
dialog: Louder.
text: VIDEOCAMERA SLOWLY ZOOMS OUT and PANS over to Emil, sitting
text: on the hotel bed watching the TV. He looks at us.
speaker_heading: EMIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Louder.
text: Oleg's hand reaches in front of the lens - turning up the
text: volume. The scene cuts back to Stephen Geller being
text: interviewed by Robert Hawkins and his camera crew. He's
text: sitting on the front lawn of a mental institution in a paint
text: stained shirt. A showing of his artwork is displayed in the
text: background. Patients peruse the paintings of weird
text: dysfunctional faces that avoid eye contact. One of the
text: paintings depicts Eddie Flemming and Leon Jackson.
scene_heading: STEPHEN GELLER
dialog: This had nothing to do with shoes that
dialog: didn't fit or my relationship with my
dialog: father who, as you know, made a fortune
text: selling penny loafers in the fifties.
dialog: These people died because of the
dialog: criminal actions of my doctor.
scene_heading: ROBERT HAWKINS
dialog: Your doctor?
scene_heading: STEPHEN GELLER
dialog: Yes. My psychiatrist didn't insist that
dialog: I stay on my medication.
scene_heading: ROBERT HAWKINS
dialog: ...so you feel absolutely no
dialog: responsibility for killing these people?
scene_heading: STEPHEN GELLER
dialog: It was my finger that pulled the
dialog: trigger, but I'm not morally
dialog: responsible. My psychiatrist knew what
dialog: I was capable of. How could I know.
dialog: I'm not a doctor.
scene_heading: ROBERT HAWKINS
dialog: You seem very savvy for a man who's been
dialog: found mentally incompetent to stand
dialog: trial.
scene_heading: STEPHEN GELLER
dialog: Look, I'm a victim here, too. I was a
dialog: year away from getting my masters in
dialog: Art, now I'll never graduate. My life
text: has been permanently disrupted.
scene_heading: ROBERT HAWKINS
dialog: Permanently disrupted? Aren't you
dialog: selling paintings now for quite a lot of
dialog: money? Hasn't this 'incident' as you
dialog: call it, jump started your career as an
dialog: artist?
scene_heading: STEPHEN GELLER
dialog: Look, I'm in here. You call this a
dialog: career move?
scene_heading: ROBERT HAWKINS
dialog: And isn't there a movie in the works
dialog: about you?
scene_heading: STEPHEN GELLER
dialog: We're in negotiations, that's correct.
scene_heading: ROBERT HAWKINS
dialog: But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent
dialog: criminals from profiting from their
dialog: crimes?
scene_heading: STEPHEN GELLER
dialog: That doesn't apply to me because I'm not
dialog: a criminal. I'm not a criminal! I
dialog: wasn't convicted.
text: Emil leans forward - listening. Fascinated.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: I love America. No one is responsible
dialog: for what they do.
text: There's a KNOCK on the door. Our VIDEOCAMERA POV swings over
text: to it. Then WHIPS back to Emil. Emil looks at us.
speaker_heading: EMIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Get in the bathroom!
speaker_heading: OLEG (O.S.)
dialog: Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and
dialog: shut up!
text: Emil turns off the TV. Our POV backs into the bathroom,
text: closing the door but leaving it open a crack. Emil looks
text: down at his shoe. The POV PANS down to the kitchen knife
text: sticking out of Emil's BOOT. Emil's hands pull his pants
text: cuff over it. POV PANS up to Emil as he moves to the door
text: and opens it. It's not Daphne and she's not world class.
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: Hi, I'm Honey.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Where's Czech girl?
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be.

speaker_heading: HONEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Now I like to get business out of the

speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: I ordered a Czech girl. Daphne, you

speaker_heading: HONEY
text: It's an outcall service run out of an
dialog: apartment. I don't meet the other
dialog: girls. Aren't you gonna get undressed?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Where is escort service?
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: That's confidential. Could you put the
dialog: money on the dresser?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: I like to talk to the person who runs
dialog: the service. Can you give me address?
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: Look. Do we have a problem here?
dialog: There's no reason to have a problem.
dialog: I'm gonna make you feel real good. You
dialog: wanna Czech girl?
dialog: After I'm done with you, you won't miss
dialog: her. Now why don't you pay me?
text: She starts to unfasten Emil's belt.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: (stopping her)
dialog: Listen to me. I don't want sex. Just
dialog: give me the address and then you go.
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: (suddenly hard as nails)
dialog: Look, man, I don't give a shit if you
dialog: want sex or not, but you're payin' for
dialog: my time.
text: Emil pulls the knife out of his boot and SHOVES her against
text: the door, PUSHING the blade against her throat - suddenly
text: furious like he was before killing Milos and Tamina.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Give me the address!!
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: Alright, alright - don't hurt me!
dialog: Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
text: Emil backs off as she reaches for her purse, and comes out
text: with a can of mace, SPRAYING Emil's face!
text: Emil stumbles backwards - Oleg holding him in the frame. He
text: WHIP PANS back to Honey as she grabs her clothes, unlocking
text: the door but Emil's HAND SLAMS it shut! Emil turns blindly,
text: rubbing his burning eyes - guarding the door. Honey darts
text: toward the bathroom - she pushes open the door and runs into
text: Oleg who is VIDEOTAPING HER. Horrified, she turns around as
text: Emil SMASHES her in the face so hard she topples backwards,
text: tripping into the bathtub, pulling the shower curtain down on
text: her! Like a panther out for the kill, Emil POUNCES. Oleg
text: films as Emil lifts his hand, gripping...
scene_heading: THE KITCHEN KNIFE
text: As Emil's hand comes FLYING DOWN - then RISES UP, BLOODIED.

speaker_heading: COMPOSITE ARTIST
dialog: What about her cheek bones?
speaker_heading: JORDY
text: Her cheek bones are prominent and her

dialog: absolutely beautiful.
text: The composite artist looks at Jordy.
speaker_heading: JORDY (CONT'D)

dialog: don't know who your girl is.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: How long they been livin' here?
speaker_heading: KORFIN
dialog: You hear that question, Garcia?
speaker_heading: GARCIA
dialog: Yeah, I got Immigration on the phone -
dialog: they've been here illegally.
speaker_heading: KORFIN
dialog: Well, they're definitely permanent
dialog: residents now.
speaker_heading: GARCIA
dialog: I got the owner of the plumbing company
dialog: Milos worked for.
speaker_heading: KORFIN
dialog: Why don't we get some sleep and we'll go
dialog: see him in the morning.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: You go home. I'm takin' your car and
dialog: goin' back to the crime scene.
speaker_heading: KORFIN
dialog: Aren't you tired?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: If I go home I won't be able to fall
dialog: asleep anyway.
text: Jordy takes the sketch of Daphne which isn't a bad likeness
text: and heads for the door. Korfin falls in behind him. As they
text: pass Garcia he hands Jordy the address.
speaker_heading: KORFIN
dialog: (of the picture)
dialog: She keepin' you up? Like to meet her,
dialog: huh? She'd make you forget your ex
dialog: wife. Cure your insomnia.
scene_heading: INT. MILOS' APARTMENT - DAWN
text: CAMERA DESCENDS FROM THE SKY picking up Jordy as he enters
text: what is left of Milos and Tamina's apartment. The roof has
text: been burned off. He moves into the next room, trying to see
text: through the darkness - looking through the muck and char.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Okay to smoke?
text: Jordy turns, surprised. Eddie sits on a singed chair. He
text: pours from a half-pint bottle of vodka into his 'won ton
text: soup' container, smoking a cigar. On the arm of the armchair
text: is a brown legal folder and stacks of photographs of the
text: crime scene and the burned bodies.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: It's your crime scene now. You can do
dialog: what you want.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Watch the news?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Nah, I musta missed it.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Well, just so you know. I gave you guys
dialog: the credit.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Well, just so you know, I don't care
dialog: about that stuff.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Nah, why should you?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: I don't even watch TV.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Good. Good. Commendable.
text: Eddie knocks his 'won ton soup' back.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Did you get a report from the M.E.?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Sure. But I would like to ask you
dialog: something. You got a problem with me?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: If you found me steppin' on your crime
dialog: scene - it might piss you off, too.
dialog: (then)
dialog: What about the report?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You were right, they were both dead
text: before the fire. The male was stabbed
text: so hard the killer broke off the tip of
dialog: the knife in his spine. That's usually
text: an indicator of something personal.
text: Jordy pulls out a sketch of Daphne. Hands it to Eddie.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: The Super said he'd seen her before but
dialog: she didn't live here.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Pretty.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: (acts as if he didn't notice)
dialog: Hmmmm.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Maybe you don't care about that either.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Who says she's a suspect?
text: Jordy tries to take the sketch back. Eddie holds on.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What would you call her?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Look, I'm not even sure she has anything
dialog: to do with this. I saw her outside
dialog: after the fire - thought it was a lead.
dialog: Maybe she saw something. Maybe she was
dialog: visiting somebody here. Who knows?
text: Eddie walks up to the burnt mattress - where the bodies were.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Obviously they weren't having sex. As
dialog: you pointed out. So why go through all
dialog: the trouble of putting 'em like that?
text: Eddie passes a crime scene photo of the bodies to Jordy.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone
text: trying to send a message. Burial rites
dialog: are taken very seriously in Eastern
dialog: Europe. It could be to humiliate them.
dialog: Just burning them up, no proper funeral,
dialog: it's like condemning them to hell.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Eastern Europe. Like what? Romania?
dialog: Hungary?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Or Czechoslovakia. The Slavs have been
dialog: fighting the Germans and the Russians
dialog: for a thousand years. These are very
dialog: intense people and they take things
dialog: personally.
text: Eddie's cellular rings - he grabs it.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yeah? Where? You sure it was a knife?
dialog: Uh-huh. Really? Okay.
dialog: (to Jordy)
dialog: We've got another murder - in a hotel on
text: Eighth Avenue. A stabbing. Clerk said
dialog: the room was rented by a Russian...
text: Eddie's moving with Daphne's sketch.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: I'll come with you.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: There wasn't a fire. There'll be
dialog: nothing for you to do.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: I can watch you, Eddie. Maybe I'll
dialog: learn something.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: This isn't homicide school.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: My parents are from Poland. I can help
dialog: with the Eastern European angle.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You're Polish?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: My folks are.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Stay here.

scene_heading: EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NEWS STAND - DAY
text: Video POV of the news stand as a hand reaches into frame and
text: picks up a copy of THE NEW YORK POST. Eddie's photo is on
text: the front page - holding the kitchen timer by the wires.
text: Underneath his picture the caption reads, "DOUBLE HOMICIDE...
text: FLEMMING'S ON IT." The videocamera widens out revealing Emil
text: standing in front of a Times Square news stand, reading the
text: front page. The videocamera turns around - until focusing on
dialog: Oleg himself.
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: This is second day in America. First
dialog: day was very exciting. Full of thrills
dialog: and chills. Over there, is co-star of
dialog: my new movie, Emil!
text: He turns the camera around - FILMING EMIL.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: (to vendor)
dialog: Who is he?
speaker_heading: VENDOR
dialog: New York's finest. This is his case.
text: The VENDOR - picks up People. Stephen Geller is on the
dialog: cover.
speaker_heading: VENDOR (CONT'D)
dialog: This all you want?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Do you know how much killer gets for
dialog: movie rights?
speaker_heading: VENDOR
dialog: (People)
dialog: In here, says he wants a million.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Million?! The killer gets one million
dialog: dollars for a television interview?
speaker_heading: VENDOR
dialog: Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous
dialog: serial killer - half a million for his
dialog: interview. And how much you think
dialog: Monica got for writing book about the
dialog: President coming on to her? It pays to
dialog: be a killer or a whore in this country.
dialog: Look, you want magazine or not?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Yes. Both.
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: And these.
text: Oleg picks up FILM COMMENT, MOVIELINE and PREMIERE magazine.
dialog: Emil pays for everything.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: (to Oleg)
dialog: Get a taxi.
text: Oleg tucks the magazines in his coat, picks up the suitcases
text: and hails a taxi. As Emil collects his change he sees an old
text: BLIND WOMAN waiting at the crosswalk. The light's blinking
speaker_heading: WALK.
speaker_heading: EMIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Let me help.
text: Emil gently takes her arm and crosses her to the other side.
speaker_heading: BLIND WOMAN
dialog: Thank you, son.
text: Emil watches her walk on.
scene_heading: INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: The hotel room is a hive of activity. GIL is dusting the
text: dresser for prints. Another officer is stripping the bed and
text: putting the bedding into a big, clear plastic bag. As Eddie
text: enters the crime scene, a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER is standing in
text: the doorway taking pictures.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Takin' a bath.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Any I.D.?
speaker_heading: LEON
text: Still unknown but we're running prints.
dialog: Kid over there caught the case.
text: Jordy enters. Leon steps in his way.
speaker_heading: LEON (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry...PD only.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: It's okay.
text: Eddie walks over to a young detective. TOMMY CULLEN, only
text: 26, is excited to meet Eddie.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Tommy Cullen. Heard a lot about you.
dialog: Nice to meet you. Here's what we got.
text: A girl in there, figure her to be a
text: prostitute, looks like she was fighting
dialog: for her life. She's got defense wounds
dialog: on her hands. Right this way - in the
dialog: bathroom.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: After you.
text: Eddie follows Tommy into the bathroom. There's blood
text: splattered all over the walls and the floor. Honey's topless
text: body lies in the tub tangled in the bloody shower curtain.
text: MURPHY, an Irish medical examiner (M.E.), is examining the
dialog: body.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Capra? That's not Czech or Russian.
dialog: Who said he sounded Russian?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: The clerk?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Check the switchboard, see what phone
dialog: calls were made from this room.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I'll do it.
text: Tommy heads out. Eddie takes out his cigar holder. Slides
text: out what's left of his cigar. Re-lights it. Looks down at
text: Honey's body in the bathtub. Gil's dusting the tub for
dialog: prints.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
text: Clothes were off in the other room. Tub
text: is dry except for the blood.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Any of you guys take a piss lately?
text: Gil looks confused. Eddie points to the toilet. Seat is up.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Do the seat for me.
text: Gil crosses to the toilet and starts to dust it. Eddie
text: stands in the bathroom - studying the scene. Holding the
text: unlit cigar. Looking around at the blood splattered walls.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Only one guys checked in?
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: C'mere. You wanna go to homicide
dialog: school? Here - make yourself useful.
text: Eddie positions Jordy behind the tub next to the wall.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Our killer...our killer's standing here
text: slashing at her. She's fightin' him.
text: The blood is splattering this way. It's
dialog: on this wall...
dialog: (pointing to the right of
dialog: Jordy)
dialog: And there's some specks over here.
dialog: (to the left of Jordy)
dialog: There's nothing here because someone was
text: standing right here. Someone big. And
text: he's got blood on him. Lots of blood.
dialog: He wouldn't walk out of here like that.
dialog: (turning to Murphy)
dialog: Murphy, what kind of knife you think
dialog: we're talking about here?
text: Murphy pulls out a clear plastic ruler and walks over to the
text: blood-splattered wall.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: If you look here where he missed and hit
dialog: the wall you see that the marks aren't
dialog: deep but they're kinda wide... not your
dialog: everyday kitchen or pocket knife.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What if the tip was broken off?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Could be. Then we should find it here
dialog: somewhere.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I think we've already found it.
text: Eddie exchanges a look with Jordy as Tommy, the young
text: detective, returns.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: There was only one call from this room
dialog: last night. I dialed it. It's an
dialog: escort service.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Did you identify yourself?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Hey, I'm new but I'm not stupid.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Call communications and get an address
dialog: on that number.
text: Tommy holds up a slip of paper with the outcall service
text: address on it.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Good work.
scene_heading: INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - STAIRS - DAY
text: Jordy hurries out - catches up with Eddie.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: You goin' to the escort service?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You got any better ideas?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Mind if I ride along with you?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: This has nothing to do with your fire.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: But what if it does? You might need my
dialog: help.
text: As Eddie exits the hotel, a MAN approaches.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Hey, Eddie, can I get your autograph for
dialog: my son?
scene_heading: EXT. KING EDWARD HOTEL - DAY
text: Jordy catches up. Eddie finishes signing the autograph using
text: the man's back.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I'll let you know what happens.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: This is ridiculous. I'm not gonna be in
dialog: your way - we can talk the case over.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin.
dialog: If you win you can come with me. If you
dialog: don't win, you don't come.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: I'll call it... tails.
text: Eddie pulls out a coin and hands it to Jordy.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Okay. I'll call it. Heads.
text: Jordy flips the coin and it's heads.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Heads. See, you lost twice.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Okay. Get in.
text: Jordy goes for the passenger side of the car. Before Jordy
text: can get in, Eddie starts to pull away. Jordy stands on the
text: sidewalk - dejected. Eddie stops the car again and this time
text: lets Jordy get in.
speaker_heading: WHIP PAN TO:
scene_heading: INT. UPPER EASTSIDE HALLWAY - DAY
text: Eddie and Jordy arrive in front of Rose's door. Eddie knocks
text: and flips a coin to Jordy.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Oh here. A souvenir.
text: Jordy takes the quarter. Not understanding what Eddie means.
text: He looks at the quarter.
speaker_heading: JORDY
text: Two heads.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Better than one.
text: Eddie suckered him with the coin toss. Jordy reacts. Eddie
text: laughs - squirts Binaca in his mouth. Knocks again. We hear
scene_heading: ROSE HELLER.
speaker_heading: ROSE (O.S.)
dialog: Who's there?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Police. We'd like to ask you a few
dialog: questions.
speaker_heading: ROSE (O.S.)
dialog: I have nothin' to say. If you wanna
dialog: contact my attorney...
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (commands)
dialog: Homicide, Miss Hearn. It's Detective
dialog: Eddie Flemming. Open up.
text: Rose reacts. Immediately UNLOCKS, UNCHAINS and opens the
dialog: door!
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: You! I've seen you on TV!
text: Eddie glances self-consciously at Jordy.
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: C'mon in. C'mon in!
scene_heading: INT. ROSE'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: They enter.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Just a minute. Shit. And I don't have
text: a camera. Hold on a second.
text: Rose moves back to the phone - finishes up her conversation
text: in Afrikaner. We hold on Eddie and Jordy at the door. Eddie
text: looks around - taking in the place. FOUR GIRLS are on
text: phones. Two girls take orders for customers. The other two
text: work the phone sex lines. Rose hangs up the phone - turns to
dialog: Eddie and Jordy:
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of
dialog: your girls was killed last night at the
dialog: King Edward Hotel.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Oh my G-d. Honey! Honey's dead?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Do you remember the man who called?
text: Though Rose answers Jordy, she directs her response to Eddie.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Yeah. He wanted a girl from
dialog: Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey
dialog: 'cause once they get there, you know, it
dialog: doesn't really matter - Honey was
dialog: killed...? Poor girl...
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Do you have any Czech girls working for
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Did you tell him you did?
text: A BUTCH GIRL enters. Rose speaks to her in Afrikaner.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: (Afrikaner)
dialog: Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What are you saying?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Daphne. Another guy came in asking me
dialog: about her, too.
text: Jordy pulls out the sketch, unfolds it.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: This her?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Yeah. Sort of. I tried to recruit her,
dialog: gave her my card. She said she'd think
dialog: about it but I never heard from her.
speaker_heading: BUTCH GIRL
dialog: (Afrikaner)
text: Beautiful eyes.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Who came by looking for her?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: He said he was her cousin. I told him
dialog: where she works. They were just here.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Describe him.
speaker_heading: ROSE
text: Tall, short-haired, scary eyes. Second
dialog: guy with him was...shorter, with a
dialog: wrestler's build. And he wouldn't turn
dialog: his videocamera off me.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: He had a videocamera? Where is she?
dialog: Quickly!
speaker_heading: ROSE
text: She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon
dialog: on 63rd and Madison.
scene_heading: EXT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY
text: As Eddie speeds through the street, SIREN BLARING.
scene_heading: INT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY
text: Jordy holds on as Eddie darts in and out of cars with
text: astonishing dexterity. This man can drive. Eddie picks up
text: his phone - dials. Jordy is on his cell phone as well.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison.
dialog: Hair salon. Ludwig's.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: I'm on my way with Eddie. Ludwig's.
dialog: 63rd and Madison. The suspects might be
dialog: there already.
text: Eddie looks over as Jordy disconnects. Eddie picks up a beer
text: he was holding between his legs - finishes it.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You thirsty?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: I'm on duty.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (drinking)
dialog: So am I. Alright, I'll go inside and
dialog: you cover the back.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Hey! I always wanted to be a cop when I
dialog: was a kid. I dreamed of running up to a
text: door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and
dialog: yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy!
dialog: What'd you dream about?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: I wanted to run up to a building on
text: fire, kick in the door, rush into the
dialog: smoke and save a kid.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Then I guess we're doin' this the right
dialog: way, aren't we? If we pull up to a
dialog: burning building I'll gladly let you go
dialog: first.
text: Jordy looks at Eddie - can't deny he's right.
scene_heading: INT. LUDWIG'S SALON - DAY
text: We're in a moving video POV of Ludwig's, the hair salon -
text: it's big and spacious. The lens finds THE RECEPTIONIST.
speaker_heading: OLEG (O.S.)
dialog: Daphne Handlova?
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Daphne? In the back. Probably
text: shampooing a customer's hair.
text: Oleg approaches Daphne who is mixing hair dye. LUDWIG, the
text: owner, is with her.
speaker_heading: LUDWIG
dialog: Why are you messing with your hair color
dialog: again? You're going to kill your hair.
dialog: You won't look good with black hair.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: I want to do it, alright?
speaker_heading: LUDWIG
dialog: Well, then do it after work. A
text: customer's waiting.
text: He leaves, a customer approaches. She smiles at him - turns
text: on the water in the sink then sees - Oleg filming her. She
text: backs up...suddenly moves to the emergency door!
text: TO THE BACKYARD
text: There's a garden out there. Daphne runs toward the alley.
text: Oleg follows her - still videotaping. As she rounds the
text: corner she bumps into...Emil! He pulls out his kitchen
text: knife, shoving her against the wall, pushing the blade with
text: the broken tip against her throat.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: I...I have a temper.
text: She looks at him, not understanding. Oleg films the scene.
speaker_heading: EMIL (CONT'D)
dialog: When I lose it, I lose control. I
dialog: didn't intend to kill Milos but he stole
dialog: from me. Cheated me! When I went to
dialog: prison, they beat me. I still didn't
dialog: tell he was my partner. I loved Milos
dialog: like a brother...
text: The tone in Emil's voice - there's an uncharacteristic
text: softness to it. He wants to reconcile his behavior to her.
speaker_heading: EMIL (CONT'D)
dialog: (in English)
dialog: I'm not a killer.
text: The back door opens. He shoves the knife in his pocket as
text: Ludwig peers around the alleyway. What he sees is Emil
text: leaning close to Daphne, kissing her.
speaker_heading: LUDWIG
dialog: Daphne, will you be coming back to work?
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
text: In a minute, Ludwig.
text: Ludwig leaves.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Smart girl. I'm glad you're not a
dialog: whore. But washing hair? This is no
dialog: job for a woman as beautiful as you.
dialog: They should be washing your hair.
text: Emil reaches into his pocket and pulls out SOMETHING, sticks
text: it in the palm of her hand, closing her fingers around it.
speaker_heading: EMIL (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't want to kill you. But if you
dialog: talk, I will.
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: I thought you'd want these.
text: He taps her hand...he turns and goes out the rear exit. Oleg
text: follows. Jordy arrives.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: ...Daphne?
text: She says nothing.
speaker_heading: JORDY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm a fire marshal. You remember me
dialog: from the other night? You are Daphne,
dialog: right?
text: She says nothing. Eddie arrives. Daphne turns. Recognizing
dialog: Eddie.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You don't have to be afraid. We're here
dialog: to protect you. Come with me. We want
dialog: to talk to you. You speak English
dialog: alright?
text: Eddie looks at Jordy. Takes Daphne by the arm.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LUDWIG'S SALON - CONTINUOUS
text: As they come out, Eddie notices Daphne clutching something in
text: her hand. He reaches for her hand. Opens it. It's a
text: brushed gold necklace.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Did he give you these? Was he just
dialog: here?
text: Eddie searches the streets. Notices Oleg and Emil on the far
text: corner. Oleg is videotaping him. Leon and Tommy pull up.
text: Korfin behind. They all pop out. Eddie grabs Leon -
text: squeezes his arm - quietly.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
text: The other side of the street. The guy
text: with the videocamera.
dialog: (back to Jordy)
dialog: Don't look - put her in the car.
dialog: (to Leon)
dialog: Stay this side.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: (back to Tommy)
dialog: Stay with her.
text: They start heading down the curb - trying not to attract the
text: attention of Oleg and Emil.
scene_heading: A VIDEO CLOSE-UP
text: of the scene from across the corner.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: (Czech)
dialog: Put the fuckin' camera down! Let's go!
text: Emil starts to flee.
scene_heading: EXT. NYC STREETS - CONTINUOUS
text: What follows next is an incredible foot chase with Eddie,
text: Jordy, Korfin and Leon running through traffic - chasing
text: Emil. Eddie tries to stay in the lead but is running out of
dialog: breath.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Split up!
text: Jordy runs down one side of Madison - Eddie, the other.
text: Korfin continues down 62nd and Leon covers the other side.
text: They search for Emil, grabbing people, turning them around,
text: missing him. Emil seems to have disappeared.
text: Leon, gun raised, approaches the cafe. As he rounds the
text: corner, Emil darts out, cracking Leon across the face! Leon
text: crashes into a table, dropping his gun. Emil scoops up the
text: gun and PISTOL-WHIPS Leon. BEATING the detective to a pulp.
text: People are running from the scene. Emil takes Leon's wallet.
text: He is distracted by LAUGHTER. Oleg is VIDEOTAPING the scene.
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: Emil, look!
text: Oleg swivels with the videocamera. Korfin is running toward
text: them - pushing through the crowd. Emil FIRES! Korfin is
text: blown backwards.
speaker_heading: OLEG (CONT'D)
dialog: Perfect! Cut. Print!
text: Eddie arrives. Bends down to Leon, whose face is red with
text: blood. Jordy runs to Korfin, who's laying in the street,
text: shot in the side. Jordy cradles his partner.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Are you hit?
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: No. I'm okay.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: (to Korfin)
dialog: Bobby, Bobby! Where're you hit?!
speaker_heading: KORFIN
dialog: It hurts. Aw, Jesus!
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Lay down. Stay down, Bobby.
text: Jordy looks up as Eddie steps into the center of the street.
text: Cars screech out of the way! Eddie crouches, taking aim at
text: Emil, who is almost two blocks away. It's an impossible
text: shot, out of range.
text: But Eddie closes an eye, aims and squeezes off one SHOT. Two
text: blocks away, Emil topples. Korfin and Jordy look at Eddie,
text: astonished he made the shot. Emil scrambles to his feet.
text: Runs. Eddie holsters his weapon. Pulls out a handkerchief.
text: Dabs Leon's wounds.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: He got my gun! Motherfucker was filming
dialog: the whole time!
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I know. Relax. Take it easy. Don't
dialog: worry, we'll get those fuckers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: EMS VEHICLE
text: Eddie and Jordy watch as Korfin on a stretcher, is loaded in
text: an EMS VEHICLE and in b.g., an EMS DOCTOR attends to Leon's
text: bloody face. Eddie and Jordy turn to go back into the
text: restaurant, now cleared out - as Nicolette Karas arrives with
dialog: her cameraman.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Detective - can you tell us what
dialog: happened here?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I can't talk right now. We have some
dialog: things to take care of.
text: Jordy moves off, he doesn't want to get pulled in front of
dialog: Nicolette.
text: Daphne can be seen waiting in the back of the restaurant,
text: maybe twenty feet away. Tommy stands next to her. This is
text: where Eddie and Jordy are headed.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: I understand, but I noticed that the
dialog: Fire Marshall is here with you. Is this
dialog: somehow related to the fire department?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I really can't give out any information
dialog: right now at this point.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Okay. But I do understand that your
text: partner, Leon Jackson's been injured.
dialog: Is that correct?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: He was hurt, but not seriously. He'll
dialog: be fine.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Do you have the suspect in custody?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Um...now is not a good time, okay.
text: Detective Jackson's hurt. He's fine.
dialog: I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective
text: Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: (to cameraman)
dialog: Alright, cut, cut, cut.
text: Mike the cameraman cuts the cameraman - lowers it from his
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Eddie)
dialog: Eddie, are you okay?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yeah. Now's not a good time.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Alright.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Alright?
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Alright.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Alright.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Okay.
text: Eddie walks into the restaurant. Throws a look back at her,
text: then enters.
scene_heading: INT. ARMAND RESTAURANT - DAY
text: Jordy talks to Daphne.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: I told your partner, I can't help. I
dialog: didn't see anything.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: C'mon, start at the beginning. You know
dialog: these people?
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: Tamina was a friend of mine. My shower
dialog: was broken, she let me use theirs.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Go on.
text: She says nothing.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Whether you tell us or not, we'll find
dialog: out. Better if it comes from you.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: If I tell you, will you arrest me?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Arrest you for what? Why would we
dialog: arrest you?
text: She still hesitates.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you hiding? Why are you afraid
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: She just saw two of her friends killed!
dialog: They probably threatened her.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Is that all there is?
text: She looks at Eddie.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you here illegally? Don't worry
dialog: about that. We'll talk to Immigration.
dialog: They won't deport you.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
text: She clams up.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Something back home?
text: Jordy leads Daphne to a table - she sits. Eddie sits across
text: from her. Jordy crouches down next to her.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: ...my little sister and I shared a flat -
dialog: I came home one night and a man was
text: raping her. His gun was on the chair...
text: He came at me and I shot him.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: (optimistic)
dialog: Alright. That's a justifiable homicide.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: Yes, but he was a cop.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: A cop?
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm from a small town in Slovakia. Like
dialog: the South here. The Police is right, a
dialog: civilian is wrong. So I fled.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Look, we can help you but right now we
dialog: have to deal with what's happening here.
dialog: Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: (to Eddie)
dialog: Can I talk to you?
text: Eddie steps away with Jordy. Keeping his eyes on Daphne.
text: She tries to listen.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: She's fucked. Even if that story is
dialog: true.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Raw deal.
text: Eddie tilts his head. Measures Jordy.
speaker_heading: JORDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Look - let me talk to her. Any leads I
dialog: get, they're all yours. Just let me
text: have a first crack at her.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You wanna talk to her alone?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What would your girlfriend think of
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: I don't have a girlfriend.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: My point exactly.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: I'm serious here.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: So am I.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: C'mon. You intimidate her 'cause you're
dialog: a celebrity. She sees me differently.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You're her Savior? Is she the kid
dialog: you're gonna save from the burning
dialog: building?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: You know what I'm saying here.
text: Eddie looks at his watch. Thinks it over. Measures Jordy.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a
dialog: head start. You take her to the station
dialog: house. Don't let her out of your sight.
dialog: She's the only warm body we got left.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Hey. I'm a professional.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Women like that have a way of turning
dialog: professionals into amateurs.
text: He gives Jordy a look and heads for the door.
scene_heading: INT. A SEEDY BATHROOM - DAY
text: Emil pulls off his sock and shoe, lifts his foot into a
text: stained sink and washes the blood away, exposing the chunk of
text: pink flesh taken out of his ankle. Emil grabs some toilet
text: paper, plugs the wound, then cuts the towel off the dispenser
text: with his kitchen knife and wraps his ankle. He grits teeth
text: in pain. The lights go out. Then Oleg adjusts the
text: fluorescent light above the sink.
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: Gotta light the scene better. Now it's
text: more moody... like a scene from THE
speaker_heading: THIRD MAN.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: Does it hurt?
text: Emil lifts his foot out of the sink.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: This is nothing.
text: Emil lifts his shirt, exposing his back.
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: Oh, shit. I hate looking at that!
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Don't want to film this?
text: We don't see what Oleg sees - not yet - but from his
dialog: expression, it's horrible.
scene_heading: INT. JORDY'S CAR - DAY
text: Daphne rides in the backseat. Jordy's watching her in the
text: rearview.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: Now I become custody of police
dialog: department?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: If you cooperate with the DA - maybe
dialog: they'll help you with your situation.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: I will if they don't send me back.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: They won't until this is over.
text: She looks away. Out the window. Jordy sees emotion filling
text: her eyes. She looks back at him - her eyes have teared up.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: Are you married?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Divorced.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: Do you live alone?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I've been in these clothes since...the
dialog: killings. Could we stop at your place?
dialog: I could take a shower...before I go into
dialog: custody?
text: Jordy looks at her. Can't quite tell if she's trying to
dialog: manipulate him or really just wants to get cleaned up before
dialog: all the shit starts.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: I can't take you to my place.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: Somewhere else?
text: Jordy looks at her...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: Staring right at us.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I want to talk to you about something
dialog: serious.
text: He holds up the diamond engagement ring.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I want to live the rest of my life with
dialog: you...I don't know you've been married
dialog: before and I've never been married, but
dialog: I do love you, and...
text: Eddie is standing in front of a mirror - rehearsing the
text: proposal. He notices a small dab of blood on his shirtcuff.
text: Leon's blood. Paulie enters carrying a towel and a vodka
dialog: tonic.
speaker_heading: PAULIE
dialog: She's here.
text: Paulie sets down the drink and begins their silent ritual.
text: He hands Eddie the towel. Eddie wipes off his face and
text: hands, then hands the towel back to Paulie. Paulie helps
text: Eddie on with his coat. Eddie takes some Visine out of his
text: coat pocket. Drops a few in each eye. HE straightens
text: himself and looks in the mirror, taking a big gulp of the
text: drink. Eddie sets the glass down and starts out. Paulie
text: hands him a Binaca. Eddie gives himself a squirt as he
text: exits. Paulie follows.
scene_heading: INT. P.B. HERMAN'S RESTAURANT - DAY
text: It's lunchtime...it's crowded. Eddie takes a seat at a
text: table. He takes the ring out of his pocket - holds it under
text: the table. Nicolette Karas walks up to Eddie from behind.
text: Gives him a kiss on the cheek.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Hey, honey.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Hey.
text: She orders a drink in Greek from the Greek waiter, then sits
text: down across the table. There's a long pause - they just look
text: at each other.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: What is your problem? Why'd you snap at
dialog: me? I just wanted a statement.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I can't...I can't answer you just
dialog: because you want me to answer you!
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: You didn't have to embarrass me in front
dialog: of my colleagues. You could give me
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry. Did I embarrass you,
dialog: sweetheart? Oh...
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Stop it.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to
dialog: the cameras and say, do you mind if we
dialog: just work something out?
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Alright, alright, Eddie. Don't
dialog: patronize me.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I'm not.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Yes you are. I'm not just some
dialog: reporter. I don't just stick a
dialog: microphone in your face. You could give
dialog: me something.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yeah, well you took the camera and put
dialog: it right down on the evidence. That
dialog: was...
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: That was good. You were holding the
dialog: evidence.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You were merciless. You didn't give a
dialog: shit if you got me or not.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Well, who was it that taught me how to
dialog: do that? Huh?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You're ruthless.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: You're not so bad yourself.
text: They look at each other.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
dialog: C'mere.
text: They kiss.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at this. You have blood on your

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Could be Leon's.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Jesus. And last week you came over with
dialog: blood on your shoes. What am I going to
dialog: do with you?
text: Eddie takes her hand.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You know, I been thinkin'...these shoes
dialog: might look nice with another pair of
text: shoes next to them in the closet.
text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: You know, Nicky, I've been married twice
dialog: before. My first wife was a
dialog: professional woman, didn't have time for
dialog: children. My second wife...I never

text: Nicolette's phone rings. Eddie stops - looks at the ringing
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: What are you doing? What are you
dialog: saying?
text: Nicolette's phone keeps ringing. Eddie stares at it.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Eddie?
text: Nicolette's phone keeps ringing.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't worry about the damn phone. I

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Answer the phone.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: No. Tell me what you want to say.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Answer it.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Okay. Okay. Hold that thought just for
dialog: a second. They only call me when it's
dialog: an emergency. Just hold that thought.
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Can you call back?
speaker_heading: PHONE VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: We need you here in twenty minutes. Get

speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: What're you talking about?
speaker_heading: PHONE VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Katie. We don't know where she is. We
dialog: can't find her. You gotta anchor the

speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: What? Oh. Okay. Yeah.
text: The line disconnects. She collapses the phone. Turns to
dialog: Eddie.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor. They
dialog: want me to anchor tonight!
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: That's good.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: EDDIE

speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Okay. That is great. But I can't go

dialog: here.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: No. Go ahead. You're gonna be great.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: No. No, listen to me here. I want to

dialog: know, the shoe thing and the marriages
dialog: and...
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I'll tell you tonight. Let's do it
dialog: tonight. As soon as you get back we'll
dialog: talk. We'll talk.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Promise?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I promise. We'll talk. You'll be
dialog: great. You'll be fine. Go ahead, just
dialog: imagine that, uh... Just look into the
dialog: lens and imagine you're talking to me.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Yeah. I'll do that. As long as you're

speaker_heading: EDDIE

speaker_heading: NICOLETTE

speaker_heading: EDDIE

speaker_heading: JORDY
text: The men are out of quarters - practicing

speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: So...the station is empty?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Yeah. This way.
text: He gestures toward the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. FIRE STATION LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Jordy and Daphne walk through the locker room. Her eyes
text: never leaving Jordy's.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: You considered becoming a prostitute?
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: Yes, I considered it.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Did you ever turn tricks before?
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: What about back home?
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: No.
text: Daphne stops. Looks at him. Stands very close.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE (CONT'D)
dialog: I came here. I had no money. I knew no
dialog: one. I couldn't get a job because you
dialog: have to have a green card to get work.
dialog: They approached me - I could've made a
dialog: lot of money. I considered it, but...
dialog: it's not who I am. They pay me below
text: the table at Ludwig's.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: So you were never a prostitute?
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: What are you asking me?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: I'm just trying to find out who you are.
text: She looks up into his eyes. Searching. Thinking he's
text: hinting.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: Can you let me go?
text: She leans in close to him - giving him the opportunity to
text: kiss her. Jordy is tempted but...remembers Eddie's warning
text: and backs up slightly.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Showers are this way.
text: Desperate now, willing to do anything, Daphne moves in even
dialog: closer.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: You could shower with me.
text: Jordy is locked in her eyes. Almost giving in. Then breaks
text: away. Gestures towards the showers.
text: Daphne looks away form him - crestfallen. She heads to the
text: showers. Jordy follows her into the bathroom. The walls are
text: lined with shower stalls.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: I'll uh, I'll get you a towel.
text: He leaves her there. Alone. She quickly moves to the
text: window. Opens it. Looks down. It's a two-story drop to the
dialog: street.
speaker_heading: JORDY
text: gets a towel from the locker room. His beeper goes off. He
text: checks the number but decides not to return the call. We
text: follow him back into the bathroom. The shower is on but he
text: notices the window. It's open.
speaker_heading: JORDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit!
text: He rushes over. He looks out. No sign of her. He turns -
text: looks back at the shower. It's on but he can't see through
text: the curtain. Can't tell if she's there. He walks over -
text: quickly - fearing that she's left. He pulls the curtain
text: aside. She's crouched in the corner shower stall. Holding
text: herself. She looks up at him - her eyes filled with tears.
speaker_heading: JORDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you alright?
text: Jordy sits on the bench next to the shower.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: I'm not a whore. I'm not a whore.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: You don't know. I'm sorry. I was
dialog: desperate. That's not me. I shot a
dialog: cop. Can you imagine what they'll do to
dialog: me when I got to prison?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: They're not gonna send you right back.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...I'm glad.
dialog: Actually I'm glad it's over. All this
dialog: time. Hiding. Never being able to look
text: anyone in the eyes.
dialog: Always afraid that someone would find
dialog: out who I was. Never trusting anyone...
text: He covers her with the towel, pulling her up.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: You can trust me.
text: She embraces him. Trusting him. He stands there for a
text: moment. Then awkwardly holds her. Comforting her.

text: taping Emil as he rips open the safety plastic with his

speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: The video of Milos and Tamina - I told

speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: EMIL

speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: What does it look like? It's an address

text: Oleg jumps up with the camera to tape the book.
speaker_heading: OLEG

speaker_heading: EMIL

speaker_heading: OLEG

speaker_heading: DUFFY

speaker_heading: JORDY

speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: I let her take a shower.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: A shower!? Did you take one, too?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: No! Nothing happened.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Oh really. That's nice. You took a
text: homicide witness to take a shower after
dialog: your partner was shot? Are you out of
dialog: your fucking mind?? Are you having that
dialog: much trouble gettin' dates?!
speaker_heading: EDDIE (O.S.)
dialog: I told him to take her there.
text: Jordy and Duffy turn. Eddie walks out. Eddie turns - Tommy -

text: Hotel - is coming out of the back office.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Tommy, get her outta here.
text: Tommy takes Daphne into the precinct.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: This way, ma'am.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: There was too much press hangin' around
dialog: there. I didn't want her face on the

speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: It was my decision, not his.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall
dialog: and every now and then I'd like to be
dialog: included in decisions.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do
dialog: the press conference. How about that?
dialog: The case is all yours.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Oh yeah...? Alright.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (to Jordy)

speaker_heading: EDDIE

speaker_heading: JORDY

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Just a shower?

speaker_heading: JORDY

dialog: No, I don't think you were a fool, I
dialog: just think you were stupid about it. I
dialog: mean, to say the least, you outta know
dialog: better. You don't know her well enough.
dialog: She's got the potential to fucking hang
dialog: you even if she suggests that you made a
dialog: pass at her, it's fuckin' over. You can
dialog: deny it all you want, but it will not
dialog: make one fucking bit of difference.
dialog: You're dead.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: I told you, you know, I thought I was
dialog: doing the right thing, you know, I think
dialog: she's innocent.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Well, it's not up to you to decide
dialog: whether she's innocent or not. Don't
dialog: you understand, that's why you're a
dialog: professional.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a
dialog: limb for somebody? I mean, you shoulda
dialog: heard her there. Tellin' her whole
dialog: story...I believed her.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: How you go out on a limb for somebody is
dialog: by giving her a number of an Immigration
dialog: lawyer. Here, here's a number of an
dialog: Immigration lawyer. That's how you help
dialog: her.
dialog: But you can't get involved in her like
dialog: that. You're gonna jeopardize your
dialog: career, your life and you're gonna
dialog: jeopardize my case. And lemme give you
dialog: another piece of advice. Maybe you
dialog: don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a
dialog: little secret - the whole fuckin' world
dialog: watches television. And when you get
dialog: out there, they know your face. And the
dialog: little fame, the little fuckin' itty
dialog: bitty fame that I get in this city makes
dialog: it a lot easier for my job. And I get
dialog: more done because of it.

speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Why'd you help me back there with the
dialog: Chief? Why'd you stand up for me like
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You know, I don't know. I like you.
dialog: You remind me of a puppy I used to have.
dialog: He pissed on the rug all the time, but I
dialog: still kept him.
text: Eddie picks up his cigar that's going out. He sticks it in
text: his mouth. A match is lit. He looks up. Jordy holds the
text: match. Eddie dips the end of the cigar and puffs. The
text: homicide detective and the fire marshal hold a look.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Eddie walks in - carrying flowers. He closes and locks the
text: door behind him. He grabs the phone. Dials.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: It's Flemming...anything turn up? Did
dialog: they check the hospitals? Airports?
dialog: Yeah, I hit him! I fuckin' hit him! We
dialog: should be all over everywhere - with
dialog: dogs, choppers, everything! These guys
dialog: are from fuckin' Czechoslovakia...
text: He looks at the flowers. Decides to put the case behind him
text: for a moment.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll call you later.
text: He HANGS up. Arranges the flowers in a vase. So they look
text: perfect. Sets them on the coffee table. Fills out a card,
dialog: writes, "Nicky, I love you.
text: Will you marry me?" He sticks the card in the flowers -
text: turns the lights down low. Puts a romantic Sinatra song on
text: the stereo. Moves to the liquor cabinet. Pours himself a
text: drink. He sets the ringbox on the coffee table - next to the
text: flowers. There's a knock at the door.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Coming!
text: Eddie smooths his hair, unlocks the door. But the hallway is
text: empty.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Nicky!?!?
text: No answer. Eddie steps out in the hallway with the drink in
text: his hand. Walks toward the elevator. Doesn't notice the
text: shadow that passes behind him - entering his apartment.
text: Eddie turns. No sign of anyone.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Nicky?!
text: He walks back toward his apartment. Turns and locks the
text: door. A BLUR jumps out of the shadows SLAMMING him on the
text: head with a gun. Eddie tumbles to the floor! OUT COLD!
scene_heading: A BLURRED VIDEO IMAGE
text: as it's focused - on Eddie - handcuffed and upper body taped
text: to a chair - 20 minutes later - sobered up. Emil is sitting
text: in front of him. On the coffee table alongside him are the
text: flowers in a vase. They've ransacked the place. Emil has
text: Eddie's watch, his gold shield and his money. He's smoking
text: one of Eddie's cigars and in Emil's hand...is the diamond
text: engagement ring and card. Oleg, 60 MINUTES-style, is
text: positioned behind Emil videotaping Eddie. He moves to the
text: corner of the room - bringing a light back over to illuminate
text: Eddie's face.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: So...who's Nicky?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Your opinion.
dialog: (leaning forward)
dialog: You see, they going to make a movie
dialog: about me, too, Eddie. And write books.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: What's your accomplishment.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: I kill someone famous.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Then do it, asshole.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Good - be tough to the end. Actor who
dialog: plays you will want to die like hero.
text: Eddie looks at the videocamera. Emil answers Eddie's look.
speaker_heading: EMIL (CONT'D)
dialog: So tabloids don't have to do re
dialog: enactments. They going to have real
dialog: movie this time.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: If you kill me and film it you're
dialog: putting a noose around your neck.
text: Emil turns to Oleg.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Turn it off.
text: Oleg obeys. Emil turns to Eddie.
speaker_heading: EMIL (CONT'D)
dialog: No. We are insane. Who else but crazy
dialog: men would film their murders?
dialog: (gestures to Eddie)
dialog: So we kill someone famous and if we are
dialog: caught, we are sent to mental hospital.
dialog: But what good is money there? Because
dialog: once in hospital I say I not crazy.
dialog: Just pretended to be acquitted. We see
dialog: psychiatrists. They must certify we are
dialog: sane and because of your - what is law
dialog: called?
dialog: (Eddie says nothing)
dialog: Oh - I got it. Because of your Double
dialog: Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same
dialog: crime twice. We come out free, rich and
dialog: famous!
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: Good idea!
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You really think you'll be able to fool
dialog: a jury with this bullshit? How fuckin'
dialog: stupid are you?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Smarter than Americans. You're fed cry
dialog: baby talk shows all day long. Not only
dialog: will Americans believe me, they'll cry
dialog: for me.
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you
dialog: like to say goodbye to your Nicolette?
dialog: Maybe you can propose to her now?
text: Eddie says nothing. Just stares at Emil. Emil puffs on
text: Eddie's cigar.
speaker_heading: EMIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay. He has nothing to say.
dialog: (signaling Oleg)
dialog: Start the camera!
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: Cut!
text: Emil looks at Oleg.
speaker_heading: OLEG (CONT'D)
dialog: This is my project. I say 'action.' I
dialog: am the director! You are the talent.
dialog: You wait for me to say 'action!'
text: Emil looks at Eddie as if to say, "See what I have to put up
text: with." Oleg gestures from behind the videocamera.
speaker_heading: OLEG (CONT'D)
dialog: And...action!
text: Oleg FILMS as Emil raises Eddie's service revolver. Eddie
text: suddenly KICKS at Emil's hand, but Emil pulls it away,
text: backing out of Eddie's reach.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Bad last moment - I cut that out.
text: Emil raises the pistol again - pointing the gun at Eddie's
text: left temple. Emil cocks the hammer, but Eddie avoids the
text: gun, ducking his head to the side of Emil's arm. Standing
text: and following his head up Emil's arm and pushing him over
text: into the desk. Eddie then knocks Emil with the chair and
text: Emil falls off the desk and onto the floor.
text: Oleg still grips the videocamera. Eddie continues around
text: with the chair and drives Oleg back across the room - pinning
text: him to the wall.
text: Eddie comes back from Oleg to the gun at the same time as
text: Emil is limping for it. Eddie knocks Emil out of the way
text: with the chair and then stabs him with the legs of the chair
dialog: repeatedly.
text: Eddie comes up and around again at Oleg who is coming at him
text: from the wall. Eddie knocks Oleg over the coffee table and
text: onto the sofa. Falling on top of him, rolling over and
text: leaving Oleg on the sofa.
text: Eddie manages to get up from the sofa and position the chair
text: in such a way that he can fall over backward and grab the
text: gun. Emil limps toward the gun at the same time and it is
text: not clear in the darkness who has the gun.
text: Oleg gets up from the sofa and goes over to get the
text: videocamera. Eddie has managed to get the gun and comes up
text: as Oleg is moving in with the camera and starts shooting
text: toward Oleg - managing to shoot one of the blinds off the
text: window and one of the lampshades off the lamp.
text: Oleg crouches down with the camera and Eddie starts to turn
text: toward Emil who comes at him with the knife and stabs him in
dialog: the stomach.
text: Emil steps back, revealing the knife is BURIED IN EDDIE'S
speaker_heading: STOMACH.
text: Eddie stumbles backward, falling over but still attached to
text: the chair - holding the gun. Eddie can't believe he got
text: stabbed. Blood swells around his stomach. He can't be
text: dying. This can't be happening. He looks at Emil. The pain
text: is terrible. Oleg has knelt down next to Eddie - getting a
dialog: close up.
text: Emil looks at Eddie.
speaker_heading: EMIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Die. Die.
text: Emil looks around. Grabs a black pillow and finishes Eddie
text: off, suffocating him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACKNESS
text: We are moving through a tunnel - pitch black, so dark all you
text: feel is the motion. We are travelling very fast. Finally,
text: in the distance, a speck of light which fills the frame.
text: We slowly pull back from the white light to discover it is a
text: tiny pixel on a TV screen.
speaker_heading: WIDENING
text: further out we see Eddie's funeral on the evening news. It's
text: an enormous gathering - a sea of blue uniforms and
text: dignitaries. In the upper right hand corner, superimposed
text: over the funeral, is a picture of Eddie from his ID and in
text: his NYPD uniform. We see Oleg's reflection on the set with
text: the videocamera. He is filming the TV. We hear the audio
text: from Eddie's funeral.
speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER (ON T.V.)
dialog: ..Detective Flemming was one of the most
dialog: decorated NYPD detectives in the history
dialog: of New York. He made several thousand
dialog: arrests during his career, including the
dialog: famed Stephen Geller case. Beloved by
dialog: the community in which he served. His
dialog: partner eulogized him...
text: Leon is at the mic.
speaker_heading: LEON (ON T.V.)
dialog: ...Eddie was my mentor, my best friend
dialog: and my partner...he taught me the
dialog: meaning of the word 'cop.' He was a man
dialog: in every sense of the word. I'll miss
dialog: him...
dialog: (choking on tears)
dialog: Sleep well, brother.
text: Leon begins to sing "Amazing Grace." Oleg PANS from the TV
text: and focuses it on a lightbulb. Hands enter the frame -
text: carefully pouring clear liquid into an ashtray. A long
text: hypodermic needle slides into the ashtray - the plunger is
text: pulled back and the needle quickly fills with liquid.
text: Gingerly, the needle is inserted into the lightbulb. Again,
text: the plunger moves and the lightbulb is filled and placed on a
text: table...next to a CAN OF GASOLINE. VIDEOCAMERA ZOOMS OUT
text: revealing...Emil sitting at a hotel desk doing this.
scene_heading: INT. P.B. HERMAN'S RESTAURANT - DAY
text: It's packed with COPS drinking. Prosecutors...lawyers...many
text: who were at the funeral, including Leon. All wear the black
text: ribbon on their badges. There's a quality of an Irish wake -
text: boisterous, guys cursing...many cops in uniform. A buffet
text: has been laid out.
text: Hawkins enters in a black suit, wearing a black ribbon. He
text: greets people, shaking hands, embracing Leon.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: Awful...what an awful day. He was New
dialog: York City.
text: Hawkins notices a young man by the window. Teary-eyed. It's
text: Tommy. Hawkins nods to him.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I never got to tell him how much I
dialog: admired him.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: I know, son, I know. We all loved him.
text: Hawkins moves on...greeting others. He notices at the end of
text: the bar - sitting alone on a stool - is Nicolette. He moves
text: to her. Pulls up a stool alongside her. She turns, looks at
text: him. Just stares at him for a long beat. She is bombed.
text: Definitely drunk. She's had many. She turns to Hawkins.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: You know...you know he was gonna propose
dialog: to me. The crime guys found a card he'd
dialog: written out to me. And a ring
dialog: box...these fuckers that killed him -
dialog: have my ring. They have my diamond
dialog: engagement ring...
text: Hawkins touches her shoulder with compassion.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: What do you mean you know? He told you
dialog: he was gonna propose to me?
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: Well, he...
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: (overriding)
dialog: I want to hear everything he said.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: I'm trying to tell you.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Alright. Go ahead.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: That morning. He was talking to me and
dialog: Leon about marriage.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Oh my G-d. We were having lunch here.
text: He started making overtures - talking
text: about little shoes next to his in his
dialog: closet but I got a call to anchor - and
text: I walked out on him. I walked out on
dialog: him when he was trying to ask me to
dialog: marry him!!
text: Nicolette is crying now. She angrily wipes away a tear.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'd never had a great relationship
dialog: before. I'd never made great choices
dialog: with men. And he wasn't easy to get to
dialog: know. He was older, my parents told me
dialog: I was nuts to get involved with him.
dialog: But he was so great to me. Always
dialog: encouraging, telling me I could do
dialog: anything...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He was the one. You know, I'd give up
dialog: everything - everything - for just a
dialog: little more time. I would've spent
dialog: fifteen minutes with him if that's all I
dialog: knew I had.
text: She's lost it. Hawkins consoles her. Nicolette shrugs him
text: off - turns back to her drink. Downs the rest of it. A
text: woman arrives, MAGGIE, Hawkins' producer - assistant in tow.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Robert...?
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (holding a cellular)
dialog: You've got a call.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: I can't talk to anybody right now, can't

speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: Hello? Who is this?
dialog: (listens)
dialog: How do I know this is you?
text: Hawkins gives Nicolette a comforting squeeze on her shoulder.
text: Backs away from the bar. Now out of hearing distance, he
text: looks back at Nicolette and lowers his voice.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS (CONT'D)
dialog: Where?
text: We INTERCUT Emil on a public phone in the lobby of a movie
text: theater. Oleg videotapes Emil on the phone, as he throws

speaker_heading: EMIL

speaker_heading: EMIL

speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: I'll meet you on one condition - I get

speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: We'll talk about that. Four o'clock

speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: What? It doesn't work that way.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: (incensed)

speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Come alone. Bring cash. And we'll talk

speaker_heading: JORDY

speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Okay. But not water sports.
text: Duffy walks out. Jordy leads Daphne out of the station.
text: Korfin follows. A MAN IN A CHEAP SUIT is talking to Camello

speaker_heading: MAN

speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Yeah.

speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: Are you alright?
speaker_heading: JORDY
text: I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: I'm sorry.

speaker_heading: JORDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Is he your boyfriend?
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: Ludwig? He's gay - are you jealous?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest

speaker_heading: JORDY

speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: No matter what happens...I'm glad I met
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: I'm glad I met you.
text: They hold each other's eyes...then suddenly they kiss.
text: Urgently. Passionately. Somebody is coming up the stairs.
text: They part quickly. A tenant enters his apartment down the
text: hall. Jordy clears his throat.
speaker_heading: JORDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's get your stuff.
text: He opens the door. Peers inside - checking it out. Turns to
text: her. Gestures that it's okay to enter.
scene_heading: INT. DAPHNE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: It's very small. Almost no furniture. The bare minimum.
text: The apartment is a hole. She looks at Jordy. Both thinking
text: the same thought. Another kiss.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: You better get packed.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: Right.

text: In the kitchen.
speaker_heading: JORDY

speaker_heading: DAPHNE

speaker_heading: DAPHNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Jordy!!!
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: No! Get back! GET BACK!!!
text: Jordy's more surprised than shaken. It's a fire - he knows
text: the drill. He pushes her into the living room. Then notices
text: a FIRE EXTINGUISHER hanging on the wall. Grabs it. Aims it
text: at the FIRE spreading in the kitchen. He SPRAYS as Daphne
speaker_heading: SCREAMS!
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: That's not mine!
text: WHOOOOOOOOOSH! The fire extinguisher FEEDS THE FIRE! Flames
text: leap up from the fire - shooting toward the extinguisher
text: because it's filled with gasoline. The handle LOCKS! Jordy
text: CAN'T TURN IT OFF. Flames engulf the extinguisher and
scene_heading: JORDY'S HAND.
text: He flings the extinguisher - BACKS OUT OF THE KITCHEN.
text: Closes the door. Jordy takes off his jacket. Stuffs it
text: under the bottom of the door. Blocking the smoke. He
text: hurries into the living room. Knowing it's moments before
text: the extinguisher will explode. Jordy pulls out his cellular.
text: Hits the speed dial as he notices Daphne about to throw a
text: chair through the window.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Don't! It'll suck the flames toward us!
text: Too late. She SMASHES the window. There's an EXPLOSION in

speaker_heading: JORDY (CONT'D)
dialog: This is Jordan Warsaw! We got a 1075,
dialog: make it quick, we're trapped! 8th
text: Avenue and 44th Street.
text: He pulls Daphne toward the bedroom. It's locked. Jordy
text: kicks it open. Grabs the comforter off the bed. Shoves that
text: under the door jam. He pulls Daphne into the bathroom.
text: Shuts the door. Runs his severely burned hand under the cold
text: water. Daphne looks out the window - hearing the sirens.
text: She notices someone has nailed the window shut. And on top
text: of one nail...is Eddie's gold shield.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: Oh my G-d! Oh my G-d!
text: Jordy turns - sees Eddie's shield.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE (CONT'D)

text: This freaks her out. They were in her home. She starts to
dialog: panic.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Calm down. Get a hold of yourself! Get
dialog: down!
text: He pulls aside the curtain to the bathtub. In it is a CAN OF
text: GASOLINE. A virtual bomb.
speaker_heading: JORDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh Jesus!
text: Daphne reaches for the can of gasoline.
speaker_heading: JORDY (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: Pouring it out!
text: She grabs the can of gasoline - pours it down the drain. The

text: beginning to smoke and burn. They are trapped.
text: Jordy turns - grabs an exposed water pipe that runs up the
text: wall to the ceiling. He throws his feet against the wall for
text: leverage. Pulls with all his might to break it loose. It's
text: creaking - but he's having a hard time with it.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh shit!
text: Jordy looks over. The gasoline she's pouring out - is not
text: going down the drain. It's stopped up. As soon as the fire
dialog: gets in the bathroom, everything will explode!
text: Jordy begins pulling at the rusty pipe with all his might.
text: Daphne comes over - helps him. Both of them trying to break
text: it off. Suddenly it snaps and water POURS into the room.
text: SOAKING THE WALLS. They point the pipe toward the door,
text: soaking some of the flames which are consuming the door.
text: Trying to stop the fire from coming in. He and Daphne are
text: drenched. And trapped.
text: Jordy grabs a broken piece of pipe. Starts SMASHING the wall

text: in the apartment next door. The smoke has a place to escape.
text: There's a 7-year old KID in there. Standing in the bathroom.
text: Terrified.

dialog: blow up.
speaker_heading: OLEG
text: Across the roof is videotaping the bathroom as it EXPLODES!
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: Fire engines have arrived. The street is filled with
text: gawkers. Garcia and Korfin pull up just as Jordy runs from
text: the building - holding the kid in one arm and pulling Daphne
text: with the other. Carefully guarding his bandaged hand. A
text: fireman grabs the kid. Another grabs Daphne. Garcia and
text: Korfin run to Jordy.
speaker_heading: GARCIA
dialog: Jordy! What the hell happened?!
speaker_heading: KORFIN
dialog: Are you alright, man? Lemme see the

speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Where's Daphne? Daphne?
text: He spots Daphne on the corner as a familiar voice pushes

speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Isn't she a beauty? She's my fire, look
dialog: at that loom-up on her!
text: Jordy turns - it's Max. The attention pyromaniac who Jordy
text: threw out of his office. As a news crew arrives, Max turns
text: to the cameras.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I did this! I did this! Take my
dialog: picture! I'm Max! Max Gornick!

speaker_heading: JORDY
text: They were inside. They booby trapped

speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: What the hell are you talking about???

text: Jordy and Korfin turn. The Chief has a phone to his ear and
dialog: is freaked.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY OF CHANNEL 12 BROADCASTING - NIGHT
speaker_heading: JORDY'S POV
text: as he enters the TV station. His clothes burnt and still
text: wet. The lobby's full of ANGRY COPS. Tommy and Leon, still
text: in his funeral suit, SCREAMING above them all at Maggie the
text: producer and her ASSISTANT, who are standing behind the desk.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Where is he?! Where is Hawkins?!
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: He's not on the premises!
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: I want the tape. Go get it and bring it
dialog: here this minute.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Any request for the video must be
dialog: directed to "Top Story's" attorney -
dialog: Bruce Cutler. I'll be happy to give you
dialog: his number.
text: Leon jumps over the desk where Maggie stands. Tommy pushes
text: past the security guard to follow Leon. They continue toward
text: Maggie, pushing her further back into the office. She tries
text: to protect herself with an office door which Leon slams open.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Lady, if you put Eddie's murder on TV,
dialog: I'll get a warrant for your arrest and
dialog: shove it so far up your ass it'll come
dialog: outta your mouth!
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I want your shield number!
speaker_heading: HAWKINS (O.S.)
dialog: Viewer discretion advised!
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (pointing at the TV)
dialog: You want the tape? There it is!
text: Leon, Tommy, all the cops and Jordy - turn toward a TV set
text: which is mounted in the lobby. The "Top Story" logo flashes
text: on the screen, then Robert Hawkins is seen behind his desk.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: What we are about to broadcast is very
dialog: graphic footage...
text: Everyone is riveted. But Jordy notices outside...a "Top
text: Story" NEWS VAN is waiting in the alley. Robert Hawkins
text: jumps from a doorway and into the van. Jordy backs out.
scene_heading: INT. PLANET HOLLWYOOD - NIGHT
text: POP...a video POV of a bottle of Crystal as the cork is
text: popped. The videocamera pans up to Emil sitting at the
text: table. He nods at the waiter who leaves. Emil raises the
text: glass - looking into the lens.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: America! Who says you can't be success
dialog: in America? I arrived with nothing,
dialog: knowing nobody - now look - I am a
dialog: success story!
text: The videocamera is lowered. Oleg turns it off. Asks
dialog: suspiciously.
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: You are success story? I am success
dialog: story! Why do you say I and not we?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Oleg, don't be paranoid. You got a
dialog: hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't
dialog: you? I gave you half of what they gave
dialog: me. Look - here we are!
text: Emil gestures toward the big television set. We are in
dialog: Planet Hollywood - where diners and those by the bar can
text: watch a huge screen hanging from the ceiling. Robert Hawkins
text: is introducing his show.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS (ON T.V.)
dialog: Good evening. Welcome to "Top Story".
dialog: Tonight, I present to you material of a
dialog: graphic and violent nature never before
dialog: seen on television. And I do so with a
dialog: heavy heart. You will be first-hand
text: witness to the slaying of celebrated New
dialog: York City Homicide Detective, Eddie
dialog: Flemming. It would be only normal to
dialog: ask, why? Why are we showing something
dialog: so journalist, I must show it. A
dialog: democracy survives through the freedom
dialog: of its media, and if we cannot see what
dialog: is happening then we don't deserve our
dialog: democracy, or our freedom. Eddie
dialog: Flemming was my friend. I cried when I
dialog: watched this footage and vowed to fight
dialog: this violence with every molecule of my
dialog: being from this day onward. Hopefully,
dialog: this will have a similar effect on you.
dialog: One final word, this material is
dialog: absolutely not appropriate for children.
text: The restaurant BUZZES. Emil checks his watch.
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: In movie they make of us, who do you
dialog: think would act me?
speaker_heading: EMIL
text: The one who got caught in the bathroom.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: George Michael.
text: Emil laughs. Oleg doesn't.
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: I'm serious.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Shut up. Look!
text: Emil points towards the TV. "Top Story" is continuing. The
text: scene cuts to Emil's video footage. Eddie is handcuffed to
text: the chair. The light illuminating his face.
speaker_heading: OLEG (O.S.)
dialog: This is my project. I say 'action.' I
dialog: am the director! You are the talent.
dialog: You wait for me to say 'action.'
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And 'action!'
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Bad last moment - I cut it out.
text: Emil looks at Oleg - furious.
speaker_heading: EMIL (CONT'D)
dialog: I told you to cut that out before we
dialog: handed in the tape!
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: Be quiet. Watch.
text: Oleg watches the big-screen TV as Emil raises the pistol to
text: Eddie's temple. Eddie pushes him over the desk. Eddie then
text: knocks Emil with the chair and Emil falls off the desk onto
text: the floor. Eddie continues around with the chair and drives
text: Oleg back across the room - pinning him to the wall. Eddie
text: and Emil both go for the gun. Eddie knocks him out of the
text: way. Stabs him with the legs of the chair repeatedly.
text: Leaves him in a ball on the floor. Oleg comes at Eddie and
text: he knocks Oleg over the coffee table and onto the sofa. The
text: blinds and lamp shade are shot - bathing the room with more
text: light. Emil stabs Eddie in the stomach. Oleg kneels down
text: for a CLOSE-UP.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Die. Die.
scene_heading: EXT. TIMES SQUARE - CONTINUOUS
text: Hawkins' van drives across Times Square. Jordy's car
text: following. We WIDEN OUT... Eddie's murder is being broadcast
text: on the JUMBOTRON in Times Square. People stare up - stunned.
scene_heading: INT. PLANET HOLLWYOOD - CONTINUOUS
text: The dinner patrons are watching TV. Shocked. Emil glares at
dialog: Oleg.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Why did you leave that stuff in about
dialog: you being the director?
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: Because I am the director. Don't you
dialog: realize, if it wasn't for my film, for
dialog: my talent, my idea to do this - no way
dialog: would we be sitting here right now.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Your idea? I thought it was my idea.
text: Oleg tenses. Emil laughs.
speaker_heading: EMIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Aren't you just the cameraman?
text: Oleg doesn't laugh.
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: I'm serious...this - this is a great
text: American film. Full of violence and
dialog: sex. And I want my credit.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Credit?
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: Yes. Before we hand in the next video -
dialog: I put titles on it and my credit is
text: going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Yes. But there's only one problem - you
dialog: want credit but the problem is - I don't
dialog: share credit.
text: Oleg is pissed.
speaker_heading: EMIL (CONT'D)
dialog: You got that?
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: No, I don't get that!
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: You think you are a director? You are a
dialog: fucking little, small Russian piece of
dialog: shit. And I hate you. I fucking hate
dialog: you.
text: Emil slaps Oleg across the face. Oleg stands up. Emil
text: suddenly pulls out Eddie's gun but before he can pull the
text: trigger, Oleg STABS Emil in the arm! Emil squeezes off a
text: shot through the crowded restaurant. Patrons SCREAM - Oleg
text: runs through the restaurant, escaping. It's chaos.
text: Hawkins arrives with a crew and with BRUCE CUTLER, a
text: confident, tough criminal attorney.
text: Emil pulls the steak knife out of his arm, picks up a napkin -
text: pressing it to his wound.
speaker_heading: EMIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, hello.
text: Cutler accesses the situation.
speaker_heading: EMIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you my attorney?
dialog: (extends his hand to Cutler)
dialog: I'm Emil. I'm insane.
speaker_heading: CUTLER
dialog: I'm not your lawyer until I see the
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Here. I have your money.
text: Emil picks up a briefcase and hands it to Cutler. Cutler
text: opens it - inside is the cash Emil got from Robert Hawkins.
text: Emil looks at the table, pushing the plates and silverware
text: aside. Emil looks under the table, throwing the chair aside,
text: freaking. He's lost the most important thing in his life.
speaker_heading: EMIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh no! No! Shit!
speaker_heading: CUTLER
text: (follows Emil - reaching out to
dialog: him)
dialog: Emil. Take it easy. Stay with me. Sit
dialog: down. What do you need? What are you
dialog: looking for?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: He has the camera! He took the movie!
text: Jordy comes in, gun raised.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Don't move! Don't move! Get your hands
dialog: up! Drop it!
text: Emil puts his hands in the air. Immediately drops the gun!
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: I give up!
text: Jordy is disappointed! He didn't want to take Emil alive.
text: Hawkins signals to his camera man, who swings his camera at
text: Jordy as he approaches Emil, his gun aimed at Emil's head.
speaker_heading: CUTLER
dialog: This man is unarmed, officer. He's
dialog: surrendered.
text: Jordy cracks Emil across the face - knocking him down.
speaker_heading: CUTLER (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you hitting him for?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Turn that camera off!
text: Jordy handcuffs him. Emil turns to the camera for sympathy,
text: appearing more hurt than he is.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: No. Keep filming...
text: Jordy realizes how media savvy Emil is and understands in
text: that moment why he's surrendering. Jordy yanks Emil up -
text: dragging him across the restaurant floor - Emil still
text: favoring his ankle.
speaker_heading: CUTLER
dialog: (to Emil)
dialog: Don't say anything.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: CUTLER
dialog: I'm coming with you.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Yes. Yes, come with me!
speaker_heading: CUTLER
dialog: (to Jordy)
dialog: I'm invoking rights - this man is
dialog: represented by counsel. I'm coming with
dialog: him.
text: The "Top Story" crew is all over them, filming everything.
text: Cutler stays close to Emil. Making sure he's in the video
dialog: footage.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Turn that camera off!
scene_heading: EXT. PLANET HOLLWYOOD - CONTINUOUS
text: As Jordy comes out with a limping Emil, police are arriving.
text: Tommy, Leon and Murphy run over as Jordy opens the back door
text: to his car. Leon grabs Emil.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: I'll take him.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: No way! He's mine!
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: (holding on to Emil, squeezing
dialog: his arm hard)
dialog: We're takin' him. Don't argue!
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: He's my collar!
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Well, he killed my partner!
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: He's yours but I take him in! I'll
dialog: drive him to the precinct, you can have
dialog: him but I'm walkin' him in.
text: Leon realizes Jordy wants to be seen on TV taking Emil into
dialog: custody.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Okay, kid, have your 15-minutes. I'll
dialog: follow you. Tommy, you ride with him!
text: Leon stares hatefully into Emil's eyes.
speaker_heading: LEON (CONT'D)
dialog: You're goin' down, motherfucker, you are
dialog: goin' down. I'll be there with a smile
dialog: when they put you down!
text: Cutler hurries to Emil's side.
speaker_heading: CUTLER
dialog: Don't say a word. Don't respond to his
dialog: taunting!
dialog: (to Leon)
dialog: He's represented by counsel. You want
dialog: to speak to someone - you speak to me!
speaker_heading: TOMMY
text: Out of the way, counselor.
text: Tommy shoves Cutler aside.
speaker_heading: CUTLER
dialog: Don't you put your hands on me,
dialog: Detective.
text: Jordy pushes Emil in the back seat and slams the door. Leon
text: turns to Hawkins, whose cameras are filming everything.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: And you, you'll pay for what you did!
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: (low)
dialog: This footage will work in your favor.
dialog: When the jury sees this - no matter what
dialog: Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
text: Leon looks at him. This man used to be his friend.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: You outta be ashamed. Ashamed of
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: If I didn't put it on somebody else
dialog: would! I was his friend!
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Don't give me that fucking shit.
text: The cameras are rolling.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Don't get into it on TV.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: (yells to other cop cars)
dialog: Alright, let's get going!
text: Leon and the other cops rush to their cars. Jordy is already
text: behind the wheel. As soon as Tommy jumps in the passenger
text: seat, Jordy takes off. The cameras film him driving away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JORDY'S CAR - NIGHT
text: Jordy takes a left turn, racing away. Running all the
dialog: lights.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: What are you doin'? You're gonna lose
dialog: everybody!
text: Jordy rips through another turn, heading toward the West Side
text: Highway. The car speeds up the ramp and races up the left
dialog: lane - having lost the police.
speaker_heading: TOMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Where are you goin'?? This ain't the
dialog: way to the station!
text: Jordy looks up at Emil in the rear view mirror.
scene_heading: EXT. WEST SIDE HIGHWAY EXIT - CONTINUOUS
text: Jordy pulls off on 130th Street. They are way uptown in the
text: middle of nowhere. The car drives down a dark street.
text: Crumbled, vacant buildings dominate the streets and there are
dialog: no people around.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERTED STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: The car slows down. Tommy watches Jordy, realizes what's
text: going on. Jordy stops at a dead end. Pulls open the back
text: door, yanks Emil out and starts to drag him up into the
text: deserted tunnel.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Jordy...??? Listen to me. You can't do
dialog: this. This isn't the way to do things.
text: Jordy ignores Tommy, slamming him up against the tunnel wall.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Were you a fireman? That how you knew
dialog: how to rig the apartment?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: My father was. He gave me many lessons
dialog: about fire. Now it's my friend.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Tommy, take a walk.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: What are you gonna do?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Don't you get it? He knew he was gonna
dialog: get caught! That's why he videotaped
dialog: Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna
dialog: get off.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Don't stoop to his level!
text: Jordy tosses the car keys to Tommy.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Take the car. Get outta here, Tommy.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: (erupting)
text: GET OUTTA HERE NOW!! GET IN THAT CAR
dialog: AND DRIVE AWAY!!! DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL
dialog: KILL YOU, TOO!!!
text: Tommy nervously backs up toward Jordy's car. Climbs behind
text: the wheel and drives away, leaving Jordy and Emil alone in
text: the darkness. Jordy takes out Eddie's pistol. The one Emil
text: took from Eddie. Jordy opens the cylinder - two bullets
text: left. Jordy snaps the cylinder shut, tucks Eddie's gun in
text: Emil's belt. He drags Emil away from the wall, into the
text: center of the empty space - unlocks Emil's handcuffs and
text: throws them aside. Still holding the gun on Emil, he circles
text: around to face him.
speaker_heading: JORDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Get your hands up! Get your hands up!
text: Now facing Emil, he sticks his gun in his waistband - the
dialog: same place he put Emil's.
speaker_heading: JORDY (CONT'D)
dialog: You wanna be a real American? Go for
dialog: your gun.
text: Emil holds his arms out - making it clear he's not going for
dialog: the gun.
speaker_heading: JORDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Pull the gun! You want to be famous?
dialog: Shoot me, you'll get more headlines and
dialog: make more money.
text: Emil watches Jordy...a slow grin spreads across his face.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: You can't kill me. You're not a cop.
dialog: Just fireman with a gun. I bet you
dialog: never shot anybody in your life.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: You'll be my first.
text: Jordy pulls out his 9mm and pushes the barrel right between
text: Emil's eyes.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: C'mon. Pull the trigger. Do it. Oh,
dialog: look, you're sweating. You don't have
dialog: the balls.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Get down on your knees.
text: Emil gets on his knees and starts to sing in Czech. SIRENS
text: fill the air. Police cars come flying down the street.
speaker_heading: JORDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Where's your partner?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: The Sheraton! On Broadway! Room 210.
dialog: Go get Oleg. He'll kill you.
text: Leon runs up. Tommy's relieved to see Jordy didn't kill
dialog: Emil.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Gimme your gun, Jordy. We all want him
dialog: dead but you can't do it this way.
text: Emil is still smiling. Jordy suddenly slams Emil in the
text: face. Knocking him to the floor. He jumps in his car and
text: speeds away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BROADWAY SHERATON - 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: A room service WAITER wheels a tray with a magnum bottle of

speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Do you really need me?
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Keep your mouth shut. Don't mess this

speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: R-room service.
text: A HOOKER, wrapped in a towel, opens the door a crack, looking
text: out at the waiter.
speaker_heading: HOOKER
dialog: Come in.
text: Jordy whips around the corner - pointing his gun and pushing
text: the hooker back out of the room. Jordy moves to the bedroom
text: door. Peers through the crack. Oleg sits on the edge of the
text: bed in his skivvies with two naked prostitutes. He's hooked
text: up his videocamera to the TV set and is showing them his
text: footage of the fire.
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: Look at that. See that shot! Seamless.
dialog: No cuts.
dialog: (excited)

dialog: That's filmmaking!! Isn't it great?!
text: Jordy KICKS in the door - gun raised.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Don't move!

speaker_heading: JORDY (CONT'D)

text: cars braking to a stop. One SLAMS into another.
text: Jordy leaps over a car, closing in on Oleg. People gawk.
text: Even in New York, it's odd to see a man being chased in his
text: underwear. Oleg runs, knocking people aside. He's holding
text: the camera in his hand. It's on.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: STOP! STOP THAT MAN!
text: A UNIFORMED COP turns as Oleg runs right into him. Knocking

dialog: Shoot him! SHOOT!
text: A GUNSHOT! Jordy ducks! Another GUNSHOT! Jordy realizes
text: the shots are coming from the screen.
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: Look! Over here!
text: Jordy turns. Oleg stands up and FIRES at him - trying to
text: film Jordy's death with a videocamera.
text: Jordy ducks, then rises up with his gun as Oleg vaults over
text: the seats, leaping from one to the other, mashing shoulders
text: and heads, bounding for the screen.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Everybody down! Stay DOWN!
text: Jordy FIRES as the screen villain blasts away. Some in the
text: audience don't realize the real thing is happening. Oleg
text: leaps on the stage in front of the screen, illuminated by it.
text: Jordy runs down the aisle. Oleg FIRES at Jordy. Jordy FIRES
text: back. People panic - scurrying away - Jordy can't get a
text: clear shot. Oleg FIRES again, wounding a moviegoer. Jordy

text: Emil's mouth and lights it for him. Emil has never smoked
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: CUTLER (CONT'D)
dialog: How're they treating you, alright
dialog: (Emil is nonresponsive)
dialog: I want to get the cuffs off... but
dialog: there's a little bit of a problem.
dialog: Things out there are very negative right
dialog: now for us. We gotta change that
dialog: around. Perception is very, very
dialog: important. Perception is reality. I
dialog: know you're not fuckin' crazy. But it's
dialog: important that I get that message out.
dialog: Cause that's our only defense in this
dialog: case.
text: Emil leans forward. Cutler retrieves the cigarette from
text: between his lips.
speaker_heading: CUTLER (CONT'D)
dialog: I want you to focus on three things:
dialog: fear...
text: He puts the cigarette back in Emil's mouth.
speaker_heading: CUTLER (CONT'D)
dialog: ...delusions and paranoia.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: I was all of these.
speaker_heading: CUTLER
dialog: Well, you didn't appreciate the severity
dialog: of it until recently. No question about
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: What about Oleg?
speaker_heading: CUTLER
dialog: Disappeared. They're looking
dialog: everywhere. Maybe he went back to
dialog: Czechoslovakia.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: No, he is here. Shit...
speaker_heading: CUTLER
dialog: Don't worry about him. Think about
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: What about my movie rights? Book
dialog: rights?
speaker_heading: CUTLER
dialog: Look, I haven't really focused on that
dialog: kind of thing.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: What's your cut? How much?
speaker_heading: CUTLER
dialog: I would say...half. Half is fair.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: No. No way.
speaker_heading: CUTLER
dialog: But it's...
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Thirty-percent. No more. Or I call
dialog: another lawyer. This is the biggest
dialog: case of your life. Don't try to
dialog: negotiate. Thirty percent. Say yes or
dialog: no.
speaker_heading: CUTLER
dialog: This is not about money, Emil. I need
dialog: your trust in me.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: What else do you need?
speaker_heading: CUTLER
dialog: I need to know about your background. I
dialog: need to know about your upbringing. Why
dialog: you're here.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: (indicating cigarette)
dialog: Give me another one, please.
text: Cutler stuffs another cigarette in Emil's mouth. Lights it.
speaker_heading: CUTLER
dialog: Tell me about yourself. What you did as
dialog: a young boy... what your parents were
dialog: like.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: My father always degraded me. Killed my
dialog: self-esteem. And my mother was blind.
speaker_heading: CUTLER
dialog: Your mother was blind?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me.
dialog: She went to fucking black market doctor
dialog: to induce me.
speaker_heading: CUTLER
dialog: Back in the Czech Republic?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad
dialog: drugs which made her go blind. And my
dialog: father blamed me for her blindness...
speaker_heading: CUTLER
dialog: Your father blamed you for your mother's
dialog: blindness?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Yeah, he hated me from day when I was
dialog: born. Put it out. Can you put the
dialog: cigarette out?
text: Cutler takes the cigarette from Emil's lips and extinguishes
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: EMIL (CONT'D)
dialog: That's what he did to me. He put
dialog: cigarettes out on me.
speaker_heading: CUTLER
dialog: Your father put cigarettes out on you?
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Out on my back when I was a small boy.
speaker_heading: CUTLER
dialog: Can I see your back?
text: Emil rises. Cutler comes around and pulls his shirt up. HIS
text: ENTIRE BACK IS COVERED WITH DISGUSTING PURPLISH WELTS FROM
text: CIGARETTE BURNS. Cutler recoils - horrified.
speaker_heading: CUTLER (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, Jesus.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: I'm abused. Don't you think?
speaker_heading: CUTLER
dialog: I don't think it's abuse, I think it's
dialog: torture.

text: subpoena in his hand.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: The public doesn't have any idea what we
dialog: do and now you're going to define our
dialog: image! This is going to be our Rodney
dialog: King!
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: What was I supposed to do? The guy
dialog: tried to mug me. I was gonna send a cop
dialog: back - I just forgot.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Forgot? You handcuffed a civilian to a
dialog: tree?!
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Chief - I know I screwed up - but this
dialog: guy was no innocent civilian.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Well this is gonna end your career and
dialog: probably mine.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: End my career?
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: How are you going to fight this? Maybe
dialog: if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd
dialog: been on the front page, as a hero, this
dialog: thing would be easier to fight. You'd
dialog: have the good to weight against the bad!
dialog: It's unfortunate that I have to make
dialog: decisions based upon your press coverage
dialog: but there's nothing I can do! Gimme
dialog: your shield.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: But Chief? Over this??
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: There's nothing to talk about. Get a
dialog: good lawyer. You're suspended until
dialog: your trial.
text: Jordy sighs. Dying inside. He surrenders his shield. Drops
text: his handcuffs, his pager and his gun. Duffy picks up the gun
text: - looks at it.
speaker_heading: DUFFY (CONT'D)
dialog: (pats Jordy's shoulder)
dialog: I know you got backup at home. Drop it
dialog: off.
text: Jordy sighs and exits.
scene_heading: INT. IMMIGRATION &amp; NATURALIZATION OFFICE - DAY
text: Jordy is talking to BILL STERN, a senior special agent. In
text: another office we see Daphne with two 25-year old ASSISTANT
scene_heading: U.S. ATTORNEYS.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: (to Jordy)
dialog: Look, what don't you understand? We've
dialog: got a good relationship with the Czech's
dialog: and the State Department doesn't want to
dialog: cause an incident.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: But the D.A. needs her as an eyewitness!
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: They've got her testimony on videotape.
dialog: And even if they do take her to court
dialog: immediately after she'll be extradited.
dialog: The Czechs want her back. She shot a
dialog: cop! I mean, Christ, man, what if Emil
dialog: Slovak and Oleg Razgul fled to the Czech
dialog: Republic? How would you feel if the
dialog: Czechs wouldn't give them back to us?!
text: Stern looks over at Daphne sitting in another office. Lowers
text: his voice.
speaker_heading: STERN (CONT'D)
dialog: And just between us...I was married to a
dialog: redhead. They're a jinx. Redheads are
dialog: like cross-eyed priests. Stay away from
dialog: both.
text: Jordy gives him a look.
speaker_heading: STERN (CONT'D)
dialog: You want to see her - go ahead.
text: Jordy enters the other office. Sits next to Daphne. The
text: assistant U.S. Attorneys leave.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: We're gonna fight the extradition.
text: Daphne takes Jordy's bandaged hand in hers.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: Forget about me. You have enough
dialog: problems of your own.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: ...Do you really want me to forget about
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: I don't want to drag you down with me.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Daphne, I...
text: Daphne touches her finger to his lips.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: Shhhh.
text: She leans in and kisses him. Then looks into his eyes,

scene_heading: EXT. FEDERAL COURT HOUSE STEPS - DAY
text: It's weeks later. Nicolette is looking worn, tired,
text: frazzled. She's trying to go through her stand up. But
text: she's unraveling. Not recovered from the loss of Eddie.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: ...and today with his partner who he
dialog: blamed for the crimes still at large,
dialog: Emil Slovak will appear in court. His
dialog: lawyer will argue that he is mentally
text: unfit to stand trial. Eyewitness News

dialog: of...Zwangen...Zwagen...
speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: NICOLETTE

text: She starts over.
scene_heading: INT. JORDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Jordy's on the couch. A drink in his hand, watching TV with
text: his dog, ZACK. Jordy's eyes are glazed. He's drunk, his
text: eyes are as bloodshot as Eddie's were...without his job or
dialog: Daphne.
text: His mind miles away - the dog and drink are his only comfort.
text: As Nicolette reports (she got the name right), her anger
text: seeps through her broadcast.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE (ON T.V.)
dialog: Mr. Zwangendaba claims to be a direct
dialog: descendent of the African King from whom
dialog: he takes his name...
text: Jordy's face is flashed on screen. The phone RINGS. Jordy
text: picks up.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Hello?
dialog: (listens)
dialog: No comment.
text: He hangs up. The phone RINGS AGAIN.
speaker_heading: JORDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello?
dialog: (listens)
dialog: No!
text: Jordy hangs up. Changes the channel. He stops as Robert
text: Hawkins' face fills the screen. He is standing across from
text: someone - in a park - interviewing him.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS (ON T.V.)
dialog: He robbed you?
text: The ANGLE CUTS to Zwangendaba, the mugger, now dressed in a
text: suit and tie. Clean shaven and with a fresh haircut. He
text: stands in the same spot where Jordy handcuffed him to the
text: tree. He's appearing on "Top Story".
speaker_heading: ZWANGENDABA (ON T.V.)
dialog: That's right, I encountered him right
dialog: here. I was just askin' for change an'
text: he whips out his big gun an' pushes me
text: up against that tree, whereupon he takes
dialog: my money and handcuffs me to it, leavin'
dialog: me there all exposed...
text: The phone RINGS again. Jordy suddenly pulls the phone off
text: the table and throws it through the window:
speaker_heading: BACK TO TV
text: as the channel is changed. A REPORTER is on TV. Behind him
text: is a picture of Emil. Emil is smiling, in a shirt and tie.
text: The reporter stands in front of the jail.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: ...and WBAI has learned that Mr. Slovak
dialog: won't have to worry about how he is
text: going to pay for his defense. He has
dialog: received movie offers and been in
dialog: conversations with numerous publishers
dialog: concerning the rights to his life story.
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: Oleg is at a bar watching TV. Poisoned with envy.
scene_heading: INT. JORDY'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING
text: Jordy stands in front of the mirror over the dresser. We see
text: the TV overturned in the b.g. His back up gun is on it. He
text: stares at it. Dark thoughts dancing in his head.
scene_heading: EXT. BATTERY PARK - DAY
text: Jordy sits in a taxi, wearing sunglasses. Looking inside the
text: park where a POLICE BARRICADE surrounds a POLICE TUGBOAT.
text: Cutler and Emil are arriving - Emil is being transferred to
text: Rykers Island. Jordy pulls his .38 out of his ankle holster
text: and sticks it in his pocket.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON METER
text: to $42.00. The TAXI DRIVER looks in the rearview mirror.
speaker_heading: TAXI DRIVER
dialog: I can't believe this guy got off.
dialog: Unbelievable.
dialog: Jordy takes out money. All he's got is fifty bucks and he
text: crams it into the slot.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Whatever's leftover, keep.
text: Jordy exits the cab. The anger rising inside his body is
text: coming to a boiling point. He walks into the park. Leon is
text: sitting on a bench. Just sitting there. Also filled with
text: rage and frustration. Jordy meets his eyes. Leon gets up
text: and walks away. Disgusted by it all. Jordy's right hand
text: grips the gun inside his pocket as he walks on.
speaker_heading: HIGH WIDE SHOT
text: Many policemen are trying to control a swarm of reporters.
text: All are waiting for Emil. WE SEE:
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
text: and his camera crew, and, not far from him - frustrated and
text: frazzled, waits Nicolette. Still grieving her loss, she
text: looks over at Hawkins and his crew. She shoots him a
text: disgusted look - Hawkins shrugs it off. He checks his watch -
text: anxious - looks at his cameraman.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: He said he'd be here. Pick him up as he
dialog: comes through the crowd. Do you hear
dialog: me? For Chrissakes don't miss this.
text: THE POLICE VAN PULLS UP
text: Cutler's car behind it. Emil - handcuffed - is unloaded from
text: the van. Reporters swarm forward - Cutler gets out of his
text: car, hurrying up, taking his place alongside Emil and the
text: POLICE ESCORTS. The swarm follows - firing questions at
text: Cutler. He answers the barrage of questions with:
speaker_heading: CUTLER
dialog: ...my client was suffering from a major
dialog: illness of schizophrenic nature wherein
dialog: during times of intense stress, as a
text: result of paranoid and psychotic
dialog: delusions - there was impairment of his
dialog: ability to appreciate wrongfullness...
dialog: This is a victory for the mentally ill!
text: Jordy walks alongside the moving mass. His eyes focused on
text: Emil - his hand in his pocket. We notice in the crowd Max,
text: the celebrity-crazed pyromaniac. What's he doing here?
text: Max's hand is also stuck deeply in his pocket. A weird gleam
text: in his eye. We see Korfin in the group, speaking to other
text: cops. Nicolette and her camera crew are vying for their
text: place in the mass. She watches Emil with quiet rage. Cutler
dialog: continues:
speaker_heading: CUTLER (CONT'D)
text: ...before Emil boards the police boat
text: and heads for Rykers Island where he
dialog: will be checked into the psyche ward, I
dialog: want to say one last word to you all...
dialog: As you know, Emil was coerced by Oleg
dialog: Razgul into committing these murders,
text: yet Oleg is still out in the street, a
dialog: free man, filming gruesome murders... My
dialog: client and I hope he is brought to
dialog: justice in the near future.
text: They are through the monuments, approaching the steps when
text: Jordy passes a distracted Hawkins - who's checking his watch
text: obsessively.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: Where the hell is he? Goddamn it?!
text: Jordy glares at Emil. Emil looks back at Jordy, gloating.
text: Smiles. He won. He beat the system. Jordy suddenly erupts.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: You think this is funny?? What the hell
dialog: are you laughing at?
text: Emil stares down Jordy. Jordy grips the gun inside the
dialog: jacket.
speaker_heading: CUTLER
dialog: (to a nearby escort)
dialog: Officer, keep this man back, he's
dialog: assaulted my client on previous
dialog: occasions.
text: A PATROLMAN blocks Jordy from Emil.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: This is it? This bastard kills the best
dialog: cop this city ever had and we do
dialog: nothing?
speaker_heading: CUTLER
dialog: You may not like it marshal, but that's
dialog: the law.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: And what about the other victims?? What
dialog: about their families? He'll end up in
dialog: some country club nuthouse while his
dialog: lawyer sells his rights to the movies
dialog: and we just stand here and do nothing?
dialog: We let this scumbag walk?
text: Jordy moves past the officer. Emil breaks away from Cutler.
text: Gets in Jordy's face. Laughs quietly.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Be careful. I can kill you. I'm
dialog: insane.
text: Jordy shoves Emil into Cutler. A scuffle breaks out as the
text: cops separate the two - pulling Jordy back as we cut to:
speaker_heading: A VIDEO POV
text: as it approaches Hawkins from behind. A hand dips into frame
text: tapping Hawkins on the shoulder. Hawkins turns - sees who
text: he's been waiting for. His face lights up.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: I thought you wouldn't show up. Where
dialog: is it? Where is the tape?
speaker_heading: IT'S OLEG
text: In disguise - sunglasses and a hat. Holding his videocamera.
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: It's all in here. All in here.
scene_heading: MEANWHILE JORDY
text: has been separated from Cutler and Emil as Hawkins' voice
text: cuts above the din of the crowd, announcing excitedly:
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
dialog: Wait a minute, Bruce! We've got some
dialog: interesting evidence, something you
dialog: should look at!
text: Reporters turn as Hawkins speaks. His crew is taping as he
text: continues introducing his broadcast:
speaker_heading: HAWKINS (CONT'D)
dialog: I have exclusive rights to the ORIGINAL
text: UNCUT videotape shot by Oleg Razgul,
dialog: proving Emil Slovak was not insane!
dialog: Hard to believe...watch!
text: Reporters swing their cameras over as Oleg holds his
text: videocamera up in the air.
speaker_heading: OLEG (ON VIDEO)
dialog: He knew exactly what he was doing - all
dialog: of this was planned! It's all here in
dialog: my movie. Emil is not insane. Look.
dialog: Look!
text: Oleg PLAYS his videocamera as lenses focus, we see excerpts
text: of the moment where Emil explains to Eddie:
speaker_heading: EMIL (ON VIDEO)
dialog: ...so we kill someone famous and if we
dialog: are caught, we are sent to mental
dialog: hospital...
speaker_heading: CUTLER
dialog: (points to Oleg)
dialog: Officers, there's your killer, do your
dialog: duty, arrest him!
text: The police are attempting to get to Oleg, but a sea of
text: reporters separate them. We hear the staccato calls from the
text: press corps. Nicolette looks on in amazed outrage. Jordy
text: notices and starts moving towards her. Before the POLICE
text: CAPTAIN in charge of the detail can react, the rage which
text: killed Milos, Tamina and Honey wells up inside Emil. He
dialog: yells at Oleg!
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Traitor!!
speaker_heading: OLEG
dialog: No. You are the traitor. You are
dialog: murderer. I am director. Action!
text: Oleg pulls his gun. Emil pulls Cutler in front of him as:
dialog: BANG!
text: Oleg FIRES! Cutler is SHOT and goes down. Hawkins swings
text: his camera over to Oleg - filming the would-be assassin.
text: Oleg FIRES off another SHOT - hitting the COURT OFFICER
text: escorting Emil. Emil grabs the down officer's gun. He
text: swivels - rapid fires at Oleg. Oleg topples. People are
text: screaming. It's CHAOS.
text: Emil darts forward - grabbing Nicolette who is closes to him.
text: He puts his handcuffed arms over her head - points the gun at
text: her head.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Drop the gun! DON'T SHOOT!
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: I'll kill her! Back off! Everyone back
dialog: away from me!
text: We hear Jordy's voice above Emil.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Let her go. Let her fucking go!!
text: The captain is screaming at all his men.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: No one shoot! Lower your weapons! Do
dialog: not fire! No officer will fire his
dialog: weapon unless I say so!
dialog: (to Emil)
dialog: Let the woman go!
text: Cops reluctantly lower their weapons. But Jordy is still
text: aiming his gun at Emil. He is the only one who hasn't
text: lowered his gun. The captain is yelling at him.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Holster your weapons! Back away. That
dialog: is an order! No officers will fire!
text: Emil is screaming back at the captain as Jordy screams at
dialog: Emil.
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Tell him to put his gun down!
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Let her go! Let her go!!
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking
dialog: kill her.
text: Jordy doesn't lower his gun. Emil tries to back away. The
text: reporters - who have ducked and covered - are still keeping
dialog: their lenses pointed at the scene. This is great film!
text: Jordy follows after Emil - his gun raised.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Let her go.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Shoot! Shoot him!!
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Shut up!
text: Meanwhile, the captain is still yelling:
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: No on shoot! No one shoot!! No officer
dialog: will follow. No officer will shoot!
text: Nicolette is still encouraging Jordy.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Shoot! Shoot! Shoot him!!
speaker_heading: EMIL
dialog: Shut up!
text: Everyone is screaming at once. It's mass chaos. The captain
text: is trying to keep everyone calm. Cops following along with
text: their weapons lowered. All except Jordy - his gun still
dialog: pointed at Emil.
text: Hawkins can't believe what footage he's getting. He's
text: pushing his cameraman to the front of the pack. Trying to
dialog: get the best coverage.
speaker_heading: EMIL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll surrender!! I'll surrender if he
text: lowers his gun.
text: He's pointing at Jordy but he's continuing to back away
text: towards the police boat.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Don't. Don't let him surrender. Shoot
dialog: him!
text: Jordy won't take his gun off him.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: Let her go. Let her go.
text: The captain is yelling at Jordy.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Lower your weapon. I told you - lower
dialog: your weapon!
text: Jordy struggles to get a clean shot at Emil. He can't. His
text: heart pounding. Adrenaline pumping. He suddenly lowers his
text: weapon. Turns away. The captain visibly relaxes. Emil
text: laughs. Jordy suddenly turns back. Quickly raises his
dialog: weapon.
speaker_heading: JORDY SHOOTS
text: Emil takes a shot in the leg. Nicolette ducks under the
text: handcuffs and scurries away. Emil looks at Jordy - surprised
text: he shot him. Jordy FIRES AGAIN. Emil is hit in the
text: shoulder. Jordy marches forward, EMPTYING HIS CLIP in Emil's
text: chest. Abdomen. Head. Gun fire echoes in the humid air as
text: Emil stumbles back. Does a funny dance and drops to the
text: ground. Dead. The captain yells.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
dialog: I told you not to shoot! No officers
dialog: should shoot.
text: Jordy quietly answers:
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: I'm not a cop. I'm a fire marshal.
speaker_heading: HAWKINS
text: He's still alive.
text: Hawkins looks down at Oleg. He is sprawled on the ground.
text: His videocamera in hand - he's still making the movie.
speaker_heading: OLEG'S VIDEO POV
text: as it ZOOMS from the Statue of Liberty and PANS to Oleg. He
text: looks in the lens with his dying eyes, gasps:
speaker_heading: OLEG
text: A film...by Oleg Razgul.
text: And Oleg dies but suddenly his eyes pop WIDE OPEN. Hawkins
text: jumps back, Oleg smiles, coughing in pain.
speaker_heading: OLEG (CONT'D)
dialog: How was that?
text: Oleg's head rolls to one side. Now dead. Nicolette runs
text: over to Jordy. Composing herself. Coming together. Glad
text: Emil is dead. Jordy starts to walk away.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Wait a minute. Where are you going?
dialog: Learn from Eddie. Talk to the court of
dialog: public opinion. Take the credit, you
dialog: need it.
text: She turns him around. Straightens his tie. Starts to push
text: the hair out of his face but he stops her hand.
speaker_heading: JORDY
dialog: No thanks.
text: Jordy puts something in her hand. She looks down. It's
text: EDDIE'S BADGE. The one Jordy took out of Daphne's bathroom.
text: She looks up at him. Her cameraman rolling. The lens
text: pointed at Jordy. Jordy looks at Nicolette. Meets her eyes.
text: He doesn't want to make a statement. He still doesn't want
text: the fame. He did learn from Eddie. Eddie was killed because
dialog: he was a celebrity. Jordy wants no part of it.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Cut.
text: Her cameraman lowers his leans. Jordy smiles. She nods.
text: Jordy turns and walks away.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Get a shot of him leaving. Then pan to
dialog: me.
text: Jordy disappears into the sea of people. The camera PANS
text: back to Nicolette.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, he wouldn't talk to us, but you
dialog: saw it.
text: The CAMERA PULLS BACK from Nicolette's face and the video is
dialog: now on:
scene_heading: THE JUMBOTRON IN TIMES SQUARE
text: We PULL BACK FURTHER and FURTHER. Nicolette finishing her
dialog: stand up:
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
dialog: New York City has a new hero, Fire

dialog: Marshal Warsaw's heroic actions this
