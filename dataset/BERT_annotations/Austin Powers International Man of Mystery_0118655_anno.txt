speaker_heading: VANESSA

speaker_heading: VANESSA

speaker_heading: VANESSA

speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Do I make you horny?
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN

speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger&amp;emdash
dialog: that's what I do, I swing.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: I understand that, Mr. Powers, but
dialog: let me be perfectly clear with you,
dialog: perhaps to the point of being
dialog: insulting. I will never have sex
dialog: with you, ever. If you were the
dialog: last man on Earth and I was the last

dialog: gone perfectly to plan except for
dialog: one small flaw. Because of a

dialog: not frozen. I was therefore by
dialog: definition only partially frozen.
text: ANGLE ON EVIL ASSOCIATE MUSTAFA. He is terrified and sweaty,
text: eyes darting left and right.
speaker_heading: MUSTAFA
dialog: But my design was perfect! Your
dialog: autonomic functions were shut down,
dialog: and even though your arm wasn't
dialog: frozen, the aging was retarded,
dialog: therefore your right arm is only
text: slightly older than the left.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Can't you see I'm only half a man?
dialog: Look at me, I'm a freak!

scene_heading: ANGLE ON MR. BIGGLESWORTH

dialog: Yes, they're always after me lucky
dialog: charms!
text: Everyone in the room tries to keep a straight face.
speaker_heading: PATTY O'BRIEN
dialog: What? What? Why does everyone always

speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
dialog: Over the last thirty years, Virtucon
text: has grown by leaps and bounds. About
dialog: fifteen years ago, we changed from
dialog: volatile chemicals to the
dialog: communication industry. We own cable
dialog: companies in thirty-eight states.
text: The thirty-eight states illuminate on the map.
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO

dialog: (holds up plate)
dialog: Some plates, like the Gone With The
dialog: Wind series, have gone up in value
dialog: as much as two-hundred and forty
dialog: percent, but, as with any investment,
dialog: there is some risk involved.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called
dialog: blackmail. The Royal Family of
dialog: Britain are the wealthiest landowners
dialog: in the world. Either the Royal Family
dialog: pays us an exorbitant amount of money,
dialog: or we make it look like Prince
text: Charles, the heir to the throne, has
dialog: had an affair outside of marriage
dialog: and, therefore, they would have to
dialog: divorce.
text: There is an uncomfortable silence.
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
dialog: Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did
dialog: have an affair. He admitted it, and
dialog: they are now divorced, actually.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: People have to tell me these things.
dialog: I've been frozen for thirty years,
dialog: throw me a bone here.
dialog: (pausing)
dialog: OK, no problem. Here's my second
dialog: plan. Back in the Sixties I had a
dialog: weather changing machine that was in
dialog: essence a sophisticated heat beam
dialog: which we called a "laser." Using
dialog: this laser, we punch a hole in the
dialog: protective layer around
text: the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer." Slowly
text: but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the
dialog: risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a
dialog: hefty ransom.
text: There is another uncomfortable silence.
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
dialog: Umm, that also has already happened.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Right.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Oh, hell, let's just do what we always
dialog: do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons
dialog: and hold the world hostage.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Gentlemen, it's come to my attention
dialog: that a breakaway Russian Republic
dialog: called Kreplachistan will be
dialog: transferring a nuclear warhead to
dialog: the United Nations in a few days.
dialog: Here's the plan. We get the warhead,
dialog: and we hold the world ransom...
dialog: (dramatic pause)
dialog: ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
text: There is an uncomfortable pause.
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
dialog: Don't you think we should ask for
dialog: more than a million dollars? A
dialog: million dollars isn't that much money
dialog: these days.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: All right then...
dialog: (dramatic pause)
dialog: ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
text: There is another uncomfortable pause.
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
dialog: Virtucon alone makes over nine billion
dialog: dollars a year.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: (pleasantly surprised)
dialog: Oh, really?
dialog: (slightly irritated)
dialog: One-hundred billion dollars.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: OK, make it happen. Anything else?
speaker_heading: FRAU FARBISSINA
dialog: Remember when we froze your semen,
dialog: you said that if it looked like you
dialog: weren't coming back to try and make
dialog: you a son so that a part of you would
dialog: live forever?
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: FRAU FARBISSINA
dialog: Well, after a few years, we got sort
dialog: of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you
dialog: to meet your son.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: My son?
speaker_heading: FRAU FARBISSINA
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Scott!
text: SCOTT EVIL walks out. He is fifteen, grungy, and wears a

speaker_heading: SCOTT EVIL
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr.
dialog: Evil.

speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: So, shall we shag now, or shall we

speaker_heading: VANESSA

speaker_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION

speaker_heading: AUSTIN

speaker_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION

dialog: Carnies.
speaker_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Circus folk.

dialog: Nomads, you know. They smell like

speaker_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION
dialog: (suffering him)
dialog: Indeed...If we could get back to the
dialog: business at hand. It's one thing to
dialog: have a warhead, it's quite another
dialog: thing to have the missiles to launch

speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Maybe these photographs are the last

dialog: (hands him the photos)
dialog: I've uncovered the details on Project

speaker_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION

dialog: We've long feared such a development.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: When did you find that out, Austin?
speaker_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION
dialog: Austin did some reconnaissance work
text: at Alotta Fagina's penthouse last
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: BASIL EXPOSITON
dialog: Our next move is to infiltrate

speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Yes, Virtucon runs a tour of their

speaker_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION

speaker_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION
dialog: Austin, this is my mother, Mrs.

dialog: in Kent. Can you believe, she's ninety-two years old?
text: Austin hauls off and PUNCHES the lady in the face.
speaker_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION
dialog: My God, Austin, what have you done?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: That's not your mother, that's a
dialog: man!
text: Austin begins tugging on her hair.
scene_heading: MRS. EXPOSITION
dialog: Owww...my hair!
speaker_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION
dialog: Get away from my mother!
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Austin, have you gone mad?
text: The two guards come over and help Mrs. Exposition to a cot.
scene_heading: MRS. EXPOSITION
dialog: (through pain)
dialog: Who is that man? Why did he hit me?
speaker_heading: BASIL EXPOSIION
dialog: Don't worry, mother. Lie down.
dialog: Austin, you have a lot of explaining
dialog: to do.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was
dialog: a man.
speaker_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION
dialog: Damn it, man! You're talking about
dialog: my mother!
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: You must admit, she is rather mannish.
dialog: No offense, but if that's a woman,
text: it looks like she's been beaten with
text: an ugly stick.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Really, Austin!
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Look at her hands, baby! Those are
text: carpenter's hands.
speaker_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION
dialog: All right, Austin, I think you should
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: I think if everyone were honest,

speaker_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION
dialog: I'm leaving!

speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Yes, Basil?

speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Austin, may I have a word with you?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Of course, luv.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Listen, I know I'm just being
dialog: neurotic, but I can't shake this
dialog: suspicious
dialog: feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I
dialog: don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad
dialog: relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues.
dialog: You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to
dialog: give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this
dialog: weird, irrational, unfocused...well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Don't be sorry. You're right to be
dialog: suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged
dialog: her rotten.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: I can't believe you made love to her
dialog: just like that. Did you use
dialog: protection?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Of course, I had my nine-millimeter
dialog: automatic.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: No, did you use a condom?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Only sailors use condoms, man.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Not in the Nineties.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Well they should, filthy beggars,
dialog: they go from port to port. Alotta
dialog: meant nothing to me.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Well, it means something to me. If
dialog: you want us to have a relationship,
dialog: you've got to be a one-woman man.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're
dialog: everything to me.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: You just don't get it, do you, Austin?

speaker_heading: SCOTT EVIL
dialog: OK. Well, I just really met my Dad

speaker_heading: SCOTT EVIL

speaker_heading: DR. EVIL

speaker_heading: SCOTT EVIL
dialog: No. Maybe, like, work in a petting

speaker_heading: DR. EVIL

speaker_heading: SCOTT EVIL
dialog: No, he's really evil.
speaker_heading: THERAPIST
dialog: Scott.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: No, the boy's right. I really am

speaker_heading: THERAPIST
dialog: Don't be so hard on yourself. You're

speaker_heading: SCOTT EVIL
dialog: I just think, like, he hates me. I

speaker_heading: THERAPIST

speaker_heading: The group LAUGHS.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL

speaker_heading: GROUP

speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Very well, where should I begin? My
dialog: father was a relentlessly self-
dialog: improving boulangerie owner from
dialog: Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy
dialog: and a penchant for buggery. My mother
dialog: was a fifteen-year-old French
dialog: prostitute named Chloe with webbed
dialog: feet. My father would womanize, he
dialog: would drink, he would make outrageous
dialog: claims, like he invented the question
dialog: mark. Sometimes he would accuse
text: chestnuts of being lazy. A sort of
dialog: general malaise that only the genius
dialog: possess and the insane lament. My
dialog: childhood was typical.
dialog: Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make
dialog: meat helmets. If I was insolent, I was placed in a burlap
text: bag and beaten with reeds. Pretty standard, really. At the
dialog: age of twelve I received my first scribe. At the
text: age of fifteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically
dialog: shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shawn
dialog: scrotum. At the age of eighteen, I went off to evil medical
dialog: school. From there...

speaker_heading: DR. EVIL

speaker_heading: SCOTT EVIL
dialog: But what if he escapes? Why don't
dialog: you just shoot him? What are you

speaker_heading: DR. EVIL

speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Dr. Evil, do you really expect them

speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to

dialog: magma.
dialog: (to guard)
dialog: All right, guard, begin the

speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Release the sharks!

dialog: Dr. Evil?
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Yes, what is it? You're interrupting
dialog: my moment of triumph.
speaker_heading: FRAU FARBISSINA
dialog: It's about the sharks. Since you
dialog: were frozen, they've been placed on
dialog: the Endangered Species List. We
dialog: tried to get some, but it will take
text: months to clear up the red tape.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: Right.
dialog: (to Austin)
dialog: Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you
text: in a tank of piranhas with laser
text: beams attached to their heads.
text: Frau clears her throat again.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: What is it now?
speaker_heading: FRAU FARBISSINA
dialog: Well, we experimented with lasers,
dialog: but you would be surprised at how
dialog: heavy they are. They actually
dialog: outweighed the piranha themselves,
dialog: and the fish, well, they sank to the
dialog: bottom and died.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: I have one simple request&amp;emdash
text: sharks with friggin' laser beams
dialog: attached to their heads, and it can't
dialog: be done? Remind me again why I pay
dialog: you people?
dialog: What do we have?
speaker_heading: FRAU FARBISSINA
dialog: Sea bass.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: FRAU FARBISSINA
dialog: They're mutated sea bass.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Really? Are they ill-tempered?
speaker_heading: FRAU FARBISSINA
dialog: Please allow me to demonstrate.
text: Frau Farbissina throws a leg of lamb attached to a rope
text: towards the tank, where the WATER BUBBLES and sea bass arch
text: through the air. The sea bass devour the lamb. She pulls
text: the rope back. The lamb has been eaten to the bare bone.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-
dialog: tempered sea bass it is.
dialog: (to the room)
dialog: Come, let's return to dinner. Close
dialog: the tank.
speaker_heading: SCOTT EVIL
dialog: Aren't you going to watch them?
dialog: They'll get away!
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: No, we'll leave them alone and not
text: actually witness them dying, and
dialog: we'll just assume it all went to
dialog: plan.
speaker_heading: SCOTT EVIL
dialog: I have a gun in my room. Give me
dialog: five seconds, I'll come back and
dialog: blow their brains out.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: No Scott. You just don't get it, do
dialog: you?
text: Dr. Evil presses a button; the wall closes back over the

scene_heading: INT. TANK AREA
text: Austin and Vanessa slowly descend towards the water. They
text: can see the WATER BUBBLING beneath them.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: What's your plan?
text: Just then, a SEA BASS jumps out of the water, just missing
dialog: Austin.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: First, I plan to soil myself. Then,
dialog: I plan to regroup and think about
dialog: the next move. Any thoughts?
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep
dialog: this on me just in case.
text: She pulls out a container of dental floss.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: All right, I get it. I have bad
dialog: teeth. You have to understand, in
dialog: Britain in the Sixties you could be
text: a sex symbol and still have bad teeth.
dialog: It didn't matter.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: No, no, no. We'll use the floss to
dialog: get to the ledge.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Smashing idea! Give it to me.
text: Austin takes the container and draws out four feet of dental
text: floss and spins the container above his head like a bolo.
text: He throws it and it wraps around a RADIATOR and it catches
text: like a grappling hook.
text: Austin begins drawing out the floss to take up the slack.
text: Meanwhile, the slow-dipping mechanism is edging towards the
text: sea bass. Unfortunately, Austin is still drawing out the
text: floss. He keeps pulling out floss.
text: More floss still. The mechanism continues to sink. Finally,
text: the floss line goes TAUT. Austin ties it off high on the
text: pole of the slow-dipping mechanism. Austin holds out his
dialog: hand like a surgeon&amp;emdash
text: Vanessa places a tube of toothpaste in his hand. Meanwhile
text: the guard is reaching to undo the floss. Austin places the
text: open tube on his palm, aimed at the guard. Vanessa WHISTLES
text: at the guard loudly. He turns around.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Judo chop!
text: Austin JUDO CHOPS the toothpaste tube, sending a stream of
text: toothpaste into the guard's eyes.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: (screaming, rubbing
dialog: his eyes)
dialog: My eyes! My eyes!
text: Austin folds the tube across the top of the wire, grabbing
dialog: both ends.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Hold on, Vanessa!
text: She grabs onto him and they slide down the floss to safety
text: right as the dipping mechanism goes under the water.
text: Meanwhile, the guard waits for them with toothpaste smeared
text: all over his face.
text: He and Austin STRUGGLE.
text: The guard manages to get Austin pinned to the ground, Austin's
text: head dangling over the water. SEA
text: BASS circle. The water boils, dangerously close to Austin's
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Austin, watch out!
text: Austin FLIPS the guard over. The SEA BASS chew the guard's
text: head off like a blender.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Not a good time to lose one's head.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Indeed.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: That's not the way to get ahead in
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: It's a shame he wasn't more

dialog: You have a full head of hair, mine
dialog: is slightly receding. You're thin,
dialog: I'm about forty pounds overweight.
dialog: OK, we are different, I'm not making

dialog: things you stand for&amp;emdash swinging,
dialog: free love, parties, distrust of
dialog: authority- are all now, in the
dialog: Nineties, considered to

dialog: admit.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: No, man, what we swingers were
dialog: rebelling against were uptight squares
dialog: like you, whose bag was money and
dialog: world domination. We were innocent,
dialog: man. If we'd known the consequences
dialog: of our sexual liberation, we would
dialog: have done things differently, but
dialog: the spirit would have remained the
dialog: same. It's freedom, man.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Your freedom has cause more pain and

speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Man, you are one chilly square!
speaker_heading: SCOTT EVIL
dialog: Dad, we just made a breakthrough in

speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: I had the group liquidated, you little

speaker_heading: SCOTT EVIL
dialog: I hate you! I hate you! I wish I

speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Scott, don't say that...
