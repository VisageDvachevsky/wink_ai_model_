scene_heading: INT. DIMLY-LIT BAR - NIGHT
text: Two men, CAESAR and MARTY "DUCKS," stand at the end of the
text: deserted bar, talking quietly, oblivious to the exotic dancer
text: grinding her pelvis on a pole in the middle of the small
text: stage. Body language and charisma tell us that Caesar is the
dialog: boss, "Ducks" his lieutenant.
speaker_heading: DUCKS
dialog: It's Peezee. Gotta be. He hates your
dialog: fuckin' guts.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: (brooding)
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: DUCKS
dialog: Who else knew about the money? And
dialog: how did Peezee know they popped Tony
dialog: Cisco when we didn't even hear about
dialog: it 'til last night?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: (sighs heavily)
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: DUCKS
dialog: (pressing)
dialog: What is so hard to understand here?
dialog: You said yourself Peezee was a
dialog: mamaluke and you couldn't trust him.
dialog: Now suddenly you're soft on the guy?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I just don't think it was him.
speaker_heading: DUCKS
dialog: Okay, I'll bite. If not Peezee, then
dialog: who?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: (slowly rising to
dialog: his full height)
dialog: I think it was you, Ducks.
text: Caesar starts to walk away as the bartender, now holding a
text: sawed-off shotgun, moves closer to Ducks. The exotic dancer
text: splits in a hurry through a curtain at the back of the stage.
speaker_heading: DUCKS
dialog: (scared)
dialog: You gotta be kiddin'!
text: Caesar stops at the door where two of his soldiers have
dialog: 2.
text: appeared, holding AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.
speaker_heading: DUCKS
dialog: Caesar, you know me! What kind of
dialog: fuckin' idiot would I have to be to
dialog: try that shit with you?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: A dead fuckin' idiot.
text: As he walks out the door, the soldiers OPEN FIRE on Marty
text: "Ducks." Caesar doesn't look back.
scene_heading: PULL BACK TO:

scene_heading: INT. SING SING PRISON - NIGHT
text: Maximum-security prisoners are gathered around watching their
text: favorite show in the rec room. In the front row is PAUL VITTI,
text: former New York crime boss, and a couple of other wiseguys.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Garbage. Change the channel.
speaker_heading: WISEGUY
dialog: Okay, Paul.
text: The WISEGUY gets up and starts switching channels on the TV.
text: A couple of CONVICTS in the back start to protest.
speaker_heading: CONVICT
dialog: Hey! What're you doin', asshole!
text: Vitti turns and stares at them. They fall silent
dialog: immediately.
speaker_heading: CONVICT
dialog: Sorry, Mr. Vitti. Didn't mean any
dialog: disrespect.
speaker_heading: WISEGUY
dialog: Punks.
text: Vitti turns the page and sees a huge headline in the Post:
text: MOB SHRINK TELLS ALL. He gets up, agitated.
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: I'm going to bed.
text: Vitti stands up and heads back to his cell.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CELL BLOCK - MOMENTS LATER
text: As Vitti approaches his cell, he sees a prison guard standing
text: by. His cellmate, EARL, a giant of a man, comes out of their
text: cell carrying his bedroll and a box containing his other
text: meager possessions.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: (suspicious)
dialog: What's goin' on, Earl?
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: They're transferring me.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Don't know. Thanks for looking out
dialog: for me, Mr. Vitti.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Yeah. Take it easy.
text: He notices something in the box.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Hey, Earl. Is that my after-shave?
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: (blanches)
dialog: I'm sorry. I just grabbed stuff -- I
dialog: didn't know --
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: That's okay. Keep it. Go ahead.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Thanks. See you around.
text: Earl exits with the guard. Vitti hesitates a moment, then
text: warily steps into his cell.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. VITTI'S CELL - MIDDLE OF NIGHT
text: The cellblock is quiet. A guard stops outside the darkened
text: cell, looks around to make sure no one is watching, then
dialog: 4.
text: pulls out a GUN with a SILENCER, reaches through the bars and
text: FIRES REPEATEDLY into Vitti's shadowy form under the blanket.
text: Then he slips away as quietly as he appeared.
text: ON his exit we PAN DOWN TO Vitti, unhurt, curled up under his
dialog: bunk.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MEMORIAL CHAPEL - DAY
text: A deluxe casket flanked by elaborate floral displays and an
text: easel displaying a portrait of the deceased, Dr. Isaac Sobel.
text: Mourners fill the pews, standees at the back, an overflow
text: crowd. BEN SOBEL sits in the front row, staring at the
text: casket with his wife, LAURA, his son, MICHAEL, now a
text: teenager, BEN'S MOTHER, and her friend, DR. JOYCE BROTHERS.
text: At the podium, the RABBI is speaking.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: And now I'd like to call on Isaac's
dialog: son, Dr. Ben Sobel, who would like to
dialog: say a few words.
text: Ben rises and crosses solemnly to the podium.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (addressing audience)
dialog: It's very difficult for me to talk
dialog: about my father, because in a sense
dialog: I'm talking about two men.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: One, of course, is the public Isaac
dialog: Sobel, the eminent psychotherapist and
dialog: popular author known to millions of
dialog: readers around the world.
text: Laura, Michael and Ben's Mother listen proudly to the eulogy.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: The second Isaac Sobel is the private
dialog: man -- my father -- Dad. And for
dialog: those of you who knew him well and
dialog: knew our family -- well, let's face it
dialog: -- my father was a psychotic, mind-
text: fucking prick. An arrogant, abusive,
dialog: ego-inflated --
text: A RINGING CELL PHONE interrupts him.
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT TO:
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: 5.
text: still seated in the front row, daydreaming. The RINGING
text: CONTINUES as all the mourners and even the Rabbi discreetly
dialog: check their cell phones.
text: Then Ben realizes it's his, fumbles for the phone in his
text: jacket pocket and answers it.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Hello?
text: The mourners mutter.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PRISON PAY PHONE - SAME TIME

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Paul?
dialog: (to Laura)
dialog: I have to, uh, take this.
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: This isn't a good time.
text: Vitti is disheveled, his hair messed, his shirt buttoned
dialog: wrong.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Not a good time? Let me explain
dialog: something to you. I'm in fucking Hell
dialog: right now. This is not a good time.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (sotto voce)
dialog: I can't talk right now. My father
dialog: died!
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: So what does that have to do with me?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Call me later --
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Don't hang up on, Sobel! They're
dialog: tryin' to kill me!
dialog: 6.
text: Ben hangs up.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
speaker_heading: VITTI
text: He stands there for a long beat just staring, the DIAL TONE
text: BUZZING in his ear.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SING SING - MESS HALL - NEXT DAY
text: Vitti and another WISEGUY pass through the cafeteria line
text: with their trays. Vitti now looks catatonic.
speaker_heading: WISEGUY #2
dialog: Ooh, they got tapioca. I love
dialog: tapioca.
dialog: (looks at Vitti)
dialog: You all right, Paul?
text: Vitti just stares, wild-eyed, actually drooling a little.
speaker_heading: WISEGUY #2
dialog: Can I have your tapioca?
text: A guard, the one who tried to kill him, watches Vitti from
text: his post. Then he nods to someone across the room.
text: COYOTE, a heavily-muscled and tattooed gang member, nods in
dialog: response.
text: Vitti walks past the table where Coyote is sitting with other
dialog: tough Hispanic gang members.
speaker_heading: COYOTE
dialog: (to Vitti)
dialog: Hey, Fredo! Or is it Guido?
text: His friends laugh.
text: Vitti stops and stares dumbly at them.
speaker_heading: COYOTE
dialog: Just keep walkin', Don Corleone.
text: There is a tense moment, then Vitti bursts out laughing.
speaker_heading: COYOTE
dialog: Shut up!
text: Vitti laughs harder, strangely manic.
speaker_heading: COYOTE
dialog: I said, shut up, bitch!
dialog: 7.
text: But Vitti can't stop. He drops his tray of slop, splattering
text: food on the men. Coyote leaps to his feet and pulls a shiv.
speaker_heading: COYOTE
dialog: You're a dead man, jefe!
text: Coyote lunges at Vitti with the knife, but Vitti suddenly
text: whirls around, bashes Coyote in the face with his food tray
text: and bursts into song.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: (singing, with
dialog: appropriate dance
dialog: moves)
dialog: 'When you're a Jet,
dialog: You're a Jet all the way,
dialog: From your first cigarette
dialog: To your last dyin' day...'
text: Prisoners and guards stare at him like he's nuts.
text: Coyote stabs at him again, but Vitti dodges and smashes him
text: over the head with the tray.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: 'When you're a Jet,
dialog: If the shit hits the fan,
dialog: You got brothers around,
dialog: You're a family man...'
speaker_heading: COYOTE
dialog: You're a dead man, jefe!
text: Coyote rushes him, but Vitti sidesteps and hits him in the
dialog: face.
text: Guards move in from all sides. Vitti jumps up on the
text: tabletop to escape them.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: (kicking at them,
dialog: singing)
dialog: 'I like to be in America,
dialog: Okay by me in America...'
text: The guards drag him down and cuff his hands behind him, then
text: carry him out stiff as a board.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: 'Tonight, tonight, won't be just
dialog: any night -- '
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SOBEL HOUSE - LATER

text: house, the family gets out and starts walking to the house.
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SOBEL HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER
text: The family crosses to the front door.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (sighs deeply)
dialog: I can't believe he's gone.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: I can't believe what you said about
dialog: him. Cold and withholding? You had
dialog: to tell everybody?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Nice. Why didn't you just take a
dialog: swing at the casket?
text: Ben opens the front door and they go in.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: The family enters the foyer.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Okay, I might have strayed from my
dialog: notes a little. I'm dealing with a
dialog: lot of stuff here. Grief is a
dialog: process.
text: Laura notices FBI AGENTS CERRONE and MILLER waiting for them
text: in the living room. Cerrone is an attractive woman in her
text: late twenties, wearing a dangerously-short skirt. Miller is
text: a clean-cut man in his thirties.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Dr. Sobel, I'm Agent Miller, this is
dialog: Special Agent Cerrone, Federal Bureau
dialog: of Investigation. We'd just like to
dialog: ask you a few questions, if we could.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (testy)
dialog: Can I ask what this is about? We just
dialog: came from the cemetery.
speaker_heading: CERRONE
dialog: We know this is a difficult time for
dialog: you, Dr. Sobel. Sorry about your
dialog: father.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Thank you, I'm going to miss him
dialog: 9.
dialog: terribly.
text: Ben gestures for them to sit.
text: Laura and Michael both look at him doubtfully.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I mean -- there were issues -- as, I
dialog: think, there are with any father and
dialog: son. He wasn't especially warm --
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Ben -- once today? Enough.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No, I'm just saying, in spite of all
dialog: that --
text: Agent Cerrone crosses her legs, a move that does not go
text: unnoticed by Ben and Michael.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: -- he was a great, great legs.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Man.
speaker_heading: CERRONE
dialog: Dr. Sobel, you received a call this
dialog: morning from Paul Vitti?
text: Laura shoots him a look.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What makes you think Paul Vitti called
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Because we monitor and record all his
text: phone calls from Sing Sing.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Then yes. He did.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: That was him on the phone?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: And you didn't tell me?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Wow. Talk about withholding.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Michael?
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: You told her --
dialog: (nodding at
dialog: Agent Cerrone)
dialog: You told her at the drop of a hat.
text: Agents Cerrone and Miller eye each other.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: She's with the F.B.I. She needs to
dialog: know these things.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Oh, I see. And I don't. Why tell
dialog: Laura? She couldn't possibly handle a
dialog: phone call.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Did I say that?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: You folks need a minute?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No, we're fine.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: If you don't need me anymore, I'll be
text: in the kitchen.
dialog: (to Agent Cerrone)
dialog: And two words of advice -- from one
text: professional woman to another -- Pant.
dialog: Suit.
text: She exits.
speaker_heading: BEN
text: She's grieving. It's a process.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: We understand.
dialog: (prompting)
dialog: Vitti?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Oh, yes. Paul Vitti and I were
dialog: involved in some organized crime
dialog: activity a couple of years ago. I
dialog: mean, I wasn't involved -- not
dialog: 'involved' involved -- I was just
text: trying to help him therapeutically,
dialog: and some people tried to, uh, kill us.
dialog: No big deal.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Well, shortly after you spoke, he
dialog: 11.
text: seemed to have some kind of breakdown.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What kind of breakdown?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I think you'd better go up there and
dialog: see for yourself.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SING SING INFIRMARY - PSYCH WARD - DAY
text: Vitti huddles in the corner of a bare, white, padded cell,

speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: (singing)
dialog: 'I feel pretty, oh, so pretty, I feel
dialog: pretty and witty and bright...'
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME TIME
text: Ben watches through a two-way mirror with the prison
text: psychiatrist, DR. CUTLER. They can hear Vitti through a
text: wall-mounted speaker.
speaker_heading: DR. CUTLER
dialog: I'm treating him with Thioridazine,
text: 300 milligrams, T.I.D. That seems to
dialog: keep him pretty calm.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (watching Vitti)
dialog: That would keep a parade pretty calm.
dialog: He just keeps singing West Side Story
dialog: songs?
speaker_heading: DR. CUTLER
dialog: 'Tonight,' 'Maria,' the balcony scene.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: The balcony scene? Both parts?
speaker_heading: DR. CUTLER
dialog: Oh, yeah. Get him to do 'Officer
dialog: Krupke.' It's really good.
scene_heading: INT. PADDED CELL
text: Ben and Dr. Cutler enter. Vitti doesn't seem to notice.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: (singing)
dialog: 'Who's the pretty girl in the mirror
dialog: 12.
dialog: there? What mirror? Where? Who can
dialog: that attractive girl be?'
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Paul, it's me. Ben Sobel. Paul?

dialog: Maria?
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Tony?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (with a look to
dialog: Dr. Cutler)
dialog: Oh, boy.
dialog: (to Vitti)
dialog: What's going on, Maria?
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: The rumble -- it's tonight! I have to
dialog: get out of here. I don't want to die.
dialog: No, Chino, no!
text: Vitti's jaw suddenly goes slack and he slumps in his seat,
text: staring forward.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Paul? Paul?
text: Ben waves a hand in front of Vitti's face. Nothing.
speaker_heading: DR. CUTLER
dialog: This is how it's been. He sings for a
text: while, then he goes completely
text: catatonic.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (skeptical)
dialog: Really. Can we take him to an
dialog: examining room?
speaker_heading: DR. CUTLER
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. EXAMINING ROOM - MINUTES LATER
text: Vitti sits inert on the examination table.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You already did a neurological work-
dialog: up?
speaker_heading: DR. CUTLER
dialog: Yep. No tumors, no aneurisms, no sign
dialog: of stroke --
dialog: 13.
text: Ben slaps Vitti's face lightly a couple times.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Completely catatonic --
text: He pulls on Vitti's ears and nose. Vitti does not react.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Totally gone. Well, I don't think
text: he's smart enough to be faking.
dialog: Street smart, yes, but we're talking
text: about an I.Q. just north of a bedroom
text: slipper.
text: Ben checks Vitti out of the corner of his eye. No reaction.
text: Then Ben takes a sharp needle from an instrument tray.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: So if I just stuck him with this
dialog: needle, he probably wouldn't even
dialog: respond.
speaker_heading: DR. CUTLER
dialog: I don't know. Try it.
text: Ben hesitates for a moment to see if Vitti will crack, then
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Okay --
text: He sticks the needle into Vitti's shoulder.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: (bursts into song)
dialog: 'Boy, boy, crazy boy, keep cool, boy!
dialog: Got a rocket in your pocket, keep
dialog: cool-y cool boy -- '
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SING SING - CONSULTATION ROOM - NEXT DAY
text: Vitti is sitting at a table facing Ben. Dr. Cutler observes
text: from a chair in the corner.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Paul, we're going to give you some
dialog: tests to assess your mental condition.
dialog: There's no pressure -- just answer as
dialog: best you can. Do I have your consent
dialog: to share the results of these tests?
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Mommy's mad at me because I made a
text: boom on the rug.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I'll take that as a yes. Okay, I'm
dialog: going to show you ten cards, each
dialog: containing a picture of an inkblot. I
dialog: want you to look at each card and tell
dialog: me what you see.
speaker_heading: VITTI
text: I see you. I see him. I see a table.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Focus, Paul. You haven't seen the
dialog: card yet.
dialog: (hands him first card)
dialog: What does this look like to you? Take
dialog: your time.
text: Vitti looks at the wrong side of the card. It's all white.
speaker_heading: VITTI
text: It looks like snow.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No, Paul, the other side.
text: Vitti turns it over and makes a face.
speaker_heading: VITTI
text: A bat. A big bat. Or a weasel.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (taking notes)
dialog: Bat or weasel. All right.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: And he's got a little girl -- no, it's
text: a little boy -- in his teeth -- and
dialog: he's shakin' him and shakin' him
dialog: 'cause the kid didn't wipe himself
text: good -- and the kid is screaming
text: because the bat-weasel ripped out his
text: throat and the blood is shootin' out
text: of his neck vein.
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: That's the blood.
text: Doctor Cutler looks worried.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (skeptical)
dialog: See anything else?
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Just the pussy with the teeth.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (making more notes)
text: Pussy with teeth. Next card.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: SHAPES TEST
text: Vitti is literally trying to pound a square peg into a round
dialog: hole.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: VITTI AND BEN
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Now try repeating the numbers
dialog: backwards. For instance, if I was 1-
dialog: 2-3, you will say 3-2-1. Okay, 7-3-8.
speaker_heading: VITTI

speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: This is a picture of a guy -- nice,
text: hardworking guy -- comes home and
dialog: finds out his wife's been screwin'
text: this midget while he was out of town.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (appalled, makes
dialog: a note)
dialog: Screwing a midget. And how does the
dialog: story end?
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: I think he works over the midget for a
text: while, then he blows 'em away.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: The wife or the midget?
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: (smirks)
dialog: Trick question, right? Both of 'em.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: ANOTHER TEST
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Okay, Paul. Last test. In this one,
dialog: I'm going to start a sentence and you
dialog: complete it any way you want to.
dialog: Ready? 'I get
dialog: angry -- '
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No, you're supposed to complete the
dialog: sentence.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: I did. I said 'yes.'
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I wasn't asking if you agreed or
dialog: disagreed; it was more like, 'I get
dialog: angry when -- '
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: -- whenever.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well, that about does it for me.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Ben meets with RICHARD CHAPIN, the U.S. Attorney for the
dialog: Southern District of New York.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Based on his symptoms and the test
dialog: results, I'd say brief psychotic
dialog: disorder -- if it persists, possibly
dialog: schizophreniform disorder. And Dr.
dialog: Cutler agrees with my diagnosis.
speaker_heading: CHAPIN
dialog: So he's crazy?
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Dr. Cutler? No, he's annoying, but --
speaker_heading: CHAPIN
dialog: Vitti.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Not crazy. At least not permanently.
dialog: In certain people, continuous exposure
dialog: to an extremely stressful situation --
dialog: soldiers in combat, for instance,
dialog: disaster victims, a hostage situation,
dialog: or being locked up in a maximum
text: security prison with someone trying to
dialog: kill you -- it can produce a temporary
text: psychotic state.
speaker_heading: CHAPIN
dialog: How temporary?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: A day, a week, up to a month -- if the
text: precipitating stressors are removed.
speaker_heading: CHAPIN
dialog: (musing)
dialog: Which means he's not going to get any
text: better while he's still in the can.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: He could get worse. He could
text: deteriorate to the point where he'd be
text: permanently schizophrenic.
speaker_heading: CHAPIN
dialog: Then I'd say he's got a real problem,
dialog: because he goes before the parole
dialog: board in four weeks.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You think they'll let him out?
speaker_heading: CHAPIN
dialog: Oh, yeah, I'm sure they'll want to
dialog: release a major Mafia figure who's now
text: totally deranged on top of it.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: Well, couldn't you release him to a
dialog: halfway house or some place where he
dialog: could get some decent treatment?
dialog: Based on my earlier work with him, I
dialog: don't think he's dangerous, and I
dialog: think he was making a real effort to
dialog: reform himself.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: CHAPIN
dialog: You do, huh?
dialog: (thinks for a
dialog: long moment)
dialog: Okay. Then I'll tell you what. I'm
dialog: gonna release him into your custody.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Mine? Me? No, this is a bad time for
dialog: me. My father just died -- and I've
dialog: got this bulging disc in my neck --
dialog: and we're redecorating, which is a
dialog: total nightmare. I can't --
speaker_heading: CHAPIN
dialog: You want to see him killed in prison?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No, of course not.
speaker_heading: CHAPIN
dialog: Or sent to a facility for the
text: criminally insane.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No --
speaker_heading: CHAPIN
dialog: Then he's all yours. I'm going to
dialog: talk to the Bureau of Prisons and get
dialog: you certified as a temporary federal
dialog: institution.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (stricken)
dialog: What? I can't be an institution.
speaker_heading: CHAPIN

dialog: You've got thirty days to get him in
dialog: shape for his parole hearing. That
dialog: means sane, sober and gainfully
dialog: employed. But let me warn you,
dialog: Doctor. If he fucks up in any way --
dialog: if he flees, or if I find out that
dialog: this whole thing was just a setup so
dialog: he could get back on the street and
dialog: return to a life of crime -- I will
dialog: hold you totally responsible, and I'll
dialog: see that you are stripped of your
dialog: license and prosecuted to the full
dialog: extent of the law. Are we clear?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (gulp)
dialog: Yes. We're clear.

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Okay, Paul -- this way.

text: him. Vitti keeps walking, passing the car.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: This way, Paul. Over here. Here we
dialog: go.
text: Ben helps Vitti into the car. One of Vitti's legs is still

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Leg, Paul. Leg up.
text: Ben lifts Vitti's leg into the car and closes the door.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: (enraged)
dialog: You fucking son-of-a-bitch! Where the
dialog: fuck do you get off sticking me with a
dialog: needle?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I knew it! I knew you were faking!
dialog: You used me to get you out of prison!
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Took you long enough. I was singin'
dialog: West Side Story for three fuckin'
dialog: days. I'm half a fag already.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: I call you to say somebody's trying to
dialog: kill me and you hang up on me?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I was at the funeral home!
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: You're my fuckin' doctor!
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: My father died!
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Me me me me! He's dead! Get over it.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Are you hearing yourself?
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: (perfunctorily)
dialog: I'm deeply sorry for your loss.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Yeah, I can see how touched you are.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: What's the difference? You hated him
dialog: anyway.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I loved my father. I'm feeling a lot
dialog: of grief right now.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: I'm not sensing it, but if you say so.
text: Ben nervously pops a pill and swallows it.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: (re: pill)
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Decongestant. I'm getting over a
dialog: cold. All right, what's going on?
dialog: Who's after you?
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: I don't know -- take your pick. Could
dialog: be my old family, or could be the
dialog: Rigazzis. Ever heard of Lou Rigazzi -
dialog: - Lou 'The Wrench'?
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Why "The Wrench"?
speaker_heading: VITTI
text: Because he twisted a guy's head off
dialog: once.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Off?
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Off. Fuckin' Calabrese -- animals.
dialog: And comin' from me you know that's a
dialog: big compliment.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I'm sure they'd be flattered. So --
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: The feds are really putting the
dialog: pressure on. The families are
dialog: fighting each other again -- what's
dialog: left of 'em. It's the fall of the
dialog: fuckin' Roman Empire. It's
dialog: World War Three out there.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: So what does that have to do with you?
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: They knew I was gettin' out soon and
dialog: the last thing anybody wants to see is
dialog: me getting into it on either side.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Maybe if you just explain to
dialog: them -- that you're out of it now,
dialog: that you're starting a new life --
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Yeah, they'll probably want to throw
dialog: me a party and give me a gold watch.
dialog: Trust me -- nobody's lookin' forward
dialog: to me being out.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You are, aren't you?
speaker_heading: VITTI

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Paul! I don't think you understand.

dialog: a lot of trouble if you screw up.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Don't worry about it. I'll call you
dialog: tomorrow.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Oh, no. You want to go back to Sing
dialog: Sing? Thursday's meatloaf night. I
dialog: can have you back there in no time.
dialog: The U.S. Attorney was very clear. You
dialog: stay with me; therapy every day; you
dialog: can't leave the area without
dialog: permission --
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: What are you, my father now?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: And you have to get a job as soon as
dialog: you're well enough, which is now. So
dialog: are you coming in with me or do I have
dialog: to make a phone call?

speaker_heading: CHAPIN
dialog: Yeah, he's about as crazy as I am.
dialog: 23.
dialog: Think about it. Locked up, he was
dialog: absolutely no use to me. But back on
dialog: the street, Vitti's still powerful
dialog: enough to pose a threat to both
dialog: families. It's like throwing gasoline
text: on a fire.
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: If we can use Vitti to escalate this
dialog: war, we might just end up putting them
dialog: all away.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: That's if he goes back to his old
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: CHAPIN
dialog: If? People like Paul Vitti don't
dialog: change. This guy's been a menace to
dialog: society since he was twelve years old.
dialog: Being a criminal is all he knows.
dialog: Trust me.
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: He's gonna head straight for trouble.
dialog: Then all we have to do is sit back and
dialog: pick up the pieces. We could get
dialog: twenty, maybe even thirty indictments
text: next time the grand jury convenes.
speaker_heading: CHAPIN

speaker_heading: LAURA

speaker_heading: VITTI

speaker_heading: LAURA

text: Laura smiles at the two men, then exits.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You'll have to forgive her. She's

speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: I understand. She's uncomfortable.
dialog: The whole situation's a little awkward
dialog: with me bein' here -- but let's face
dialog: it, Emily fuckin' Post she's not.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Emily fuckin' Post. Well, that
dialog: explains why she rarely used her
dialog: middle name.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Listen, I got a friend coming over. I
dialog: didn't want you to be surprised.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What kind of friend? Because if it's
dialog: 'The Wrench,' or 'The Power Drill' or
dialog: any other kind of
dialog: tool --
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Not that kind of friend. It's a
dialog: personal thing.
speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: VITTI

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I'm not -- this has nothing to do with

speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: I heard her busting your balls.
speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Or?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Or what?
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Or you're pussy-whipped.

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No, it didn't.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Good. Because I want you to know that

dialog: understand what you're going through.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I do, Dad.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: And if I seemed a little hard on
dialog: Grandpa, it's just that your

dialog: nothing I ever did was good enough. I
dialog: don't want it to be that way with us.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It's not.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: And you know, at times like this we

dialog: Right?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No. Not really.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: That's good. Good talk. And I

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

dialog: Then tell me. I'm not here to judge
dialog: you.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Okay. When I was really little --
dialog: like seven or eight -- maybe I wanted
dialog: to be a cowboy.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: A cowboy. Really?
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Yeah. My father gave me a cowboy
dialog: suit -- you know, the vest, the
dialog: chaps, the cap guns -- the whole
dialog: thing. And he used to take me up
dialog: to my uncle's farm in New Jersey
dialog: and lead me around on this pony.
dialog: Yippee-i-o. You happy now?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: So you watched cowboy movies and TV
dialog: shows with your father.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Everybody. The whole family. My
dialog: father loved 'Gunsmoke.'
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Sheriff Dillon.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: (corrects him)
dialog: Marshal Dillon.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Marshal. So who were your favorite
dialog: cowboys?
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: This is so fuckin' retarded.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Paul!
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: All right. Gene Autry, Roy Rogers,
dialog: the Lone Ranger --
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Interesting. They're all good guys.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Yeah, I guess.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No, that's important. You didn't want
dialog: to be the bad guy. You wanted to be
dialog: the hero.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Yeah, so?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: So what happened?
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: I don't know. Nothing happened.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: So why didn't you become a cowboy?
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: I lived in East Harlem! I joined a
dialog: street gang when I was 12 and that was
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Something else happened when you were
dialog: twelve.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (prompting)
dialog: Something that made you very sad?
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: The Dodgers moved from Brooklyn to
dialog: L.A. Everybody took it pretty hard.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Something else.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: We playin' a guessing game here?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Paul! Your father was murdered!
dialog: Right in front of you. Remember?
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Do I remember? I think about it every
dialog: fuckin' day of my life. What's that
dialog: got to do with it?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: It's got everything to do with it. He
dialog: gave you the cowboy suit. With a
text: white hat. He was in the mob, but he
dialog: wanted you to be a good guy, didn't
dialog: he?
text: Vitti starts thinking about his father and starts to weep.
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Yeah. He did.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: He didn't want you in the gang life.
dialog: He only did it himself so you wouldn't
dialog: have to. He was trying to buy you a
dialog: better life than his.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: (crying harder)
dialog: He always said he wanted me to go to
dialog: college. I didn't even finish high
dialog: school.
text: He really starts sobbing now.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well, Paul, this could be a great
dialog: opportunity for you. You're right
dialog: back where you were when you were
dialog: twelve. You've got some big choices
dialog: to make.
text: Vitti fights to regain control.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Okay. Okay. That's enough of that
dialog: shit.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: It's not shit, Paul. My point is,
dialog: when you're a child, you think
dialog: anything is possible. Wouldn't it be
dialog: great to think like that now?
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: (retreating back into
dialog: his cynicism)
dialog: Yeah, just sprinkle some fuckin' fairy
dialog: dust on me.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I'm just saying you've got to keep
text: an open mind and explore some new
dialog: possibilities. Try some different
dialog: things -- maybe you'll connect with
dialog: one of them. There's a career
dialog: counselor I work with. I can call
dialog: him for you. He may be able to help
dialog: you find a job.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: You mean working for somebody? I'm
dialog: supposed to take orders from some guy
dialog: who used to get me coffee?
dialog: (starts sweating and

speaker_heading: JELLY
dialog: It would appear not.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: How'd you get out?
speaker_heading: JELLY
dialog: New trial. The evidence in my first

speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: JELLY

speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: VITTI

speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: JELLY
dialog: I'm an extra.
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: An extra what?
speaker_heading: JELLY
dialog: A supernumerary. An 'atmosphere.' It

speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: Eighty bucks? For standin' around all

speaker_heading: JELLY
dialog: Today? About eight hundred maybe.
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: And how about bookin' bets for the

speaker_heading: JELLY

speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Yeah, I know. When you're a Jet,

speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: So you want to tell me what's going on

speaker_heading: VITTI

speaker_heading: VITTI

speaker_heading: RIGAZZI

dialog: Patty who?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What is this -- a knock-knock joke?

speaker_heading: VITTI

dialog: you trust me?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (off balance)
dialog: It's not that I don't trust you, I
dialog: just don't -- trust you. Are you
dialog: lying to me? Because I know you,
dialog: Paul. You'll say or do anything to
dialog: get your own way.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: This is what's so hard about being an
dialog: ex-con. You make one little mistake

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Oh, so now you're the victim? I want
dialog: the truth.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Wait a second. Say that again.

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Say what?
speaker_heading: VITTI

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Paul --
speaker_heading: VITTI

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I'm not an actor --
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Hey, you're as good as most of the
dialog: bums I see around here. They have
dialog: this part. You could do it.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Actually, I did The Music Man in tenth

speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Of course. I'm gonna talk to Raoul.

speaker_heading: VITTI

speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Come on -- you were great.
speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: VITTI

speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: TONY BELLA

speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Maybe once or twice. Look, I got

speaker_heading: TONY BELLA

speaker_heading: VITTI

speaker_heading: LAURA

speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: When is this going to end?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Tonight, I hope. I just have to find

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Why? A few days ago you weren't even

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (very excited)
dialog: You know, this might just fuckin'
dialog: work.
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You're gonna get in so much trouble.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - SAME TIME
text: The marshals are trying to climb over the construction site

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Then knock down the gates!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BUS - SAME TIME
text: Jelly is pulling on the hat and jacket of a transit authority

dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: (pops his head in)
dialog: Forty bars. That's all we need.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: How much is that?
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: $350 an ounce, 16 ounces in a pound,
dialog: 90 pounds in each bar -- do the math.
speaker_heading: JELLY
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Actually, gold is measured in troy
dialog: ounces. 14.6 ounces to the pound.
dialog: That would be... $18,396,000.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: JELLY
dialog: Give or take.
text: He hears a LOUD CRASH and all eyes turn to the gates.
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well, so much for not peeing in my
dialog: pants.
text: Eddie goes off to help transfer the gold.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - SAME TIME

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You know what you said about not
dialog: flipping out?
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: (flipping out)
dialog: What did I do? What did I do? I had
dialog: a perfect life, I threw it away.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Don't do this.
text: Vitti drags him off toward the building structure.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I can't help it! My life is over!
dialog: I'm going to jail. Some people
dialog: can handle prison -- I'm not one of
dialog: them. I have delicate features. I'm
dialog: small. I'll be way too popular!
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Calm down.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I can't calm down! I'm gonna die!
text: Inside the structure, Vitti spins him around and shakes him.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: You're not gonna die!
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I can't breathe! I'm suffocating!
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: (shaking him)
dialog: For Chrissake, get hold of yourself!
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I can't! I'm dying! We're all going
dialog: to die!
text: Suddenly, he slaps Vitti hard across the face. They both
dialog: freeze.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Did I just hit you?
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Yeah. Feel better now?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (breaking down)
dialog: I'm sorry, Paul. I blame myself for
dialog: this. I wanted to help you. I wanted
dialog: to be there for you. But I just
dialog: wasn't good enough.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: You were good. It isn't your fault.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No, it is. Since my father
dialog: died --
dialog: (starts crying)
dialog: I've lost my way. I don't know
dialog: anything anymore. I mean, what's the
dialog: point? I didn't think it would hit me
dialog: so hard --
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Would you just shut up about your
dialog: father!
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I'm grieving, goddammit! Have a
dialog: little respect!
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: He was an asshole -- you said it
dialog: yourself. What are you grieving for?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I'm grieving for myself, you fucking
dialog: idiot!
text: Ben lets it all go, sobbing for all the years of pain.
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: (surprised, shrugs)
dialog: Jeez, I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Now I know how you must have felt when
dialog: your father was killed.
text: Vitti looks at him.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (crying more)
dialog: I mean, it had to be ten times worse
dialog: for you -- being murdered right in
dialog: front of you. And you were so young -
dialog: -
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: We don't have time for this.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (really sobbing)
dialog: It must've been so painful!
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: (eyes filling with
dialog: tears)
dialog: I'm warning you -- don't do
dialog: this --
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I mean, it's like all his hopes for
dialog: you died with him. And that's so sad.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: (starting to cry)
dialog: There I go. You happy now? You see
dialog: what you're doing here?
text: Both men are crying now.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Your father really loved you.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: I loved him, too. I did.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (hugs him)
dialog: I know. I know.
text: Jelly comes around the corner and sees the two men in a weepy
dialog: embrace.
speaker_heading: JELLY
dialog: Oh, boy. This is bad.
dialog: 113.
text: Another huge CRASH as the marshals ram the gates again, this
text: time tearing loose one of the big hinges.
speaker_heading: JELLY
dialog: Maybe we oughta should go.
text: Vitti, Ben and Jelly run to the bus, but Eddie pulls a gun
text: and stops them. Al and Bobby cover Jelly and the rest of the
text: crew. Vitti backs away slowly.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Did you really think you were gonna
dialog: live through this?
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: I had my hopes.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yeah, well, nice work. Mr. Rigazzi
dialog: will be very grateful.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (to Vitti)
dialog: Rigazzi? I thought he worked for
dialog: Patti LoPresti.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: That's what Patty thought, too. This
dialog: scumbag's been playin' both sides
text: against the middle.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: There's only one side as far as I'm
dialog: concerned. Mine. What did you think?
dialog: I was just gonna stand by and let some
dialog: fuckin' has-been move back in? So
dialog: long, Mr. Vitti.
text: He cocks the gun and is about to pull the trigger when Ben
text: suddenly roars and slams him in the head with his gun. Vitti
text: and Jelly quickly cover Al Pacino and Enormous Bobby.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (beating the shit
dialog: out of Eddie)
dialog: I can't take it anymore! That's what
dialog: I hate about you fucking sociopaths!
dialog: You just keep changing the rules to
dialog: suit yourselves. Well, not this time,
dialog: you anti-social asshole. You fucked
dialog: with the wrong shrink!
text: Sitting on Eddie's chest, he presses the gun against Eddie's
dialog: nose.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Don't you read the papers? The guy
dialog: 114.
text: with the gun makes the rules.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Yeah, what?
text: They shove Eddie, Enormous Bobby and Al Pacino into the back

text: lifts it off the ground.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION

speaker_heading: RAOUL (O.S.)

dialog: on?
text: Raoul strides out into the street, furious, still talking
text: through his bullhorn.
speaker_heading: RAOUL
dialog: (to the Captain)
dialog: Who are you? What are you doing in my
dialog: shot?
text: The Captain and the marshals look around and see that they're
text: on the set of "Little Caesar."
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: What are you doing on my street?
text: The Captain walks toward Raoul until they are almost face to
text: face, shouting at each other through their BULLHORNS.
speaker_heading: RAOUL

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: I don't give a shit about your permit!

text: Ben turns to Vitti.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Feeling pretty good, huh?
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: I felt worse.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: So what now? You go on the run for
dialog: the rest of your life? Back to Sing
dialog: Sing? Or you turn up dead in an alley?
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Those are my choices? What happened
dialog: to lying on a beach in Costa Rica
dialog: for the next twenty years? You
dialog: can't let me enjoy this for five

speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Not so good.
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: Yeah, I heard. It's all over the
dialog: television. I never should've trusted
dialog: Eddie. But, you know, a woman alone
dialog: in the world is very vulnerable.
speaker_heading: VITTI
dialog: Yeah, I know.
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: At least I don't have to worry about
dialog: the Rigazzis no more. Thanks to you.
speaker_heading: VITTI

speaker_heading: VITTI
