text: The screen divides into smaller squares accommodating the

text: The ball comes back, but she is across the court with
text: lightning speed and putting every ounce of energy into the
text: shot, returns it again.
text: We are inside her head: only the sound of her furious
text: breathing, the ball and the squeak of tennis shoes can be
dialog: heard.
text: Back comes the ball, again and again, each time, Billie Jean
dialog: punches it back until....
text: .++The world crashes in: a sudden surge of applause and

speaker_heading: UMPIRE V/O
text: Game, set and match to Miss King.

speaker_heading: MICHAEL 0/S

speaker_heading: BOBBY RIGGS

speaker_heading: MICHAEL 0/S
dialog: No, Sir.
text: Sits back. Opens his desk drawer. Pulls out a pack of cards.

scene_heading: 6 INT. CHURCH. DAY. 6

scene_heading: GAMBLERS ANON LEADER
dialog: Would anybody else like to speak?
dialog: sir?

speaker_heading: ADDICTS

speaker_heading: BOBBY RIGGS
dialog: At least that’s what Priscilla

text: His face briefly shines and then he remembers.
speaker_heading: BOBBY RIGGS (CONT’D)
dialog: She's gonna leave me unless I quit
dialog: gambling.
dialog: A couple of ‘we hear you, Bobby’s from the room.
speaker_heading: BOBBY RIGGS (CONT'D)
dialog: Puzzles me, this word: gambling.
dialog: Every time she gets the car out the
dialog: garage Priscilla’s gambling big
dialog: time. Never checks the mirror,
text: sticks it in reverse, puts her foot
text: down, straight out onto the
dialog: highway. Jeez Louise, that’s
dialog: gambling. But here I am. Gamblers
dialog: Anonymous.
dialog: 
scene_heading: GAMBLERS ANON LEADER
dialog: And what’s your point, Bobby
speaker_heading: BOBBY RIGGS
dialog: My point? Everybody gambles all the
dialog: time. Life’s a gamble, right?
dialog: That's the thrill of it: this way
dialog: or that way, the yes or the no, the
dialog: heads or the tails of being alive!
dialog: Yet here I am and here you are,
dialog: heads bowed, ashamed of ourselves.
dialog: But that ain’t right. You fellas
dialog: aren't here cos you're gamblers-
dialog: we're all gamblers. You're here cos
dialog: you're terrible gamblers. That's
dialog: what the problem is. You lose,
dialog: right? And you end up here.
text: More ashamed nods from the Gamblers.
speaker_heading: BOBBY RIGGS (CONT'D)
dialog: I get it. But there’s one thing
dialog: worse than losing, friends: it’s

text: This is taking a surprising turn. Even Bobby is cheering up.
speaker_heading: BOBBY RIGGS (CONT'D)
dialog: Heads up, fellas, we can turn this
dialog: around, we can get back in the
dialog: game, we will get back in the
dialog: game...
dialog: Everyone's listening now. This isn’t the inspirational speech
dialog: they were expecting, but they like it.
scene_heading: GAMBLERS ANON LEADER
dialog: I’m not sure that-
speaker_heading: BOBBY RIGGS
dialog: I play a bit of cards, but sports
dialog: is my bag: tennis, golf, shooting
dialog: hoops, whatever it is, there’s a
dialog: bet to made. And if there isn’t I
dialog: don’t get out of bed. I hear you
text: guys yammering on, and I realized.
dialog: I see the problem. What you gotta
dialog: do is get yourselves a thing.
speaker_heading: GAMBLER
dialog: A thing?
speaker_heading: BOBBY RIGGS
dialog: Yeah, a thing! An edge, an angle,
text: the inside track, the sniff in the
dialog: wind, the thing that turns you from
text: a gambler to a hustler, from a
dialog: loser to a winner. A thing!
scene_heading: GAMBLERS ANON LEADER
dialog: This is not what we should be
dialog: talking about here.
speaker_heading: BOBBY RIGGS
dialog: Why do you want to stop us doing

text: The Leader is nonplussed.
speaker_heading: BOBBY RIGGS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Flowers from your parents! We

dialog: meal, wouldn’t that be something?
dialog: Billie Jean?
text: In the bathroom, in a long evening gown, Billie Jean is
text: putting on earrings. She is lost in her own thoughts.
speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BILLIE JEAN

dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: BILLIE JEAN
dialog: It isn’t working, Larry.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: What isn’t?
speaker_heading: BILLIE JEAN
dialog: You and me. Us. Being married.
dialog: We're never in the same place at

dialog: don’t make each other happy.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I’m happy. And if there’s more I
dialog: can do to make you happy, tell me.
speaker_heading: BILLIE JEAN
dialog: It’s not you, Larry. You know it’s
dialog: not.

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: We've had our moments- which

text: The necklace is tied.
speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Which low-lifes?
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: Our so-called friends, the United

text: Gladys jabs a finger at one particular line. Billie Jean’s

speaker_heading: BILLIE JEAN
dialog: What?! This is outrageous.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: It’s got Jack Kramer’s fingerprints
text: all over it.
speaker_heading: BILLIE JEAN

speaker_heading: GLADYS.
dialog: You may not.
speaker_heading: BOB SANDERS
dialog: You're not supposed to be in here,

speaker_heading: GLADYS

speaker_heading: JACK KRAMER
dialog: Oh, we have a Jewish member now.
dialog: Don’t we, Bob?
speaker_heading: BOB SANDERS

speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: I always find it’s best to be clear

text: Southwest Tournament press release.
text: She bangs the offending piece of paper down on the coffee
text: table, rattling the china.
speaker_heading: JACK KRAMER
dialog: Ah. Yes.
speaker_heading: BILLIE JEAN
dialog: It says you're offering twelve
dialog: thousand dollars to the men’s
dialog: winner and one thousand five
dialog: hundred dollars to the women’s.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: That’s either a misprint or a
dialog: provocation. I might get off with
dialog: manslaughter.
speaker_heading: JACK KRAMER
dialog: No, those are the terms.
speaker_heading: BOB SANDERS
dialog: The men’s prize has to be that high
dialog: to attract the best players. We're
dialog: trying to make this the most
dialog: prestigious tournament in America.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: And paying the women players less
dialog: than ever makes it more
dialog: prestigious. Aha. I get it. I see
dialog: the logic. Hallelujah, my eyes have
dialog: been opened.
speaker_heading: BILLIE JEAN
dialog: -Gladys.
text: Said quietly but firmly. Everybody takes notice.

speaker_heading: BILLIE JEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I just bring it back around to
dialog: the money, Jack?
speaker_heading: JACK KRAMER
dialog: You know I’m sympathetic to your
dialog: cause, Billie Jean. We've talked
dialog: about this--
speaker_heading: BILLIE JEAN
dialog: We have. Many times. You promised
dialog: this year would be different.
speaker_heading: JACK KRAMER
dialog: It's simply a question of what we
dialog: can afford.
speaker_heading: BOB SANDERS
text: People come to see the men play.
dialog: They’re the draw.
speaker_heading: BILLIE JEAN
dialog: Eight times more of a draw?
speaker_heading: BOB SANDERS
dialog: Sorry?
speaker_heading: BILLIE JEAN
dialog: You're offering the men’s winner
dialog: exactly eight times more than the
dialog: women’s winner. Do we bring in an
dialog: eighth of the crowd?
speaker_heading: BOB SANDERS
dialog: I don’t know the percentages--
speaker_heading: BILLIE JEAN
dialog: They sold the exact same number of
dialog: tickets today for the women’s final
dialog: as the men’s final. Isn’t that
dialog: right, Jack?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I suppose so.
speaker_heading: GLADYS.
dialog: Same sales, same prize money. Seems
dialog: fair to me.
speaker_heading: JACK KRAMER
dialog: Be reasonable, there’s no way we
dialog: can afford that.
scene_heading: BATTLE OF THE SEXES - Simon Work File - 4/7/16 13
speaker_heading: BILLIE JEAN
dialog: Then what's your argument? Just
dialog: give me a logical argument why you
dialog: should pay a woman an eighth of
dialog: what you pay a man and I promise
dialog: I'll stop asking.
speaker_heading: JACK KRAMER
dialog: Well, for one thing, the men have
dialog: to support their families.
speaker_heading: BILLIE JEAN
dialog: I'm the main bread winner in my
dialog: family.
speaker_heading: JACK KRAMER
dialog: Look. The men are simply more

dialog: -stronger-
speaker_heading: BOB SANDERS
dialog: -fact-

speaker_heading: JACK KRAMER
dialog: It's not your fault. It’s biology.
speaker_heading: BILLIE JEAN

speaker_heading: JACK KRAMER
