speaker_heading: MARIA (O.S.)
dialog: ...but you took a huge bet on the

text: 1. A MAID clean an expansive living room, waxing a mahogany

dialog: 
text: 2. A BUTLER open sliding doors to an empty grand sitting
dialog: room.
dialog:

speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: They lived through the Depression,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Is that what's happening now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: When I was a kid my favorite

text: And right on cue, we see for the first time -- ROBERT MILLER

speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: Was this freshman econ?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: This was fifth-grade econ.
dialog: (smiles, off her laugh)
dialog: But this is something we've seen
dialog: over and over again, time and time
dialog: again, that competition for this--
dialog: limited amount of dollars out
dialog: there, can make even the best of us
dialog: manic. So it's not surprising that
dialog: we see these asset bubbles, but

scene_heading: INT. FALCON
dialog: 
text: A sleek, slate-gray cabin, divided into three seating areas.
dialog: 
text: At the back of the plane, five AIDES DE CAMP chatter in hushed

speaker_heading: BACK TO
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: 
text: who sits alone in his private area facing the cockpit,

speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Quants? Derivatives structures?
dialog: What was that about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAVIN
dialog: It makes no sense.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: That's what you said last week.
dialog: Why'd we go down there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAVIN
dialog: To sign.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: And did we sign?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAVIN
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: No. We did not. Instead I fly two

speaker_heading: GAVIN

scene_heading: INT. ROBERT'S MANSION - ENTRY HALL - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: It's our first glimpse of Robert's home, and it doesn't

text: maintaining period details but updated with a Modernist
text: flair. It actually works.
dialog: 
text: A SERVANT takes Robert's briefcase from him as he enters,
text: handing him three small PRESENTS which he puts under his arm.
dialog: 
text: We HEAR sounds of a DINNER PARTY complete with CHILDREN

dialog: and anticipation.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: A party in progress, dinner already served.
dialog: 
text: Seated around a large square table are: ELLEN (58, Robert's

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN
scene_heading: (LIGHTING UP)
dialog: Look, your grandfather's here!
dialog: 
text: The kids clamor for Robert's attention. He moves around the

speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Hi, guys!
dialog: Goldenrod - 4.17.11 5.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDCHILD
dialog: Hi Grampi! What did you bring us?
dialog: 
text: Robert hands out the presents, and the kids unwrap them in a
text: frenzy. He continues making the rounds until he finally gets to
text: Brooke and Peter, seated next to each other.
dialog: 
text: They embrace, but we notice clear restraint, a marked contrast
text: to his behavior towards their kids.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: It's your birthday, Dad, not theirs.
dialog: You're spoiling them rotten.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBERT
speaker_heading: (GRINNING)

dialog: 
text: Robert rounds the table and takes his seat next to Ellen as
text: she discreetly waves to the SERVANTS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: We had to eat. The kids were
dialog: starving...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: (hugging her, happy)
dialog: No, no that's okay. Where's my
dialog: drink, is this mine, here?
dialog: 
text: Another SERVANT enters with a CAKE flickering birthday

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALL
text: HEY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY!
dialog: 
text: Robert smiles. They finish cheering, then CLINK glasses for a
dialog: toast.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Thank you, thank you, thank you all
dialog: very much, it's such a surprise, I
dialog: didn't even know it was my birthday!
dialog: 
text: Everyone laughs a little.
dialog: Goldenrod - 4.17.11 6.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: What did Mark Twain say about? He
dialog: said-- old age... is clearly a case
dialog: of mind over matter. If you don't
dialog: mind, it doesn't matter.
speaker_heading: (MORE LAUGHTER)
dialog: I've done a lot of things in my life,
dialog: worked very hard, but being here,
dialog: looking around-- at all these shining,
dialog: radiant faces, I know that my best
dialog: work is right here in this room, right
dialog: now... I'm deeply proud of all of you.
dialog: That's the best gift your mother and I
dialog: could have hoped for,
speaker_heading: (KISSES ELLEN)
dialog: so, thank you...

speaker_heading: PETER
speaker_heading: (CALLING OUT)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Oh, here we go!
dialog: 
text: More group LAUGHTER.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Although your one-track mind assures
dialog: me you've got not only your mother's
dialog: genes, but you've got mine, too!
dialog: 
text: More LAUGHTER. Robert laughs, too. He sees Ellen hug Peter
text: across the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, I'm aware that may seem
dialog: uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me
dialog: sixty years to realize what's truly
dialog: important -- and it's you guys so thank
dialog: you all very much.

speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: I don't know about me as a mom.

speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: No, no no, you should have-- I want

dialog: 
text: Robert brings the drinks to the banquette where Brooke rests

speaker_heading: BROOKE
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: It's all about you, isn't it.
speaker_heading: (POINTS)
dialog: Four... and nineteen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Yeah, yeah yeah...
dialog: 
text: Brooke nods, tries to smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: So what was that all about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: The last time you made a speech like that
dialog: we lost the Firestone bid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBERT
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: Yeah, well... I just... wanted it
dialog: to be about the family tonight.
dialog: 
text: She nods again, unconvinced, then pulls out a MAGAZINE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: You see this?
dialog: 
text: He looks closely at it. A "Forbes" cover story:
dialog: 
dialog: "Robert Miller, the Oracle of Gracie Square: Investor profits
dialog: in uncertain times by predicting housing crisis."
dialog: Goldenrod - 4.17.11 8.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Yeah... Oy. You know how I feel
dialog: about that. Trash can.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Peter's got a copy pinned up in the
dialog: conference room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBERT
text: (sits back, takes a drink)
dialog: Well, you gonna keep skirting around it?
dialog: 
text: Brooke leans back and stares at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Why sell our company? We make a
dialog: great return, we give money to the
dialog: causes we believe in...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: My darling, you are still in your 20's.
dialog: I am 60. That's a big difference in
text: point of view.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Dad, you're not that old.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBERT
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: It catches up alright. And maybe
dialog: there's some other things I'd like to
dialog: do. Maybe I would like to spend a

text: outside the office.
dialog: 
text: Brooke shoots him a look.

speaker_heading: ROBERT (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (GROWING IMPATIENT)

scene_heading: INT. LOFT APARTMENT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: JULIE CÔTE (32) sits at the head of a marble table in the

text: modern woman: sleek, fit, and flowing, even at home.
dialog: 
text: She's intently focused, handwriting personal notes onto a stack
text: of INVITATIONS for the "Julie Côte Gallery - Paintings by Victor
text: Rodriguez - April 10th" as she downs the last of a WHITE WINE.
text: She's got a seating chart out that she's working on.

scene_heading: INT. JULIE'S LOFT - SAME
dialog: 
text: Robert enters. Julie is already back at the table, writing.

dialog: 
text: He comes up behind her, running his arms across her stomach.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (standing in frustration)
dialog: Okay...
dialog: 
text: She crosses to the open kitchen and pours out more wine,
text: lights a cigarette. Robert trails.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm
dialog: late. I'm always late-- you know
dialog: that-- and I'm sorry. And I'm
dialog: always saying I'm sorry about being

dialog: (crosses to her)
dialog: It doesn't mean I wouldn't rather

dialog: 
text: They stare at each other as she drags off the cigarette, then

speaker_heading: DEFINITIVE)

scene_heading: INT. GREENBERG &amp; COMPANY - OFFICE HALL - THE NEXT DAY

speaker_heading: JULIE

speaker_heading: BROOKE

speaker_heading: ROBERT

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BROOKE

speaker_heading: ROBERT

speaker_heading: BROOKE

speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: You remember Alexanderov? Well he
dialog: came to see me one day last year.
dialog: He said "Robert, we've got a great
dialog: opportunity- there's a copper mine,
dialog: it's in Russia, it's under-
dialog: exploited- there's billions under
dialog: the ground, and to get it out, all
dialog: we need is a couple hundred
dialog: million, you put in a hundred,
dialog: we'll put in a hundred- we'll
dialog: triple it all in six months." So, I
dialog: go check it out. And the geological
dialog: survey's right, friendly
dialog: government. And to lock it in, you
dialog: hedge it, right? Sell the copper
dialog: ahead on the commodities exchange
dialog: and it all works, it's fine, and
dialog: you're making a fortune.
dialog: (beat, then real fast)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: Goldenrod - 4.17.11 65.
speaker_heading: ROBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: But then there's something I hadn't
dialog: accounted for-- variation margin--
dialog: and that friendly Russian
dialog: government all of a sudden not so
dialog: friendly anymore and they're
dialog: blocking the export of the copper
dialog: so I gotta make it up, I gotta put
dialog: the cash in to cover the hedge. But
dialog: I'm not worried about it because
dialog: it's still springing money, there's
dialog: so much money coming out of the
dialog: ground you can't believe. You can't
dialog: stop it. And, yes, I'm the oracle,
dialog: I've done housing, I've arb'd
