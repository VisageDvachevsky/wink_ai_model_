speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: 1	EXT. BOREAL FOREST - ALASKA - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
text: Flying. Not at the intangible height of a jet, but at
text: spitting distance from the treetops. We're in central
text: Alaska, the Big Lonely, just north of the Arctic Circle.
text: A thick forest follows the contours of mountain foothills
text: like a deep-pile carpet. Up at treeline the forest thins to
text: tundra, a grassy scruff turning red and yellow with the
dialog: coming of autumn.
text: On the horizon, the hills rise to meet the Endicott
text: Mountains, a great fortress wall of granite so sharp and
dialog: jagged that snow cannot stick to its face. This is how all
dialog: North America once looked -- raw, indomitable.
text: Then, abruptly coming into the SCENE is a colossal etching
text: across the landscape too deliberate to be of natural origin.
text: Bisecting this country like a metallic ribbon -- or a scar,
dialog: depending on your point of view -- is the 800-mile-long
text: Trans-Alaskan Pipeline.
text: Even the immensity of the pipeline is rendered insignificant
text: by the vastness of the land. It goes on, and on, and on...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: A lone MAN walks along the Haul Road, a one-lane gravel
text: trail running parallel to the pipeline. The weather turns
text: sour -- rough wind and stinging snow cut across the man's
dialog: path.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: The man is ERIC DESMOND, twenty-four, clean-shaven,
text: determined. He's clearly out of place here, dressed in a
text: business suit and a light, camel-hair topcoat.
text: Eric is trying to follow some footprints in the snow -- a
text: predator's tracks, those of a wolf or coyote. But the
text: footprints ahead have faded, covered by the snow and wind.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: The weather becomes more oppressive. Heavy snow, gale winds
text: and sub-zero temperatures make his progress tortuous. Eric
text: strives stubbornly forward.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: 1	CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: Eric has gathered some branches. He tries to make a fire.
text: Moisture from his breath has frozen in the upturned collar
text: of his insufficient coat, and his skin is split raw from the
dialog: cold.
text: His hands are too numb to hold the matches. After several
text: attempts at striking one, he slumps down next to the pile of
text: wood, exhausted and frustrated.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: The snow has covered the pile of branches. Eric still sits
text: next to it, partially covered in snow himself.
speaker_heading: ERIC
text: His face is a death mask: eyes half-open and dull, lips a
text: purplish blue, bloodless skin crystallizing as it ices over.
text: The wind HOWLS around him. The snow sticks to his eyelashes
text: and hair without melting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: END DREAM
scene_heading: 2	INT. DARK BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Eric bolts up in bed. Next to him, ANNE MARIE GAUVIN sits
text: up and hugs him. All that can be seen of her in the dark is
text: a lovely silhouette and a cascade of dark hair. After a
text: moment, Eric kisses her. He shakes off the dream and lies
text: back down.
scene_heading: 3	EXT. HAUL ROAD AND PIPELINE - CLOSE - DAY
text: A metal sign, peppered with shotgun holes, is posted near a
dialog: pipeline support piling:
dialog: 
scene_heading: PIPELINE UTILITY CORRIDOR
speaker_heading: PRIVATE PROPERTY
speaker_heading: NO TRESPASSING
speaker_heading: NO	 HUNTING
speaker_heading: NO	 TRAPPING
speaker_heading: NO	 SHOOTING
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Eric walks quietly past the sign, intent on something ahead
text: of him. Although still somewhat boyish in appearance, he's
text: confident and resolute in attitude. His clothes have a
dialog: distinctly western feel: Lucchese boots, Levis 501's, Mahan
text: cotton shirt. His down parka is unzipped in the sunny,
text: windless, forty-degree afternoon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: 3	CONTINUED:
text: He pauses, then brings to his shoulder a rifle with a
text: four-power scope mounted atop it. He peers through the
dialog: scope.
scene_heading: HIS POV - THROUGH SCOPE
text: He puts the crosshairs on the shoulder flank of a big,
text: ivory-white timber wolf, fifty yards away.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: Anne Marie stands beside Eric, a Nikon with a telephoto lens
text: in her hand, holding her breath in anticipation. She's
text: twenty-three, pretty, with soft features and piercing blue
text: eyes. She wears Eddie Bauer woman's gear like she was born
dialog: in it.
text: Eric expertly fixes his aim and slowly squeezes the trigger.
text: But instead of a loud retort, there is only the dull POP of
text: a CO2-powered dart gun.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: The tranquilizer dart finds its mark in the wolf's fleshy
text: shoulder. The wolf takes off running, but almost
text: immediately slows, sits, then lies down.
text: Eric and Anne Marie hurry over to the wolf, who is breathing
text: deeply. Eric kneels next to him and strokes his thick fur.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What a beauty.
dialog: (to Anne Marie)
dialog: Hand me the transmitter.
text: Anne Marie passes to Eric a tiny, weatherproof homing device
text: attached to a steel collar band. Eric puts the collar
text: loosely around the wolf's neck and crimps it in place, all
text: the while TALKING soothingly to the semi-conscious animal.
text: Anne Marie smiles at Eric's tenderness and snaps some
dialog: photos.
text: With the collar in place and transmitter activated, Eric
text: backs away while the wolf tries to rouse itself from its
dialog: narcosis.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: He's coming around fine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE MARIE
dialog: Be right back. I left my
text: camcorder in the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: 3	CONTINUED: (2)
scene_heading: FOLLOW ANNE MARIE
text: as she hurries back to their International Scout. On the
text: door of the Scout is a stylized logo of an oil derrick,
dialog: under which are the words:
dialog: 
scene_heading: NORTHLAND PETROLEUM CORP.
text: Anne Marie opens the hatchback and grabs a video camera.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON ERIC AND THE WOLF
text: Eric smiles as the wolf wobbles tentatively to his feet and
text: trots unsteadily away. Near the treeline the wolf turns,
text: glances back at Eric and then disappears into the forest.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: Anne Marie is taping the wolf's retreat. Looking through
text: the viewfinder, she crosses a gully between a pipeline
text: piling and a rock formation. Eric turns toward her and a
text: glint of light in the debris at her feet catches his eye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Anne Marie! Stop!
text: She glances down. Something metal is half-buried in the
text: dead leaves and gravel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Don't move.
text: Eric runs over. He pokes at the object with a stick. With
text: a SNAP, a steel leg trap chomps the stick in half. Anne
text: Marie jumps back. Eric brushes the dead leaves on the
text: ground behind her and she carefully backtracks out of the
dialog: gully.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Goddamn trappers!
text: He angrily rips the trap out of the ground, unearthing
text: several others attached to one another by a long chain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (continuing)
text: Takes nerve, laying traplines on
dialog: restricted land.
text: Eric slips the scope off the dart rifle and climbs up the
text: pipeline on foot pegs to the top of an anchoring poINT.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: 3	CONTINUED: (3)
text: Using the scope as a telescope, he scans up and down the
dialog: Haul Road.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE MARIE
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: He still might be around. I saw
text: fresh tire tracks coming in.
scene_heading: HIS POV - THROUGH SCOPE
text: The road and the pipeline stretch toward either horizon,
text: north and south. In the distance, a jeep is parked on the
text: Haul Road. Near it, a Man climbs down into another shallow
text: ravine.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: Eric hurries down the footpegs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
text: Man and a jeep, about a mile and
text: a half down.
text: He jumps into the Scout. Anne Marie stuffs her cameras into
text: the hatchback. As soon as she climbs in, Eric tears out.
scene_heading: 4	INT. SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)
text: It races along the dusty gravel road at 60 MPH.
scene_heading: 5	EXT. HAUL ROAD
text: Startled at the APPROACH of the Scout, the Trapper uproots
text: his traps and runs out of the ravine. He WHISTLES and
text: another Trapper appears nearby.
scene_heading: 6	INT. TRAPPERS' JEEP
text: They pile into their dilapidated, all-terrain jeep. It's
text: oddly well-equipped, however. Bolted to the dashboard is an
text: expensive tape player and a beat-up radio beacon receiver
text: with a round locating screen. They zoom off.
scene_heading: 7	INT. SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)
text: Eric stomps on the gas. The dust from the jeep obscures his
text: view but he's gaining on them anyway. Anne Marie hangs on
text: and squints her eyes against the choking dust.
scene_heading: 8	INT. TRAPPERS' JEEP - (MOVING SHOT)
text: The driver is LEMALLE (35), a tall, ugly, rawboned Canadian.
text: His entire outfit is made of animal hide. He has long red
text: hair, and a reptilian face usually twisted into a sadistic
text: sneer. While driving, he scans along the pipeline.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEMALLE
dialog: Where the fuck did you drop
dialog: Corbett off?
text: In the passenger seat, MITCHELL (38), chews tobacco and
text: looks grim. He's a squat, flat-faced Okie, with curly
text: matted hair and tired grey eyes. He's dressed in a brown
text: long coat and has a Colt .45 Peacemaker in a quick-draw
text: holster strapped to his leg. Despite his intimidating air,
dialog: confrontation is not his style.
text: He spots a figure up ahead, where the road crosses a muddy
dialog: creek.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: He's over there.
scene_heading: 9	EXT. HAUL ROAD
text: Turning sharply, the trappers' jeep splashes through the
text: creek bed without slowing. Bouncing, it comes down hard
text: against the axle-deep bank at the creek's high water mark.
text: LeMalle tries to back out, but can't find traction in the
dialog: mud.
text: Eric stops the Scout thirty yards behind them.
scene_heading: 10 INT. SCOUT
text: Eric opens his door. To Anne Marie:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Stay here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE MARIE
dialog: Be careful -- there're two of
dialog: them.
text: Eric reaches in the back seat and hands something to Anne
dialog: Marie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: If I unzip my parka, stick this
text: out the window.
scene_heading: 11 EXT. HAUL ROAD
text: Eric confidently approaches the jeep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: 11 CONTINUED:
text: Then, a third trapper climbs from the creek. He's got a
text: line of traps slung around his neck and a world of
text: experience on his face. He's BEN CORBETT, a life-long
text: huntsman, somewhere past forty, weathered beyond his years.
text: He has a feral nose, thick beard and dark, smart, hunter's
text: eyes. He wears a hooded cotton sweat shirt, cotton
text: coveralls and vapor-barrier mountain boots. On his belt is
text: a holster rig cradling a .44 magnum revolver.
text: Eric slows down. He didn't expect to face anyone as
dialog: formidable as Corbett.
scene_heading: 12 INT. / EXT. JEEP
text: Emboldened by Corbett's presence, LeMalle reaches into the
text: back seat and grabs his 6.5 by 55 Swedish military carbine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: (to LeMalle)
dialog: No shooting. Let's see who's so
dialog: interested in us.
text: Corbett has an incongruously affable voice. He throws his
text: traps into the jeep, then strides closer toward Eric.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (to Corbett)
dialog: Ain't worth it, Ben...
scene_heading: 13 EXT. HAUL ROAD - CREEK CROSSING - LONG SHOT
text: As Corbett comes closer, Eric realizes this might not've
text: been a great idea. Corbett squints his eyes and sniffs the
text: air, as if by this he can gauge his opponent's mettle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You got two counts against you --
dialog: trapping out of season and
text: poaching on restricted land.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: Can't be much of a crime, if all
dialog: they got minding the area is a
dialog: cocky kid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I got your plate number, asshole.
dialog: Maybe you feel like spending a
dialog: few months in jail.
text: Corbett just smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: 13 CONTINUED:
text: But LeMalle, rankled, sticks the carbine out the jeep
dialog: window.
text: Seeing the rifle pointed at him, Eric freezes, then slowly
text: unzips his parka.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEMALLE
dialog: Ben? Sure you don't want me to
dialog: drop the fucker?
text: Corbett doesn't answer. Then, his eyes narrow and he looks
text: past Eric at the Scout.
speaker_heading: CORBETT'S POV
text: The passenger in the Scout sticks what looks like another
text: rifle out the window.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: Eric quickly glances over his shoulder to make sure Anne
text: Marie's backing him up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You leave and don't come back,
dialog: that's the end of it.
text: After a long moment, Corbett smiles again, then turns away
text: from Eric. He motions LeMalle to the front of the jeep.
text: Frustrated, LeMalle slams back the safety on the carbine and
text: throws it in the back seat.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON TRAPPERS
text: Mitchell climbs into the jeep and starts the engine.
text: LeMalle and Corbett rock the jeep back and forth in the rut.
text: While pushing, Corbett rips the sole of his boot on a sharp
text: piece of granite. He cusses and pushes harder.
scene_heading: 14 EXT. HAUL ROAD - CREEK CROSSING
text: Eric walks back to the Scout. He feels the trappers' eyes
text: on his back, but forces himself not to hurry.
text: The trappers free their vehicle. Corbett gets in the
text: driver's seat, and they take off.
scene_heading: 15 INT. SCOUT
text: Anne Marie's hands are shaking as she pulls the plastic
text: tranquilizer rifle back in the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: 15 CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: ANNE MARIE
dialog: (unnerved)
dialog: Great idea -- pointing a lousy

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Bastards took off, though, didn't
dialog: they?
scene_heading: 16 EXT. BOREAL FOREST - LATER THAT DAY
text: The trappers have left the flatlands of the Haul Road area.
text: Now their jeep climbs a pathway over the rolling foothills.
scene_heading: 17 INT. TRAPPERS' JEEP - (MOVING SHOT)
text: Corbett broods while driving. Mitchell looks out the
text: window. The silence makes LeMalle uncomfortable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEMALLE
dialog: All this fuckin' land, and we're
dialog: locked out. Makes me puke.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: Jawing about it won't change it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEMALLE
dialog: Three hundred seventy-five
dialog: million acres in this state. I'm
dialog: real tired of runnin' into
dialog: people.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Then don't look to your left.
scene_heading: 18 EXT. SPORTSMEN'S CAMP
text: A brand-new Land Rover is parked on an alluvial fan in a
text: bend in a small river. Scattered about is an assortment of
text: expensive camping gear, beer cans, spent shells and other
dialog: garbage.
text: Three toy-macho, vacationing SPORTSMEN are guzzling beer and
text: BLASTING fish in the shallow river with 12-gauge shotguns.
text: They look up and glower suspiciously as the jeep slows and
dialog: stops.
scene_heading: 19 INT. TRAPPERS' JEEP
text: LeMalle grabs his carbine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: Leave it here.

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: 19 CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: (pats Mitchell's shoulder)
dialog: Relax. I just want to ask them
dialog: how the hunting is.
scene_heading: 20 EXT. SPORTSMEN'S CAMP
text: Corbett gets out of the jeep. He regards the Sportsmen,
text: their shotguns and their mess with ill-concealed contempt.
text: The Sportsmen clutch their weapons and watch Corbett. He
text: walks around the camp, spotting a rubber-lined rucksack
text: stuffed with dead ermine. After a long, tense moment,
text: Corbett smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: Looks like you've had some luck.
dialog: Where's your guide?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPORTSMAN #1
dialog: We're on our own, if it's any of
dialog: your damn business.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: (re ermine)
dialog: You did real good.
text: He crouches next to the dead animals and strokes the fur.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEMALLE
dialog: (to Corbett)
dialog: No swinging shit. They're over
dialog: their goddamned limit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: (to Sportsmen)
dialog: My friend is right. Supposed to
dialog: have a licensed guide when you're
dialog: on this land, too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPORTSMAN #1
dialog: Hey, we paid our fuckin' permit
dialog: fees.
text: LeMalle amuses himself by pissing in their campfire. No one
text: notices that in the b.g., quiet Sportsman #3 unzips his
text: parka, exposing a .45 Peacemaker in a belt holster.

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

dialog: the government took it over.
dialog: Only Innuit can hunt here now,

text: Corbett swings the rucksack of carcasses onto the hood of
text: the Land Rover. Pissed, Sportsmen #1 and #2 step closer to
dialog: him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: According to tribal law, hunters
dialog: passing through the land of
dialog: another tribe can only take game
dialog: to survive. They can eat the
dialog: meat, but have to surrender the
dialog: hides.
text: LeMalle pulls a hunting knife and holds up one of the
dialog: ermine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEMALLE
dialog: Want the meat?

speaker_heading: SPORTSMAN #1
dialog: Fuck you, dirtball.
text: Corbett chuckles and Mitchell spits.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: LeMalle digs through the camping goodies in the back of the

speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: Suddenly, Sportsman #3 reaches inside his parka and pulls
text: the pistol. He swings it toward LeMalle.
text: LeMalle looks up when he hears the HAMMER cock.
text: There is a deafeningly loud SHOT.
text: Sportsman #3 falls down dead at LeMalle's feet.
text: Off to one side, Corbett holds a huge, smoking .44 magnum
text: six-shooter in his hand.
text: Shotgun in hand, Sportsman #1 gauges his chances of blasting
text: Corbett. Nil. When Corbett turns to him, he lies the
text: weapon down. Sportsman #2 rushes to his friend.
text: Looking bleak, Mitchell spits again. Corbett crosses to
text: LeMalle and knocks from his hands the things he wanted to
text: steal. Chastised, LeMalle smolders. After a moment:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: (to Sportsmen)
dialog: Put him in your truck. Smell of
dialog: blood will attract the bears.
dialog: (to trappers)
dialog: Let's go.
text: As Corbett walks to the jeep, he's too angry to notice that
text: he's stepped in a patch of mud under the Land Rover.
text: Near the jeep, LeMalle stops and pulls them into a huddle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEMALLE
dialog: I don't believe in leavin'

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL

text: Corbett and Mitchell get in their jeep.
speaker_heading: LEMALLE
text: isn't yet satisfied. He walks back over to the Sportsmen,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEMALLE
dialog: Think I'm pretty? You better
dialog: forget how we look, 'cause next
dialog: time they won't keep me from
dialog: killing you. This land ain't
dialog: quite civilized, you know...
text: He unsheathes his buck knife. BELOW FRAME, he slices across
text: the forehead of the dead Sportsman, peels back his scalp and
text: cuts it loose, Indian-style. The Sportsmen are stunned and
dialog: sickened.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON TRAPPERS' JEEP

scene_heading: 21 EXT. DEVIL'S CAULDRON - DUSK
text: Devil's Cauldron Hot Springs is a cluster of twenty tiny

text: miles north of the Arctic Circle. Thirty miles east of the
text: Pipeline, it's almost dead center of interior Alaska.
text: At the edge of town is a gravel airstrip. Mixed with the
text: prospector-era sod-roof cabins are a few prefabricated
text: houses. The boon brought by men building the pipeline is
text: long gone. Now only a few itinerant loggers, natives and
text: bush dwellers remain to fight boredom, each other and the

scene_heading: 23 INT. KENAI'S GENERAL STORE
text: A handwritten public notice next to a schedule of church
dialog: meetings reads: "Live each day so you can look every damn

text: The trappers come in. Corbett sits in a chair and pulls his
text: boots off. One of his wool socks is wet. He nods to the
text: man sitting in the other chair, SAM WILDER. Wilder is short

text: The front module is 12 by 24, the rear 12 by 18.
text: An extended-cab pickup pulls up and Sam Wilder gets out.
text: The gravel-and-dirt Haul Road, paralleling the pipeline for

text: Wilder stays on his feet.
text: Corbett hurries back to the door. Wilder lunges,

speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: Smart? Sure. That's why I'm

speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Been driving long?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I needed a pilot's license to
dialog: take the job here, so I got one
dialog: in six weeks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: That makes the flight more
dialog: interesting.
text: Eric ignores the jibe. He stays at 2,000 feet, making the
text: landscape all the more immediate.
text: Corbett stares out the window and broods. He spots an open,
text: snow-covered area where some dark blotches mar the
dialog: whiteness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: See the blood? Pack of wolves
text: took down a moose. Greedy,

speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: Hunting and trapping was a damn
dialog: fine life.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle,
dialog: we were teams. I'd always go
dialog: with Mitchell. Good man,
dialog: Mitchell. I'd let Bob worry
dialog: about goddamn LeMalle. We'd hire
text: a plane in October. On the way
text: to a dirt airstrip somewhere,
dialog: we'd drop supplies. We'd land,
dialog: tell the pilot to come back for
dialog: us a few days before Christmas.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - (AERIAL SHOT)
text: While talking in an even tone, Corbett intently studies the
text: instrument panel and scans the landscape below.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: The idea was to get to the
dialog: supplies before the bears did.
dialog: Along the route we'd set our
dialog: traps. Made our year's living in
dialog: three months.
text: Corbett spots a flat plateau farther in the mountains, above
text: the tree line.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Lot of times we didn't even have
text: a landing strip. We'd set down
dialog: on a plateau, like that one
dialog: there. Yeah, that one's easy;
dialog: you could glide right in...
text: Suddenly, he turns in the seat and pins Eric against the
text: door with his left foot.
text: The plane flies erratically. With his right foot, Corbett
text: kicks the fuel jettison lever on the instrument panel,
text: jamming it on.
scene_heading: 90 EXT. CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
text: The lever, used to empty the fuel tanks in case of
text: emergency, does so with great expediency. All the gas is
text: instantly discharged.
scene_heading: 91 INT. CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
text: Corbett releases Eric and calmly sits back up in his seat.
text: Eric rubs his neck, incredulous. Corbett's move was too
text: fast and too outrageous. In a moment, the engine SPUTTERS
text: to a stop. Eric struggles to hold the stick steady and
text: glide the plane down to the plateau Corbett pointed out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: Hope you got your money's worth
dialog: on those lessons.
scene_heading: 92 EXT. CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
text: There's an even chance of hitting a mountain instead of the
text: plateau. Eric pushes the Cessna's nose down. The plateau
text: comes up fast.
text: The plane drops lower and lower, pitching and yawing in the
dialog: wind.
text: It CRASH LANDS, its metal underbelly SCREECHING as it hits
text: the jagged granite under the snow. It stops suddenly,
text: flipping tail over nose.
scene_heading: 93 INT. CESSNA
text: It rests upside down in the snow. The men are dazed.
text: Behind Eric, one of the extra fuel cans, now hanging upside
text: down, leaks gas. In front of him, the engine is ON FIRE.
text: Eric undoes his seat belt and rights himself, but his leg
text: gets caught in the tangled belt. He pulls out a Swiss Army
text: knife and cuts the rope binding Corbett's handcuffs to the
text: seat. Corbett pushes the passenger door open. Panicking,
text: Eric tries to pull loose of his seat belt, painfully
text: wrenching his ankle.
scene_heading: 94 EXT. CESSNA
text: Corbett rolls out into the snow. With no time to grab his
text: supplies, Eric clambers from the wreckage. He and Corbett
text: crawl/roll down the incline of the plateau, away from the
dialog: plane.
text: A moment later the leaking gas reaches the burning engine
text: and the Cessna EXPLODES.
speaker_heading: WIDER

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: 94 CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: ERIC

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Last time I checked the flight
dialog: plan, we were forty miles
text: northeast of Devil's Cauldron.
dialog: Southwest is that way. No sense
dialog: waiting for a goddamn taxi.
text: Grimacing with pain, he gets up. Clutching the magnum, he
text: shoves Corbett in front of him and starts walking. Corbett
text: frowns -- it's tough to trudge through the snow with his
text: arms cuffed tightly behind his back.
text: Eric looks around and tries not to let his emotions register
text: on his face. They wouldn't be farther from the rest of
text: humanity on another planet. Smelling fear on Eric, Corbett
text: enjoys the view. And waits.
scene_heading: 95 EXT. ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - LATER THAT DAY
text: The Endicott range is full of jagged peaks, icy streams and
text: gnarled tundra valleys. Squinting in the glare of the snow,
text: Eric and Corbett trek through the grandiose Gates of the
text: Arctic area. The smoldering plane wreckage is a hard-won,
text: snow-covered mile behind them.
text: Intricate patterns of fragmented rock, strips of scruffy
text: tundra and bedrock outcrops produce lonely, foreboding
text: mosaics upon the landscape. The air is still. The silence
text: is itself a disconcerting presence. Ten miles ahead and two
text: thousand feet lower, the forest begins. But here, on the

scene_heading: 96 EXT. ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - DUSK
text: The sun drops behind the mountains. A wind whips up,

text: solid rock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: We'll stop here, dig out a snow
dialog: shelter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: Snow shelter. Okay. You dig.
dialog: I'll have a little sit-down.
text: Corbett sits on his haunches and smiles while Eric digs near

text: move, Eric refuses to let his patronizing air get to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Even in the drifts, this snow's
text: too powdery to make a shelter.
dialog: When you're done jerking around,
text: reach down the back of my coat.
text: Eric approaches him suspiciously. He puts his hand down
text: through Corbett's collar. Something is stowed inside a
text: homemade flap in the lining of his coat. Eric pulls out a
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: 96 CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 97 EXT. NYLON SHELTER - EVENING

scene_heading: 98 INT. NYLON SHELTER
text: The men huddle inside the tarp. Eric keeps a wary eye on
text: Corbett -- at all times he treats him like a rattlesnake.
text: Eric unwraps his ankle and rubs it. It's swollen to the
text: size of a softball.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: Still quite a hike to Devil's
dialog: Cauldron.
dialog: (beat)
text: Days. A long stretch to go
dialog: without sleep, my friend. You

dialog: now, but take your eyes off me

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: -- Turn around.
text: While poking the .357 in Corbett's ribs, Eric one-handedly
text: unlocks Corbett's right manacle, pulls his arm through the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: 99 EXT. HAUL ROAD - DREAM - (AS IN SCENE 3)
text: Eric is hurrying along the pipeline in his business suit,

scene_heading: 100 EXT. ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - DAWN

scene_heading: 101 INT. NYLON SHELTER
text: The light hits Eric's eyes. He bolts awake from a fitful
text: sleep. Corbett sits, already awake, looking like he'd
text: uproot the rock to which he's chained if he could. He waits
dialog: for an opportunity -- any opportunity -- with the patience

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 102 EXT. ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - SMALL VALLEY - DAY
text: Eric and Corbett trudge up to the bank of a frozen stream

text: hurry. Frustrated, but making dead sure he's always got the
text: drop on Corbett, Eric puts a tentative foot on the ice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: Ice is too thin -- you can see
text: the water moving underneath.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: We're not sitting here 'til

speaker_heading: 102 CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: Wait 'til I'm across!
text: Eric doesn't want to be too far from his prisoner. He keeps

text: Corbett is three feet from solid ground. He drops to his
text: knees, then stomach, and rolls like a log the rest of the
dialog: way.
text: Eric splays out on the ice and crabwalks across. The ice
text: makes an ominous CRACKING and water begins to seep through
dialog: air holes.
text: Standing, Corbett weighs his chances of bolting from Eric.

scene_heading: 106 EXT. ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - DAY
text: Eric limps further down from the mountains. Corbett keeps
text: pace in front of him and his magnum. As their altitude

text: Their tracks in the snow stretch up behind them into the
text: distance. The magnificence and grandeur of the surroundings
text: cannot be overstated. Picture the most rustic, overwhelming
text: wilderness imaginable, and then make it ten times larger.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE - LATER
text: The men's way is once again interrupted, this time by a
text: sheer granite drop. The steep decline would be tough to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: Have to backtrack, find another

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Forget it. It would take days.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: (assessing the drop)
dialog: Going to be a bit of a challenge
text: with handcuffs on.
text: Eric realizes he's right. After some deliberation, Eric
text: cautiously approaches him. With the .357 cocked and ready,
text: he undoes one of the cuffs, leaving them hanging from
text: Corbett's wrist. He then unthreads the nylon twine from
text: Corbett's tarp.
scene_heading: ANGLE - GRANITE SHEER
text: Eric and Corbett are tied, belt to belt, with the nylon
text: rope. Corbett inches down first, feet spread for maximum
text: footing, gloveless hands grasping at anything.
text: Eric mimics Corbett's moves and follows the same path.
text: Unable to grasp the rocks effectively, he stops and takes
text: his gloves off. Continuing, he winces -- the rock is cold
text: and sharp. His hands are soon numb and bloody. Even in the
text: dry, below-freezing air, Eric is sweating.
text: He looks down and hangs on more tightly. Sliding to level
text: ground two hundred feet below would pummel him to hamburger.
text: Corbett pauses and rests his cheek against the rocks. Eric
text: is right above him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: 106 CONTINUED:
text: Suddenly, Corbett's foot slips. His right hand
text: instinctively goes for a hold. The dangling handcuffs snare
text: on a protuberance, knocking him off balance.
text: The fulcrum of Corbett's body leans out into the empty air.
text: Eric moves down a little, braces himself and extends his
text: leg, giving Corbett something to grab. Corbett takes hold
text: of Eric's shoe and tries to teeter back against the rock
text: wall. Adrenaline screams through Eric's system.
text: Corbett looks up at Eric. A careless move will send them
text: both tumbling. Eric clutches harder at the rocks and waits
dialog: for the worst.
text: After a long moment, Corbett regains his balance and lets go
text: of Eric's foot. He continues his descent. Eric lets out
text: his breath and tries to swallow. His mouth is as dry as the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 107 EXT. TREELINE - LATER THAT DAY
text: Handcuffed again, Corbett hikes in front of Eric along the
text: top of some foothills. Now and again he glances behind,
text: gauging Eric's weariness, waiting for a moment's
text: carelessness. Around them there is heavy vegetation now --
text: snow-covered sedge tussocks, knee-deep muskeg and twisted
text: thickets that are treacherous and slow to tramp through.
text: Above them, ominous clouds and sharp, cold winds are coming
dialog: down from the north.
text: But below, a mile ahead, the edge of the forest is like the
text: hem of a great green garment stretching endlessly southward.
dialog: The combination of altitude and latitude creates an
text: amazingly sharp topographical dividing line. Within a few
text: thousand yards, the landscape abruptly changes from scrub
text: brush to thick coniferous forest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: Better get into those trees

text: Then, Corbett pauses as a walloping sound ECHOES across the

text: Eric and Corbett move through the storm in slow motion.
dialog: Both recognize the need for a truce in the face of a common
text: enemy. The snow and wind cut through their clothing like
text: razors. They poke around for dead wood with which to make a

text: Awestruck by the intensity of the storm, Eric tears branches
text: from birch trees and piles them in Corbett's handcuffed
dialog: arms.
text: They hurry back to the nylon tarp, strung between two tree
text: trunks, FLAPPING violently in the storm. Hunching against
text: the wind, Eric pulls off his gloves and reaches in his
text: pocket for some precious matches. His fingers are so cold
text: he can't hold them, and he drops several in the wet snow.
text: Angry, he shoots a look at Corbett. Corbett is holding his
text: hands inside his coat. He pulls them out and quickly takes
dialog: the remaining matches from Eric.
text: Crouching down, back to the wind, Corbett grasps a match
text: between his numb fingers and awkwardly strikes it. He holds
text: the flame next to the kindling. It doesn't catch fire
text: immediately. Corbett lets the match burn out against his
text: fingers. He tries another match. This time, a flame takes
text: hold but could succumb to the wind at any moment.
text: On his knees and elbows, Corbett nurses along the tiny fire.
text: Eric can't control his shivering. He gets on his knees next
text: to Corbett and holds his coat open to further baffle the

scene_heading: 112 EXT. / INT. NYLON SHELTER - NIGHT
text: Corbett and Eric sit under the nylon shelter. The STORM
text: rages outside. Eric empties his pockets of Eskimo potato,
text: reindeer lichens, bistsort sorrel and other plants for his
dialog: dinner.
text: Corbett has fashioned a snare from his boot laces and a tree
text: branch, and placed some crushed roots as aromatic bait next
text: to a small animal burrow outside the shelter. A squirrel
text: sticks his nose out of the burrow to investigate.
text: Corbett sits catlike, ready to pounce. Eric grimaces as

scene_heading: 113 INT. NYLON SHELTER
text: Corbett pulls his dead dinner inside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: I need your pocket knife.
dialog: (Eric hesitates)
dialog: I have to eat, too.
text: After a beat, Eric pulls open the small blade on his Swiss

speaker_heading: CORBETT

dialog: Always eat your meat raw when the

scene_heading: 115 EXT. THE TURTLE
text: Her visitor, whoever it is, is behind the Turtle. Anne

speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: A foraging GRIZZLY sniffs around, attracted by the smell of
text: fresh carrion -- Wilder. Eight feet tall and eleven-hundred
dialog: pounds, it's used to having its way. Right now, it's
dialog: hungry.
text: With a casual swipe of its paw, its massive claws puncture
text: the Turtle's aluminum skin, popping open the door of the

text: Wilder's body slumps out into the snow. The bear pushes at

dialog: in.
text: Anne Marie looks around, wondering what the hell to do nEXT.
text: Wilder's snowmobile is a few yards behind her, parked

text: Testily, the bear looks up, SNIFFING loudly.
text: Keeping her eyes on the bear, Anne Marie feels for the
text: snowmobile ignition keys. They're not there. She feels

text: Anne Marie IGNITES the flares. They illuminate the area

text: the flares like Excalibur and moves forward.
text: The bear, reluctant to leave so hearty a pre-hibernation

scene_heading: ANGLE - UNDER THE TURTLE
text: Anne Marie tries to squeeze out the other side, but she's

text: She twists around, looking for a defense. Above her is the

scene_heading: 116 EXT. WOODS NEAR THE TURTLE - SERIES OF SHOTS - NIGHT
text: Wearing one of Eric's coats, Anne Marie stands in the center

text: The big Remington rifle leans against the tree closest to
dialog: her.
text: She tosses one end of a hundred feet of nylon rope over a

dialog: What's the problem with Sam

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENAI
dialog: Pretty clever: If the trappers
dialog: got that signal beacon and get
dialog: here in time, Sam's is the first
dialog: place they'll look. They may
dialog: figure you're waiting for an
dialog: airplane, so you can't stay in

dialog: place they'd expect you is on the

dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: I can't afford any trouble --

dialog: -- Here's a hundred dollars. And
dialog: if you or anyone else will back

speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE

scene_heading: 165 EXT. DEVIL'S CAULDRON - CLOSE ON ERIC

speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: It's Anne Marie. She gasps. Seeing Eric, she's more angry

speaker_heading: ANNE MARIE
dialog: Eric! Why aren't you in

scene_heading: 168 INT. RENTAL CABIN
text: The ten-by-ten cabin is furnished with two sagging cots, a

text: In the spa, water DRIPS somewhere. All the stalls are

text: In his sod house, Kenai looks out his one tiny window at the

text: The trappers' jeep APPEARS in the snowfall on the road into

text: The trappers get out of the jeep. LeMalle has Eric's

text: They fan out and approach Wilder's cabin.
scene_heading: ANGLE WITH TRAPPERS

scene_heading: 171 EXT. DEVIL'S CAULDRON
text: The trappers march through town like an advancing army,

scene_heading: 172 INT. RENTAL CABIN

text: Eric leads Corbett around the back of the spa. A GUNSHOT
text: rings out nearby and a BULLET hits the wall above Eric's
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
text: has seen their faint silhouettes through the snow. He
text: purposely SHOOTS over their heads so he doesn't hit Corbett.
scene_heading: ANGLE BEHIND HOT SPRINGS SPA
text: Eric and Corbett crouch down and double back. They are
text: once again swallowed up by the snowfall.
scene_heading: 200 EXT. ALLEY
text: Viking Bob follows their footprints in between the
text: buildings. He continues to a point where they converge to
text: one set, then stop. He smiles at the naivete of Eric's
text: ploy. Looking at the boardwalk railing above, he assumes
text: Eric and Corbett have swung over it onto the iced-over
text: boardwalk. Pleased with his deduction, Viking Bob continues
text: along the alley.
text: SNAP! Viking Bob lets out a horrible HOWL and falls on his
text: back in the snow. Biting into his right calf is a huge
text: conibear leg trap. In extreme pain, he struggles to lever
text: it open with the barrel of his rifle.
scene_heading: 201 EXT. KENAI'S GENERAL STORE
text: Corbett shoots Eric a dangerous look as Viking Bob's CRIES
text: carry though the town.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: He'll live.
scene_heading: 202 EXT. ALLEY
text: Hearing Viking Bob's cries, Mitchell backtracks and rushes
text: to Viking Bob's aid. Between them, they manage to yawn open
text: the jaws of the trap and free Viking Bob's leg. Viking Bob
text: tries to walk but the leg won't support him -- the bone is
text: broken. Bitterly frustrated, he waves Mitchell on. In
text: agony, Viking Bob eases down in the snow. He tears a strip
text: of lining from his coat and wraps his leg to stop the
dialog: bleeding.
scene_heading: 203 EXT. HOT SPRINGS SPA
text: Anne Marie scurries by on her way to the airstrip.
text: Suddenly, the hot springs door bursts open and LeMalle
text: lunges at her. Stripped of his wet clothes, he's wrapped

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: 203 CONTINUED:
text: in blankets and furs, his feet protected by sacks lashed to
text: them. His wet body and hair steams in the frigid air.
text: Anne Marie lets out a startled cry and springs away from
text: him. She falls hard on her back, knocking her wind out.
text: Scrambling for footing in the snow, LeMalle drops his rifle.
text: He comes at her again. Anne Marie moves away and pulls the
text: .44 magnum out. LeMalle stops and glares at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE MARIE
dialog: (gasping)
dialog: Don't make me shoot.
text: She gets up, keeping the magnum pointed shakily toward him.
text: LeMalle glowers menacingly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE MARIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: We're going to Sam's cabin. You
dialog: can stay in the jail until this
text: is over.
text: LeMalle slowly crouches down for his rifle. Anne Marie
text: wields the handgun at him, but he doesn't stop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEMALLE
dialog: Want to chance it with that
dialog: hog-leg? You can't even hold it
dialog: up. Better drop me first shot,
dialog: bitch, or I'll rip your fuckin'
text: lungs out.
text: Taunting, sneering, LeMalle stares her down. Anne Marie is
text: paralyzed. Feeling that he's won, LeMalle wraps his bony
text: fingers around the stock of the Remington.
text: Anne Marie closes her eyes and FIRES. Pulling the rifle
text: close, LeMalle tucks and rolls and jumps to his feet. Anne
text: Marie FIRES again, and AGAIN. Shot, LeMalle hobbles away,
text: leaving a trail of blood in the snow. Numb, Anne Marie lets
text: her arm fall.
scene_heading: 204 EXT. BOARDWALK NEAR WILDER'S CABIN
text: Eric looks around at the sound of the shooting, fearing the
text: worst. He pulls Corbett off the boardwalk and they cut
text: across open ground toward the airstrip depot.
scene_heading: 205 INT. HOT SPRINGS SPA
text: Kenai looks around at the messy RESULTS of LeMalle's
text: ransacking for things to wear. Kenai turns, startled, when
text: he hears footsteps. It's Neff and Meyerling.

speaker_heading: KENAI

speaker_heading: MEYERLING

speaker_heading: MEYERLING

scene_heading: 206 EXT. YARDS BEHIND AIRSTRIP DEPOT
text: Through the snow, Eric can see the faint outline of the
text: plane on the runway. He and Corbett hurry toward the back
text: of the airstrip depot.
text: As they wend their way through the junk-filled yards, Eric
text: catches a glimpse of movement around a corner, REFLECTED in
text: a pane of glass leaning against a roll of tar paper.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: 206 CONTINUED:
scene_heading: ERIC'S POV - REFLECTION
text: Peacemaker in hand, Mitchell is behind the depot, coming
dialog: right for them.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Eric takes out the homemade flashbomb. He lights it, tosses
text: it toward Mitchell and covers his eyes. It EXPLODES with a
text: muffled pop and a bright flash of white light.
text: Mitchell stumbles backwards and blinks his eyes. The flash
text: has temporarily clouded his vision.
text: Eric moves Corbett to another approach to the depot and
text: waits for Mitchell to move on.
scene_heading: 207 EXT. REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOT
text: Mitchell is about to do just that when a hand on his
text: shoulder stops him. It's LeMalle, oblivious to the profuse
text: bleeding from his right shoulder. Mitchell blinks, still
text: having trouble seeing. LeMalle gestures for him to be quiet
text: and points in Eric and Corbett's direction.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEMALLE
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Over there...
text: He hoists his Remington.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Hold it. You might hit Ben.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEMALLE
dialog: Bullshit. I hit what I'm aiming
dialog: at.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Let 'em come closer first...
text: But LeMalle is too anxious. He swings the rifle up,
text: left-handed, and SHOOTS.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: The bullet just misses Eric. He panics and wildly returns
text: FIRE with the .357.
scene_heading: 208 EXT. REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOT
text: Mitchell and LeMalle scatter under the hail of bullets.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: 208 CONTINUED:
scene_heading: ANGLE ON ERIC AND CORBETT
text: as they HEAR LeMalle's labored footsteps run past them,
text: nearby. Eric peers cautiously around the corner toward the
text: depot. There is no further movement.
text: Eric waits a moment, then leads Corbett cautiously toward
dialog: the depot.
scene_heading: 209 EXT. REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOT
text: Reaching the rear wall, they practically stumble over
text: something. It's Mitchell, lying on the ground near the
text: wall, badly wounded by Eric's barrage. Eric gasps.
text: Anguished, Corbett kneels next to Mitchell. Mitchell pulls
text: him closer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Glad to see you're okay. I told
dialog: LeMalle not to shoot.
dialog: (tries to smile)
dialog: Had some fine seasons, didn't
dialog: we...
text: Mitchell's grasp on Corbett's coat relaxes as he dies.
text: Horrified, Eric stares at the man he killed. Noticing the
text: scrimshaw lying on the snow where it slipped from Mitchell's
text: pocket, Corbett picks it up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: (to Eric)
dialog: Fifteen years on the trail with
dialog: this man, I never saw him rise to
dialog: anger.
text: Glaring at Eric, Corbett dips his hand in Mitchell's blood,
text: and suddenly smears it across Eric's mouth. Repelled, Eric
text: pulls back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: (continuing; bitterly)
dialog: Your first kill. How does it
dialog: taste?
text: Wiping his face, sickened and desolate, Eric has no reply.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Then, from somewhere close by, LeMalle FIRES at them. Eric
text: stuffs the .357 in his belt and uses a brick to knock the
text: padlock off the back door of the depot. He pushes Corbett
dialog: inside.
scene_heading: 210 INT. CARGO PLANE - COCKPIT
text: The pony-tailed, ex-hippie PILOT shuts his engines off and
text: removes his Walkman headphones. Hearing LeMalle's
text: continuing GUNSHOTS, the Pilot pulls his door closed and
text: turns on his two-way radio.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: (into radio mic)
dialog: Circle, this is BMY-955. I just
text: touched down in Devil's Cauldron.
dialog: Nobody's here to greet me like
dialog: usual, and there's gunfire. I'm
dialog: getting scarce.
text: With that, he STARTS his engines up again.
text: CUT TO ERIC IN DEPOT
text: who turns, startled, when he hears the ENGINES coughing to
dialog: life OS.
scene_heading: 211 INT. CARGO PLANE - COCKPIT
text: The Pilot fiddles with his controls and prepares to take
text: off. He looks up, surprised, as the passenger door suddenly
text: opens.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Anne Marie slides onto the seat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE MARIE
dialog: You can't leave yet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: It's my responsibility to get

text: Anne Marie points the .44 at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You got to be kidding.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNE MARIE
dialog: Leave the engines idling. Go
text: back and open the side door.
text: Shaking his head and muttering, the Pilot unfastens his seat
text: belt, climbs between the two seats to the cargo compartment,
text: and obliges the little lady with the big gun.
scene_heading: 212 INT. AIRSTRIP DEPOT
text: The depot, as temporary-looking as the rest of Devil's
text: Cauldron, is a boxcar-shaped loading dock and warehouse with
text: a corrugated steel roof. Boxes, wood palettes and hand
text: dollies are piled haphazardly about.
text: Eric and Corbett navigate through the piles of boxes,
text: inching toward the front door -- the door leading to the
dialog: plane.
text: Suddenly, a string of overhead lights come on. Eric goes
text: for the .357, then stops when he sees Meyerling, Kenai and
text: Neff have come in the front door. Kenai stomps his feet and
text: shivers. Grandstanding for the others, Meyerling steps
dialog: forward.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEYERLING
dialog: Nobody wants any more killings;
dialog: we all agree to that, correct?
dialog: (no one argues)
dialog: That's good. Now, Eric, you're
dialog: gonna hand your prisoner over to
dialog: us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Fuck you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEYERLING
dialog: This isn't your concern. It's
dialog: over, here and now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: (to Meyerling)
dialog: Sure, when you put a bullet in my
text: back on the way out. Easier for
text: all involved.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEYERLING
dialog: Not a bad idea. Face it, Ben.
dialog: There's no room in Alaska for you
dialog: any more.
text: Meyerling pokes with his foot at a tipped-over rack of
text: Eskimo paraphernalia -- masks, furs, big skin drums, fish-
dialog: and bear-spears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEYERLING
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You're as antiquated as this
dialog: shit.
text: Meyerling moves toward Corbett, but Eric stands in his way.

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: 212 CONTINUED:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Keep back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: You're quite a piece of work,
dialog: Meyerling. The tide changes, you
text: ride right along with it.
text: Eric looks at Neff.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Neff, you know better than
dialog: this...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEFF
dialog: You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond.
dialog: Step aside; stay out of it.
text: Kenai and Neff move in with Meyerling. Eric stands his
text: ground and reaches for the .357 in his belt.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: Suddenly, LeMalle stumbles into the depot, the blankets and
text: furs dragging at his feet. His right side is bathed in
text: blood. Half-frozen, bled dry, he looks ready to drop down
text: dead. In his left hand, impossibly, he still clutches the
text: massive Remington.
text: He hoists it to his hip and grits his teeth as he BOLTS a
text: round into the chamber with his injured right arm. Bracing
text: himself, he levels the rifle at Eric.
text: Hearing the ACTION of the rifle, Eric turns.
text: Corbett reaches down, grabs a rusty Eskimo spear in both his
text: handcuffed hands, and hurls it.
text: There is a deafening ROAR as LeMalle's rifle discharges.
text: LeMalle flies back from the recoil -- and from the spear
text: stuck clear through his chest.
text: Some packing material above Eric's head smolders, ignited by
text: the muzzle blast.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: There is a moment of silence. Corbett looks at the other
text: weapons near him, and then at Meyerling. Threatened,
text: Meyerling pulls out a .380 automatic. Before Eric can do
dialog: anything, Meyerling FIRES.
text: The IMPACT of the bullet throws Corbett against some boxes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: 212 CONTINUED: (2)
text: With a YELL, Eric jumps Meyerling and rips the gun from his
text: grasp. Enraged, he pummels Meyerling with it until Kenai
text: and Neff pull them apart. Eric wrenches away from them and
text: scrambles to his feet with Meyerling's gun in his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Anybody moves and I'll shoot!
text: Holding the .380 on them, Eric crosses to Corbett. Bleeding
text: from the abdomen, he's trying to stand up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Can you walk?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: Wound's a through-and-through.
dialog: Missed my liver, I think.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Let's get out of here.
text: Cautiously backing away from the others, Eric helps Corbett
text: get up and shuffle toward the OS SOUND of the cargo plane.
scene_heading: 213 EXT. DEVIL'S CAULDRON - AIRSTRIP
text: Anne Marie jumps down from the cockpit. She and Eric lift

scene_heading: 214 EXT. CARGO PLANE

scene_heading: 215 INT. CARGO PLANE - (AERIAL SHOT)

speaker_heading: CORBETT

speaker_heading: CORBETT
dialog: So they can patch me up and put

dialog: Meyerling's right -- I'm a
dialog: dinosaur. Greedy bastards like

speaker_heading: CORBETT

dialog: our troubles... or us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You're wrong. Everything we do
dialog: leaves its mark. You said it
dialog: yourself -- there are hundred-
text: year-old footprints in the

text: Too tired to argue, Corbett leans back against the window.
text: He takes Mitchell's scrimshaw out of his pocket and looks at
dialog: it.
scene_heading: EXTREME CLOSE UP - THE SCRIMSHAW

scene_heading: 218 EXT. CARGO PLANE
