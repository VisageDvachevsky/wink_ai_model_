scene_heading: EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - EARLY MORNING
text: We're FLYING above suburban America, DESCENDING SLOWLY toward
text: a tree-lined street.
speaker_heading: LESTER (V.O.)
dialog: My name is Lester Burnham. This is my
dialog: neighborhood. This is my street. This...
dialog: is my life. I'm forty-two years old. In
dialog: less than a year, I'll be dead.
scene_heading: INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: We're looking down at a king-sized BED from OVERHEAD:
text: LESTER BURNHAM lies sleeping amidst expensive bed linens,
text: face down, wearing PAJAMAS. An irritating ALARM CLOCK RINGS.
text: Lester gropes blindly to shut it off.
speaker_heading: LESTER (V.O.)
dialog: Of course, I don't know that yet. He
text: rolls over, looks up at us and sighs. He

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BATH - MOMENTS LATER
text: Lester thrusts his face directly into a steaming hot shower.
text: ANGLE from outside the shower: Lester's naked body is
text: silhouetted through the fogged-up glass door. It becomes
text: apparent he is masturbating.
speaker_heading: LESTER (V.O.)
dialog: (amused)
text: Look at me, jerking off in the shower.
dialog: (then)
dialog: This will be the high point of my day.
dialog: It's all downhill from here.
scene_heading: EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: CLOSE on a single, dewy AMERICAN BEAUTY ROSE. A gloved hand
text: with CLIPPERS appears and SNIPS the flower off.
text: CAROLYN BURNHAM tends her rose bushes in front of the Burnham
text: house. A very well-put together woman of forty, she wears
dialog: color-coordinated gardening togs and has lots of useful and
dialog: expensive tools.
text: Lester watches her through a WINDOW on the first floor,
text: peeping out through the drapes.
speaker_heading: LESTER (V.O.)
dialog: That's my wife Carolyn. See the way the
dialog: handle on those pruning shears matches
dialog: her gardening clogs? That's not an
dialog: accident.
scene_heading: EXT. JIMS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: In the fenced front yard of the house next door, a dog BARKS

text: the barking dog.
speaker_heading: JIM #1
dialog: Hush, Bitsy. You hush. What is wrong?
speaker_heading: LESTER (V.O.)
dialog: That's our next-door neighbor Jim.

speaker_heading: LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JIM #2
dialog: (re: barking dog)
dialog: What in the world is wrong with her? She
dialog: had a walk this morning.
speaker_heading: JIM #1
dialog: And a jerky treat.
speaker_heading: JIM #2
dialog: You spoil her.
dialog: (sternly)
dialog: Bitsy. No bark. Come inside. Now.
scene_heading: EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: Good morning, Jim!

speaker_heading: JIM #1
dialog: Morning, Carolyn.
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: (overly friendly)
dialog: I just love your tie! That color!
speaker_heading: JIM #1
dialog: I just love your roses. How do you get
dialog: them to flourish like this?
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: Well, I'll tell you. Egg shells and
dialog: Miracle Grow.
text: Jim #1 and Carolyn continue to chat, unaware that Lester is
text: watching them.
speaker_heading: LESTER (V.O.)
dialog: Man. I get exhausted just watching her.
text: Lester's POV: We can't hear what Jim and Carolyn are saying,
text: but she's overly animated, like a TV talk show host.
speaker_heading: LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: She wasn't always like this. She used to

speaker_heading: LESTER (V.O.)

text: PLASTIC SURGERY WEBSITE, featuring clinical "before" and
text: "after" photos of surgically augmented breasts.
speaker_heading: LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
text: Janie's a pretty typical teenager. Angry,
dialog: insecure, confused. I wish I could tell
dialog: her that's all going to pass...
text: Outside, a CAR HORN BLARES. Jane stuffs items into her
speaker_heading: BACKPACK.
speaker_heading: LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: But I don't want to lie to her.
text: We HEAR the CAR HORN again from outside. Jane studies herself
text: in a mirror, then shifts to get a good profile of her
dialog: breasts.
scene_heading: EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Carolyn stands next to a platinum-colored MERCEDES-BENZ
text: ML320, reaching in through the drivers' window to blow the
speaker_heading: HORN again.

speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: Jane. Honey. Are you trying to look
dialog: unattractive?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CAROLYN

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CAROLYN (CONT'D)
dialog: Lester, could you make me a little later,

dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Nice going, Dad.
text: Lester smiles sheepishly, trying to lighten the moment.
text: His POV: Carolyn looks down at us, contemptuous but also
text: bored, as if she gave up expecting anything more long ago.
speaker_heading: LESTER (V.O.)
dialog: Both my wife and daughter think I'm this
dialog: gigantic loser, and... they're right.
scene_heading: INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - A SHORT TIME LATER
text: Carolyn is driving; Jane stares out the window. Lester is
text: asleep in the back seat.
speaker_heading: LESTER (V.O.)
dialog: I have lost something. I'm not exactly
dialog: sure what it is, but I know I didn't
dialog: always feel this... sedated. But you know
dialog: what? It's never too late to get it back.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
text: Lester sits at his workstation, a BEIGE CUBICLE surrounded by
text: IDENTICAL BEIGE CUBICLES. He's staring at a computer monitor
text: and talking on a HEADSET PHONE. The beleaguered expression on
text: his face is at odds with the light, friendly tone of his
dialog: voice.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Hello, this is Lester Burnham from Media
dialog: Monthly magazine, I'm calling for Mr.
dialog: Tamblin, please?... Well, we're all under
dialog: a deadline here, uh, but you see, there
dialog: is some basic information about the
dialog: product launch that isn't even covered in
dialog: your press release and I... Yeah. Can I

speaker_heading: LESTER

scene_heading: INT. BRAD'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Brad is seated behind his desk in his big corner office.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: I'm sure you can understand our need to
dialog: cut corners around here.
text: Lester sits across from him, looking small and isolated.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Oh, sure. Times are tight, and you gotta
dialog: free up cash. Gotta spend money to make
dialog: money. Right?
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Exactly. So...
text: Brad stands, ready to usher Lester out.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: (blurts)
dialog: Like the time when Mr. Flournoy used the
dialog: company MasterCard to pay for that
dialog: hooker, and then she used the card
dialog: numbers and stayed at the St. Regis for,
dialog: what was it, like, three months?
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: (startled)
dialog: That's unsubstantiated gossip.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: That's fifty thousand dollars. That's
dialog: somebody's salary. That's somebody who's
dialog: gonna get fired because Craig has to pay
dialog: women to fuck him!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Jesus. Calm down. Nobody's getting fired
dialog: yet. That's why we're having everyone
dialog: write out a job description, mapping out
dialog: in detail how they contribute. That way,
dialog: management can assess who's valuable and--
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Who's expendable.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: It's just business.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: (angry)
dialog: I've been writing for this magazine for
dialog: fourteen years, Brad. You've been here
dialog: how long, a whole month?
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: (frank)
dialog: I'm one of the good guys, Les. I'm trying

scene_heading: EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: --there is no decision, you just write

speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: You don't think it's weird and kinda

speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: Possibly. But you don't want to be

speaker_heading: LESTER

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: Could you be just a little bit more
dialog: dramatic, please, huh?
text: As they get out of the car, Carolyn scopes out the MOVERS
text: next door.
speaker_heading: CAROLYN (CONT'D)
dialog: So we've finally got new neighbors. You
dialog: know, if the Lomans had let me represent
dialog: them, instead of--
dialog: (heavy disdain)
dialog: --"The Real Estate King," that house
dialog: would never have sat on the market for
dialog: six months.
text: She heads into the house, followed by Lester.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Well, they were still mad at you for
text: cutting down their sycamore.
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: Their sycamore? C'mon! A substantial
dialog: portion of the root structure was on our
dialog: property. You know that. How can you call
dialog: it their sycamore? I wouldn't have the
dialog: heart to just cut down something if it
dialog: wasn't partially mine, which of course it
dialog: was.
scene_heading: INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: We HEAR EASY-LISTENING MUSIC.

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Mom, do we always have to listen to this
dialog: elevator music?
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: (considers)
dialog: No. No, we don't. As soon as you've

speaker_heading: JANE

dialog: No, Dad. It was spec-tac-ular.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Well, you want to know how things went at
dialog: my job today?
text: Now she looks at him as if he's lost his mind.
speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: They've hired this efficiency expert,
dialog: this really friendly guy named Brad, how
dialog: perfect is that? And he's basically there
dialog: to make it seem like they're justified in
dialog: firing somebody, because they couldn't
dialog: just come right out and say that, could
dialog: they? No, no, that would be too...
dialog: honest. And so they've asked us--
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: --you couldn't possibly care any less,
dialog: could you?
text: Carolyn is watching this closely.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (uncomfortable)
dialog: Well, what do you expect? You can't all

text: She gets up and heads toward the kitchen.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, hello. You've barely even spoken
dialog: to me for months.

speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry I haven't been more available,

speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: (finally)
dialog: You know, you don't always have to wait
dialog: for me to come to you...
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh, great. So now it's my fault?
speaker_heading: LESTER

dialog: something wounded... and dangerous.
text: His POV, on VIDEO: Through the kitchen window, we see Lester

speaker_heading: MONTAGE:

text: Doggedly scrubs countertops in the kitchen;
text: Perches on a stepladder to dust a cheap-looking ceiling fan
text: in the master bedroom;
text: And vacuums a dirty carpet that will never be clean.

scene_heading: INT. SALE HOUSE - SUN ROOM - LATER

speaker_heading: LESTER

text: The HIGH SCHOOL BAND plays "ON BROADWAY." On the gym floor,

text: Lester, watching from the stands, picks out his daughter.
text: His POV: Jane performs well, concentrating. Dancing awkwardly

dialog: entirely.
text: Lester is suddenly alone in the stands, spellbound.
text: His POV: Angela looks directly at us now, dancing only for

speaker_heading: LESTER

speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Thanks... but I have a car.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Oh, you have a car. Oh. That's great!
dialog: That's great, because Janie's thinking

dialog: honey?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (you freak)
dialog: Dad. Mom's waiting for you.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Well, it was very nice meeting you,
dialog: Angela. Any, uh, friend of Janie's is a
dialog: friend of mine.

speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: It's the weirdest thing.
text: The ROSE PETAL drifts into view, landing on his pillow.
speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I feel like I've been in a coma for about
dialog: twenty years, and I'm just now waking up.
text: More ROSE PETALS fall onto the bed, and he smiles up at...

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: It's okay. I'm used to guys drooling over
dialog: me. It started when I was about twelve,
dialog: I'd go out to dinner with my parents.
dialog: Every Thursday night, Red Lobster. And
dialog: every guy there would stare at me when I
dialog: walked in. And I knew what they were
dialog: thinking. Just like I knew guys at school
dialog: thought about me when they jerked off.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Vomit.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: No, I liked it. And I still like it. If
dialog: people I don't even know look at me and
dialog: want to fuck me, it means I really have a
dialog: shot at being a model. Which is great,
dialog: because there's nothing worse in life
dialog: than being ordinary.

scene_heading: EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Asshole.

speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: (over phone line)
dialog: Hello? Hello?
text: Lester is frozen, unable to speak. Suddenly, the SHOWER is

speaker_heading: JIM #1
dialog: Just a little something from our garden.
speaker_heading: JIM #2
dialog: Except for the pasta, we got that at

speaker_heading: COLONEL
dialog: Let's cut to the chase, okay? What are
dialog: you guys selling?
speaker_heading: JIM #2
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Nothing. We just wanted to say hi to our
dialog: new neighbors--
speaker_heading: COLONEL
dialog: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you said you're
dialog: partners. So what's your business?
text: The Jims look at each other, then back at the Colonel.
speaker_heading: JIM #1
dialog: Well, he's a tax attorney.
speaker_heading: JIM #2
dialog: And he's an anesthesiologist.

scene_heading: INT. COLONEL'S FORD EXPLORER - LATER
text: The Colonel drives, staring darkly at the road ahead. In the
text: passenger seat, Ricky is using a CALCULATOR and jotting
text: numbers down in a NOTEBOOK.
speaker_heading: COLONEL
dialog: How come these faggots always have to rub
dialog: it in your face? How can they be so
dialog: shameless?
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: That's the whole thing, Dad. They don't
dialog: feel like it's anything to be ashamed of.
text: The Colonel looks at Ricky sharply.
speaker_heading: COLONEL
dialog: Well, it is.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Yeah, you're right.

speaker_heading: COLONEL

text: Ricky sighs, then looks at his father.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Forgive me, sir, for speaking so bluntly,
dialog: but those fags make me want to puke my

text: The Colonel is taken aback but quickly covers.
speaker_heading: COLONEL
dialog: Me too, son. Me too.
text: Case closed, Ricky goes back to his calculations.

dialog: bold strokes: $24,950.00.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUS - A SHORT TIME LATER
text: Jane and Angela are standing with two other TEENAGE GIRLS.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: I'm serious, he just pulled down his
dialog: pants and yanked it out. You know, like,
dialog: say hello to Mr. Happy.
speaker_heading: TEENAGE GIRL #1
dialog: Gross.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: It wasn't gross. It was kind of cool.
speaker_heading: TEENAGE GIRL #1
dialog: So, did you do it with him?
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Of course I did. He is a really well-
dialog: known photographer? He shoots for Elle on
dialog: like, a regular basis? It would have been
dialog: so majorly stupid of me to turn him down.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: TEENAGE GIRL #2
dialog: You are a total prostitute.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Hey. That's how things really are. You
dialog: just don't know, because you're this
text: pampered little suburban chick.
speaker_heading: TEENAGE GIRL #2
dialog: So are you. You've only been in Seventeen once, and you

speaker_heading: ANGELA

speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Him? Jane. No way. He's a total lunatic.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You know him?
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Yeah. We were on the same lunch shift
dialog: when I was in ninth grade, and he would
dialog: always say the most random, weird things,
dialog: and then one day, he was just like, gone.
dialog: And then, Connie Cardullo told me he his

speaker_heading: RICKY

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Thanks, but I really don't need to have
text: some psycho obsessing about me right now.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: I'm not obsessing. I'm just curious.
text: He looks at her intently, his eyes searching hers. Jane is
text: unnerved and has to look away. Ricky smiles and walks off.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: What a freak. And why does he dress like
dialog: a Bible salesman?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: CAROLYN

speaker_heading: ANGELA (CONT'D)
dialog: You're looking good, Mr. Burnham.
text: She starts toward him.
speaker_heading: ANGELA (CONT'D)
dialog: Last time I saw you, you looked kind of
dialog: wound up.
dialog: (spots something)
dialog: Ooh, is that root beer?
text: She reaches inside the refrigerator to grab a bottle. As she
text: does, she moves to place her other hand casually on Lester's
text: shoulder. He sees it coming. Everything SLOWS DOWN, and all
text: sound FADES...
text: EXTREME CLOSE UP on her hand as it briefly touches his
text: shoulder in SLOW MOTION. We HEAR only the amplified BRUSH of
text: her fingers against the fabric of his suit, and its
text: unnatural, hollow ECHO...
text: BACK IN REAL TIME: She grabs the root beer and smiles at him.
text: CLOSE on Lester: his eyes narrow slightly, then:
text: He cups her face in his hands and kisses her. She seems
text: shocked, but doesn't resist as he pulls her toward him with
text: surprising strength. He breaks the kiss, looking at her in
text: awe, then he reaches up and touches his lips. His eyes widen
text: as he pulls a ROSE PETAL from his mouth right before we SMASH

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Sure!

scene_heading: INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Angela lays on the bed, in bra and panties, reading a

text: on her computer.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'm sorry about my dad.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Don't be. I think it's funny.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yeah, to you, he's just another guy who

dialog: he's just too embarrassing to live.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Your mom's the one who's embarrassing.
dialog: What a phony.

speaker_heading: ANGELA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Oh, come on. Like you've never sneaked a

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: ANGELA

speaker_heading: ANGELA (O.C.)
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I would! I would suck your dad's big fat

speaker_heading: ANGELA (CONT'D)
dialog: (spots something)

scene_heading: EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: (intrigued)
dialog: Really?
scene_heading: EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: On VIDEO: We're across from Jane's window, looking in. Jane
text: tries to shut the drapes, but Angela won't let her.
text: Irritated, Jane retreats into the room. We ZOOM toward her,
text: even as Angela poses in the window; we're clearly not
text: interested in Angela. The ZOOM continues, searching for Jane,
text: who has disappeared. Finally, we settle on the small make-up
text: MIRROR where we see a REFLECTION of Jane, back at her

scene_heading: INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
text: Lester digs through stuff stored on the shelves, searching

speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Shit. Shit!
text: He yanks aside COLLEGE YEARBOOKS, a racquetball RACQUET,
text: boxes of old HOT ROD MAGAZINES, an unopened remote-controlled
text: MODEL JEEP KIT, stacks of old vinyl LPs... finally his face
text: lights up when he finds:
text: A pair of DUMBBELLS obviously unused for many years.
text: Lester rips off his jacket and tie and unbuttons his shirt.
text: He glances around, finding his REFLECTION in the WINDOW as he
text: pulls off his shirt, then the T-shirt underneath. He eyes
dialog: himself critically: Angela was right, he's not in bad shape.
text: Just a few extra pounds around his middle that wouldn't be

speaker_heading: COLONEL (O.C.)
dialog: Ricky!
text: Moving swiftly, Ricky pulls the drapes shut and switches on a

text: VIDEO EQUIPMENT line the shelves, as well as HUNDREDS OF CDs.
text: There is easily twenty thousand dollars worth of equipment in
dialog: this room.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Coming, Dad.
speaker_heading: COLONEL (O.C.)
dialog: You know I don't like locked doors in my
dialog: house, boy.
text: Ricky opens the door. The Colonel stands outside, eyeing him.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: I'm sorry, I must have locked it by
dialog: accident. So what's up?
text: The Colonel holds out a small PLASTIC CUP WITH A CAP.
speaker_heading: COLONEL
dialog: I need a urine sample.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Wow. It's been six months already. Can I
dialog: give it to you in the morning? I just

speaker_heading: COLONEL
dialog: Yeah, I suppose.
dialog: (an awkward beat)
dialog: Well. Good night, son.
text: He disappears down the hall. Ricky smiles, shuts and locks

text: to a MINI REFRIGERATOR in the corner of his room and takes
text: out a cup-sized TUPPERWARE CONTAINER from the freezer,
text: already filled with urine, albeit frozen, and places it on a

text: His POV: Across from us, in a PEDESTAL BATHTUB, is Angela.
text: She smiles and beckons us, and we MOVE CLOSER. ROSE PETALS
text: float on the surface of the water, obscuring her naked body.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: I've been waiting for you.
text: Lester kneels by the bathtub like a man in church.
speaker_heading: ANGELA (CONT'D)
dialog: You've been working out, haven't you? I
dialog: can tell.
text: She arches her back and looks up at him provocatively.
speaker_heading: ANGELA (CONT'D)
dialog: I was hoping you'd give me a bath... I'm
dialog: very, very dirty.

scene_heading: INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: CLOSE on Carolyn, her eyes wide, listening to the rhythmic

speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: All right, so shoot me. I was whacking
dialog: off.
text: Carolyn gets out of bed, repelled. Lester LAUGHS.
speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: That's right. I was choking the bishop.

speaker_heading: CAROLYN

speaker_heading: LESTER

speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: Lester. I refuse to live like this. This

speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: This hasn't been a marriage for years.
dialog: But you were happy as long as I kept my
dialog: mouth shut. Well, guess what? I've
dialog: changed. And the new me whacks off when

dialog: I've never hit you, or even tried to
dialog: touch you since you made it so abundantly
dialog: clear just how unnecessary you consider

dialog: you got your license. And some people
dialog: might think that entitles me to half of
dialog: what's yours.
text: She sinks into a chair, stunned. It's clear he knows where

speaker_heading: LESTER

speaker_heading: MANAGER

speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Yeah, like twenty years ago.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Well, I'm sure there have been amazing

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: It was one of those days when it's a

dialog: this electricity in the air, you can
dialog: almost hear it, right? And this bag was
dialog: just... dancing with me. Like a little
dialog: kid begging me to play with it. For
dialog: fifteen minutes. That's the day I

speaker_heading: RICKY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Janie, today I quit my job. And then I
dialog: told my boss to fuck himself, and then I
dialog: blackmailed him for almost sixty thousand

speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: Your father seems to think this kind of

speaker_heading: CAROLYN

speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sick and tired of being treated like

speaker_heading: CAROLYN

dialog: got bored? And who used to run up to the
dialog: roof of our first apartment building to
dialog: flash the traffic helicopters? Have you
dialog: totally forgotten about her? Because I
dialog: haven't.
text: His face is close to hers, and suddenly the atmosphere is
text: charged. She pulls back automatically, but it's clear she's
text: drawn to him. He smiles, and moves even closer, holding his
text: beer loosely balanced. Then, just before their lips meet...
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: (barely audible)
dialog: Lester. You're going to spill beer on the
dialog: couch.
text: She's immediately sorry she said it, but it's too late. His
text: smile fades, and the moment is gone.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: So what? It's just a couch.
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: This is a four thousand dollar sofa
text: upholstered in Italian silk. This is not
dialog: "just a couch."
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: It's just a couch!
text: He stands and gestures toward all the things in the room.
speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: This isn't life. This is just stuff. And
dialog: it's become more important to you than
dialog: living. Well, honey, that's just nuts.
text: Carolyn stares at him, on the verge of tears, then turns and
text: walks out of the room before he can see her cry.
speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: (calls after her)
dialog: I'm only trying to help you.

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (shy)
dialog: Don't.
text: We're watching the WIDE-SCREEN TV in Ricky's room.
text: A CORD leads from the TV to Ricky's DIGICAM. Ricky holds the
text: camera, sitting naked in a chair. It's been almost a month
text: since his father beat him up, and there are still slight
text: SCARS on his face. He's aiming his camera at Jane.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (re: image on TV)
dialog: It's weird, watching myself. I don't like
dialog: how I look.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: I can't believe you don't know how
dialog: beautiful you are.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'm not going to sit here for that shit.
text: She gets out of bed, takes his Digicam and focuses it on him.
text: We see his image on the TV as she videotapes.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ha. How does it feel now?
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You don't feel naked?
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: I am naked.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You know what I mean.

speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: When I was fifteen, my dad caught me
text: smoking dope. He totally freaked and
dialog: decided to send me to military school. I
dialog: told you his whole thing about structure
dialog: and discipline, right?
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Well, of course, I got kicked out. Dad
dialog: and I had this huge fight, and he hit
dialog: me... and then the next day at school,
dialog: some kid made a crack about my haircut,
dialog: and... I just snapped. I wanted to kill
dialog: him. And I would have. Killed him. If
dialog: they hadn't pulled me off.
dialog: (then)
dialog: That's when my dad put me in the
dialog: hospital. Then they drugged me up and
dialog: left me in there for two years.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Wow. You must really hate him.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: He's not a bad man.
text: He grabs a half-smoked JOINT from an ashtray and lights it.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Well... you better believe I'd hate my
dialog: father if he did something like that to
dialog: me.
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Wait. I do hate my father.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Why?
text: He passes her the joint, then takes the Digicam and focuses
text: it on her. We see her image on the TV as he videotapes.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: He's a total asshole and he's got this
dialog: crush on my friend Angela and it's
dialog: disgusting.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: You'd rather he had the crush on you?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Gross, no! But it'd be nice if I was

speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: How?
text: Jane looks into the camera, a loopy, stoned grin on her face.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Well, now, I too need structure. A little
dialog: fucking discipline.
text: They LAUGH. She lays back on the bed.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm serious, though. How could he not be
dialog: damaging me? I need a father who's a role
dialog: model, not some horny geek-boy who's
dialog: gonna spray his shorts whenever I bring a
dialog: girlfriend home from school.
dialog: (snorts)
dialog: What a lame-o. Somebody really should put
text: him out of his misery.
text: Her mind wanders for a beat.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Want me to kill him for you?
text: Jane looks at him and sits up.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yeah, would you?
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: It'll cost you.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Well, I've been baby-sitting since I was
dialog: about ten. I've got almost three thousand
dialog: dollars. 'Course, I was saving it up for
text: a boob job.
text: She stands and sticks out her breasts, then falls back on the
text: bed, LAUGHING.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: But my tits can wait, huh?
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: You know, that's not a very nice thing to

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Well, I guess I'm just not a very nice
dialog: girl, then, am I?

text: intently.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: (suddenly nervous)
dialog: You know I'm not serious, right?
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Of course.

speaker_heading: RICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you know how lucky we are to have
dialog: found each other?

speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - EARLY MORNING

speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Remember those posters that said, "Today

dialog: life?" Well, that's true of every day
dialog: except one.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: The day you die.

text: wearing sweatpants and running shoes, bursts out of the front
text: door and dashes up the driveway.
scene_heading: EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - A SHORT TIME LATER
text: We're now at street level, as Lester runs toward us. He
text: carries a WALKMAN and wears EARPHONES, and we HEAR ROCK MUSIC
text: as he runs. The endorphins have kicked in, and Lester grins,
text: reveling in the sheer physical pleasure of his body.
dialog: 74.
scene_heading: INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - A SHORT TIME LATER
text: The blender GRINDS as Lester, still in his sweatpants, makes
text: himself a high-protein shake. He's in excellent shape; even
text: his posture has changed, and he moves with the confident,
text: easy swagger of an athlete. Jane watches him blankly from the
text: kitchen table.
text: Carolyn enters. Lester leans against the counter, drinking
text: his shake directly from the blender pitcher, eyeing her. He's
text: got a newfound sexual energy that makes her uncomfortable,
text: and he knows it. Carolyn quickly rinses off her coffee cup,
text: avoiding his eyes, and starts out.
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: Jane, hurry up. I've got a very important
dialog: appointment--
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Mom, is it okay if Angela sleeps over
dialog: tonight?
text: Jane looks at Lester to see how he reacts. He doesn't.
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: Well, of course, she's always welcome.
dialog: (on her way out)
dialog: You know, I thought maybe you two had a
dialog: fight. I haven't seen her around here in

text: And she's gone. Jane continues staring at her father.
text: Finally, he glances over at her.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: I've been too embarrassed to bring her
dialog: over. Because of you, and the way that
dialog: you behave.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: What are you talking about? I've barely

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: LESTER

scene_heading: INT. FITTS HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: We're outside Ricky's room, MOVING slowly toward the open

text: mirror, combing his hair. The scars on his face are almost
dialog: gone now.
text: A REVERSE ANGLE reveals the Colonel standing outside the door
text: looking in, watching Ricky with great tenderness. Then Ricky
text: looks up at him, and the Colonel is suddenly self-conscious.
speaker_heading: COLONEL
dialog: (brusque)
dialog: You ready to go?
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Oh, I don't need a ride. I'm going to go

speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Yo, Ricky. How's it going?
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Pretty decent, Mr. Burnham.

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: CLOSE on the Colonel's face: he looks confused.

text: looks at us. His face tightens.
text: LESTER studies him for a moment, then grins and salutes
text: before going inside the house.
text: CLOSE on the Colonel, deeply troubled.
scene_heading: INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: The door swings open silently and the Colonel enters. He
text: starts going through Ricky's bureau. He opens the DRAWER in
dialog: which we know Ricky keeps his marijuana, but he doesn't
text: discover its false bottom. He stands and looks around, his
text: eyes finally landing on:
text: The DIGICAM and a stack of CASSETTES on a shelf. The camera
text: is still connected to the TV.
text: The Colonel turns on the TV, examines the Digicam and presses
text: "play." The TV's blank screen suddenly gives way to...
text: On VIDEO: Barbara Fitts sits at the kitchen table, staring
text: off into space.
text: The Colonel watches, at first baffled, then impatient. He
text: takes the cassette out of the Digicam and inserts another. On
text: the TV screen we see...
text: On VIDEO: Through the Burnham's GARAGE WINDOW, we see Lester
text: step out of his pants and briefs. Then, naked except for his

speaker_heading: CAROLYN (O.C.)

scene_heading: EXT. MR. SMILEY'S - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: I think we deserve a little junk food,
dialog: after the workout we had this morning.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (nuzzles her neck)

speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Would you like to try our new beef and

speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: (re: Buddy)

speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: (flustered)

speaker_heading: LESTER

speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: (miserable)
dialog: Oh, Lester--
speaker_heading: LESTER

speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: Oh, no. I understand completely.
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: In order to be successful, one must
dialog: project an image of success. At all
dialog: times.
text: She regrets it the second it's out of her mouth, and turns to
text: him. He just looks at her sadly, then gets out of the car and
text: shuts the door. She starts to CRY. As before, she SLAPS
text: herself, hard.
speaker_heading: CAROLYN (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop it. Stop it!

scene_heading: INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - THAT NIGHT

speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: I have to run next door. Jane left her
dialog: geometry book in my bag and she needs it

text: into view.

speaker_heading: RICKY

scene_heading: INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: The Colonel's POV: Lester leans back in his chair. We see

dialog: Lester a blow job.
text: The Colonel watches, incredulous. Then we HEAR a CAR
text: APPROACHING, and the Colonel glances over at:
text: His POV: Angela's BMW pulls into the driveway, stopping
text: behind Lester's Firebird. As Angela and Jane get out and run
text: toward the house, our focus MOVES back to the GARAGE WINDOW.

speaker_heading: LESTER
