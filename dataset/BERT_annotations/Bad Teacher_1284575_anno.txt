speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY
dialog: To establish.
text: A school marquee with removable plastic letters reads,
text: "GOOD LUCK WITH FINALS!" A JANITOR opens the glass and
text: starts removing the letters.
scene_heading: INT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY
text: POP! A Champagne cork hits the ceiling.
text: TEACHERS who rarely get to drink at work, jockey for
text: position, holding out their plastic flutes. (Note:
dialog: female teachers outnumber male teachers 12:1.)
text: PRINCIPAL WALLY SNUR, 40s, balding, faces the teachers.
text: He has a habit of blinking hard before speaking.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL SNUR
dialog: Well, it's been another great year here
dialog: at JAMS. Who can forget Mr. Pinkus'
dialog: haunted classroom? Sandy, thank you.
text: SANDY PINKUS, 40s, sporting a ponytail, smiles, clearly
text: enjoying the small compliment.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: I ain't afraid of no ghost.
text: The other teachers laugh.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL SNUR
dialog: Or the wild success of...
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.C.)
dialog: Wally, can I just say one quick thing?
text: Wally turns to AMY SQUIRREL, late 20s, cute and
text: wholesome. Any trace of sexuality she might have is
text: wiped away by her adult pigtails. She treats students
text: and adults alike -- like students.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Just wanted to remind everyone the school
dialog: day's not over. So let's keep the
dialog: drinking under control, hmm? That's it.
dialog: Back to you, Wally.
text: A bunch of teacher roll their eyes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL SNUR
dialog: Thanks, Amy,
dialog: (then, back to his notes)
dialog: . Or the wild success of the book drive
dialog: for the women's prison sponsored by Ms.
dialog: Savicki's class?
text: A broad-shouldered teacher with spiky hair, MS. SAVICKI, nods.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
dialog: But now as the summer is upon us, it's
dialog: time to not only say goodbye to another
dialog: school year, but to also say goodbye to a
dialog: member of our faculty.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Elizabeth, can you come up here?
text: ELIZABETH HALSEY, mid 20s, pretty and petite, walks up to
text: the front. She sports an enormous diamond ring and dresses
text: slightly more cosmopolitan than the other teachers.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
dialog: You've only been with us for one short
dialog: year, but know that you'll always be a
dialog: part of the JAMS family.
text: Elizabeth gives Principal Snur an appreciative smile.
text: The Teachers lightly applaud.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
dialog: And we got you a little something.
text: Wally hands Elizabeth an envelope. She opens it and.
text: pulls out a gift card: BOSTON MARKET. $37.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Almost forty dollars. Thank you!
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL SNUR
dialog: Why don't you say a couple words?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Okay. Um... I'm not really good at this
dialog: type of thing so I'll make it quick. I
dialog: know I've only been here a year, but
dialog: there's so much I'm going to miss...
scene_heading: INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY
text: Elizabeth sits at her desk, cleaning it out. She's tossing
text: the few personal effects she has into a banker's box.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (V.0.)
dialog: My students, probably most of all.I'm not
dialog: saying they were little angels, butthey
dialog: were all there to learn and that'sthe
dialog: greatest gift a student can give a teacher.
text: Elizabeth's class is horsing around, enjoying the last
dialog: days of seventh grade.
text: A dim-looking BOY tentatively approaches her desk with
text: his yearbook in hand. He hands it to Elizabeth, who
text: considers what to write for a beat, then smiles as she
text: signs it.
scene_heading: INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
text: Elizabeth walks down the hall holding her box.
text: SIXTH, SEVENTH and EIGHTH graders all race past her,
text: running toward their summer vacation.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (V.0.)
dialog: And I wish that I had gotten to know all of
dialog: you better, but between four classes and
dialog: planning a wedding, I had my hands full.
dialog: From the little I do know about you, I know
dialog: that our students are in good hands.
text: Elizabeth passes Amy's classroom, where she is carefully
text: removing inspirational posters from her walls and rolling
text: them into cardboard tubes.
scene_heading: EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY
text: Three middle school BURNOUTS are smoking weed in a
text: thicket on the outskirts of the school property.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (V.0.)
dialog: And I can't believe it's all over. This
dialog: year flew by. And even though I'll never
dialog: teach again professionally, I've realized
dialog: that I don't need a blackboard and
text: classroom to set an example.
text: Elizabeth comes up behind them.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Hand it over.
text: The Burnouts' eyes all go wide and they freeze. One of
text: the burnouts hands her the joint.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Everything.
text: The kids look at each other and then pull out a bag with
text: a couple of joints. They hand it over to Elizabeth.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: This was a warning. Next time, I don't
dialog: call the principal. I call the cops.
scene_heading: EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAY
text: Elizabeth walks to her brand new MERCEDES. She gets in,
text: pulls out a joint and lights it. She takes a huge TOKE,
text: and then PEELS out of the lot. She tosses her banker's
text: box out the window and extends her hand, giving the
text: school THE FINGER.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (O.S.)
dialog: Woo-hoo!
text: A couple students look at her strangely.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: The dim-looking kid that had Elizabeth sign his yearbook.
text: He flips to the faculty section, and by the picture of
text: Elizabeth is her message: "YOU ARE ILLITERATE!"
scene_heading: DIM-LOOKING KID
dialog: (struggling to read)
dialog: You are... Illit... Illit...
text: Elizabeth's car comes barrelling toward him and nearly
text: hits him.
text: She accelerates into the speed bumps, almost hitting the
text: JANITOR from the opening shot, who's changing the plastic
text: letters to read, "HAVE A GREAT SUMMER!"
speaker_heading: JANITOR
dialog: Slow down!
scene_heading: CHYRON: BAD TEACHER
scene_heading: EXT. TOWNHOUSE NIGHT
text: A Mercedes with the vanity plate "HIS" is parked in the
text: driveway of an upscale neighborhood. Elizabeth's matching
text: Mercedes pulls into the adjacent spot. Her license plate
text: reads "HERS."
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: A bachelor pad. Top of the line electronics. Lots of
text: black leather furniture. Tacky, but expensive.
text: Elizabeth pours two glasses of wine and takes a long sip.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (CALLING)
dialog: Baby Doll?
speaker_heading: MARK (O.S.)
dialog: Coming!
text: MARK, early 30s, exits the bedroom in his underwear.
text: He's shaved his head to avoid signs of early balding and
text: is also a full four inches shorter than Elizabeth.
text: Thankfully for him, he has money.
speaker_heading: MARK (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (ANXIOUS)
dialog: Hey! That was a quick party.
text: Elizabeth kisses Mark on the top of his head and hands
text: him a glass.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Yeah. You should have seen it. What a
dialog: joke.
text: She raises her glass for a toast. He raises his.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Here's to me never having to work again.
dialog: And I owe it all to you, Lover.
text: Elizabeth takes a big sip.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (FLIRTATIOUS)
dialog: So I made a reservation at Ruth's Chris,
dialog: and then I booked us a suite at the
dialog: Drake, and I thought we could finish the
dialog: night in "anal alley." Hmm?
text: Something drops in the bedroom. Mark, alarmed, turns
text: towards the door. Elizabeth brushes past him into --
scene_heading: INT. TOWNHOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Elizabeth enters to find -- NOTHING. Mark follows her in.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Elizabeth looks around -- under the bed, in the closet,
text: behind the door.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: See? Nothing.
text: Just then, the wooden chest at the foot of the bed SNEEZES.
text: Elizabeth opens the latch to find SHEILA, 23, dressed only
text: in a thong, scrunched in the fetal position. She stands,
text: revealing LARGE FAKE BREASTS, and steps out of the chest.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (TO MARK)
dialog: Motherfucker!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: How could you do this to me?!
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You are buying me the biggest pair of
dialog: yellow diamond earrings they make! I'm
text: talking serious blood diamonds.
text: Sheila SNEEZES again.
dialog: Bless you.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (TO SHEILA)
dialog: Get out of my house, bitch!
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Don't talk to her like that.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Excuse me?
dialog: I love her.
text: Mark puts his arm around Sheila. Elizabeth eyes Sheila's
text: large breasts.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You love her? She's a hooker.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK SHEILA
dialog: She's not a hooker. I dance.
text: Elizabeth takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (SWEET)
dialog: Listen, Marky, you made a mistake.
dialog: You're human. I'm human. And this time
dialog: it was you. Maybe six months from now,
dialog: you'll walk in on me. I don't know, but
dialog: probably.
text: Sheila SNEEZES again.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Shut the fuck up.
dialog: (then, to Mark, sweet)
dialog: And. maybe I'm talking crazy, but I don't
dialog: want to throw away our life together over
dialog: something like this. We're getting
dialog: married! I'm willing to fight for us.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'm not. And you know why? Because
dialog: Sheila loves me -- and not just for my
dialog: money.
text: Sheila squeezes his shoulder.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I'm sorry if I care that my future husband
dialog: can support me. We didn't all grow up
dialog: with a silver spoon in our mouths. You
dialog: can't even imagine what it's like going to
text: bed hungry, night after night.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What are you talking about?! Both your
dialog: parents are CPAs.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: My parents worked their asses off to send
dialog: me to private school. Do you know what
dialog: it's like driving a Pontiac when everyone
dialog: else gets a Beemer the second they
dialog: menstruate? That shit stays with you.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It's over, Elizabeth.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: For the record, there's a shitload of
dialog: things that I hate about you, but I still,
dialog: would've gotten married.
dialog: (beat, sweet)
dialog: Because I love you.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (rolls his eyes)
dialog: I'm gonna need the ring back.
text: She grabs her bag and heads for the exit. Mark follows.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You sad little troll! I hope you and
dialog: your hooker enjoy chlamydia together!
speaker_heading: MARK
text: Elizabeth. The ring.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (not turning around)
dialog: I'm not even listening to you anymore.
text: She starts to open the door. He closes it.
dialog: The ring!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Like I even want your gay-ass ring.
text: She tries pulling it off.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: It's not coming off. I'll go to the
dialog: jeweler's tomorrow.
text: Mark takes her hand and removes the ring with ease.
text: Elizabeth steps out into the night. The door SLAMS
text: behind her.
scene_heading: CHYRON: 3 MONTHS LATER
scene_heading: EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAY
text: A red 1994 Grand Am with a cracked windshield peels into
text: the half-empty lot and screeches to a halt. The license
text: plate reads "HERS."
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
scene_heading: INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
text: Elizabeth walks down the empty hall. It's possible a
dialog: person has never looked less happy to be anywhere.
text: FAINT SOFT ROCK plays from an open door. Something from
text: inside the classroom catches Elizabeth's eye.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (under her breath)
dialog: You've gotta be shitting me.
scene_heading: TURN TO REVEAL
scene_heading: AMY'S CLASSROOM
text: The room has been decorated to within an inch of its
text: life. Every surface is covered with posters like "Noted
dialog: African-Americans," or "Hispanic American Hall of Fame,"
text: or "Women Who Dared." A RED DELICIOUS APPLE has been
text: placed on each student's desk.
text: Amy, dressed casually in cargo shorts and texas, is trying
text: to hang a large "INTEGRITY" poster. She looks over, sees
text: Elizabeth staring at her, and immediately lights up.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Elizabeth Halsey, as I live and breathe!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
text: Amy Squirrel.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I know we barely got a chance to get to
dialog: know one another last year -- what with
dialog: you planning the wedding of the century
dialog: and me juggling all my extra-currics --
dialog: but I just want to say that I'm super
text: excited to be across-the-hall-mates.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: And I know you kinda skated by last year,
dialog: doing the bare minimum thing -- you were
dialog: kind of a lone wolf -- but now you're
dialog: back and I just know that you are going
dialog: to rededicate yourself to the task at --
text: Amy notices Elizabeth's bare hands.
speaker_heading: AMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Where's your beautiful ring?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: My fiance and I broke it off. I found
text: him in bed with someone else.
dialog: Oh my gosh!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: It was another man.
speaker_heading: AMY
speaker_heading: (INCREDULOUS)
dialog: Shut the front door!
dialog: (motioning for a hug)
dialog: Somebody needs a hug.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Somebody doesn't.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Hm. Another time then.
text: Elizabeth takes an apple from a desk.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (RE APPLE)
dialog: These washed?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Of course. I'd never serve a student
text: unwashed fruit.
text: CRUNCH. Elizabeth takes a huge bite out of the apple.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (MOUTHFUL)
dialog: I thought the teachers got the apples.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Well, I think the students teach me at
dialog: least as'much as I teach them.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Stupid.
text: Elizabeth tosses the mostly uneaten apple into the trash
text: and exits. It hits the rim and lands on the floor.
dialog: Okey-dokey.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY
text: It's like an asylum -- nothing on the walls. Elizabeth
text: reads from a stack of US Weekly's and circles pictures of
text: CELEBRITY BREASTS. LYNN, late 30s, the kind of woman who
text: spends a lot of time on her internet dating profiles, but
text: rarely gets emailed, pokes her head in.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Oh sorry, am I interrupting?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Um -- kinda.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Do you want to grab some lunch?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I'm in the middle of something, Lynn.
dialog: My treat.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Fine.
scene_heading: EXT. KFC - DAY
text: Elizabeth and Lynn sit at an outdoor table. Lynn picks at
text: a garden salad. Elizabeth is eating a bucket of chicken
text: and drinking a large drink. She pulls a bottle of cough
text: syrup from her purse and dumps it into her drink.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: You have that thing going around, huh?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Are you excited for tomorrow?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Is tomorrow Saturday?
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: No, it's the first day of school.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Wait, I thought I had a week to get my
dialog: class together.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Yeah, that was last week.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (under her breath)
dialog: Fuck my ass.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: If you hate teaching so much, why don't
dialog: you just get another job?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: And do what? Sell perfume at the mall?
dialog: Work at a day care center?
text: (slurps her big gulp)
dialog: You know, when I first got into teaching,
dialog: I thought I was doing it for all the
dialog: right reasons: short hours, summers off,
dialog: no accountability.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I love my summers. Fresh corn. Mmm.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: From now on, my full-time job will be
dialog: finding a guy who will take care of me --
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Oh god, I pray for that --
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: And that makes a shit ton of money and
dialog: doesn't ask too many questions.
dialog: (licking her fingers)
dialog: I spent most of my summer hanging out at
text: the bars near where the Bulls practice.
dialog: Had some fun, got some cool souvenirs that
dialog: I Ebayed, but those guys aren't looking to
text: settle down. And they all wear condoms.
text: And then they take the condoms with them.
dialog: That's how paranoid they are that a girl
dialog: will try and get pregnant. Like it's so
dialog: easy to get pregnant from a guy nutting
text: into a condom.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: You're gonna find someone great.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I've been thinking about it a lot. I mean,
dialog: I figure I'm like an 8, 8.5. But once I
dialog: get my new tits, I'll probably be a --
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: You don't want to do that. You're
text: already so pretty.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I know I'm hot, Lynn, but I don't stand a
dialog: chance against all those Barbies dolls
dialog: out there. Anna Nicole had it right, may
dialog: she rest in peace.
text: Lynn checks her watch.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: We should finish up. Wally's doing that big
text: orientation for teachers in the auditorium.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Yeah, I'm not going to that.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: But it's mandatory.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: ("I'm so scared")
dialog: Ooohhh...
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Yeah, I probably won't go either. I
dialog: don't know I might. I'll probably go,
dialog: but just sit in the back. Maybe leave
dialog: early. Maybe stay till the end. Play it
dialog: by ear. Or just stay till the end.
text: Lynn takes both their, trays and dumps them.
speaker_heading: LYNN (CONT'D)
dialog: This was fun.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Yeah, it was alright. When you said you
dialog: were taking me to lunch, I kinda thought it
dialog: was going to be nicer, but this was okay.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: It's okay. You can get me next time.
scene_heading: INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
dialog: Not much character, not many furnishings.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Elizabeth is online looking at a PORN SITE. She stares
text: at the SCREEN and compares breasts to the ones in US
text: Weekly. She reaches for a bong and pulls a huge hit.
text: The front door opens and her roommate, KIRK, early 30s,
text: boarish and carrying a tattered backpack and a Big Gulp,
text: walks quickly past Elizabeth.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Hey, Kirk, what do you think about me
dialog: with Jessica Simpson's tits?
text: He stares at her chest intently. She's not bothered by it.
dialog: Go bigger.
text: Kirk enters his bedroom and slams the door.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Cool, yeah.
text: She glances at the clock: 3:14 AM.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: (under her breath)
dialog: Fuck my ass.
scene_heading: INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Elizabeth is asleep. After a beat, the ALARM goes off.
text: She checks the clock: 5.:15. She groans.
scene_heading: INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
text: First day of school excitement. The bell RINGS, and like
text: rats, the KIDS scurry to their various classes. Before
text: long, the hallway is empty.
scene_heading: INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - MORNING
text: In one corner, CHASE, clearly at the top of the seventh
text: grade food chain, shows off a photo spread of herself
text: modelling in a "Western-Style" clothing catalogue.
text: GARRETT, 12, wearing grey, stained sweatpants and a grey
text: sweatshirt with block letters that read "GYMNASTICS,"
text: stares longingly at Chase from a few desks away.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: The photographer was, like, sooo nice.
dialog: He made me feel sooo comfortable.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: I might get flown to Kansas City for
dialog: their fashion week.
speaker_heading: GARRETT
speaker_heading: (RIVETED)
dialog: Oh my.
text: Chase and her friends turn to face Garrett, who's as
text: surprised as they are that he spoke.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Stalk much?
text: Garrett quickly turns away. Chase rolls her eyes. An
text: angry-looking kid, TRISTAN, wearing a MICHAEL VICK
text: JERSEY, turns to Garrett.
speaker_heading: TRISTAN
speaker_heading: (FAKE SNEEZING)
dialog: Faggot.
speaker_heading: GARRETT
speaker_heading: (EARNEST)
dialog: Bless you.
speaker_heading: TRISTAN
dialog: What'd you say to me?
text: Elizabeth, with large bags under her eyes, enters the
text: class. Tristan, on a dime, heads back to his seat.
text: The class immediately quiets down. SASHA, 12, dressed
text: like a paralegal, walks up to Elizabeth with a large
text: Tupperware tray.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Hi, I'm Sasha. It's a pleasure to meet
dialog: you.
dialog: (handing over tupperware)
dialog: My mother baked these for you.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (not looking up)
dialog: Just leave them on the desk.
text: Sasha, confused, gently puts them down and stands there.
text: After a moment, Elizabeth looks up.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: You need something?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 16.
text: - Sasha shakes her head and retreats to her desk at the
text: front of the class.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyone here seen "Stand and Deliver?"
dialog: Show of hands.
dialog: (off their blank stares)
dialog: No one? Edward James Olmos? Wow.
text: Elizabeth takes a DVD from her bag. She points to two
text: KIDS in the front of the class.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: You and you, go grab the TV and roll it
text: up front.
dialog: (pointing to Sasha)
dialog: And you, go shut off the lights.
text: The two kids, SHAWN and SPENCER, roll the TV over. Sasha
text: shuts off the LIGHTS.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: We're watching a movie on the first day?
speaker_heading: CHASE
speaker_heading: (TO ELIZABETH)
dialog: I think it's awesome. You rock.
speaker_heading: GARRETT
dialog: I agree with Chase.
text: Elizabeth pops in the DVD. "Stand and Deliver," starring
text: Edward James Olmos as a tough-as-nails calculus teacher
text: in an inner-city school begins. Elizabeth takes a bite
text: of one of Sasha's cookies and immediately spits it out.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Ugh. Oatmeal raisin?
text: She pushes the Tupperware tray into the trash next to her
text: desk. Sasha looks on, sadly.
scene_heading: INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY
text: Lunch is in full swing. Each clique has staked its own
text: territory. Several TEACHERS, Elizabeth and Amy among
text: them, are on lunch duty.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: GARRETT, sitting alone, writing in a journal. Tristan,
text: the bully, tosses a bowl of cole slaw at Garrett.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRISTAN
dialog: Incoming!
text: Direct hit. The cole slaw nails him in the shoulder.
text: Garrett picks some of the cole slaw off his shirt and
text: eats it. He continues writing. Amy races over to
text: Tristan and writes him up.
text: Elizabeth watches, bored, struggling to keep her eyes
text: open. Amy heads over to Elizabeth.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Somebody's got a case of the sleepies.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Did you see what just happened?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Yeah, that one kid hit the other kid with
dialog: the cole slaw.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You weren't at the orientation the other
dialog: day, but we're doing something new this
dialog: year. It's very exciting. We're
text: splitting the cafeteria into quadrants.
text: Elizabeth yawns.
speaker_heading: AMY (CONT'D)
dialog: So, anyways, in order for the quadrant
dialog: system to work, it's vital that each
dialog: teacher maintain order within their
dialog: quadrant. Because it's really tough for
dialog: me as head lunch monitor -- or another
dialog: teacher -- to leave their quadrant to
dialog: discipline a kid in another quadrant. I
dialog: know it's a lot to take in. I'd be happy
dialog: to sit with-you after school and explain
dialog: all of the new guidelines.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Tell you what. Why don't you send me a
dialog: memo, and if I have any questions, I'll
dialog: come to you.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Okay, Elizabeth. Sounds like a plan,
dialog: Stan.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: AMY (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO ELIZABETH)
dialog: Oh, I meant to ask you. Did I hear that
dialog: you were showing a movie this morning?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: How do I know what you heard?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Fair enough. Listen, I don't want to

dialog: to start.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Are we gonna have a problem, me and you?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Oh, shishkebobs, no. If I gave you that

dialog: than across-the-hall-mates.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I don't know what you've heard, but I
dialog: don't munch box.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No, of course not. I don't even know
dialog: what that is. I just meant friends.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Like getting manicures and going shopping

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (VERY FRIENDLY)

speaker_heading: SCOTT

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

speaker_heading: SCOTT

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

speaker_heading: SCOTT

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Thanks. I love men's watches. It's kind

speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: It's a bummer knowing my watch could feed

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Oh? Your grandfather designs watches?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: The family business. My mom's maiden

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Shut up!
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: My parents had a minor meltdown when I

speaker_heading: SCOTT

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Yeah... So did you and your wife just
dialog: move to town?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: I'm not married.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

speaker_heading: SCOTT

speaker_heading: DR. VOGEL (CONT'D)
dialog: So, Elizabeth, have you given any thought
dialog: to size?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I was thinking, you know, maybe a D.
speaker_heading: DR. VOGEL
dialog: IJh huh, uh huh. I ,would say, though,
dialog: with your frame, you might consider
text: something smaller. A large B, maybe a C
dialog: cup. You'd be surprised how significant
dialog: those would look.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Hmm. Yeah, I think I'll go with the D's,
dialog: really turn some heads.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: DR. VOGEL
dialog: You know, Elizabeth, breast enhancement's
dialog: not a cure-all. I just want to make sure
dialog: you have realistic expectations.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Doctor, I lost my fiance to a woman with
dialog: monster fake tits. So now I need monster
dialog: fake tits so that I won't lose my next
dialog: fiance. Those are my expectations. Is
dialog: that realistic enough for you?
speaker_heading: DR. VOGEL
dialog: Very good then.
scene_heading: INT. DR. VOGEL'S OFFICE - RECEPTION AREA - DAY

text: Elizabeth laughs. Danni laughs.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: That's absurd. What if I don't spend the

speaker_heading: DANNI

speaker_heading: (LEANING IN)

speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I don't know. That's a lot of money.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I know. And I hate asking a friend for

dialog: This has its desired effect on Lynn.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Maybe I could sell that jewelry my

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: That turquoise crap? Blech. No one's

dialog: But it looks great on you.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Thanks. What about Mark?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: What type of person do you think I am?!

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

text: Amy walks over.
speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL SNUR

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Um... some clips, maybe. I think in a lot,

speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL SNUR

speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL SNUR

text: showed up at the carwash in a bikini top and
dialog: short-shorts. It was pretty racy stuff.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL SNUR
speaker_heading: (THRU STALL)
dialog: Can we talk about this later?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (quoting some adage)
dialog: "Later we'll all die, said the gator to

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 36.
text: Another TEACHER walks past Amy, looking confused. He
text: hesitates and then goes into an adjoining stall.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL SNUR
dialog: Look, Josh Gershman's dad called and said
dialog: that the carwash was a huge success. And
dialog: Lauren Rissman's dad called and said the
dialog: kids had a great time.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I don't want to speak out of school, but
dialog: I happened to be pedalling by and saw her
dialog: get.pretty chummy with the money. ,And
dialog: remember, we barely know anything about
dialog: her. She was a real lone wolf last year.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL SNUR
dialog: Are you accusing Elizabeth of embezzling
dialog: from the seventh grade car wash?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Something about this doesn't pass the
dialog: smell test, Wally.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL SNUR
dialog: Well, they raised over $7000, so whatever
dialog: she did worked. And next time you accuse
dialog: a fellow teacher of stealing, you better
dialog: be damn sure. We're done here.
text: Amy takes a deep breath. Her face is BEET RED.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Thanks for the pep talk. Have a super
dialog: day, you two.
text: Amy exits. Immediately, there is an IMMENSE ERUPTION
text: from the other stall, followed by a sigh.
speaker_heading: MALE TEACHER (O.S.)
speaker_heading: (IN STALL)
dialog: Christ... I thought she was never going
dialog: to leave.
scene_heading: INT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY
text: Sandy, the math teacher with the ponytail, sits at the

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (entering, very friendly)
dialog: Hey! Are those new Doc Marten's?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Sandy looks behind him at the dozing teacher. "Is she
dialog: talking to me?"
dialog: Guilty.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: How's Period 5?
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Great, thanks for asking. We got a new
dialog: bassist and we finally got a regular gig,
dialog: which is nice because it's earned. It's
dialog: time to show the world that a bunch of
dialog: teachers can really rock out.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Awesome!
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Hey, would you mind grabbing me my yogurt
dialog: from the fridge?
dialog: Sure thing.
text: Sandy goes to the fridge. Elizabeth pulls visine from
text: her bag, and as his head goes into the fridge, she
text: squirts the entire container into his coffee mug.
speaker_heading: SANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: You should come to one of our shows.
text: He hands her the yogurt.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Oh, I can't.
text: Elizabeth exits. Sandy sadly takes a sip of his coffee.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: I didn't even tell you the dates.
scene_heading: INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY
text: Elizabeth's class is seated. They're staring at her,

speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Are we starting "School Ties" today?
text: Elizabeth holds up her finger while she finishes reading a
scene_heading: NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 38.
text: The camera ANGLES to show that she is studying a picture
text: of a topless AFRICAN TRIBESWOMAN with large breasts.
text: After a beat, Elizabeth looks up.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Alright, today, we're starting "School
dialog: Ties." Classic.
text: (then, pointing to a Student)
dialog: You, shut off the lights.
text: Elizabeth goes to the DVD player. There's a knock at the
text: door and the SCHOOL SECRETARY walks in holding a box.
text: She hands it to a confused Elizabeth.
scene_heading: SCHOOL SECRETARY
dialog: Here it is. Good luck.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Here what is?
scene_heading: SCHOOL SECRETARY
dialog: It's the pre-test for the state
dialog: standardized test. It was in the memo.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Oh, yes. In the memo.
text: The Secretary leaves. Elizabeth stares at the box.
text: Tristan and.a couple kids start making farting noises
text: with their hands.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey. Zip it. Zip your shit.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Alright, look, we all know these tests
dialog: are gay --
text: Elizabeth turns to a student who COULD BE GAY.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey.
text: Elizabeth passes the box to the front of the class, where
text: the kids dutifully take Scan-trons and test booklets.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH.(CONT'D)
dialog: (then, reading)
dialog: According to this memo, I'm supposed to
dialog: give you forty-five minutes per section.
dialog: Blah blah blah. Clear your desks,
dialog: pencils out and -- begin!
text: Twenty-five pencils hit paper in unison.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 39.
text: Elizabeth takes the TV and swivels it to face her desk.
text: She turns on the movie, turns down the volume (just a
text: little bit) and reclines.
scene_heading: INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY
text: Chase and another popular girl strut across the
text: cafeteria, arm in arm. A THIRD POPULAR GIRL, saving a
text: table, waves them over.
text: Chase and her friend walk right past the girl like she
text: doesn't exist and take a seat with a bunch of other girls.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (O.S.)
speaker_heading: (MARVELLING)
dialog: Little bitches.
scene_heading: TURN TO REVEAL
text: Elizabeth and Lynn on lunch duty.
text: The girl at the table starts BAWLING. Amy, also on duty,
text: races over to console her.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: What a phony.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Major phony. But she also cares a lot, too.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: So what's going on with your boobs?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Shit. Shit is going on with my boobs. I'm
dialog: never gonna get married. I'm gonna die
dialog: broke. I should just blow my brains out.
dialog: (then, lighting up)
dialog: There he is!
text: Scott walks down the ramp and HIGH-FIVES a bunch of kids.
text: He gives them a big wave.
speaker_heading: LYNN
text: I love how his eyes sparkle when he smiles.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I want to sit on his face.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Hey, guys.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You're really making a habit out of this.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Ha, yeah. Actually, Sandy Pinkus in the Math
dialog: department, I guess he got that stomach bug
dialog: that's been going around and I got the call.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I heard he pooped himself in first
dialog: period. A kid had to walk him to the
dialog: nurse.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Lynn, would you mind grabbing me a milk?
text: Elizabeth gives her a "can you get out of here?" look.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Scott, do you want anything?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: I'm good, thanks for asking.
text: Lynn walks off.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: So, Scott --
text: Lynn comes back.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Sorry, what kind of milk do you want?
dialog: Skim? Whole? 2%? Chocolate?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I don't know. Surprise me.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Okay, I'll get you skim. No, no, 2%.
text: Lynn walks off again.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: She's funny.
text: Elizabeth notices Amy looking at her as she continues to
text: console the girl. Elizabeth turns back to Scott.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: So, Scott, I was thinking, I would love to
dialog: hear about your experiences in the Peace
dialog: Corps. I love Haiti. Maybe we could go
dialog: grab a drink some night. Maybe tonight.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Isn't it Back-to-School Night?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (news to her)
dialog: Yeah, Silly, I meant after.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Cool! Let's get a group together.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Yeah, definitely! Or just the two of us.
text: Scott looks around, then lowers his voice.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Oh. Um, listen, I'm really flattered.
dialog: You're one of the nicest people I've met
dialog: here. But... I'm actually seeing
dialog: someone.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Oh?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Yeah, we've been keeping it quiet.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Because she's ugly?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: No. She's beautiful. She's great. She
dialog: really cares about the kids. It's
dialog: just... when you're dating a co-worker...
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (REALIZING)
dialog: Squirrel?
text: Elizabeth whips around to see Amy, who's now sharing a
text: frozen yogurt with the formerly bawling girl. Amy looks
text: up, smiles and gives a thumbs up to Elizabeth and Scott,
text: signalling that everything's okay with the girl. Elizabeth
text: NOTICES Amy's LARGE BREASTS straining against her blouse.
text: She quietly seethes.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Anyways, thanks again for asking me out.
dialog: I'm honored. And I'll take a raincheck
dialog: on that group date. See ya!
text: Scott crosses through the cafeteria. Lynn returns with a
text: four cartons of milk.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Here you go. I got you one of each.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 42.

scene_heading: EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - NIGHT
text: At night, under the stars, the SCHOOL looks peaceful, serene.
scene_heading: INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - NIGHT
text: Elizabeth is up front. She's staring,at the PARENTS.
text: They stare right back at her. It's awkwardly silent for
text: a beat too long.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Hi, my name's Elizabeth Halsey.
dialog: Soooooo... Any questions?
text: Sasha's Mother eagerly raises her hand. Elizabeth points
dialog: to her.
speaker_heading: SASHA'S MOTHER
dialog: Hi, I'm Sasha's mother. We waved to each
dialog: other at the carwash. I'm a little
dialog: concerned with the importance you're
dialog: placing on movies. What about the state
dialog: test?
text: Elizabeth points to her sign on the wall -- "Don't
dialog: Question My Authority."
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: That's exactly what I say to my students.
dialog: Listen, I'm a good teacher. And the school
dialog: hired me because I'm good at what I do.
dialog: (as the parents take this in)
dialog: And the reason your son loves my class is
dialog: because I inspire him. Movies are one
dialog: tool that I use. I also use other
dialog: multimedia techniques, which I'm not
dialog: going to get into right now. Look, I
dialog: could take you day by day through my
dialog: entire syllabus, but that's not how I do
dialog: things. I'm not one of these stuffy
dialog: teachers who's totally by the book. I
dialog: talk to the kids like they're little
dialog: adults. It's about mutual respect. So
dialog: that's my spiel, as the Jews say.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Help yourselves to some delicious snacks
text: and drinks in the back. Class dismissed.
text: They head to the back of the class. ANGLE ON
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A "refreshments" table. A lonely package of OREOS rests
text: against a PITCHER OF TAP WATER.
text: Elizabeth tries to sneak out the door, but is stopped by
text: a sharply dressed PARENT.
speaker_heading: PARENT #1
dialog: Excuse me, Ms. Halsey.
speaker_heading: (EXTENDING HAND)
dialog: I'm Chris' dad.
text: From Elizabeth's reaction, she clearly has no idea who
dialog: Chris is.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Chris... Great kid -- and precocious.
dialog: You must be so proud.
speaker_heading: CHRIS' DAD
dialog: Oh, what a relief. I just wish his
dialog: grades would reflect it.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: If I know Chris, he'll get there.
speaker_heading: CHRIS' DAD
dialog: Listen, I know you have a full plate, but
dialog: if you could keep an eye on Chris, my
dialog: wife and I would really appreciate it.
text: Chris' dad shakes her hand. Elizabeth opens her hand,
text: sees a tightly folded HUNDRED DOLLAR bill. She looks
text: back up at Chris' dad.
speaker_heading: CHRIS' DAD (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (WINKING)
dialog: For supplies. Or whatever.
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Elizabeth stands with another set of parents. They're
text: eating Oreos and sipping water.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You're Chase's parents? Great kid -- and
dialog: precocious. You must be so proud.
text: The parents beam.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: A student like that would benefit so much
text: from some extra attention.
speaker_heading: CHASE'S MOM
dialog: You think we should hire a tutor?
dialog: (then, to Chase's Dad)
dialog: I told you.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (CONSPIRATORIAL)
dialog: I'd be happy to do it myself. It's just
text: hard in a class of twenty-five.
speaker_heading: CHASE'S MOM
dialog: Oh, to be a teacher.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: It's just so hard, on my salary, having to
dialog: pay for my supplies, my fiance cheated on
dialog: me with his twin sister... and, unlike a
dialog: lot of these other teachers, all I truly
dialog: care about is helping your child learn.
dialog: And as their personal tutor, I guarantee a
dialog: full grade higher -- or your money back.
text: Chase's mom takes out her check book.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Make it out to "cash."
scene_heading: JUMP-.CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - LATER
text: Parents are leaving the class, ad-libbing "thank.you's."
text: Another SET OF PARENTS surreptitiously hand Elizabeth
dialog: some cash.
text: A Bohemian mother, MELODY, wearing a beret, lingers behind.
speaker_heading: MELODY
dialog: Excuse me, Ms. Halsey. I just wanted to
dialog: introduce myself. I'm Melody. Garrett's
dialog: mom.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (EYEING BERET)
dialog: Nice to meet you... Garrett's a great kid

speaker_heading: MELODY
dialog: Oh, you're referring to his poetry.
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You must be so proud.
speaker_heading: MELODY
dialog: I am. So so so so so proud. So proud.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: A kid like that, if I could just give some
dialog: more one on one time, he would just blossom.
speaker_heading: MELODY
dialog: I'm so happy to hear you say that.
dialog: would really benefit from that.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Unfortunately, in a class of twenty-
dialog: five...
speaker_heading: MELODY
dialog: Ugh. Class sizes are ridiculous.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: And with the amount they pay teachers...
speaker_heading: MELODY
dialog: Thank god you love what you do.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I guess what I'm getting at is, maybe you
dialog: could help out by giving me a little --
dialog: you know -- somethin somethin.
text: Elizabeth offers her hand, palm up. Melody stares back
text: at her blankly.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: It's just, it's really tough to teach the
dialog: way that I want to teach when there's so
dialog: little money. I mean, look at this place.
speaker_heading: MELODY
dialog: You know what I'm going to do for you?
text: Melody opens her pocketbook. Elizabeth smiles.
speaker_heading: MELODY (CONT'D)
dialog: I am going to start a letter-writing
dialog: campaign to the school board, to my
dialog: congressman, to the mayor -- and keep
dialog: writing until you get what you deserve.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She opens her date book and writes herself a note.
speaker_heading: MELODY (CONT'D)
dialog: And I'm writing myself a reminder!
text: Melody pulls Elizabeth into a warm hug.
speaker_heading: MELODY (CONT'D)
dialog: You are a saint.
text: Melody exits. Elizabeth is left in the classroom by
dialog: herself.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: So long, Crazy.
text: As Elizabeth pulls out the CASH she just made, we hear
text: the opening beats of COOLIO'S "GANGSTER'S PARADISE."
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. J.A.M.S. - ADMINISTRATION BULLPEN - DAY

scene_heading: INT. THRIFT STORE - DAY
text: The SONG continues. Elizabeth stands across from a
text: HIPPIE-LOOKING GIRL. The pile of "Lost and Found"

scene_heading: INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The SONG continues as Elizabeth throws more money in her
text: "New Tits" jar and enters a new amount into her notebook.
dialog: The new balance: $1473.
scene_heading: INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY
text: "Gangster's Paradise" CONTINUES and we see that the class
text: is now watching "Dangerous Minds" with Michelle Pfeiffer
text: as a tough-as-nails teacher in an inner-city school.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AMY'S CLASSROOM - SAME
text: The SONG continues as Amy, in her empty classroom, stands
text: against the adjoining wall, her ear pressed to it.
scene_heading: INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - ANOTHER DAY
text: The SONG continues. The class is still watching
text: "Dangerous Minds." There's some NOISE in the hall.
text: Elizabeth PAUSES the movie, STOPPING the song. She leans
text: into the hall.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Enough with the commotion!
text: The hallway goes silent. She comes back in and UNPAUSES
text: the movie. The SONG comes back on.
scene_heading: INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
text: The SONG continues as the hallway fills with excited
text: kids, who race down the hall and talk animatedly with

scene_heading: EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAY
text: The SONG continues. Elizabeth sits in her car. She lights
text: a joint with the cigarette lighter and deeply inhales.
text: KNOCK KNOCK! The SONG abruptly ENDS.
text: Elizabeth jumps. She turns to her window, sees Sasha,
text: bundled in her winter coat, waving.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (through the window)
dialog: What do you want?
text: Sasha motions for her to roll down the window. Elizabeth
dialog: doesn't.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Is that marijuana?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: It is. But it's medicinal. Doctor gave
dialog: it to me. Not that it's any of your
dialog: business.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Oh, okay. Feel better.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: My mom and I made you holiday cookies. Here.
text: Sasha pulls out a tupperware container.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (peering through window)
dialog: Are those oatmeal raisin?
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Sugar.
text: Elizabeth considers, then manually rolls down the window
text: a crack. She grabs the container and quickly closes her
text: window. Elizabeth starts eating a cookie.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You have anything to drink?
text: Sasha shakes her head.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Word to the wise: stop dressing like
dialog: you're running for congress.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: I don't want to run for congress. I want
dialog: to be president.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: See? That's what I'm talking about.
dialog: Keep saying stuff like that, you're gonna
dialog: get punched. You really want to be
dialog: President or is that what your parents
dialog: tell to be?
text: Sasha shrugs.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't have to decide right now. Who
dialog: knows? Maybe you wake up one day and
dialog: decide that you love giving massages and
dialog: you want to be a masseuse. Salary plus
dialog: tips. Think about it.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: If I think about it, will I get extra
dialog: credit?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: Hopeless. Watch your feet.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 49.
text: Elizabeth reverses. Sasha jumps away from the car.
text: Elizabeth peels out, passing the school marquee that
dialog: reads, "Happy Holidays, Jammers! See you in '09!"
scene_heading: INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY
text: Elizabeth rolls over. It's 3:40 PM. She yawns and gets
text: out of bed.
scene_heading: INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: QUICK CUTS. Elizabeth opens her refrigerator. Nothing
dialog: except ketchup packets, mustard packets and soy sauce
dialog: packets.
text: She reaches for her bong and tries lighting it. Once.
text: Twice. She shakes the lighter. No luck.
text: She carries the bong to the stove, turns on the stove,
text: and tries lighting it from there. No luck.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Seriously?
scene_heading: EXT. LIQUOR STORE - AFTERNOON
text: Elizabeth walks up to the door. It's locked. She shakes
text: the door.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Seriously?
text: She sees a HOMELESS GUY leaning against the storefront.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Why's the store closed?
text: The Homeless Guy looks at her strangely.
speaker_heading: HOMELESS GUY
dialog: It's Christmas.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Seriously?

speaker_heading: HOMELESS GUY

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Whatever.
dialog: (then, stops)
dialog: Hey, you got a lighter?
speaker_heading: HOMELESS GUY
dialog: I don't smoke. It's bad for you.
text: Elizabeth walks back to her car, empty-handed. A MINI-

text: The window rolls down. It's Garrett and his Mom.
speaker_heading: GARRETT
dialog: Ms. Halsey! Hey, it's me, Garrett!
speaker_heading: MELODY

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: MELODY

speaker_heading: MELODY

scene_heading: INT. GARRETT'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY
text: Cozy and unpretentious. Filled with crafts. Elizabeth sits

text: Elizabeth tears through a plate of Christmas cuisine.
speaker_heading: MELODY
dialog: This is a real treat for Garrett. He doesn't

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I find that hard to believe.
speaker_heading: (CHECKS WATCH)
dialog: Listen, I hate to eat and run, but I've

speaker_heading: GARRETT

speaker_heading: AUNT #1
dialog: A shelter. That is so inspiring.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Yeah, I love helping bums.
speaker_heading: MELODY
dialog: Oh, but you have to wait for dessert. We
dialog: have a real treat.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: If it's cheesecake, I'll stay.
speaker_heading: MELODY
dialog: It's even better than cheesecake!
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Garrett, why don't you run and get some
dialog: of your new poetry?
speaker_heading: GARRETT
dialog: (feigning. embarrassment)
dialog: Oh god, no one wants to hear it. Oh god,
dialog: I'm so embarrassed!
speaker_heading: MELODY
dialog: Don't be shy, Marbles.
text: Garrett runs out of the room.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: If you're not really serving dessert, I'm
dialog: gonna have to get going.
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: MELODY
dialog: One poem? If you like it, maybe you can

scene_heading: INT. GARRETT'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER
text: Garrett stands in front of Elizabeth and his family. He
text: opens his journal, clears his throat, and begins.
speaker_heading: GARRETT
dialog: This is called "The Chase," by Garrett

speaker_heading: (READING)
dialog: XOXO /My love for you is XOXO/
dialog: Her hair is long and straight / Isn't it
dialog: great? / About her smile / That I would
dialog: walk a mile for / About her personality /
dialog: That makes me see the best in me / And at
dialog: night when we sleep / Our souls locked in
dialog: deep / So that when we sleep / We can
dialog: stop pretending / And embrace our
dialog: beautiful ending.
text: Melody applauds. The Aunts join in. Elizabeth claps,
text: then gets up to go. Garrett shakes them all off.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
text: She sits back down.
speaker_heading: GARRETT
dialog: We'll dance our dance / We'll revel in
dialog: romance perchance / One glance / One dance
dialog: / Because together we can achieve...

speaker_heading: MELODY
dialog: Patty, Nancy, why don't you give me a

dialog: to talk about the poem.
text: The women exit, leaving Garrett and Elizabeth.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: So your poem's about that girl?
speaker_heading: GARRETT
dialog: Chase, yeah. You got the subtext.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Can I give you some advice?
speaker_heading: GARRETT
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Number one, stop writing poetry. Two:

dialog: the one with the teeth?
text: Elizabeth puts her hands to show teeth going off in
dialog: different directions.
speaker_heading: GARRETT
dialog: But I like Chase.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Not gonna happen. Look, I was that hot
dialog: girl. Hotter, even. And I never would
dialog: have gone out with a kid like you. And
dialog: I'm not saying that to be mean. I'm
dialog: saying it to be helpful.
speaker_heading: GARRETT
dialog: What do you know? You don't-even know
dialog: our names.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I'll tell you what I know: a kid who
text: wears the same "Gymnastics" sweatshirt
dialog: three days a week isn't getting laid
dialog: until he's 26. That's what I know.
speaker_heading: GARRETT
speaker_heading: (EMOTIONAL)

scene_heading: INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY
text: The students, many tanned, many with braids in their hair
text: from their winter vacations, silently stare at Elizabeth.
text: She looks haggard. She pulls out a bottle of cough syrup

text: The kids look at each other, like "what is she doing?"
text: Elizabeth lets out a lame, fake cough.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Shut up.
scene_heading: INT. WOMEN'S FACULTY BATHROOM - DAY

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

dialog: They're perfect.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: You should hear some of their originals.

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: No thanks... You know, I was thinking

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: What bonus?
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: For the state test.

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
scene_heading: (SURPRISINGLY SUPPORTIVE)

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Balls!
text: She knocks the stack of ungraded papers to the ground.
text: After a beat, she collects herself, goes to pick the,

speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Then what's up?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I need some date rape drugs.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: (hurt, defensive)
dialog: Two things. Number one: who do you think
dialog: I am? Yeah, I like to party and yeah,
dialog: I'm in an awesome frat, but that really
dialog: hurts. And two: they're not "date rape"
dialog: drugs. It's called GHB -- and it's for
dialog: weightlifting. It helps build mass,
dialog: okay? Why do you even want it?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (DEADPAN)
dialog: For lifting.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: I have money and I'm in a rush.

speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: That's all you needed to say. No need to

text: bottle containing a clear liquid.
speaker_heading: TUCKER (CONT'D)
dialog: One capful makes you feel really good.
text: Two capfuls will knock her out for a
dialog: couple hours. You don't want to take any
dialog: more than two.
text: Elizabeth hands him some cash. He hands her the jar and
text: then gives her a big, warm hug.
speaker_heading: TUCKER (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen, I know you and my brother aren't

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (O.S.)

speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

scene_heading: INT. T.G.I.FRIDAY'S - NIGHT
text: A portly, unkempt man in a cheap suit, CARL HALABI,

speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Marjorie?
text: "Marjorie" turns and we SEE that it's actually ELIZABETH,

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You must be Carl.
text: His face lights up, excited to be in the company of such

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

text: Elizabeth motions for him to sit down.
speaker_heading: CARL
speaker_heading: (NERVOUS)

speaker_heading: CARL

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

speaker_heading: CARL

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Listen, I'd love to sit here and chat

speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: But I'm sure you're a very busy man, so
dialog: I'll get right down to it.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: I've spoken to various, um, black citizens

speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (shakes head in frustration)
dialog: You can't use my name, okay?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: No problem.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Like I told you on the phone, every couple

dialog: how do you formulate an education budget
dialog: without hard numbers from one of my tests?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You don't need to convince me. But you

speaker_heading: CARL

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

scene_heading: INT. ILLINOIS STANDARDIZED TEST OFFICES - NIGHT

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

speaker_heading: CARL

scene_heading: INT. STANDARDIZED TEST OFFICES - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

scene_heading: INT. STANDARDIZED TEST OFFICES - LATER

speaker_heading: CARL

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (as to a child)
dialog: Carl, I'm gonna need you to pass the fuck out.

text: passes out, STILL STANDING.
text: Elizabeth grabs the lanyard from Carl's neck and heads back

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

dialog: you were so embarrassed and you made me
dialog: promise not to ever tell anyone. Well, I
dialog: never did and I never will. I know we're

speaker_heading: GARRETT
dialog: They'll probably reject me, too.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Yeah, probably. But life's about how you

dialog: Don't answer right now. Let it marinate.
dialog: Oh, and I should mention that if this
dialog: goes to trial, I can cry on cue.
text: Elizabeth starts crying. Everybody looks at her, aghast.
text: And as quickly she started, she stops.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, if you'll all excuse me, I should be
dialog: heading to fifth period. I hate to be
dialog: tardy.
scene_heading: INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY
text: Elizabeth heads down the empty hallway. From the auditorium,
text: the faint sound of "Tomorrow, Tomorrow" from "Annie" can be
dialog: heard.
text: Amy steps out of the auditorium, humming along to the song.
text: She notices Elizabeth coming to her. Amy debates her options.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Elizabeth! I was so worried. You gave
dialog: us quite a scare, you did.
text: Elizabeth doesn't acknowledge her and continues walking
text: toward Amy, only feet away now.
speaker_heading: AMY (CONT'D)
dialog: (attempting some levity)
dialog: Somebody's being a grumple--
text: BAM! Elizabeth punches Amy square in the nose. Amy drops
text: to her knees and grabs her nose, now squirting blood.
speaker_heading: AMY (CONT'D)
text: Elizabeth keeps walking and turns a corner. A BELL RINGS
text: and the hallway starts filling with STUDENTS.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL SNUR (V.0.)
dialog: Well, it's been another great year at
dialog: JAMS...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 108.
scene_heading: INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - GYM - DAY
text: QUICK CUTS. The year is winding down. Instead of gym,
text: kids are using the time to sign each other's yearbooks.
text: Chase walks up to Garrett with her yearbook, asks him to
dialog: sign it.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL SNUR (V.0.)
dialog: Who can forget the exciting addition of a
text: climbing wall to the small gym...
scene_heading: INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY
text: QUICK CUTS. It's class photo day. With each FLASH, we
text: SEE a different TEACHER with a different CLASS.
text: And finally AMY, with a bandage over her nose and two
text: black eyes, smiles widely alongside her CLASS.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL SNUR (V.0.)
dialog: .Or the student/teacher spelling bee.
scene_heading: INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY
text: Much like the first scene of the movie. The teachers are
text: sipping plastic flutes of Champagne. Principal Snur is
text: up front. Elizabeth lingers in the back.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL SNUR
dialog: I think that was a huge s-u-c-c-a-s-s.
text: Polite laughter.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
dialog: But seriously... With summer around the
dialog: corner, it's time to not only say goodbye
dialog: to another school year, but to also say
dialog: goodbye to one of our own.
text: Elizabeth smiles.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
text: Amy Squirrel.
text: Amy, her face completely healed, steps forward, with a
text: pursed smile.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
dialog: After six short years of outstanding,
dialog: tireless work here, Amy is transferring
text: out of the district.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
dialog: I know she'll bring her love for learning
text: to her new students.
text: Sandy, the ponytailed teacher, pipes up.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Speech! Speech!
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Although leaving was a difficult
dialog: choice...
text: Amy looks over to Elizabeth, who motions for her to
dialog: continue.
speaker_heading: AMY (CONT'D)
dialog: When the superintendent personally asks
dialog: you to work at one of the worst schools
dialog: in the state, you say yes. I'm looking
dialog: forward to bringing my brand of zany
dialog: energy and lust -- not love, lust -- for
dialog: learning to the underprivileged students
dialog: at Malcolm X High. I welcome the
dialog: challenge.
text: The Teachers applaud, Scott the most enthusiastic.
text: Elizabeth steps up to Amy, who flinches.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Here, I got you this.
text: Elizabeth hands Amy a poster tube. She.opens it and
text: unravels the "Integrity" poster that Elizabeth stole.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: And good luck. Somebody's gonna need it.
text: Elizabeth heads for the door. Scott catches up to her.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Hey, Stranger.
dialog: (then, whispers)
dialog: Listen, now that Amy's transferring,
dialog: maybe the two of us could go grab a
dialog: drink.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Elizabeth walks out.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: CHYRON: THREE MONTHS LATER
scene_heading: EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAY
text: Elizabeth's 1994 Grand-Am pulls into her spot. And as
text: her bare leg steps out of the car, we
scene_heading: INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
text: The hallway is empty. We FOLLOW Elizabeth from behind,
text: and as she reaches for the door to her class, we
scene_heading: INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY
text: Quick cuts. From behind, we see Elizabeth place an APPLE
text: on each desk, just as Amy did earlier.
text: Elizabeth's walls are still bare, except for a framed
text: photo of Amy's class picture, with Amy's messed up face,
dialog: from the year before.
text: The bell RINGS.
text: Elizabeth turns and we now SEE that she has TASTEFUL FAKE
text: BREASTS.
text: Elizabeth walks to her door and opens it, watching the
text: students as they reconnect with friends and share stories
dialog: about summer camp.
text: She notices Sasha who is MASSAGING a BOY's shoulders.
text: bunch of other EIGHTH GRADE BOYS wait their turn.
scene_heading: EIGHTH GRADE BOY
dialog: Do me! Do me!
text: Sasha clearly enjoys the attention. Elizabeth smiles.
text: Garrett walks by, hand in hand with Chase. Trailing both
text: of them are identical rolling backpacks. He sees
text: Elizabeth and runs over.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You and Chase, huh? She likes the
dialog: poetry?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARRETT
dialog: She likes that I'm kind of a celebrity.
dialog: But I'm cool with it. I'm the man around
dialog: here!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Easy.
speaker_heading: GARRETT
dialog: Well, I should get going. See you
dialog: around, Ms. Halsey. Oh, and nice...
text: He points at her breasts.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
speaker_heading: (TOUCHED)
dialog: Thanks! You're the first student to
dialog: notice.
text: Garrett smiles and walks off. Lynn walks by. She's
text: cleaning another big stain from her shirt.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Elizabeth, hey! How was your summer?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: It was great. I met a doctor! Plastic
dialog: surgeon, actually. He's amazing.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: He sounds amazing. How'd you meet him?
dialog: The internet?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: No, in recovery. And I looked like ass,
dialog: so I know it's real.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Sounds like a fairy tale.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: It is. Storybook. Well, not total
dialog: storybook. It's a little messy because
dialog: his wife filed for divorce last week, but
dialog: we're gonna get through that.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: So you want to grab lunch later?
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Sure! My treat.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: No, you got it last time. We'll split it.
