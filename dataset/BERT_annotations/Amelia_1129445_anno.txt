text: CLOSE on a mud-streaked AIRFIELD in mist and driving RAIN.
text: A Lockheed ELECTRA sits. Sleek, twin-engine, state-of-the-
text: art, its metallic surface battered by the monsoon. Waiting.
dialog: PULL BACK to see...
text: ...our VIEW down onto the landing strip is from an open-
text: sided, thatched roof BAR high above the airfield. And
text: peering down through the mist and rain...
text: ...a WOMAN in grimy flight clothes gazes at the plane.
text: Slender. Feminine. At first glance, fragile. Then the gray
text: eyes change like the sea, as a stray thought transforms her.
text: Something fierce lives there.

speaker_heading: FRED (O.S.)
dialog: Sure I can't talk you inta
dialog: somethin' more adventurous?
text: She turns. FRED NOONAN is tall and lean, ruggedly handsome
text: in a reckless way. His flight clothes as rumpled and dirt-
text: streaked as her own. He carries his bottle of tequila, and a
text: Coke which he sets down for her.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Adventurous? You've got the wrong
dialog: girl, Mister. You should know that
dialog: by now.
text: Her eyes study him. Assessing something as he pours himself
text: four fingers.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Actually. I knew that the moment I
dialog: met ol' George.
text: He sips his drink. She says nothing.
speaker_heading: FRED (CONT'D)
dialog: I like how you don't talk about
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: That why I get so many chances to
dialog: not do it?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Well. Natural curiosity.
text: His charming smile. She's thinking more about the tequila.
text: She reaches to take his bottle and glass. Moves them to her
text: side of the table.
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: I mean, why would a guy who needs
dialog: to run the show. Pick the one girl
dialog: he knew could kick his tail?
text: No response. Just her clear direct gaze.
speaker_heading: FRED (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll bet he knew that. First time
dialog: he met you.
text: She looks out to sea.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: He thought I hated him. He never
dialog: knew I was fascinated.

scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S OFFICE, NEW YORK - DAY
dialog: 2 2
text: Alone by the window, he gazes at the city. A powerfully
text: built man in a perfectly-tailored suit. The face at once
text: strong and elegant, capable of every emotion. Yet just now,
dialog: there are none to be seen. Even as...
text: ...a door OPENS. A pretty SECRETARY enters soundlessly, sits
text: respectfully. Waits, her pen suspended above her steno pad.
dialog: Does he know she's there?
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE: NEW YORK, LATER 1937.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (without turning)
dialog: The first time I met her she sat
dialog: in that chair.
text: The secretary doesn't know whether to write that down. And
text: still with his back to her...
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: You may as well write it down,
dialog: Mary. Write it all down. Even the
dialog: parts that are confused or
dialog: graceless or boring.
text: He turns with a soft smile to put her at ease.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: We'll see if I remember how to
dialog: edit.
text: She smiles back. She likes him, as much as her level of
text: being awed by him permits. She begins to write, as...
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'd kept her waiting two hours.
speaker_heading: T
dialog: She hated me on sight, but she
dialog: hought I couldn't tell.
text: His gaze drifts to a bookcase crammed with volumes. And one
text: object, oddly out of place. A stuffed CAT, with boots and a
text: green frock coat. It wears a confident ironic smile.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: She was a person who cherished her
dialog: privacy and was devoting her life
dialog: to social work. And there I was...
text: His smile is kind. And honestly self-mocking.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
text: Self-obsessed. Wallowing in the
dialog: glory of my authors and celebrity
dialog: acquaintances. A vain, fast-
dialog: talking, manipulator. But then I
dialog: guess you know all that, don't you?
dialog: She looks up reproachfully. Nothing of the kind, and you
dialog: know it.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, yes. And the kind of man who
dialog: fishes for compliments.
dialog: He's made her laugh.
text: DISSOLVE TO...

dialog: 3 3
scene_heading: INT. RECEPTION AREA - DAY
text: She is younger, dressed conservatively. The calm at the
text: center of a storm. Agents, authors, couriers, peddlers come
text: and go. But she has her legs drawn up beneath her, pouring
text: through a small stack of volumes. As if preparing for an
dialog: exam.
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE: G.P. PUTNAM'S SONS PUBLISHING CO. 1928.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (V.O.)
dialog: The waiting made her furious.
dialog: She undoubtedly felt I was
speaker_heading: E

speaker_heading: GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Actually, I hadn't given her a
dialog: thought. Oblivious as usual.
dialog: Which, perhaps, was even worse.
text: Now, SKYWARD by ADM. RICHARD BYRD. Photos of the explorer
text: preparing for his flight over the North Pole. One of Byrd
text: with George himself, displaying considerable gravitas.
speaker_heading: AMELIA (V.O.)
dialog: I figured he'd be pompous.
text: Her eye travels over the stack of books. Adventurers,
text: explorers, celebrities. On an end table, a framed photo of
dialog: George with the great Lindbergh.
text: A pretty SECRETARY comes to summon her. Amelia rises,
text: smooths the wrinkles from her brown suit. They head down
dialog: the corridor.
speaker_heading: AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I knew, of course, that he wasn't
dialog: going to choose me. I had no
dialog: discernible qualifications
dialog: whatsoever.
text: They reach the door, already ajar. It says GEORGE PALMER
text: PUTNAM on a small bronze plate. The secretary gingerly
text: pushes it open...
text: ...revealing George on the phone in crisp shirtsleeves and
text: suspenders. He paces, prowls, trailing the cord behind him,
text: negotiating non-stop even as he flips through a pile of
text: messages. Off again, stalking the room. Dashing, electric,
dialog: masterful.
speaker_heading: AMELIA (V.O)
dialog: But to be rejected by this...
text: parasite. A man who had given up
dialog: any life of his own to flutter near
dialog: the famous.
text: He glances up, realizing for the first time that she is
dialog: there. Sit, please. But she doesn't.
speaker_heading: AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn't know whether to laugh or
text: throw something at the jerk.
text: He gestures again, more commandingly. Sit. She doesn't
text: move, she doesn't smile. She doesn't take her steady gaze
text: from him. He hangs up the phone.
text: They stare at each other for a frozen beat. He breaks the
text: moment with a charming smile...

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Miss Earhart?
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Mr. Putnam?
speaker_heading: GEORGE (softly)
dialog: I asked you to sit.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Was that the thing you did with
dialog: your hand? Sadly, I don't speak
dialog: dog.
text: His smile now only a trace. But more genuine.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: A Ah. Well, stand if you like.
text: melia sits.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm told you want to fly the
dialog: Atlantic Ocean.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: In the 12 months since Lindbergh,
text: 55 people in 18 planes have tried.
dialog: Three planes made it. Fourteen
dialog: people have died.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: I'll make it.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Three women died trying. Two
dialog: others escaped with their lives.
dialog: If you do make it, you'd be the
dialog: first. Which...is the real
dialog: attraction for both of us, I
dialog: suspect.
text: She nods. No smile.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Always nice to know what the real
dialog: attraction is.
text: His smile. Beginning to enjoy this conversation.
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: The plane was bought from Adm. Byrd
text: by Amy Guest, a socialite who
dialog: wanted the record for herself. Her
dialog: family wouldn't tolerate the
dialog: danger. She has asked for a
dialog: replacement...
dialog: He gestures. Perhaps you.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: ...who is American, educated, well-
dialog: spoken, a flyer, preferably
dialog: physically attractive...
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Why would that matter?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Because she wants the world to pay
dialog: attention. And pretty girls
dialog: command more attention.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Was that your advice?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Sure. My role is selling this
dialog: event to the public. There will be
dialog: a contract for the girl's story
dialog: with the New York Times. Also a
dialog: book to be published over her name.
dialog: Understood...? G
speaker_heading: EORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: But all the money from these will
dialog: go to Mrs. Guest.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Except for the part that goes to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Which will be as great as I can
dialog: manage, I assure you.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: You said she wants a flyer.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Don't get your hopes up. The
dialog: celebrated Wilmer Stultz will be
dialog: the pilot. There'll be a male co-
text: pilot and navigator. The woman
dialog: will be purely a passenger.
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He waits for reaction. She keeps her mouth shut.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: That's good for your chances.
dialog: Because your level of flying
dialog: experience wouldn't place you
dialog: anywhere near the group that would
dialog: be considered for this. If the
dialog: woman were to do any flying at all.
text: No punches pulled. Not his style.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Why would anyone want a book from a
dialog: passenger?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Because the hook is that we're
text: making the woman the commander.
dialog: The pilot will sign a contract
text: saying he is under her direction
dialog: and control. It's her ship, her
dialog: flight.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Good for my chances, you said.
dialog: What are my chan...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: The job's yours.
text: She blinks. Stunned speechless.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I chose you the moment you walked
text: through the door.
text: He smiles his charming smile. Several phones are RINGING.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Now assuming my awful manners
dialog: haven't soured you on the
dialog: enterprise. May I give you a lift
dialog: to the station?
text: Amelia rises. Is she pissed at being toyed with?
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: You're a busy man, Mr. Putnam. I
dialog: can find my way.

speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Fine. What have I done?
text: She watches his smile.
speaker_heading: AMELIA (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn't mind waiting. Caught up
text: on my reading. Knitted a sweater.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I mean an apology. For what's
dialog: coming.
text: His voice softens.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm going to be pretty controlling
dialog: these next few months. How you
dialog: dress, move, cut your hair. Speak
dialog: in public. It's all part of the
dialog: package we're selling.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: We.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: That's right. If you're not in
dialog: there selling with me, it won't
dialog: work.
text: The smile turns friendly.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: You're the star. I'm no one at
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Spoken like a gentleman.
text: She steps up onto the train. Extends her hand like a man.
text: He shakes it firmly. The train begins to move. She watches

text: But Amelia stands still, throws her arms WIDE, and the
dialog: plane...
text: ...DROPS lower, and LOWER, as it CLOSES straight in on the

speaker_heading: AMELIA (V.O.)

dialog: the plane.
text: They turn toward us now. BILL STULTZ is short and wiry with

text: and the streaks of gray through his hair. He is not
dialog: necessarily happy to see us.
speaker_heading: AMELIA (V.O.)
dialog: George had told me Stultz was Adm.
dialog: Byrd's favorite pilot, fearless,

dialog: it never affected his work.

dialog: each other.
speaker_heading: AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Boys, I'd like to introduce your

speaker_heading: AMELIA

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Say hello to Slim Gordon your
dialog: navigator.
text: She is shaking hands in that strong, direct way.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: This way, if you're forced down

speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Hmmn. What does that do to our

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Costs us at least 400 gallons.
dialog: Don't bother bringing clothes for

dialog: nearest beach in Ireland. Real
dialog: lucky.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: The Admiral estimates the pontoons
dialog: only cut our range by 200 miles.
dialog: But Amelia looks to Bill. That's not really possible is it?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: The Admiral is the Admiral. He
dialog: gets to estimate any damn thing he

speaker_heading: BILL (CONT'D)

dialog: It is an act of decision.
text: A held look. No one smiles. We hear her name ANNOUNCED from

dialog: does...
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Wish I was important enough for
dialog: you to manage.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, I've just got one client.
dialog: And most days she's more than I
dialog: can manage.
text: Even Elinor's smile seems older, more capable of subtlety.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Get in line behind the boys she
text: smacked around on the Derby.
dialog: He grins back. You bet.
speaker_heading: ELINOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Some of the gal flyers had their
dialog: doubts about her...well, her skill
dialog: level. But she's everyone's
dialog: champion now.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: And both of those things. Are the
dialog: S reasons I called you.
text: trange words. He has her attention.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I think it would be huge for women
dialog: flyers if Amelia won the Derby.
dialog: The publicity would put the race,
dialog: and all of you, up there with the
dialog: boys.
dialog: 
dialog: 47.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: I'm not sure she has much of a
dialog: chance, Mr. Putnam.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, the one shot would be putting
text: her in a far more powerful plane
dialog: than anything she's flown. We're
dialog: thinking the Lockheed Vega.
text: The girl's shock. He really means this.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Sir, I've test piloted the Vega.
dialog: It's way more than she could ever
dialog: handle. It wouldn't be safe, let
dialog: alone successful.
text: He smiles.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: That's why I'm thinking of you
dialog: flying with her. You could handle
dialog: the cross-country flying, the more
dialog: difficult bits, and I'd pay you $75
dialog: a week.
text: Elinor WHISTLES low.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: Well, I think that's the most
dialog: generous opportunity I've ever
dialog: been offered.
text: He stares at her.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: There's just one thing. Obviously,
dialog: it has to appear that Amelia did
dialog: all the flying. So when pictures
dialog: are taken, you'll stand off to one
dialog: side.
text: Her eyes narrow. He's completely serious.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: In that case, I'll get my own plane
dialog: and win the race myself.

text: The look in his eye is not to be ignored.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: You can't win if you can't get a
dialog: plane to enter. Let me predict
dialog: that you won't.
text: The voice calm and low and riveting.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: In fact. If you reject my
dialog: generosity, you may come to regret
text: it. For a long, long time.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: That's a threat.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm an intensely loyal person,
dialog: Elinor. And this is what my
dialog: loyalty requires.
text: She's glaring. Reeling. Trapped.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
dialog: She's the one who said I shouldn't
dialog: let anybody turn me around.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: She probably meant me.
text: So honest, the words confuse her.
speaker_heading: ELINOR
text: Obviously, she doesn't see me as

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, sure she does.

speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Transcontinental was too ambitious.
dialog: Too many hops, too tough on the

text: A lean athlete's body, easy grace in every movement.
text: Strikingly handsome features that convey not only intellect,

speaker_heading: GENE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: What on earth would you need me

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hasn't George taught you anything?
text: Lady Lindy, the queen of the air,
dialog: the best known woman in the entire

speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: AMELIA (V.O.)
dialog: Gene had a terrible marriage and

dialog: adulterous wife. But he was too
text: kind to humiliate her with a
dialog: divorce...
text: Gene drains the last of his beer.
speaker_heading: AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: As a result, he was basically a
dialog: single parent to their young son,
dialog: Gore.
text: He glances at his watch. Wow.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I'm rattling on here, and you've
dialog: got a morning train.

dialog: chance to ask...
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: How's Nina doing?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Oh, fine.
text: Really? He smiles, gently.
speaker_heading: GENE (CONT'D)
dialog: Actually, she hasn't been feeling

speaker_heading: AMELIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Any given meal, I can eat a lobster
dialog: and have you boys in stitches.
text: A full beat. He's deciding.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Gore would love that. He has a
dialog: little crush, I'm afraid.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: At seven?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: He's eight.

speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Are you kidding, it's a godsend.
dialog: No matter how hard George and I
dialog: work, how many lectures we cram in,
dialog: there's never enough money for the
dialog: next adventure.
text: He looks at her. Lets the silence sit there. His eyes seem
dialog: to convey a depth of understanding.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: The next adventure. What is it?
text: She shrugs. No idea.
speaker_heading: GENE (CONT'D)
dialog: Because we're running out of

speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: The only way you can stay where you

dialog: Serious indeed.
speaker_heading: GENE (CONT'D)
dialog: Is to keep feeding the beast.
text: She can't smile anymore. Because this is the very fear she
dialog: lives with.
speaker_heading: GENE (CONT'D)
dialog: And the beast always needs
dialog: something larger, greater, more
dialog: daring...
speaker_heading: AMELIA (quiet)
dialog: He costs money, too.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: The price of fame, literally. Do
dialog: you and George talk about this?

speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: I think the structure may be less
