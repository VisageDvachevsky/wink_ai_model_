scene_heading: INT. STAIRCASE OUTSIDE OLD SALIERI'S SALON - NIGHT - 1823
text: Total darkness. We hear an old man's voice, distinct and in
text: distress. It is OLD SALIERI. He uses a mixture of English
dialog: and occasionally Italian.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: Mozart! Mozart! Mozart. Forgive me!
dialog: Forgive your assassin! Mozart!
text: A faint light illuminates the screen. Flickeringly, we see
text: an eighteenth century balustrade and a flight of stone stairs.
text: We are looking down into the wall of the staircase from the
text: point of view of the landing. Up the stair is coming a
text: branched candlestick held by Salieri's VALET. By his side is
text: Salieri's COOK, bearing a large dish of sugared cakes and
text: biscuits. Both men are desperately worried: the Valet is
text: thin and middle-aged; the Cook, plump and Italian. It is
text: very cold. They wear shawls over their night-dresses and
text: clogs on their feet. They wheeze as they climb. The candles
text: throw their shadows up onto the peeling walls of the house,
text: which is evidently an old one and in bad decay. A cat scuttles
text: swiftly between their bare legs, as they reach the salon
dialog: door.
text: The Valet tries the handle. It is locked. Behind it the voice
text: goes on, rising in volume.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: Show some mercy! I beg you. I beg
dialog: you! Show mercy to a guilty man!
text: The Valet knocks gently on the door. The voice stops.
speaker_heading: VALET
dialog: Open the door, Signore! Please! Be
dialog: good now! We've brought you something
dialog: special. Something you're going to
dialog: love.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: VALET
dialog: Signore Salieri! Open the door. Come
dialog: now. Be good!
text: The voice of Old Salieri continues again, further off now,
text: and louder. We hear a noise as if a window is being opened.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: Mozart! Mozart! I confess it! Listen!
dialog: I confess!
text: The two servants look at each other in alarm. Then the Valet
text: hands the candlestick to the Cook and takes a sugared cake
text: from the dish, scrambling as quickly as he can back down the
dialog: stairs.
scene_heading: EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE SALIERI'S HOUSE - VIENNA - NIGHT
text: The street is filled with people: ten cabs with drivers,
text: five children, fifteen adults, two doormen, fifteen dancing
text: couples and a sled and three dogs. It is a windy night. Snow
text: is falling and whirling about. People are passing on foot,
text: holding their cloaks tightly around them. Some of them are
text: revelers in fancy dress: they wear masks on their faces or
text: hanging around their necks, as if returning from parties.
text: Now they are glancing up at the facade of the old house.
text: The window above the street is open and Old Salieri stands
text: there calling to the sky: a sharp-featured, white-haired
text: Italian over seventy years old, wearing a stained dressing
dialog: gown.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: Mozart! Mozart! I cannot bear it any
dialog: longer! I confess! I confess what I
dialog: did! I'm guilty! I killed you! Sir
dialog: I confess! I killed you!
text: The door of the house bursts open. The Valet hobbles out,
text: holding the sugared cake. The wind catches at his shawl.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: Mozart, perdonami! Forgive your
dialog: assassin! Piet! Piet! Forgive your
dialog: assassin! Forgive me! Forgive!
dialog: Forgive!
speaker_heading: VALET
dialog: (looking up to the
dialog: window)
dialog: That's all right, Signore! He heard
dialog: you! He forgave you! He wants you to
dialog: go inside now and shut the window!
text: Old Salieri stares down at him. Some of the passersby have
dialog: now stopped and are watching this spectacle.
speaker_heading: VALET
dialog: Come on, Signore! Look what I have
dialog: for you! I can't give it to you from
dialog: down here, can I?
text: Old Salieri looks at him in contempt. Then he turns away
text: back into the room, shutting the window with a bang. Through
text: the glass, the old man stares down at the group of onlookers
text: in the street. They stare back at him in confusion.
speaker_heading: BYSTANDER
dialog: Who is that?
speaker_heading: VALET
dialog: No one, sir. He'll be all right.
dialog: Poor man. He's a little unhappy, you
dialog: know.
text: He makes a sign indicating 'crazy,' and goes back inside the
text: house. The onlookers keep staring.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LANDING OUTSIDE OLD SALIERI'S SALON - NIGHT
text: The Cook is standing holding the candlestick in one hand,
text: the dish of cakes in the other. The Valet arrives, panting.
speaker_heading: VALET
dialog: Did he open?
text: The Cook, scared, shakes his head: no. The Valet again knocks
text: on the door.
speaker_heading: VALET
dialog: Here I am, Signore. Now open the
dialog: door.
text: He eats the sugared cake in his hand, elaborately and noisily.
speaker_heading: VALET
dialog: Mmmm - this is good! This is the
dialog: most delicious thing I ever ate,
dialog: believe me! Signore, you don't know
dialog: what you're missing! Mmmm!
text: We hear a thump from inside the bedroom.
speaker_heading: VALET
dialog: Now that's enough, Signore! Open!
text: We hear a terrible, throaty groaning.
speaker_heading: VALET
dialog: If you don't open this door, we're
dialog: going to eat everything. There'll be
dialog: nothing left for you. And I'm not
dialog: going to bring you anything more.
text: He looks down. From under the door we see a trickle of blood
text: flowing. In horror, the two men stare at it. The dish of
text: cakes falls from the Cook's hand and shatters.
text: He sets the candlestick down on the floor. Both servants run
text: at the door frantically - once, twice, three times - and the
text: frail lock gives. The door flies open.
text: Immediately, the stormy, frenzied opening of Mozart's Symphony
text: No. 25 (the Little G Minor) begins. We see what the servants
dialog: see.
scene_heading: INT. OLD SALIERI'S SALON - NIGHT
text: Old Salieri lies on the floor in a pool of blood, an open
text: razor in his hand. He has cut his throat but is still alive.
text: He gestures at them. They run to him. Barely, we glimpse the
text: room - an old chair, old tables piled with books, a forte-
text: piano, a chamber-pot on the floor - as the Valet and the
text: Cook struggle to lift their old Master, and bind his bleeding
text: throat with a napkin.
scene_heading: INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
text: Twenty-five dancing couples, fifty guests, ten servants,
dialog: full orchestra.
text: As the music slows a little, we see a Masquerade Ball in
text: progress. A crowded room of dancers is executing the slow
text: portion of a dance fashionable in the early 1820's.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SALIERI'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: As the fast music returns, we see Old Salieri being carried
text: out of his house on a stretcher by two attendants, and placed
text: in a horse-drawn wagon under the supervision of a middle-
text: aged doctor in a tall hat. This is DOCTOR GULDEN. He gets in
text: beside his patient. The driver whips up the horse, and the
text: wagon dashes off through the still-falling snow.
speaker_heading: MONTAGE:
scene_heading: EXT. FOUR STREETS OF VIENNA AND
scene_heading: INT. THE WAGON - NIGHT
text: The wagon is galloping through the snowy streets of the city.
text: Inside the conveyance we see Old Salieri wrapped in blankets,
text: half-conscious, being held by the hospital attendants. Doctor
text: Gulden stares at him grimly. The wagon arrives outside the
dialog: General Hospital of Vienna.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. A HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - LATE AFTERNOON
text: A wide, white-washed corridor. Doctor Gulden is walking down
text: it with a priest, a man of about forty, concerned, but
text: somewhat self-important. This is Father VOGLER, Chaplain at
text: the hospital. In the corridor as they walk, we note several
text: patients -- some of them visibly disturbed mentally. All
text: patients wear white linen smocks. Doctor Gulden wears a dark
text: frock-coat; Vogler, a cassock.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR GULDEN
dialog: He's going to live. It's much harder
dialog: to cut your throat than most people
dialog: imagine.
text: They stop outside a door.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR GULDEN
dialog: Here we are. Do you wish me to come
dialog: in with you?
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: No, Doctor. Thank you.
text: Vogler nods and opens the door.
scene_heading: INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
text: A bare room - one of the best available in the General
text: Hospital. It contains a bed, a table with candles, chairs, a
text: small forte-piano of the early nineteenth century. As Vogler
text: enters, Old Salieri is sitting in a wheel-chair, looking out
text: the window. His back is to us. The priest closes the door
text: quietly behind him.
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: Herr Salieri?
text: Old Salieri turns around to look at him. We see that his
text: throat is bandaged expertly. He wears hospital garb, and
dialog: over it the Civilian Medal and Chain with which we will later
dialog: see the EMPEROR invest him.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain
dialog: here. I thought you might like to
dialog: talk to someone.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: You tried to take your life. You do
dialog: remember that, don't you?
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: In the sight of God that is a sin.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: Do you understand that you have
dialog: sinned? Gravely.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: Leave me alone.
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: Do you know who I am? You never heard
dialog: of me, did you?
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: That makes no difference. All men
dialog: are equal in God's eyes.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: Are they?
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: Offer me your confession. I can offer
dialog: you God's forgiveness.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: I do not seek forgiveness.
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: My son, there is something dreadful
dialog: on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm
dialog: here only for you. Please talk to
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: How well are you trained in music?
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: I know a little. I studied it in my
dialog: youth.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: Here in Vienna.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: Then you must know this.
text: He propels his wheelchair to the forte-piano, and plays an
text: unrecognizable melody.
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: I can't say I do. What is it?
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: I'm surprised you don't know. It was
dialog: a very popular tune in its day. I
dialog: wrote it. How about this?
text: He plays another tune.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: This one brought down the house when
dialog: we played it first.
text: He plays it with growing enthusiasm.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE STAGE OF AN OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT - 1780'S
text: We see the pretty soprano KATHERINA CAVALIERI, now about
text: twenty-four, dressed in an elaborate mythological Persian
text: costume, singing on stage. She's near the end of a very florid
text: aria by Salieri. The audience applauds wildly.
scene_heading: INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON - 1823
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: (taking his hands off
dialog: the keys)
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: I regret it is not too familiar.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: Can you recall no melody of mine? I
dialog: was the most famous composer in Europe
dialog: when you were still a boy. I wrote
dialog: forty operas alone. What about this
dialog: little thing?
text: Slyly he plays the opening measure of Mozart's Eine Kleine
text: Nachtmusik. The priest nods, smiling suddenly, and hums a
text: little with the music.
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: Oh, I know that! That's charming! I
dialog: didn't know you wrote that.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang
dialog: Amadeus Mozart. You know who that
dialog: is?
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: Of course. The man you accuse yourself
dialog: of killing.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: Ah - you've heard that?
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: All Vienna has heard that.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: ( eagerly)
dialog: And do they believe it?
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: Is it true?
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: Do you believe it?
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: Should I?
text: A very long pause. Salieri stares above the priest, seemingly
text: lost in his own private world.
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: For God's sake, my son, if you have
dialog: anything to confess, do it now!
dialog: Give yourself some peace!
text: A further pause.
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: Do you hear me?
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: He was murdered, Father! Mozart!
text: Cruelly murdered.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: (almost whispering)
dialog: Yes? Did you do it?
text: Suddenly Old Salieri turns to him, a look of extreme
dialog: innocence.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: He was my idol! I can't remember a
dialog: time when I didn't know his name!
dialog: When I was only fourteen he was
dialog: already famous. Even in Legnago -
dialog: the tiniest town in Italy - I knew
dialog: of him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. A SMALL TOWN SQUARE IN LOMBARDY, ITALY - DAY - 1780'S
text: There are twelve children and twenty adults in the square.
text: We see the fourteen-year-old Salieri blindfolded, playing a
text: game of Blindman's Bluff with other Italian children, running
text: about in the bright sunshine and laughing.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
dialog: I was still playing childish games
dialog: when he was playing music for kings
dialog: and emperors. Even the Pope in Rome!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. A SALON IN THE VATICAN - DAY - 1780'S
text: We see the six-year-old MOZART, also blindfolded, seated in
text: a gilded chair on a pile of books, playing the harpsichord
text: for the POPE and a suite of CARDINALS and other churchmen.
text: Beside the little boy stands LEOPOLD, his father, smirking
dialog: with pride.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
dialog: I admit I was jealous when I heard
dialog: the tales they told about him. Not
dialog: of the brilliant little prodigy
dialog: himself, but of his father, who had
dialog: taught him everything.
text: The piece finishes. Leopold lowers the lid of the harpsichord
text: and lifts up his little son to stand on it. Mozart removes
text: the blindfold to show a pale little face with staring eyes.
text: Both father and son bow. A Papal Chamberlain presents Leopold
text: with a gold snuff box whilst the cardinals decorously applaud.
text: Over this scene Old Salieri speaks.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
dialog: My father did not care for music. He
dialog: wanted me only to be a merchant,
dialog: like himself. As anonymous as he
dialog: was. When I told how I wished I could
dialog: be like Mozart, he would say, Why?
dialog: Do you want to be a trained monkey?
dialog: Would you like me to drag you around
dialog: Europe doing tricks like a circus
dialog: freak? How could I tell him what
dialog: music meant to me?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. A COUNTRY CHURCH IN NORTH ITALY - DAY - 1780'S
text: Serene music of the Italian Baroque - Pergolesi's Stabat
text: Mater - sung by a choir of boys with organ accompaniment.
text: We see the outside of the 17th-century church sitting in the
text: wide landscape of Lombardy: sunlit fields, a dusty, white
text: road, poplar trees.
scene_heading: INT. THE CHURCH AT LEGNAGO - DAY - 1780'S
text: The music continues and swells. We see the twelve-year-old
text: Salieri seated between his plump and placid parents in the
text: congregation, listening in rapture. His father is a heavy-
text: looking, self-approving man, obviously indifferent to the
text: music. A large and austere Christ on the cross hangs over
text: the altar. Candles burn below his image.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
text: Even then a spray of sounded notes
dialog: could make me dizzy, almost to
dialog: falling.
text: The boy falls forward on his knees. So do his parents and
text: the other members of the congregation. He stares up at Christ
text: who stares back at him.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
dialog: Whilst my father prayed earnestly to
dialog: God to protect commerce, I would
dialog: offer up secretly the proudest prayer
dialog: a boy could think of. Lord, make me
dialog: a great composer! Let me celebrate
dialog: your glory through music - and be
dialog: celebrated myself! Make me famous
dialog: through the world, dear God! Make me
dialog: immortal! After I die let people
dialog: speak my name forever with love for
dialog: what I wrote! In return I vow I will
dialog: give you my chastity - my industry,
dialog: my deepest humility, every hour of
dialog: my life. And I will help my fellow
dialog: man all I can. Amen and amen!
text: The music swells to a crescendo. The candles flare. We see
text: the Christ through the flames looking at the boy benignly.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
dialog: And do you know what happened? A
dialog: miracle!
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM IN THE SALIERI HOUSE - DAY - 1780'S
text: CU, a large cooked fish on a thick china plate. Camera pulls
text: back to show the Salieri family at dinner. Father Salieri
text: sits at the head of the table, a napkin tucked into his chin.
text: Mother Salieri is serving the fish into portions and handing
text: them round. Two maiden aunts are in attendance, wearing black,
text: and of course the young boy. Father Salieri receives his
text: plate of fish and starts to eat greedily. Suddenly there is
text: a gasp - he starts to choke violently on a fish bone. All
text: the women get up and crowd around him, thumping and pummeling
text: him, but it is in vain. Father Salieri collapses.
scene_heading: INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON - 1823
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: Suddenly he was dead. Just like that!
dialog: And my life changed forever. My mother
dialog: said, Go. Study music if you really
dialog: want to. Off with you! And off I
dialog: went as quick as I could and never
dialog: saw Italy again. Of course, I knew
dialog: God had arranged it all; that was
dialog: obvious. One moment I was a frustrated
text: boy in an obscure little town. The
dialog: next I was here, in Vienna, city of
dialog: musicians, sixteen years old and
dialog: studying under Gluck! Gluck, Father.
dialog: Do you know who he was? The greatest
dialog: composer of his time. And he loved
dialog: me! That was the wonder. He taught
dialog: me everything he knew. And when I
dialog: was ready, introduced me personally
dialog: to the Emperor! Emperor Joseph - the
dialog: musical king! Within a few years I
dialog: was his court composer. Wasn't that
dialog: incredible? Imperial Composer to His
dialog: Majesty! Actually the man had no ear
dialog: at all, but what did it matter? He
dialog: adored my music, that was enough.
dialog: Night after night I sat right next
dialog: to the Emperor of Austria, playing
text: duets with him, correcting the royal
dialog: sight-reading. Tell me, if you had
dialog: been me, wouldn't you have thought
dialog: God had accepted your vow? And believe
dialog: me, I honoured it. I was a model of
dialog: virtue. I kept my hands off women,
dialog: worked hours every day teaching
dialog: students, many of them for free,
dialog: sitting on endless committees to
dialog: help poor musicians - work and work
dialog: and work, that was all my life. And
dialog: it was wonderful! Everybody liked
dialog: me. I liked myself. I was the most
dialog: successful musician in Vienna. And
dialog: the happiest. Till he came. Mozart.

scene_heading: INT. THE ARCHBISHOP OF SALZBURG'S RESIDENCE - VIENNA - DAY -
speaker_heading: 1780'S
text: A grand room crowded with guests. A small group of Gypsy

text: 18th-century wind instruments: elaborate-looking bassoons,
text: basset horns, etc. and wearing their employer's livery - are
text: laying out music on stands at one end of the room. At the
text: other end is a large gilded chair, bearing the arms of the
text: ARCHBISHOP OF SALZBURG. A throng of people is standing,
text: talking, and preparing to sit upon the rows of waiting chairs
dialog: to hear a concert.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
dialog: One day he came to Vienna to play
dialog: some of his music at the residence
dialog: of his employer, the Prince-Archbishop
dialog: of Salzburg. Eagerly I went there to
dialog: seek him out. That night changed my
dialog: life.
text: We see Salieri, age thirty-one, a neat, carefully turned-cut
text: man in decent black clothes and clean white linen, walking
text: through the crowd of guests. We follow him.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
dialog: As I went through the salon, I played
dialog: a game with myself. This man had
dialog: written his first concerto at the
dialog: age of four; his first symphony at
text: seven; a full-scale opera at twelve.
dialog: Did it show? Is talent like that
dialog: written on the face?
text: We see shots of assorted young men staring back at Salieri
text: as he moves through the crowd.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
dialog: Which one of them could he be?
text: Some of the men recognize Salieri and bow respectfully. Then
text: suddenly a servant bearing a large tray of cakes and pastries
text: stalks past. Instantly riveted by the sight of such delights,
text: Salieri follows him out of the Grand Salon.
scene_heading: INT. A PALACE CORRIDOR - DAY - 1780'S
text: The servant marches along bearing his tray of pastries aloft.
text: Salieri follows him.
text: The servant turns into:
scene_heading: INT. BUFFET ROOM IN THE PALACE - DAY - 1780'S
text: Salieri's POV: several tables, dressed to the floor with
text: cloths are loaded with many plates of confectionery. It is,
text: in fact, Salieri's idea of paradise! The servant puts his
text: tray down on one of the tables and withdraws from the room.
scene_heading: INT. A PALACE CORRIDOR - DAY - 1780'S
text: Salieri turns away so as not to be noticed by the servant.
text: As soon as the man disappears, Salieri sneaks into the buffet
dialog: room.
scene_heading: INT. BUFFET ROOM IN THE PALACE - DAY - 1780'S
text: Salieri enters the room and looks about him cautiously. He
text: is salivating with anticipation as he stares at the feast of
text: sweet things. His attention is attracted in particular by a
text: huge pile of dark chocolate balls arranged in the shape of a
text: pineapple. He reaches out a hand to steal one of the balls,
text: but at the same moment he hears giggling coming toward him.
text: He ducks down behind the pastry table.
text: A girl - CONSTANZE - rushes into the room. She runs straight
text: across it and hides herself behind one of the tables.
text: After a beat of total silence, MOZART runs into the room,
text: stops, and looks around. He is age twenty-six, wearing a
text: fine wig and a brilliant coat with the insignia of the
text: Archbishop of Salzburg upon it. He is puzzled; Constanze has
dialog: disappeared.
text: Baffled, he turns and is about to leave the room, when
text: Constanze suddenly squeaks from under the cloth like a tiny
text: mouse. Instantly Mozart drops to all fours and starts crawling
text: across the floor, meowing and hissing like a naughty cat.
text: Watched by an astonished Salieri, Mozart disappears under
text: the cloth and obviously pounces upon Constanze. We hear a
text: high-pitched giggle, which is going to characterize Mozart
text: throughout the film.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PALACE GRAND SALON - DAY - 1780'S

text: Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg enters. He is a small self-
text: important figure of fifty in a wig, surmounted by a scarlet
text: skullcap. He is followed by his Chamberlain, the Count ARCO.
text: Everyone stands. The Archbishop goes to his throne and sits.
text: His guests sit also. Arco gives the signal to start the music.
text: Nothing happens. Instead, a wind musician gets up, approaches

speaker_heading: MOZART

text: Shocked, she strikes at him. At the same moment the music
text: starts in the salon next door. We hear the opening of the
dialog: Serenade for Thirteen Wind Instruments, K.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: My music! They've started! They've
dialog: started without me!
text: He leaps up, disheveled and rumpled and runs out of the room.
text: Salieri watches in amazement and disgust.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PALACE CORRIDOR - DAY - 1780'S
text: The music is louder. Mozart hastens towards the Grand Salon
text: away from the buffet room, adjusting his dress as he goes.
scene_heading: INT. GRAND SALON - DAY - 1780'S
text: The opening of the Serenade is being tentatively conducted
text: by the leader of the wind-musicians. Guests turn around as
text: Mozart appears - bowing to the Archbishop - and walks with
text: an attempt at dignity to the dais where the wind band is
text: playing. The leader yields his place to the composer and
text: Mozart smoothly takes over conducting.
text: Constanze, deeply embarrassed, sneaks into the room and seats
text: herself at the back.
scene_heading: INT. PALACE BUFFET ROOM - DAY - 1780'S
text: The music fades down. Salieri stands shocked from his
text: inadvertent eavesdropping. After a second he moves almost in
text: a trance toward the door; the music dissolves.
scene_heading: INT. GRAND SALON - DAY - 1780'S
text: Mozart is conducting the Adagio from his Serenade (K. 361),
text: guiding the thirteen wind instrumentalists. The squeezebox
text: opening of the movement begins. Salieri appears at the door
text: at the back of the salon. He stares in disbelief at Mozart.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
dialog: So that was he! That giggling, dirty-
dialog: minded creature I'd just seen crawling
text: on the floor. Mozart. The phenomenon
dialog: whose legend had haunted my youth.
dialog: Impossible.
text: The music swells up and Salieri listens to it with eyes closed -
text: amazed, transported - suddenly engulfed by the sound. Finally
text: it fades down and away and changes into applause. Salieri
text: opens his eyes.
text: The audience is clearly delighted. Mozart bows to them, also
text: delighted. Colloredo rises abruptly, and without looking at
text: Mozart or applauding and leaves the Salon. Count Arco
text: approaches the composer. Mozart turns to him, radiant.
speaker_heading: ARCO
dialog: Follow me, please. The Archbishop
dialog: would like a word.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Certainly!
text: He follows Arco out of the room, through a throng of admirers.
scene_heading: INT. ANOTHER PALACE CORRIDOR - DAY - 1780'S
text: Mozart and Arco walk side by side. They pass Salieri who is
text: staring at Mozart in fascination. As they disappear, he steals
text: toward the music stands, unable to help himself.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Well, I think that went off remarkably
dialog: well, don't you?
speaker_heading: ARCO
dialog: Indeed.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: These Viennese certainly know good
text: music when they hear it.
speaker_heading: ARCO
dialog: His Grace is very angry with you.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: What do you mean?
text: They arrive at the door of Colloredo's private apartment.
speaker_heading: ARCO
dialog: You are to come in here and ask his
dialog: pardon.
text: Arco opens the door.
scene_heading: INT. ARCHBISHOP'S PRIVATE ROOM - DAY - 1780'S
text: The Archbishop is sitting, chatting to quests. Among them
text: are several ladies. Arco approaches him obsequiously.
speaker_heading: ARCO
dialog: Your Grace.
speaker_heading: COLLOREDO
dialog: Ah, Mozart. Why?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Why what, sir?
speaker_heading: COLLOREDO
dialog: Why do I have to be humiliated in
dialog: front of my guests by one of my own
dialog: servants?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Humiliated?
speaker_heading: COLLOREDO
dialog: How much provocation am I to endure
dialog: from you? The more license I allow
dialog: you, the more you take.
text: The company watches this scene, deeply interested.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: If His Grace is not satisfied with
dialog: me, he can dismiss me.
speaker_heading: COLLOREDO
dialog: I wish you to return immediately to
dialog: Salzburg. Your father is waiting for
dialog: you there patiently. I will speak to
dialog: you further when I come.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: No, Your Grace! I mean with all
dialog: humility, no. I would rather you
dialog: dismissed me. It's obvious I don't
dialog: satisfy.
speaker_heading: COLLOREDO
dialog: Then try harder, Mozart. I have no
dialog: intention of dismissing you. You
dialog: will remain in my service and learn
dialog: your place. Go now.
text: He extends his hand to be kissed. Mozart does it with a
text: furious grace, then leaves the room. As he opens the door we
dialog: see:
scene_heading: INT. PALACE CORRIDOR - DAY - 1780'S
text: A group of people who have attended the concert, among them
text: Constanze, are standing outside the private apartment. At
text: sight of the composer they break into sustained applause.
text: Mozart is suddenly delighted. He throws the door wide open
text: so that the guests can see into the private apartment where
text: the Archbishop sits - and he can see them. Colloredo is
text: clearly discomfited by this reception of his employee. He
text: smiles and bows uneasily, as they include him in the small
dialog: ovation.
text: Mozart stands in the corridor, out of the Archbishop's line
text: of sight, bowing and giggling, and encouraging the applause
text: for the Archbishop with conducting gestures. Suddenly
text: irritated, Colloredo signs to Arco, who steps forward and
text: shuts the door, ending the applause.
scene_heading: INT. PALACE GRAND SALON - DAY - 1780'S
text: Salieri, in this vast room, is standing and looking at the
text: full score of the Serenade. He turns the pages back to the
text: slow movement. Instantly, we again hear its lyrical strains.
text: CU, Salieri, reading the score of the Adagio in helpless
text: fascination. The music is played against his description of
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
dialog: Extraordinary! On the page it looked
dialog: nothing. The beginning simple, almost
text: comic. Just a pulse - bassoons and
text: basset horns - like a rusty
text: squeezebox. Then suddenly - high
text: above it - an oboe, a single note,
text: hanging there unwavering, till a
dialog: clarinet took over and sweetened it
dialog: into a phrase of such delight! This
dialog: was no composition by a performing
dialog: monkey! This was a music I'd never
dialog: heard. Filled with such longing,
dialog: such unfulfillable longing, it had
dialog: me trembling. It seemed to me that I
dialog: was hearing a voice of God.
text: Suddenly the music snaps off. Mozart stands before him as he
text: lays down the score.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Excuse me!
text: He takes the score, bows, and struts briskly out of the room.
text: Salieri stares uncomprehendingly after the jaunty little
dialog: figure.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
dialog: But why?
scene_heading: INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 1823
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: Why? Would God choose an obscene
dialog: child to be His instrument? It was
dialog: not to be believed! This piece had
dialog: to be an accident. It had to be!
scene_heading: INT. PALACE DINING ROOM - DAY - 1780'S
text: At the table sits the EMPEROR JOSEPH II, eating his frugal
text: dinner and sipping goat's milk. He is an intelligent, dapper
text: man of forty, wearing a military uniform. Around him but
text: standing, are his Chamberlain, JOHANN VON STRACK: stiff and
text: highly correct. COUNT ORSINI-ROSENBERG: a corpulent man of
text: sixty, highly conscious of his position as Director of the
text: Opera. BARON VON SWIETEN, the Imperial Librarian: a grave
text: but kindly and educated man in his mid-fifties. FIRST
text: KAPELLMEISTER GIUSEPPE BONNO: very Italian, cringing and
text: time-serving, aged about seventy. And Salieri, wearing
text: decorous black, as usual.
text: At a side-table, two Imperial secretaries, using quill pens
dialog: and inkstands, write down everything of importance that is
dialog: said.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: How good is he, this Mozart?
speaker_heading: VON SWIETEN
dialog: He's remarkable, Majesty. I heard an
dialog: extraordinary serious opera of his
dialog: last month. Idomeneo, King of Crete.
scene_heading: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
dialog: That? A most tiresome piece. I heard
dialog: it, too.
speaker_heading: VON SWIETEN
dialog: Tiresome?
scene_heading: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
text: A young man trying to impress beyond
dialog: his abilities. Too much spice. Too
dialog: many notes.
speaker_heading: VON SWIETEN
dialog: Majesty, I thought it the most
dialog: promising work I've heard in years.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Ah-ha. Well then, we should make
dialog: some effort to acquire him. We could
dialog: use a good German composer in Vienna,
dialog: surely?
speaker_heading: VON STRACK
dialog: I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid
text: it's not possible. The young man is
text: still in the pay of the Archbishop.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure
dialog: he could be tempted with the right
dialog: offer. Say, an opera in German for
dialog: our National Theatre.
speaker_heading: VON SWIETEN
dialog: Excellent, sire!
scene_heading: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
dialog: But not German, I beg your Majesty!
dialog: Italian is the proper language for
dialog: opera. All educated people agree on
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
speaker_heading: VON STRACK
dialog: In my opinion, it is time we had a
dialog: piece in our own language, sir. Plain
dialog: German. For plain people.
text: He looks defiantly at Orsini-Rosenberg.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Ah-ha. Kapellmeister?
speaker_heading: BONNO
dialog: (Italian accent)
dialog: Majesty, I must agree with Herr
dialog: Dirretore. Opera is an Italian art,
dialog: solamente. German is - scusate - too
dialog: bruta for singing, too rough.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Ah-ha. Court Composer, what do you
dialog: say?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: I think it is an interesting notion
dialog: to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty.
dialog: It should really infuriate the
dialog: Archbishop beyond measure - if that
dialog: is your Majesty's intention.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: You are cattivo, Court Composer.
dialog: (briskly, to Von Strack)
dialog: I want to meet this young man.
dialog: Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant
dialog: welcome for him.
speaker_heading: VON STRACK
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Well. There it is.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM IN SALIERI'S APARTMENT - DAY - 1780'S
text: A somber room which serves both as a bedroom and a study.
text: We see a four-poster bed. Also, a marble mantelpiece above
text: which hangs a handsome cross in olivewood, bearing the figure
text: of a severe Christ. Opposite this image sits Salieri at his
text: desk, on which stands a pile of music paper, quill pens and
text: ink. On one side of him is an open forte-piano on which he
text: occasionally tries notes from the march he is composing,
text: with some difficulty. He scratches notes out with his quill,
text: and ruffles his hair - which we see without a powdered wig.
text: There is a knock at the door.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Si.
text: A servant admits LORL, a young lower-class girl, who appears
text: carrying a basket in which is a box covered with a napkin.
text: She has just come from the baker's shop.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl,
dialog: good morning.
speaker_heading: LORL
dialog: Good morning, sir.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: What have you got for me today? Let
dialog: me see.
text: Greedily he unwraps the napkin and lifts the lid on the box.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my
dialog: favourites. Give my best thanks to
dialog: the baker.
speaker_heading: LORL
dialog: I will, sir.
text: He takes a biscuit and eats.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Thank you. Are you well today,
dialog: Fraulein Lorl?
speaker_heading: LORL
dialog: Yes, thank you, sir.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Bene! Bene!
text: She gives a little curtsey, flattered and giggling and is
text: shown out. Salieri turns back to his work, chewing. He plays
text: through a complete line of the march. He smiles, pleased
dialog: with the result.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Grazie, Signore.
text: He inclines his head to the Christ above the fireplace, and
text: starts to play the whole march, including the phrase which
dialog: pleased him.
scene_heading: INT. A WIGMAKER'S SHOP - VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S
text: The march continues on the forte-piano as we see Mozart,
text: seated in front of a mirror, wearing an extravagant wig. On
text: either side of him stands a SALESMAN, one of them holding
text: another wig, equally extravagant. Mozart takes off the first
text: wig, to reveal his own blonde hair, of which he is extremely
text: proud, and hands it back.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: And the other one?
text: The Salesman puts the second wig on his head. Mozart pulls a
text: face of doubt in the mirror.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: And the other one?
text: He takes it off and the other Salesman replaces it with the
text: first wig on his head.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Oh, they're both so beautiful, I
dialog: can't decide. Why don't I have two
dialog: heads?
text: He giggles. The music stops.
scene_heading: INT. GRAND SALON - THE ROYAL PALACE - DAY - 1780'S
text: A door opens. We glimpse in the next room the Emperor Joseph
text: bidding goodbye to a group of military officers standing
text: around a table.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Good, good, good.
text: He turns and comes into the salon, where another group awaits
text: him. It consists of Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno, Von
text: Swieten and Salieri. The room contains several gilded chairs
text: dotted about, and a forte-piano.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Good morning, gentlemen.
dialog: All bow and say, Good morning, Your Majesty!
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: (to Von Strack)
dialog: Well, what do you have for me today?
speaker_heading: VON STRACK
dialog: Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Yes, what about him?
speaker_heading: VON STRACK
dialog: He's here.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Majesty, I hope you won't think it
dialog: improper, but I have written a little
dialog: March of Welcome in his honour.
text: He produces a paper.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: What a charming idea. May I see?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: (handing it over)
dialog: It's just a trifle, of course.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: May I try it?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Majesty.
text: The Emperor goes to the instrument, sits and plays the first
dialog: bars of it. Quite well.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Delightful, Court Composer. Would
dialog: you permit me to play it as he comes
dialog: in?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: You do me too much honour, Sire.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Let's have some fun.
dialog: (to the waiting
dialog: Majordomo)
dialog: Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But
dialog: slowly, slowly. I need a minute to
dialog: practice.
text: The Majordomo bows and goes. The Emperor addresses himself
text: to the march. He plays a wrong note.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: A-flat, Majesty.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Ah-ha!
scene_heading: INT. PALACE CORRIDOR - VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S
text: Taking his instructions literally, the Majordomo is marching
text: very slowly toward the salon door. He is followed by a
text: bewildered Mozart, dressed very stylishly and wearing one of
text: the wigs from the perruqier.
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL PALACE GRAND SALON - DAY - 1780'S
text: Joseph finishes the march. The door opens.
speaker_heading: MAJORDOMO
dialog: Herr Mozart.
text: Mozart comes in eagerly. Immediately the march begins, played
text: by His Majesty. All the courtiers stand, listening with
text: admiration. Joseph plays well, but applies himself fiercely
text: to the manuscript. Mozart, still bewildered, regards the
text: scene, but does not seem to pay attention to the music itself.
text: It finishes and all clap obsequiously.
scene_heading: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
dialog: Bravo, Your Majesty!
speaker_heading: VON STRACK
dialog: Well done, Sire!
text: The Emperor rises, pleased with himself. He snatches the
text: manuscript off the stand and holds it in his hand for the
text: rest of the scene.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Gentlemen, gentlemen, a little less
dialog: enthusiasm, I beg you. Ah, Mozart.
text: He extends his hand. Mozart throws himself to his knees, and
text: to Joseph's discomfort kisses the royal hand with fervour.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Your Majesty!
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: No, no, please! It is not a holy
dialog: relic.
dialog: (raising Mozart up)
dialog: You know we have met already? In
dialog: this very room. Perhaps you won't
dialog: remember it, you were only six years
dialog: old.
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: He was giving the most brilliant
dialog: little concert here. As he got off
dialog: the stool, he slipped and fell. My
dialog: sister Antoinette helped him up
dialog: herself, and do you know what he
text: did? Jumped straight into her arms
dialog: and said, Will you marry me, yes or
dialog: no?
text: Embarrassed, Mozart bursts into a wild giggle. Joseph helps
dialog: him out.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: You know all these gentlemen, I'm
dialog: sure.
text: Von Strack and Bonno nod.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: The Baron Von Swieten.
speaker_heading: VON SWIETEN
dialog: I'm a great admirer of yours, young
dialog: man. Welcome.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Oh, thank you.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: The Director of our Opera. Count
dialog: Orsini-Rosenberg.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: (bowing excitedly)
dialog: Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine.
dialog: Absolutely.
text: Orsini-Rosenberg nods without enthusiasm.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: And here is our illustrious Court
dialog: Composer, Herr Salieri.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: (taking his hand)
dialog: Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto
dialog: straordinario!
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: I know your work well, Signore. Do
dialog: you know I actually composed some
dialog: variations on a melody of yours?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Mio caro Adone.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Ah!
speaker_heading: MOZART
text: A funny little tune, but it yielded
dialog: some good things.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: And now he has returned the
dialog: compliment. Herr Salieri composed
dialog: that March of Welcome for you.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: (speaking expertly)
dialog: Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono
dialog: commosso! E un onore per mo
dialog: eccezionale. Compositore brilliante
dialog: e famossissimo!
text: He bows elaborately. Salieri inclines himself, dryly.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: My pleasure.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Well, there it is. Now to business.
dialog: Young man, we are going to commission
dialog: an opera from you. What do you say?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Majesty!
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: (to the courtiers)
dialog: Did we vote in the end for German or
dialog: Italian?
scene_heading: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
dialog: Well, actually, Sire, if you remember,
dialog: we did finally incline to Italian.
speaker_heading: VON STRACK
dialog: Did we?
speaker_heading: VON SWIETEN
dialog: I don't think it was really decided,
dialog: Director.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Oh, German! German! Please let it be
dialog: German.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Why so?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Because I've already found the most
dialog: wonderful libretto!
scene_heading: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
dialog: Oh? Have I seen it?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: I - I don't think you have, Herr
dialog: Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite
dialog: n - Of course, I'll show it to you
dialog: immediately.
scene_heading: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
dialog: I think you'd better.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Well, what is it about? Tell us the
dialog: story.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: It's actually quite amusing, Majesty.
dialog: It's set - the whole thing is set
dialog: in a - in a -
text: He stops short with a little giggle.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Yes, where?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A
dialog: Seraglio.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Ah-ha.
scene_heading: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
dialog: You mean in Turkey?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Exactly.
scene_heading: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
dialog: Then why especially does it have to
dialog: be in German?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Well not especially. It can be in
dialog: Turkish, if you really want. I don't
dialog: care.
text: He giggles again. Orsini-Rosenberg looks at him sourly.
speaker_heading: VON SWIETEN
dialog: (kindly)
dialog: My dear fellow, the language is not
dialog: finally the point. Do you really
dialog: think that subject is quite
dialog: appropriate for a national theatre?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Why not? It's charming. I mean, I
dialog: don't actually show concubines
dialog: exposing their! their! It's not
dialog: indecent!
dialog: (to Joseph)
dialog: It's highly moral, Majesty. It's
dialog: full of proper German virtues. I
dialog: swear it. Absolutely!
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Well, I'm glad to hear that.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Excuse me, Sire, but what do you
dialog: think these could be? Being a
dialog: foreigner, I would love to learn.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well,
dialog: tell him, Mozart. Name us a German
dialog: virtue.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Love, Sire!
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we
dialog: know nothing about that.
dialog: The Italian faction - Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno - laugh
text: discreetly.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: No, I don't think you do. I mean
dialog: watching Italian opera, all those
text: male sopranos screeching. Stupid fat
dialog: couples rolling their eyes about!
dialog: That's not love - it's just rubbish.
text: An embarrassed pause. Bonno giggles in nervous amusement.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Majesty, you choose the language. It
dialog: will be my task to set it to the
dialog: finest music ever offered a monarch.
text: Pause. Joseph is clearly pleased.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Well, there it is. Let it be German.
text: He nods - he has wanted this result all the time. He turns
text: and makes for the door. All bow. Then he becomes aware of
text: the manuscript in his hand.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Ah, this is yours.
dialog: Mozart does not take it.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is
dialog: already here in my head.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: What? On one hearing only?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: I think so, Sire, yes.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Show me.
text: Mozart bows and hands the manuscript back to the Emperor.
text: Then he goes to the forte-piano and seats himself. The others,
text: except for Salieri, gather around the manuscript held by the
text: King. Mozart plays the first half of the march with deadly
dialog: accuracy.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: (to Salieri)
dialog: The rest is just the same, isn't it?
text: He plays the first half again but stops in the middle of a
text: phrase, which he repeats dubiously.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: That really doesn't work, does it?
text: All the courtiers look at Salieri.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Did you try this? Wouldn't it be
dialog: just a little more -?
text: He plays another phrase.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Or this - yes, this! Better.
text: He plays another phrase. Gradually, he alters the music so
text: that it turns into the celebrated march to be used later in
text: The Marriage of Figaro, Non Piu Andrai. He plays it with
text: increasing abandon and virtuosity. Salieri watches with a
text: fixed smile on his face. The court watches, astonished. He
text: finishes in great glory, takes his hands off the keys with a
text: gesture of triumph - and grins.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM IN SALIERI'S APARTMENT - DAY - 1780'S
text: We see the olivewood cross. Salieri is sitting at his desk,
text: staring at it.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Grazie, Signore.
text: There is a knock at the door. He does not hear it, but sits
text: on. Another knock, louder.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Yes?
text: Lorl comes in.

speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Bene.
text: He gets up and enters:
scene_heading: INT. MUSIC ROOM IN SALIERI'S APARTMENT - DAY - 1780'S
text: KATHERINA CAVALIERI, a young, high-spirited soprano of twenty
text: is waiting for him, dressed in a fashionable dress and wearing
text: on her head an exotic turban of satin, with a feather. Lorl
dialog: exits.
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: (curtseying to him)
dialog: Maestro.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Good morning.
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: (posing, in her turban)
dialog: Well? How do you like it? It's
dialog: Turkish. My hairdresser tells me
dialog: everything's going to be Turkish
dialog: this year!
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Really? What else did he tell you
dialog: today? Give me some gossip.
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: And he's been commissioned to write
dialog: an opera. Is it true?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: Is there a part for me?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Well even if there is, I don't think
dialog: you want to get involved with this
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Well, do you know where it's set, my
dialog: dear?
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
text: In a harem.
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
text: A brothel.
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: Oh!
speaker_heading: SALIERI
text: A Turkish brothel.
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's
dialog: different. I want to be in it.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: My dear, it will hardly enhance your
dialog: reputation to be celebrated throughout
text: Vienna as a singing prostitute for a
dialog: Turk.
text: He seats himself at the forte-piano.
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce
dialog: us anyway.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Perhaps.
text: He plays a chord. She sings a scale, expertly. He strikes
text: another chord. She starts another scale, then breaks off.
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: What does he look like?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: You might be disappointed.
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Looks and talent don't always go
dialog: together, Katherina.
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: (airily)
dialog: Looks don't concern me, Maestro.
dialog: Only talent interests a woman of
dialog: taste.
text: He strikes the chord again, firmly. Cavalieri sings her next
text: scale, then another one, and another one, doing her exercises
text: in earnest. As she hits a sustained high note the orchestral
text: accompaniment in the middle of Martern Aller Arten from Il
text: Seraglio comes in underneath and the music changes from
text: exercises to the exceedingly florid aria.
text: We DISSOLVE on the singer's face, and she is suddenly not
text: merely turbaned, but painted and dressed totally in a Turkish
dialog: manner, and we are on:
scene_heading: INT. OPERA STAGE - VIENNA - 1780'S
text: The heroine of the opera (Cavalieri) is in full cry addressing
text: the Pasha with scorn and defiance.
text: The house is full. Watching the performance - which is
text: conducted by Mozart from the clavier in the midst of the
dialog: orchestra - we note Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno and
text: Von Swieten, all grouped around the Emperor, in a box.
text: In another box we see an overdressed, middle-aged woman and
text: three girls, one of whom is Constanze. This is the formidable
text: MADAME WEBER and her three daughters, Constanze, JOSEFA and
text: SOPHIE. All are enraptured by the spectacle and Madame Weber
text: is especially enraptured by being there at all. Not so,
text: Salieri, who sits in another box, coldly watching the stage.
text: Cavalieri is singing Martern aller Arten from the line Doch
dialog: du bist entschlossen.
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: Since you are determined, Since you
dialog: are determined, Calmly, with no
dialog: ferment, Welcome - every pain and
dialog: woe. Bind me then - compel me! Bind
dialog: me then - compel me! Hurt me. Break
dialog: me! Kill me! At last I shall be freed
dialog: by death!
text: After a few moments of this showy aria, with the composer
text: and the singer staring at each other - he conducting
text: elaborately for her benefit, and she following his beat with
text: rapturous eyes - the music fades, and Salieri speaks over
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
dialog: There she was. I had no idea where
dialog: they met - or how - yet there she
text: stood on stage for all to see. Showing
text: off like the greedy songbird she
text: was. Ten minutes of ghastly scales
text: and arpeggios, whizzing up and down
text: like fireworks at a fairground.
text: Music up again for the last 30 bars of the aria.
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Be freed at last by death! Be freed
dialog: at last by death! At last I shall be
dialog: freed By! Death!
text: Before the orchestral coda ends, cut to:
scene_heading: INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 1823
text: Through the window we see that night has fallen.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: Understand, I was in love with the
dialog: girl. Or at least in lust. I wasn't
dialog: a saint. It took me the most
dialog: tremendous effort to be faithful to
dialog: my vow. I swear to you I never laid
dialog: a finger on her. All the same, I
dialog: couldn't bear to think of anyone
dialog: else touching her - least of all the
dialog: Creature.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE OPERA HOUSE - VIENNA - NIGHT - 1780'S
text: The brilliant Turkish finale of Seraglio bursts over us.
text: All the cast is lined up on stage. Mozart is conducting with
text: happy excitement.
speaker_heading: CAST OF SERAGLIO
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Pasha Selim May he Live forever!
dialog: Ever, ever, ever, ever! Honour to
dialog: his regal name! Honour to his regal
dialog: name! May his noble brow emblazon
dialog: Glory, fortune, joy and fame! Honour
dialog: be to Pasha Selim Honour to his regal
dialog: name! Honour to his regal name!
text: The curtains fall. Much applause. The Emperor claps vigorously
text: and - following his lead - so do the courtiers. The curtains
text: part. Mozart applauds the singers who applaud him back. He
text: skips up onto the stage amongst them. The curtains fall again
text: as they all bow. In the auditorium, the chandeliers descend,
text: filling it with light.
scene_heading: INT. OPERA HOUSE STAGE - VIENNA - NIGHT - 1780'S
text: The curtains are down, and an excited hubbub of singers in
text: costume surround Mozart and Cavalieri, all excited and
text: chattering. Suddenly a hush. The Emperor is seen approaching
text: from the wings, lit by flunkies holding candles. Von Strack,
text: Orsini-Rosenberg and Von Swieten, amongst others, follow
text: him. Also Salieri. The singers line up. Joseph stops at
text: Cavalieri who makes a deep curtsey.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Bravo, Madame. You are an ornament
dialog: to our stage.
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: Majesty.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: (to Salieri)
dialog: And to you, Court Composer. Your
dialog: pupil has done you great credit.
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR - VIENNA - NIGHT - 1780'S
speaker_heading: MADAME WEBER
dialog: Let us pass, please! Let us pass at
dialog: once! We're with the Emperor.
speaker_heading: FLUNKY
dialog: I am sorry, Madame. It is not
dialog: permitted.
speaker_heading: MADAME WEBER
dialog: Do you know who I am?
dialog: (pointing to Constanze)
dialog: This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber.
dialog: We are favoured guests!
speaker_heading: FLUNKY
dialog: I am sorry, Madame, but I have my
dialog: orders.
speaker_heading: MADAME WEBER
dialog: Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart
dialog: immediately! This is insupportable!
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Mother, please!
speaker_heading: MADAME WEBER
dialog: Go ahead, Constanze. Just ignore
dialog: this fellow.
dialog: (pushing her)
dialog: Go ahead, dear!
speaker_heading: FLUNKY
dialog: (barring the way)
dialog: I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot
dialog: let anyone pass.
speaker_heading: MADAME WEBER
dialog: Young man, I am no stranger to
dialog: theatres. I'm no stranger to
dialog: insolence!
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. OPERA HOUSE STAGE - VIENNA - NIGHT - 1780'S
text: All are applauding Cavalieri. The Emperor turns to Mozart.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Well, Herr Mozart! A good effort.
dialog: Decidedly that. An excellent effort!
dialog: You've shown us something quite new
dialog: today.
text: Mozart bows frantically: he is over-excited.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Yes, indeed.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: And German?
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Oh, yes. Absolutely. German.
dialog: Unquestionably!
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: So then you like it? You really like
dialog: it, Your Majesty?
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Of course I do. It's very good. Of
dialog: course now and then - just now and
dialog: then - it gets a touch elaborate.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: What do you mean, Sire?
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Well, I mean occasionally it seems
dialog: to have, how shall one say?
dialog: (he stops in
dialog: difficulty; to Orsini-
dialog: Rosenberg)
dialog: How shall one say, Director?
scene_heading: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
dialog: Too many notes, Your Majesty?
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Exactly. Very well put. Too many
dialog: notes.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: I don't understand. There are just
dialog: as many notes, Majesty, as are
dialog: required. Neither more nor less.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: My dear fellow, there are in fact
dialog: only so many notes the ear can hear
dialog: in the course of an evening. I think
dialog: I'm right in saying that, aren't I,
dialog: Court Composer?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Yes! yes! er, on the whole, yes,
dialog: Majesty.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: (to Salieri)
dialog: But this is absurd!
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: My dear, young man, don't take it
dialog: too hard. Your work is ingenious.
dialog: It's quality work. And there are
dialog: simply too many notes, that's all.
dialog: Cut a few and it will be perfect.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Which few did you have in mind,
dialog: Majesty?
text: Pause. General embarrassment.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Well. There it is.
text: Into this uncomfortable scene bursts a sudden eruption of
text: noise and Madame Weber floods onto the stage, followed by
text: her daughters. All turn to look at this amazing spectacle.
speaker_heading: MADAME WEBER
dialog: Wolfi! Wolfi, my dear!
text: She moves toward Mozart with arms outstretched in an absurd
text: theatrical gesture, then sees the Emperor. She stares at
text: him, mesmerized, her mouth open, unable even to curtsey.
speaker_heading: MADAME WEBER
dialog: Oh!
text: Mozart moves forward quickly.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She
dialog: is my landlady.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Enchanted, Madame.
speaker_heading: MADAME WEBER
dialog: Oh, Sire! such an honour! And, and,
dialog: and these are my dear daughters.
text: This is Constanze. She is the fiancee
dialog: of Herr Mozart.
text: Constanze curtsies. CU, of Cavalieri, astonished at the news.
text: CU, of Salieri, watching her receive it.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Really? How delightful. May I ask
dialog: when you marry?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Well - Well we haven't quite received
dialog: my father's consent, Your Majesty.
dialog: Not entirely. Not altogether.
text: He giggles uncomfortably.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Excuse me, but how old are you?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Twenty-six.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Well, my advice is to marry this
dialog: charming young lady and stay with us
dialog: in Vienna.
speaker_heading: MADAME WEBER
dialog: You see? You see? I've told him that,
dialog: Your Majesty, but he won't listen to
dialog: me.
text: Cavalieri is glaring at Mozart. Mozart looks hastily away
dialog: from her.
speaker_heading: MADAME WEBER
dialog: Oh, Your Majesty, you give such
dialog: wonderful - such impeccable - such
dialog: royal advice. I - I - May I?
text: She attempts to kiss the royal hand, but faints instead.
text: The Emperor contemplates her prone body and steps back a
dialog: pace.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Well. There it is. Strack.
text: He nods pleasantly to all and leaves the stage, with his
dialog: Chamberlain. All bow.
text: Cavalieri turns with a savage look at Mozart and leaves the
text: stage the opposite way, to her dressing room, tossing her
text: plumed head. Salieri watches. Mozart stays for a second,
text: indecisive whether to follow the soprano or help Madame Weber.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: (to Mozart)
dialog: Get some water!
text: He hurries away. The daughters gather around Madame Weber.
scene_heading: INT. CAVALIERI'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT - 1780'S
text: Katherina sits fuming at her mirror. A dresser is taking the
text: pins out of her wig as she stares straight ahead of her.
text: Mozart sticks his head round the door.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm
dialog: going to do. I'm going to write
dialog: another aria for you. Something even
dialog: more amazing for the second act. I
dialog: have to get some water. Her mother
text: is lying on the stage.
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: Don't bother!
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: Don't bother.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: I'll be right back.
text: He dashes off.
scene_heading: INT. OPERA HOUSE STAGE - VIENNA - NIGHT - 1780'S
text: Constanze and Mozart make their way quickly through a crowd
text: of actors in turbans and caftans, and stagehands carrying
text: bits of the dismantled set of Seraglio. We see all the turmoil
text: of backstage after a performance.
text: A fireman passes Mozart carrying a small bucket of water.
text: Mozart snatches it from him and pushes his way through the
text: crowd to Madame Weber, who still lies prone on the stage.
text: Mozart pushes through the crowd surrounding her and throws
text: water on her face. She is instantly revived by the shock.
text: Constanze assists her to rise.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Are you all right?
text: Instead of being furious, Madame Weber smiles at them
text: rapturously.
speaker_heading: MADAME WEBER
dialog: Ah, what an evening! What a wise man
dialog: we have for an Emperor. Oh, my
dialog: children!
dialog: (with sudden, hard
dialog: briskness)
dialog: Now I want you to write your father
dialog: exactly what His Majesty said.
text: The activity continues to swirl around them.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: You should really go home now, Frau
dialog: Weber. Your carriage must be waiting.
speaker_heading: MADAME WEBER
dialog: But aren't you taking us?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: I have to talk to the singers.
speaker_heading: MADAME WEBER
dialog: That's all right; we'll wait for
dialog: you. Just don't take all night.
scene_heading: INT. CAVALIERI'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT - 1780'S
text: Cavalieri, still in costume, is marching up and down, very
dialog: agitated.
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: Did you know? Had you heard?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: The marriage!
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Well, what does it matter to you?
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: Nothing! He can marry who he pleases.
dialog: I don't give a damn.
text: She catches him looking at her and tries to compose herself.
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: How was I? Tell me honestly.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: You were sublime.
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: What did you think of the music?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Extremely clever.
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: Meaning you didn't like it.
text: Mozart comes in unexpectedly.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Oh - excuse me!
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
text: Is her mother still lying on the
dialog: floor?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: No, she's fine.
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: I'm so relieved.
text: She seats herself at her mirror and removes her wig.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Dear Mozart, my sincere
dialog: congratulations.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Did you like it, then?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: How could I not?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: It really is the best music one can
dialog: hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: Is she a good fuck?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: What??
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: I assume she's the virtuoso in that
dialog: department. There can't be any other
dialog: reason you'd marry someone like that.
text: Salieri looks astonished. There is a knock on the door.
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: Come in!
text: The door opens. Constanze enters.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling
dialog: very well. Can we leave now?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: No, no, no, no. You can't take him
dialog: away now. This is his night. Won't
dialog: you introduce us, Wolfgang?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night,
dialog: Signore.
text: Mozart hurries Constanze out of the door. Cavalieri looks
text: after them as they go, her voice breaking and rising out of
dialog: control.
speaker_heading: CAVALIERI
dialog: You really are full of surprises,
dialog: aren't you? You are quite
dialog: extraordinary, you little shit!
text: She turns and collapses, crying with rage, into Salieri's
text: arms. We focus on him.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
dialog: At that moment I knew beyond any
text: doubt. He'd had her. The Creature
dialog: had had my darling girl.
scene_heading: INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 1820'S
text: The old man speaks passionately to the priest.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: It was incomprehensible. What was
dialog: God up to? Here I was denying all my
dialog: natural lust in order to deserve
dialog: God's gift and there was Mozart
dialog: indulging his in all directions -
dialog: even though engaged to be married! -
dialog: and no rebuke at all! Was it possible
dialog: I was being tested? Was God expecting
dialog: me to offer forgiveness in the face
dialog: of every offense, no matter how
dialog: painful? That was very possible. All
dialog: the same, why him? Why use Mozart to
dialog: teach me lessons in humility? My
dialog: heart was filling up with such hatred
dialog: for that little man. For the first
dialog: time in my life I began to know really
dialog: violent thoughts. I couldn't stop
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: Did you try?
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: Every day. Sometimes for hours I
dialog: would pray!
scene_heading: INT. SALIERI'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY - 1780'S
text: The young Salieri is kneeling in desperation before the Cross.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Please! Please! Send him away, back
dialog: to Salzburg. For his sake as well as
dialog: mine.
text: CU, Christ staring from the Cross.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. AUDIENCE HALL - ARCHBISHOP'S PALACE - SALZBURG - DAY -
speaker_heading: 1780'S
text: We see Leopold kneeling now not to the Cross but to Archbishop
text: Colloredo, sitting impassively on his throne. Count Arco
text: stands beside him. Leopold is a desperate, once-handsome man
text: of sixty, now far too much the subservient courtier.
speaker_heading: COLLOREDO
dialog: No! I won't have him back.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: But he needs to be here in Salzburg,
dialog: Your Grace. He needs me and he needs
dialog: you. Your protection, your
dialog: understanding.
speaker_heading: COLLOREDO
dialog: Hardly.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the
dialog: worst mistake of his life. Some little
text: Viennese slut is trying to trick him
dialog: into marriage. I know my son. He is
dialog: too simple to see the trap - and
dialog: there is no one there who really
dialog: cares for him.
speaker_heading: COLLOREDO
dialog: I'm not surprised. Money seems to be
dialog: more important to him than loyalty
dialog: or friendship. He has sold himself
dialog: to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Sir -
speaker_heading: COLLOREDO
dialog: Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled,
dialog: conceited brat.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't
dialog: blame him. The fault is mine. I was
text: too indulgent with him. But not again.
dialog: Never again, I promise! I implore
dialog: you - let me bring him back here.
dialog: I'll make him give his word to serve
dialog: you faithfully.
speaker_heading: COLLOREDO
dialog: And how will you make him keep it?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in
dialog: anything. Please, Your Grace, give
dialog: him one more chance.
speaker_heading: COLLOREDO
dialog: You have leave to try.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace!
dialog: I thank you!
text: In deepest gratitude he kisses the Archbishop's hand. He
text: motions Leopold to rise. We hear the first dark fortissimo
text: chord which begins the Overture to Don Giovanni: the theme
text: associated with the character of the Commendatore.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD (V.O.)
dialog: My dear son.
text: The second fortissimo chord sounds.
scene_heading: INT. A BAROQUE CHURCH - DAY - 1780'S
text: We see a huge CU, of Mozart's head, looking front and down,
text: as if reading his father's letter. We hear Leopold's voice
text: over this image, no longer whining and anxious, but
dialog: impressive.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD (V.O.)
dialog: I write to you with urgent news. I
dialog: am coming to Vienna. Take no further
text: steps toward marriage until we meet.
dialog: You are too gullible to see your own
dialog: danger. As you honour the father who
dialog: has devoted his entire life to yours,
dialog: do as I bid, and await my coming.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: I will.
text: The camera pulls back to see that he is in fact kneeling
text: beside Constanze. A PRIEST faces them. Behind them are Madame
text: Weber, Josefa and Sophie Weber, and a very few others. Among
text: them, a merry looking lady in bright clothes: the BARONESS
scene_heading: WALDSTADTEN.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: And will you, Constanze Weber, take
dialog: this man, Wolfgang to be your lawful
dialog: husband?
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: I will.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: I now pronounce you man and wife.
text: The opening kyrie of the great Mass in C Minor is heard.
text: Mozart and Constanze kiss. They are in tears. Madame Weber
text: and her daughters look on approvingly. The music swells and
dialog: continues under the following:
scene_heading: INT. A ROOM IN LEOPOLD'S HOUSE - SALZBURG - NIGHT - 1780'S
text: There is a view of a castle in background. Leopold sits alone
text: in his room. He is reading a letter from Wolfgang. At his
text: feet are his trunks, half-packed for the journey he will not
text: now take. We hear Mozart's voice reading the following letter
text: and we see, as the camera roves around the room, mementos of
text: the young prodigy's early life: the little forte-piano made
dialog: for him; the little violin made for him; an Order presented
text: to him. We see a little starling in a wicker cage. And we
text: see portraits of the boy on the walls, concluding with the
text: familiar family portrait of Wolfgang and his sister Nannerl
text: seated at the keyboard with Leopold standing, and the picture
text: of their mother on the wall behind them.
speaker_heading: MOZART (V.O.)
dialog: Most beloved father, it is done. Do
dialog: not blame me that I did not wait to
dialog: see your dear face. I knew you would
dialog: have tried to dissuade me from my
dialog: truest happiness and I could not
dialog: have borne it. Your every word is
dialog: precious to me. Remember how you
dialog: have always told me Vienna is the
dialog: City of Musicians. To conquer here
dialog: is to conquer Europe! With my wife I
dialog: can do it. I vow I will become
dialog: regular in my habits and productive
dialog: as never before. She is wonderful,
dialog: Papa, and I know that you will love
dialog: her. And one day soon when I am a
dialog: wealthy man, you will come and live
dialog: with us, and we will be so happy. I
dialog: long for that day, best of Papas,
dialog: and kiss your hand a hundred thousand
dialog: times.
text: The music of the Mass fades as Leopold crumples the letter
text: in his hand.
scene_heading: EXT. THE IMPERIAL GARDENS - VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S
text: Salieri stands waiting, hat in hand. Beside him stands a
text: royal servant. Behind him, gardeners are glimpsed tending
text: the shrubs and bushes along a grassy ride. Down this ride
text: are seen cantering two people on horseback: the Emperor Joseph
text: and his niece, the PRINCESS ELIZABETH. They are mounted on
text: glossy horses. The Princess rides side-saddle. Running beside
text: her is a panting groom. The Emperor rides elegantly; his
text: niece, a dumpy little Hapsburg girl of sixteen, like a sack
text: of potatoes. As they draw level with Salieri they stop, and
text: the groom holds the head of the Princess' horse. Salieri
text: bows respectfully.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Good morning, Court Composer. This
dialog: is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Your Highness.
text: Out of breath, the Princess nods nervously.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: She has asked me to advise her on a
dialog: suitable musical instructor. I think
dialog: I've come up with an excellent idea.
text: He smiles at Salieri.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a
dialog: tremendous honour!
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: I'm thinking about Herr Mozart.
dialog: What is your view?
text: Salieri's face falls, almost imperceptibly.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: SALIERI

text: around and around his salon, reading the pages and dropping
text: them on the floor when he is done with them. We see his

dialog: pressures on me - financial pressures.
dialog: As you know, I'm a married man now.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: So you are. How is your pretty wife?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: She is well. She is - well, actually,
dialog: I'm about to become a father! She
dialog: only told me last night. You are the
dialog: first to know.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: I'm flattered. And congratulations
dialog: to you, of course.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: So you see, this post is very
dialog: important to me right now.
text: Salieri looks at him in distress.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Why didn't you come to me yesterday,
dialog: Mozart? This is a most painful
dialog: situation. Yesterday I could have
dialog: helped you. Today, I can't.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Why? Here is the music. It's here.
dialog: I am submitting it humbly. Isn't
dialog: that what you wanted?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: I have just come from the palace.
text: The post has been filled.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Filled? That's impossible! They
dialog: haven't even seen my work. I need
dialog: this post. Please, can't you help
dialog: me? Please!
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: My dear Mozart, there is no one in
dialog: the world I would rather help, but
text: now it is too late.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Whom did they choose?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Herr Sommer.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a
dialog: fool! He's a total mediocrity.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: No, no, no: he has yet to achieve
dialog: mediocrity.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: But I can't lose this post, I simply
dialog: can't! Excellency, please. Let's go
dialog: to the palace, and you can explain
dialog: to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is
dialog: an awful choice. He could actually
dialog: do musical harm to the Princess!
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: An implausible idea. Between you and
dialog: me, no one in the world could do
dialog: musical harm to the Princess
dialog: Elizabeth.
text: Mozart chuckles delightedly. Salieri offers him a glass of
text: white dessert and a spoon. Mozart takes it absently and goes
text: on talking.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Look, I must have pupils. Without
dialog: pupils I can't manage.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: You don't mean to tell me you are
dialog: living in poverty?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke.
dialog: I don't know why.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: It has been said, my friend, that
dialog: you are inclined to live somewhat
dialog: above your means.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: How can anyone say that? We have no
dialog: cook, no maid. We have no footman.
dialog: Nothing at all!
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: How is that possible? You give
dialog: concerts, don't you? I hear they are
dialog: quite successful.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: They're stupendously successful.
dialog: You can't get a seat. The only problem
dialog: is none will hire me. They all want
dialog: to hear me play, but they won't let
dialog: me teach their daughters. As if I
dialog: was some kind of fiend. I'm not a
dialog: fiend!
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Of course not.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Do you have a daughter?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: I'm afraid not.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Well, could you lend me some money
dialog: till you have one? Then I'll teach
dialog: her for free. That's a promise. Oh,
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's
dialog: right - I should put a padlock on my
dialog: mouth. Seriously, is there any chance
dialog: you could manage a loan? Only for
dialog: six months, eight at most. After
dialog: that I'll be the richest man in
dialog: Vienna. I'll pay you back double.
dialog: Anything. Name your terms. I'm not
dialog: joking. I'm working on something
dialog: that's going to explode like a bomb
dialog: all over Europe!
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: I'd better not. It's a bit of a
dialog: secret.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested.
dialog: Truly.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Actually, it's a big secret. Oh,
dialog: this is delicious! What is it?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Cream cheese mixed with granulated
text: sugar and suffused with rum. Crema
dialog: al Mascarpone.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Ah. Italian?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Forgive me. We all have patriotic
dialog: feelings of some kind.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Two thousand, two hundred florins is
dialog: all I need A hundred? Fifty?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: What exactly are you working on?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: I can't say. Really
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: I don't think you should become known
dialog: in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart.
dialog: However, I know a very distinguished
dialog: gentleman I could recommend to you.
dialog: And he has a daughter. Will that do?
scene_heading: INT. MICHAEL SCHLUMBERG'S HOUSE - MORNING - 1780'S
text: Hysterical barking and howling. The hall is full of dogs, at
text: least five, all jumping up and dashing about and making a
text: terrific racket. Mozart, dandified in a new coat and a plumed
text: hat for the occasion, has arrived to teach at the house of a
text: prosperous merchant, MICHAEL SCHLUMBERG. Bluff, friendly and
text: coarse-looking, he stands in his hall amidst the leaping and
text: barking animals, greeting Mozart.
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there,
dialog: damn you.
dialog: (to Mozart)
dialog: Welcome to you. Pay no attention,
dialog: they're impossible. Stop it, you
dialog: willful things! Come this way. Just
dialog: ignore them. They're perfectly
dialog: harmless, just willful. I treat them
dialog: just like my own children.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: And which one of them do you want me
dialog: to teach?
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like
dialog: it. Which one, eh? You're a funny
dialog: fellow.
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Hannah! Come this way.
text: He leads Mozart through the throng of dogs into a salon
text: furnished with comfortable middle-class taste.
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: Hannah!
text: FRAU SCHLUMBERG appears: an anxious woman in middle life.
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: (to Mozart)
dialog: You won't be teaching this one either.
dialog: She's my wife.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: (bowing)
dialog: Madame.
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The
dialog: young man Herr Salieri recommended
dialog: to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?
speaker_heading: FRAU SCHLUMBERG
text: Upstairs.
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: Gertrude!
speaker_heading: FRAU SCHLUMBERG
dialog: You can't be Herr Mozart!
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: I'm afraid I am.
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: Of course, it's him. Who do you think
dialog: it is?
speaker_heading: FRAU SCHLUMBERG
dialog: I've heard about you for ages! I
dialog: thought you must be an old man.
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: Gertrude!
speaker_heading: FRAU SCHLUMBERG
dialog: It's such an honour for us to have
dialog: you here, Herr Mozart. And for
dialog: Gertrude.
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: People who know say the girl's got
dialog: talent. You must judge for yourself.
dialog: If you think she stinks, say so.
speaker_heading: FRAU SCHLUMBERG
dialog: Michael, please! I'm sure you will
dialog: find her most willing, Herr Mozart.
dialog: She's really very excited. She's
dialog: been preparing all morning.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: FRAU SCHLUMBERG
dialog: Ah, now! Here she comes.
text: GERTRUDE SCHLUMBERG appears in the doorway: an awkward girl
text: of fifteen in her best dress, her hair primped and curled.
text: She is exceedingly nervous.
speaker_heading: MOZART
text: Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say
dialog: good morning.
text: Gertrude giggles instead.
speaker_heading: FRAU SCHLUMBERG
dialog: (to Mozart)
dialog: Perhaps a little refreshment first?
dialog: A little coffee, or a little
dialog: chocolate?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: I'd like a little wine, if you have
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: FRAU SCHLUMBERG
dialog: Wine?
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: Quite right. He's going to need it.
dialog: (calling and clapping
dialog: his hands)
dialog: Klaus! A bottle of wine. Prestissimo!
dialog: Now let's go to it. I've been waiting
dialog: all day for this.
text: He leads the way into:
scene_heading: INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY - 1780'S
text: A forte-piano is open and waiting. All the dogs follow him.
text: After them come Mozart Frau and Fraulein Schlumberg. To
text: Mozart's dismay, husband and wife seat themselves quite
text: formally on a little narrow sofa, side by side.
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: (To the dogs)
dialog: Now sit down all of you and behave.
dialog: Zeman, Mandi, absolutely quiet!
dialog: (to a young beagle)
dialog: Especially you, Dudelsachs - not one
dialog: sound from you.
text: The dogs settle at their feet. Husband and wife smile
text: encouragingly at each other.
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: Come on, then. Up and at it!
text: Mozart gestures to the music bench. Reluctantly, the girl
text: sits at the instrument. Mozart sits beside her.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Now, please play me something. Just
dialog: to give me an idea. Anything will
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: (to parents)
dialog: I don't want you to stay.
speaker_heading: FRAU SCHLUMBERG
dialog: That's all right, dear. Just go ahead,
dialog: as if we weren't here.
speaker_heading: GERTRUDE
dialog: But you are here.
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: Never mind, Strudel. It's part of
text: music, getting used to an audience.
dialog: Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.
dialog: (to Gertrude)
dialog: How long have you been playing,
dialog: Fraulein?
speaker_heading: FRAU SCHLUMBERG
dialog: Just one year.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Who was your teacher?
speaker_heading: FRAU SCHLUMBERG
dialog: I was. But she quite outgrew the
dialog: little I could show her.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Thank you, Madame.
dialog: (to Gertrude)
dialog: Come on now - courage. Play me
dialog: something you know.
text: In response the wretched girl just stares down at the keyboard
text: without playing a note. An awkward pause.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Perhaps it would be better if we
dialog: were left alone. I think we're both
dialog: a little shy.
text: Husband and wife look at each other.
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: Nonsense. Strudel's not shy. She's
dialog: just willful! You give into her now,
dialog: you'll be sorry later. Strudel -
dialog: play.
text: Silence. The girl sits unmoving. Schlumberg bellows:
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: I said play!
speaker_heading: FRAU SCHLUMBERG
dialog: Michael!
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Perhaps if I were to play a little
dialog: first, it might encourage the
dialog: Fraulein.
dialog: (to the girl)
dialog: Why don't you let me try the
dialog: instrument? All right?
text: Suddenly the girl rises. Mozart smiles at the parents. They
text: smile nervously back. Mozart slides along the bench, raises
text: his hands and preludes over the keys. Instantly a dog howls
text: loudly. Startled, Mozart stops. Schlumberg leaps to his feet
text: and goes over to the beagle.
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: Stop that, Dudelsachs! Stop it at
dialog: once!
dialog: (to Mozart)
dialog: Don't let him disturb you. He'll be
dialog: all right. He's just a little willful
dialog: too. Please, please - play. I beg
dialog: you.
text: Mozart resumes playing. This time it is a lively piece,
text: perhaps the Presto Finale from the K. 450. The dog howls
dialog: immediately.
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: Stop it! STOP!
text: Mozart stops.
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: No, not you. I was talking to the
dialog: dog. You keep playing. It's most
dialog: important. He always howls when he
dialog: hears music. We've got to break them
dialog: of the habit. Play, please. Please!
text: Amazed, Mozart starts to play the Rondo again. The dog howls
dialog: louder.
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: That's it. Now keep going, just keep
dialog: going.
dialog: (to the beagle)
dialog: Now you stop that noise, Dudelsachs,
dialog: you stop it this instant! This
dialog: instant, do you hear me? Keep going,
dialog: Herr Mozart, that's it. Go on, go
dialog: on!
text: Mozart plays on. Suddenly the dog falls silent. Schlumberg
text: smiles broadly.
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: Good, good, good! Very good dog!
dialog: Very, very good Dudelsachs.
dialog: (to his wife, snapping
dialog: his fingers)
dialog: Quick, quick, dear, bring his biscuit.
text: The wife scurries to get a jar of biscuits. A servant brings
text: in an open bottle of wine and a full glass on a tray. He
text: puts it down beside Mozart as Schlumberg addresses the silent
text: dog with deepest affection.
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: Now guess who's going to get a nice
dialog: reward? Clever, clever Dudi.
text: He gives the biscuit to the dog who swallows it greedily.
text: Mozart stops playing and stands up.
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: (barely controlling
dialog: himself)
dialog: Well, I'm a good teacher. The next
dialog: time you wish me to instruct another
dialog: of your dogs, please let me know.
dialog: Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame!
dialog: goodbye, Sir!
text: He bows to them and leaves the room. They look after him in
text: puzzled astonishment.
speaker_heading: FRAU SCHLUMBERG
dialog: What a strange young man.
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: Yes. He is a little strange.
scene_heading: EXT. A BUSY STREET IN VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S
text: A cheerful scene. We see Mozart strutting and beaming, making
text: his way through the crowd of porters, carriers and hawkers,
text: sellers of sausages and pastries, vendors of hats and ribbons.
text: Horses and carriage clatter past him. His mood is best
text: expressed by a bubbling version of Non piu Andrai played on
dialog: the forte-piano.
text: Still in the same mood, he enters the door of his own house.
scene_heading: INT. MOZART'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY - 1780'S
text: Suddenly, he stops. He looks up the stairs. The grim opening
text: chords from the Overture to Don Giovanni cut across the march
text: from Figaro. What he sees, looking up the stairs, is a
text: menacing figure in a long, grey cape and dark grey hat,
text: standing on the landing. The light comes from behind the
text: figure so that we see only its silhouette as it unfolds its
text: arms towards Mozart in an alarming gesture of possession.
text: It takes a beat in which the air of sinister mystery is held
text: before Mozart realizes who it is. Then, as the music
text: continues, he hastily sets down the bottle of wine and rushes
text: joyfully up the stairs and hurls himself into the figure's
dialog: arms.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Papa! PAPA!
text: Both men embrace. The music slowly fades.
scene_heading: INT. MOZART'S LIVING ROOM - DAY - 1780'S
text: A cramped, low-ceilinged little room which nobody has tidied
text: for ages. We see music lying everywhere. Also there are many
text: empty wine bottles; musical instruments - among them a
text: mandolin, a viola, a forte-piano with the black and white
text: keys reversed - books and abandoned plates of food.
text: Mozart clasps his father's arms. Leopold is now seen as an
text: aging, travel-stained man in clothes that need repair. His
text: face is lined, and he is obviously not in perfect health.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Why are you here?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Am I not welcome?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Of course, welcome! Welcome ten
dialog: thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
text: He kisses his hands.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: You're very thin. Does she not feed
dialog: you, this wife of yours?
text: Mozart ducks away and fetches his father's bags from the
dialog: landing.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Feed? Well, of course she feeds me.
dialog: She stuffs me like a goose all day
dialog: long. She's the best cook in the
dialog: world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait,
dialog: you'll see.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Is she not here?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
text: Leopold looks about him at the mess in the room.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Do you always live like this?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly
dialog: like this. I mean today - just today,
dialog: Stanzi - I remember now. She had to
dialog: go - yes! She had to help her mother.
dialog: Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a
dialog: very sweet woman, you'll see.
text: He carries the bag across the room and opens the door of the
text: bedroom. Constanze lies in bed. She sits up, startled.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Oh! I didn't know you were home.
dialog: Stanzi, this is my father.
text: Constanze, who looks ill and tired, stares at Leopold.
text: Leopold stares back from the doorway.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: We'll wait, we'll wait. Why don't
dialog: you get up now, darling?
text: He closes the door again.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: She's very tired, poor creature.
dialog: You know me: I'm a real pig. It's
dialog: not so easy cleaning up after me.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Don't you have a maid?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Oh we could, if we wanted to, but
dialog: Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants
dialog: to do everything herself.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: How is your financial situation?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: It couldn't be better.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: That's not what I hear.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: What do you mean? It's wonderful.
dialog: Really, it's - it's marvelous! People
dialog: love me here.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: They say you're in debt.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Who? Who says that? Now that's a
dialog: malicious lie!
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: How many pupils do you have?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Pupils?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: How many?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: I don't know. It's not important. I
dialog: mean, I don't want pupils. They get
dialog: in the way. I've got to have time
dialog: for composition.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Composition doesn't pay. You know
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: This one will.
text: He picks up some pages of manuscript.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Oh, let's not talk about it.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: It's a secret.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: You don't have secrets from me.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're
dialog: going to love it. Ah, there she is!
text: Constanze comes into the room. She is wearing a dressing
text: gown and has made a perfunctory attempt to tidy her hair.
text: We see that she is clearly pregnant.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she
dialog: beautiful? Come on now, confess,
dialog: Papa. Could you want a prettier girl
dialog: for a daughter?
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful.
dialog: Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I see that you're expecting.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Oh, yes.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: When, may I ask?
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: In three months! Papa.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Why didn't you mention it in your
dialog: letters?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure
dialog: I did.
text: He gives a little giggle of embarrassment.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out!
dialog: This calls for a feast. You don't
dialog: want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing.
dialog: Papa loves parties, don't you?
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Wolfi!
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: What? How can you be so boring?
dialog: Tea!
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Wolfi, I think your father's tired.
dialog: I'll cook us something here.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't
dialog: spend any money on me.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better
dialog: way could I spend it than on you? My
text: kissable, missable, suddenly visible
dialog: Papa!
text: The jaunty tune of Ich Mochte Wohl Der Kaiser sein (K.539)
text: sounds through all the following. This is an alternate song
dialog: from Il Seraglio: a very extroverted tune for baritone and
text: orchestra and a prominent part for bass drum. The vocal part
dialog: should be arranged for trumpet.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET IN VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S
text: Mozart and Constanze with Leopold between them. We see couples
dialog: shopping.
scene_heading: INT. A COSTUME SHOP - VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S
text: This is a shop where one can buy costumes for masquerades.
text: It is filled with extravagant costumes of various kinds.
text: Wolfgang is wearing a costume, a mask pushed up on his
text: forehead; Constanze is wearing a little white velvet mask.
text: Amidst the merriment, Leopold is helped by two assistants to
text: put on a dark grey cloak and a dark grey tricorne hat, to
text: which is attached a full mask of dark grey. Its mouth is cut
text: into a fixed upward smile.
text: He turns and looks at his son through this mask.
scene_heading: CUT STRAIGHT TO:
scene_heading: INT. A LARGE PARTY ROOM - VIENNA - NIGHT - 1780'S
text: We are in the full whirl of a Masquerade Ball. Couples are
text: dancing around dressed in fantastic costumes. The music of
dialog: Ich Mochte Wohl Der Kaiser sein increases in volume and
text: persists. We see the musicians thumping it out on a balustrade
text: above the dancers. A steer is being roasted. Through the
text: bobbing crowd we see a group, headed by the figure of Bacchus:
text: this is Schikaneder in a Greek costume, wearing vine leaves
text: in his hair. He is accompanied by his usual trio of actresses
text: and three other men. Constanze as Columbine and Mozart as
text: Harlequin are pulling Leopold by the hand of his dark cloak
text: and smiling mask. This whole group threads its way across
text: the crowded room and disappears through a door. As they go,
text: they are watched by Salieri, standing alone in a corner,
text: wearing ordinary evening clothes. He turns away hastily to
dialog: avoid being seen by them.
text: As soon as they disappear into the far room, Salieri goes
text: quickly to a lady in the corner who is giving guests domino
text: masks off a tray. He quickly takes a small black mask and
text: puts it on.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. A GROTTO ROOM NEXT DOOR - NIGHT - 1780'S
text: A fantastic room designed as a rocky grotto, lit by candles.
text: A forte-piano to one side is being played by Schikaneder:
text: the music of Ich Mochte Wohl Der Kaiser sein cross-fades to
dialog: another tune. This is Vivat Bacchus from Il Seraglio which
text: Schikaneder, dressed as Bacchus, is humming as he plays. The
text: music is actually accompanying a game of Forfeits, which has
text: begun. Five couples (the group we have just seen) are dancing
text: in the middle of a ring made by nine chairs. When the music
text: stops they will each have to find a chair, and the one who
dialog: fails must pay a forfeit.
text: Constanze is dancing with Leopold; Mozart is dancing with
text: one of the actresses; the two other actresses are dancing
text: with two other gentlemen; and two children dance together -
text: a little boy and a little girl. The scene is watched by a
text: circle of bystanders; among them - from the doorway - is
dialog: Salieri.
text: Schikaneder stops playing. Immediately the couples scramble
text: for the chairs. Leopold and Constanze meet on the same chair,
text: bumping and pushing at each other to get sole possession of
text: it. To the amusement of the people around, the chair over-
text: balances and they both end up on the floor. Constanze
text: immediately gets up again, sets the chair on its feet, and
text: tries to pretend she was sitting in it all the time. But
text: Schikaneder calls out from the forte-piano.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: No, no! You both lost. You both lost.
dialog: You both have to forfeit. And the
dialog: penalty is you must exchange your
text: wigs.
text: People are delighted by the idea of this penalty. The children
text: jump up and down with excitement. The three actresses
text: immediately surround Leopold, reaching for his hat and mask
text: and wig, whilst he tries to hold on to them. Mozart takes
text: off Constanze's wig - an absurd affair with side-curls.
text: Constanze laughingly surrenders it.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: No, please! This is ridiculous! No,
dialog: please!
text: Despite his protests an actress takes off his hat, to which
text: the smiling mask is attached, to reveal his outraged face
text: showing a very different expression underneath. Another
text: actress snatches off his wig to reveal very sparse hair on
text: the old man's head. The third actress takes Constanze's wig
text: from Mozart and attempts to put it on his father's head.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: No, really!
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: (calling to him)
dialog: This is just a game, Papa.
text: Constanze echoes him with a touch of malice in her voice.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: This is just a game, Papa!
text: Laughingly, the bystanders take it up, especially the
dialog: children.

dialog: This is just a game, Papa!
text: As Leopold glares furiously about him, the actress succeeds
text: in getting Constanze's wig firmly onto his head. Everybody
text: bursts into applause. Delightedly, Constanze puts on Leopold's
text: wig, hat and mask: from the waist up she now looks like a
text: weird parody of Leopold in the smiling grey mask, and he
text: looks like a weird parody of her in the silly feminine wig.
text: Schikaneder starts to play again, and the couples start to
text: dance. Leopold angrily takes off Constanze's wig and leaves
text: the circle; his partner, Constanze, is left alone. Seeing
text: this, Mozart leaves his partner and catches his father
text: entreatingly by the arm.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Oh no, Papa, please! Don't spoil the
dialog: fun. Come on. Here, take mine.
text: He takes off his own wig and puts it on Leopold's uncovered
text: head. The effect, if not as ridiculous, is still somewhat
text: bizarre, since Wolfgang favours fairly elaborate wigs. He
text: takes Constanze's wig from his father. As this happens, the
text: music stops again. Mozart gently pushes his father down onto
text: a nearby chair; the others scramble for the other chairs;
text: and he is left as the Odd Man Out. He giggles. Schikaneder
text: calls out to Leopold from the keyboard.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: Herr Mozart, why don't you name your
dialog: son's penalty?
dialog: Applause.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do
dialog: anything you say!
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I want you to come back with me to
dialog: Salzburg, my son.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: What did he say? What did he say?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Papa, the rule is you can only give
dialog: penalties that can be performed in
dialog: the room.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I'm tired of this game. Please play
dialog: without me.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: But my penalty. I've got to have a
dialog: penalty.
text: All the bystanders are watching.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: I've got a good one. I've got the
dialog: perfect one for you. Come over here.
text: Mozart runs over to the forte-piano, and Schikaneder
text: surrenders his place at it.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: Now, I want you to play our tune -
text: sitting backwards.
dialog: Applause.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Oh, that's really too easy. Any child
dialog: can do that.
text: Amused sounds of disbelief.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: And a fugue in the manner of Sebastian
dialog: Bach.
text: Renewed applause at this wicked extra penalty. Mozart smiles
dialog: at Schikaneder - it is the sort of challenge he loves. He
text: defiantly puts on Constanze's wig and seats himself with his
text: back to the keyboard. Before the astonished eyes of the
text: company he proceeds to execute this absurdly difficult task.
text: His right hand plays the bass part, his left hand the treble,
text: and with this added difficulty he improvises a brilliant
dialog: fugue on the subject of the tune to which they have been
dialog: dancing.
text: Attracted by this astonishing feat, the players draw nearer
text: to the instrument. So does Salieri, cautiously, with some of
text: the bystanders. Constanze watches him approach. Only Leopold
text: sits by himself, sulking.
text: The fugue ends amidst terrific clapping. The guests call out
dialog: to Mozart.
speaker_heading: GUESTS

text: SMASH CUT: Salieri's masked face whips around and looks at
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Now that's hard. That's very hard.
dialog: For Salieri one has to face the right
dialog: way around.
text: Giggling, he turns around and sits at the keyboard. Then,
text: watched by a highly amused group, he begins a wicked parody.
text: He furrows his brow in mock concentration and closes his
text: eyes. Then he begins to play the tune to which they danced,
text: in the most obvious way imaginable, relying heavily on a
text: totally and offensively unimaginative bass of tonic and
text: dominant, endlessly repeated. The music is the very essence
text: of banality. The bystanders rock with laughter. Mozart starts
text: to giggle wildly. Through this excruciating scene, Salieri
text: stares at Constanze, who suddenly turns her head and looks
text: challengingly back at him.
text: Mozart's parody reaches its coarse climax with him adding a
text: fart noise instead of notes to end cadences. He builds this
text: up, urged on in his clowning by everyone else, until suddenly
text: he stops and cries out. The laughter cuts off. Mozart stands
text: up, clutching his behind as if he has made a mess in his
text: breeches. The momentary hush of alarm is followed by a howl
text: of laughter.
text: CU, Salieri staring in pain.

text: hearing the music and playing shots on the table.
text: From time to time he drifts over to a piece of manuscript

text: to him. Standing at Mozart's desk, strewn with manuscripts,
text: he picks up Mozart's pen and strokes the feather. He touches
text: the inkstand. He lays a finger on the candlestick with its
text: half-expired candle. He touches each object as if it were
text: the memento of a beloved. He is in awe. Finally his eye falls
text: on the sheets of music themselves. Stealthily he picks them
dialog: up.
dialog: CU, The pages.

speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: (motioning him to be

dialog: Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do
dialog: not censor things lightly. When I
dialog: do, I have good reason. Figaro is a
text: bad play. It stirs up hatred between
dialog: the classes. In France it has caused
dialog: nothing but bitterness. My own dear

dialog: own people. I do not wish to see the
dialog: same fears starting here.

speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: But it's new, it's entirely new.
dialog: It's so new, people will go mad for
dialog: it. For example, I have a scene in
text: the second act - it starts as a duet,
text: just a man and wife quarreling.
text: Suddenly the wife's scheming little
text: maid comes in unexpectedly - a very
text: funny situation. Duet turns into
dialog: trio. Then the husband's equally
text: screaming valet comes in. Trio turns
dialog: into quartet. Then a stupid old
dialog: gardener - quartet becomes quintet,
dialog: and so on. On and on, sextet, septet,
dialog: octet! How long do you think I can
dialog: sustain that?
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: I have no idea.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the
dialog: longest time such a thing could last,
dialog: then double it.

dialog: Sire, only opera can do this. In a
dialog: play, if more than one person speaks
text: at the same time, it's just noise.
dialog: No one can understand a word. But
dialog: with music, with music you can have
text: twenty individuals all talking at
dialog: once, and it's not noise - it's a
dialog: perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
speaker_heading: VON SWIETEN
dialog: Mozart, music is not the issue here.
dialog: No one doubts your talent. It is
dialog: your judgment of literature that's
dialog: in question. Even with the politics
dialog: taken out, this thing would still
dialog: remain a vulgar farce. Why waste
dialog: your spirit on such rubbish? Surely
dialog: you can choose more elevated themes?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Elevated? What does that mean?
dialog: Elevated! The only thing a man should
dialog: elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.
dialog: I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the
dialog: teeth with elevated things! Old dead
dialog: legends! How can we go on forever
dialog: writing about gods and legends?
speaker_heading: VON SWIETEN
dialog: (aroused)
dialog: Because they do. They go on forever -
dialog: at least what they represent. The
dialog: eternal in us, not the ephemeral.
dialog: Opera is here to ennoble us. You and
dialog: me, just as much as His Majesty.
speaker_heading: BONNO
dialog: Bello! Bello, Barone. Veramente.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Oh, bello, bello, bello! Come on
dialog: now, be honest. Wouldn't you all
dialog: rather listen to your hairdressers
dialog: than Hercules? Or Horatius? Or
dialog: Orpheus? All those old bores! people
dialog: so lofty they sound as if they shit
dialog: marble!
speaker_heading: VON SWIETEN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VON STRACK
dialog: Govern your tongue, sir! How dare
dialog: you?
text: Beat. All look at the Emperor.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar

dialog: not.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: You are passionate, Mozart! But you

speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Sire, the whole opera is finished.
dialog: Do you know how much work went into

speaker_heading: BONNO
dialog: His Majesty has been more than
dialog: patient, Signore.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: How can I persuade you if you won't
dialog: let me show it?
scene_heading: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
dialog: That will do, Herr Mozart!
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Just let me tell you how it begins.
speaker_heading: VON STRACK
dialog: Herr Mozart -
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: May I just do that, Majesty? Show
dialog: you how it begins? Just that?
text: A slight pause. Then Joseph nods.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Please.
text: Mozart falls on his knees.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Look! There's a servant, down on his
dialog: knees. Do you know why? Not from any
dialog: oppression. No, he's simply measuring
dialog: a space. Do you know what for? His

speaker_heading: BONNO
dialog: Si, si! Veramente.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Well, gentlemen, so be it. In that

scene_heading: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
dialog: What anger?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: About the ballet.
scene_heading: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
dialog: Ballet? What ballet?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Excuse me - didn't His Majesty
dialog: specifically forbid ballet in his
dialog: opera?
scene_heading: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
dialog: Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet

speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Yes, in the third act.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE OPERA HOUSE - DAY - 1780'S
text: It is a full orchestral rehearsal. Mozart is conducting from
text: the harpsichord with his hands; he does not use a baton.
text: The singers are all in practice clothes, not costumes.
text: We are in the Act III and we hear the recitativo exchange
text: just before the march begins. Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno sit
text: watching chairs.
text: Suddenly the march starts. Peasants and friends start to
text: dance in and at the same moment, Orsini-Rosenberg gets up
text: and comes down to Mozart. He is accompanied by an anxious
dialog: Bonno.
scene_heading: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
dialog: Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a
dialog: word with you please. Right away.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Certainly, Herr Director.
text: He signals to the cast to break off.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Five minutes, please!
text: The company disperses, curious. The musicians look at Orsini-
dialog: Rosenberg.
scene_heading: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
dialog: Did you not know that His Majesty
dialog: has expressly forbidden ballet in
dialog: his operas?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Yes, but this is not a ballet. This
text: is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
scene_heading: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
dialog: Exactly. A dance.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: But surely the Emperor didn't mean
dialog: to prohibit dancing when it's part
dialog: of the story.
scene_heading: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
dialog: It is dangerous for you to interpret
dialog: His Majesty's edicts. Give me your
dialog: score, please.
text: Mozart hands him the score from which he is conducting.
scene_heading: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
dialog: Thank you.
text: He rips out a page. Bonno watches in terror.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: What are you doing?
text: He rips out three more.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: What are you doing, Herr Director?
scene_heading: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
dialog: Taking out what you should never

text: A servant opens the door to announce.
speaker_heading: SERVANT
dialog: Herr Mozart.
text: Mozart brushes past him straight towards Salieri, who rises
text: to greet him. The little man is near hysterics.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Please! Please. I've no one else to
dialog: turn to. Please!
text: He grabs Salieri.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per
dialog: favore. What's the matter?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: It's unbelievable! The Director has
text: actually ripped out a huge section
dialog: of my music. Pages of it.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Really? Why?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: I don't know. They say I've got to
dialog: re-write the opera, but it's perfect
dialog: as it is. I can't rewrite what's
dialog: perfect. Can't you talk to him?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg?
dialog: He's obviously no friend of yours.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Oh, I could kill him! I mean really
dialog: kill him. I actually threw the entire
dialog: opera on the fire, he made me so
dialog: angry!
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: You burned the score?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: How fortunate.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: It's not fair that a man like that
dialog: has power over our work.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: But there are those who have power
dialog: over him. I think I'll take this up
dialog: with the Emperor.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Oh, Excellency, would you?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: With all my heart, Mozart.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Thank you! Oh, thank you.
text: He kisses Salieri's hand.
speaker_heading: SALIERI

scene_heading: INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 1823
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: I'm sure I don't need to tell you I
dialog: said nothing whatever to the Emperor.
dialog: I went to the theatre ready to tell
dialog: Mozart that His Majesty had flown
dialog: into a rage when I mentioned the
dialog: ballet, when suddenly, to my
text: astonishment, in the middle of the
dialog: third act, the Emperor - who never
dialog: attended rehearsals - suddenly
dialog: appeared.
scene_heading: INT. OPERA HOUSE - DAY - 1780'S
text: In the background the same recitativo before the March. The
text: Emperor steals in surreptitiously with Von Strack, his finger
text: to his lips. He motions everyone not to rise, and slips into
text: a chair behind Salieri, Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno.
text: The three conspirators look at each other wide-eyed.
text: The recitativo summons up the march, but instead there is
text: silence. Mozart lays down his baton. The musicians lay down
text: their instruments. The celebrants of Figaro's wedding come
text: in with a few pitiful dance steps, in procession, only to
text: come presently to a halt, lacking their music. The singers
text: try to go on singing, but they have no cues from their
text: conductor or from the accompaniment. Everyone on stage looks
text: lost, though they attempt to go on with the story for a while.
text: Consternation grows on the faces of the conspirators. Mozart
text: glances back at the group seated in the theatre. Finally,
text: the Emperor speaks, in a whisper.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: What is this? I don't understand.
dialog: Is it modern?
speaker_heading: BONNO
dialog: Majesty, the Herr Director, he has
dialog: removed a balleto that would have
dialog: occurred at this place.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Why?
scene_heading: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
dialog: It is your regulation, Sire. No ballet
dialog: in your opera.
text: Mozart strains to hear what they are saying but cannot.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Do you like this, Salieri?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: It is not a question of liking, Your
dialog: Majesty. Your own law decrees it,
dialog: I'm afraid.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Well, look at them.
text: We do look at them. The spectacle on stage has now ground to
dialog: a complete halt.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: No, no, no! This is nonsense. Let me
text: hear the scene with the music.
scene_heading: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
dialog: But, Sire -
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Oblige me.
text: Orsini-Rosenberg acknowledges his defeat.
scene_heading: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
dialog: Yes, Majesty.
text: Orsini-Rosenberg rises and goes down to where Mozart sits
text: anxiously with the musicians, watching his approach.
scene_heading: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
dialog: Can we see the scene with the music
dialog: back, please?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr
dialog: Director!
text: He looks back deliriously at Salieri, trying to indicate his
text: gratitude. Salieri acknowledges with a slight and subtle
dialog: nod.
text: Orsini-Rosenberg returns to his king.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, we're going
dialog: from where we stopped. The Count:
dialog: Anches so. Right away, please!
text: The singers scatter offstage to begin the scene again.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: (to Orsini-Rosenberg)
dialog: What I hoped by that edict, Director,
dialog: was simply to prevent hours of dancing
dialog: like in French opera. There it is
dialog: endless, as you know.
scene_heading: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
dialog: Quite so, Majesty.
text: CUT BACK TO Mozart at the forte-piano, raising his hands.
text: The musicians raise their bows. With a flourish the happy
text: composer begins a reprise of the scene which had been cut
text: out. The music of the march begins faintly; the celebrants
text: of Figaro's wedding start to enter as the Count and the
text: Countess sit in their chairs.
text: In the theatre we see increasing pleasure on the Emperor's
text: face, sullenness and defeat on the courtiers'. Then, suddenly,
text: without interruption, on a crescendo repeat of the march, we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT - 1780'S
text: The theatre is brilliantly lit for the first public
text: performance of Figaro. Everybody is there: the Emperor, Von
text: Strack, Bonno Orsini-Rosenberg, Von Swieten, even Madame
text: Weber and her daughters in a box. The musicians all wear
text: imperial livery; the actors on stage are now in costume.
text: Mozart, conducting, wears his Order of the Golden Spur. The
text: company wheels in and around to the music of the restored
text: march, which reaches a triumphant climax.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 1823
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: (to Vogler)
dialog: So Figaro was produced in spite of
dialog: me. And in spite of me, a wonder was
dialog: revealed. One of the true wonders of
dialog: art. The restored third act was bold
dialog: and brilliant. The fourth was a
dialog: miracle.
text: The descending scale of strings in the final ensemble (Ah,
text: Tutti contenti. Saremo cosi) fades in.
scene_heading: INT. OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT - 1780'S
text: We see the tableau on stage with the Count kneeling to the
text: Countess. All are singing.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
dialog: I saw a woman disguised in her maid's
text: clothes hear her husband speak the
dialog: first tender words he has offered
dialog: her in years, only because he thinks
dialog: she is someone else. I heard the
dialog: music of true forgiveness filling
text: the theatre, conferring on all who
dialog: sat there a perfect absolution. God
dialog: was singing through this little man
dialog: to all the world - unstoppable -
dialog: making my defeat more bitter with
text: each passing bar.
text: CU, Salieri in his box, tears on his cheeks. He watches the
text: ensemble and we listen to it for a long moment. Finally it
text: fades, but continues underneath the following:
scene_heading: INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 1823
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: And then suddenly - a miracle!
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT - 1780'S
text: The ensemble reaches its climax, and fades away to the very
text: quiet, slow chords immediately preceding the boisterous final
text: chord. Salieri becomes aware that some of the audience are
text: asleep and many mare are apathetic. In the near silence we
text: see the Emperor yawn behind his hand. Those nearby look at
text: him. Orsini-Rosenberg smiles.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 1823
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: Father, did you know what that meant?
dialog: With that yawn I saw my defeat turn
dialog: into a victory. And Mozart was lucky
text: the Emperor only yawned once. Three
dialog: yawns and the opera would fail the
text: same night; two yawns, within a week
text: at most. With one yawn the composer
dialog: could still get -
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SALIERI'S SALON - DAY - 1780'S
text: Mozart is pacing up and down. Salieri is listening
text: sympathetically.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Nine performances! Nine! That's all
dialog: it's had - and withdrawn.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: I know; it's outrageous. Still, if
dialog: the public doesn't like one's work
text: one has to accept the fact gracefully.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: But what is it they don't like?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Well, I can speak for the Emperor.
dialog: You made too many demands on the
dialog: royal ear. The poor man can't
dialog: concentrate for more than an hour
dialog: and you gave him four.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: What did you think of it yourself?
dialog: Did you like it at all?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: I think it's marvelous. Truly.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: It's the best opera yet written. I
dialog: know it! Why didn't they come?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: I think you overestimate our dear
dialog: Viennese, my friend. Do you know you
dialog: didn't even give them a good bang at
dialog: the end of songs so they knew when
dialog: to clap?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: I know, I know. Perhaps you should
dialog: give me some lessons in that.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: (fuming)
dialog: I wouldn't presume. All the same, if
dialog: it wouldn't be imposing, I would
dialog: like you to see my new piece. It
dialog: would be a tremendous honour for me.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: (bowing)

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT - 1780'S
text: A performance of Salieri's grand opera, Axur: King of Ormus.
text: Deafening applause from a crowded house. We see the reception
text: of the aria which we saw Cavalieri singing on the stage near
text: the start of the film. Cavalieri, in a mythological Persian
text: costume, is bowing to the rapturous throng; below her is
text: Salieri. We see the Emperor, Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg,
text: Bonno and Von Swieten, all applauding. We hear great cries
dialog: of 'Salieri! Salieri!' and 'Bravo!' and 'Brava!'
text: CU, Salieri looking at the crowd with immense pleasure.
dialog: Then suddenly at:
text: CU, Mozart standing in a box and clapping wildly. Behind
text: him, seated, are Schikaneder and the three girls we saw before
text: in Mozart's apartment.
text: CU, Salieri staring fixedly at Mozart, then Mozart still
text: clapping, apparently with tremendous enthusiasm.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
dialog: What was this? I never saw him excited
text: before by any music but his own.
dialog: Could he mean it?
scene_heading: INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 1823
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: (to Vogler)
dialog: Would he actually tell me my music
dialog: had moved him? Was I really going to

dialog: myself actually hurrying the tempo
dialog: of the finale.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT - 1780'S
text: Salieri conducting the last scene from Axur: King of Ormus.
text: On stage we see a big scene of acclamation: the hero and
text: heroine of the opera accepting the crown amidst the rejoicing
text: of the people. The decor and costumes are mythological
dialog: Persian. The music is utterly conventional and totally
dialog: uninventive.
text: CU, Mozart watching this in his box, with Schikaneder and
text: the three actresses. He passes an open bottle of wine to
text: them. He is evidently a little drunk, but keeps a poker face.
text: The act comes to an end. Great applause in which Mozart joins
text: in, standing and shouting 'Bravo! Bravo!' Then he leaves the

dialog: I believe that is the best opera yet
dialog: written, my friends. Salieri, you
dialog: are the brightest star in the musical
dialog: firmament. You do honour to Vienna
dialog: and to me.
text: Salieri bows his head. Joseph places the chain around his
text: neck. The crowd claps. Salieri makes to kiss his hand, but
text: Joseph restrains him, and passes on. Cavalieri, smiling
text: adoringly, gives him a deep curtsey, and he raises her up.
text: The crowd all flock to Salieri with cries and words of
text: approval. All want to shake his hand. They tug and pat him.
text: But he has eyes for only one man - he looks about him,
text: searching for him and then finds him. Mozart stands there.
text: Eagerly Salieri moves to him.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Mozart. It was good of you to come.
speaker_heading: MOZART

speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Did my work please you?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: How could it not, Excellency?
speaker_heading: SALIERI

speaker_heading: MOZART

text: The first loud chord of the Statue scene from Don Giovanni

scene_heading: INT. AN OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT - 1780'S
text: The second chord sounds.
text: On stage we see a huge nailed fist crash through the wall of
text: a painted dining room set. The giant armoured statue of the

text: Giovanni who sits at the supper table, staring - his servant
text: Leporello quaking with fear under the table.
speaker_heading: THE COMMENDATORE
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Don Giovanni!
text: The figure advances on the libertine. We see Mozart
text: conducting, pale and deeply involved. Music fades down a
dialog: little.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
dialog: So rose the dreadful ghost in his
dialog: next and blackest opera. There on
text: the stage stood the figure of a dead
dialog: commander calling out 'Repent!
dialog: Repent!'
text: The music swells. We see Salieri standing alone in the back
text: of a box, unseen, in semi-darkness. We also see that the
text: theatre is only half full. Music fades down.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
dialog: And I knew - only I understood -
text: that the horrifying apparition was
text: Leopold, raised from the dead.
dialog: Wolfgang had actually summoned up
text: his own father to accuse his son
dialog: before all the world. It was
dialog: terrifying and wonderful to watch.
text: Music swells up again. We watch the scene on stage as the
text: Commendatore addresses Giovanni. Then back to Salieri in the
text: box. Music down again.
scene_heading: INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 1823
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: Now a madness began in me. The madness
text: of a man splitting in half. Through
dialog: my influence I saw to it Don Giovanni
dialog: was played only five times in Vienna.
dialog: But in secret I went to every one of
dialog: those five - all alone - unable to
dialog: help myself, worshipping sound I
dialog: alone seemed to hear.
scene_heading: INT. AN OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT - 1780'S
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
dialog: And hour after hour, as I stood there,
dialog: understanding even more clearly how
dialog: that bitter old man was still
dialog: possessing his poor son from beyond
dialog: the grave, I began to see a way - a
dialog: terrible way - I could finally triumph
dialog: over God, my torturer.
text: Music swells. On stage Don Giovanni is seized and gripped by
text: the Statue's icy hand. Flames burst from obviously artificial
text: rocks. Demons appear and drag the libertine down to Hell.
text: The scene ends.
text: CU, Salieri, staring wide-eyed.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SCHIKANEDER'S THEATRE - VIENNA - NIGHT - 1780'S

text: On stage we see a set which parodies the dining room in Don
text: Giovanni's palace, shown before.
text: Schikaneder as Don Giovanni is dancing with the three
text: actresses to the minuet from Don Giovanni (end of Act I),
text: played by a quartet of tipsy musicians. Leporello is handing
text: around wine on a tray.
text: Suddenly there is a tremendous knocking from outside. The
text: music slithers to a stop. All look at each other in panic.
text: Leporello drops his tray with a crash. All go quiet. One
text: more knock is heard. Then all musicians, actresses, Don
text: Giovanni and Leporello make a dash to hide under the table
text: which is far too small to accommodate them all. The table
text: rocks. Schikaneder is pushed out. He is terrified. He shakes
text: elaborately. Three more knocks are heard; louder.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: Who is it?
dialog: One more knock.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: C-c-c-come in!
text: In the pit a chromatic scale from the Overture to Don Giovanni
text: turns into a anticipatory vamp. This grows more and more
text: menacing until the whole flat representing the wall at the
text: back falls down.
text: An absurd pantomime horse gallops in. It has a ridiculous
text: expression, and is manned by four men inside. Standing
text: precariously on its back is a dwarf, wearing a miniature
text: version of the armour and helmet worn by the Commendatore.
text: He sings in a high, nasal voice:
speaker_heading: COMMENDATORE
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Don Giovannnnnnnnnni!
text: He tries to keep his balance as he trots in, but fails. He
text: falls off onto the stage. He beats at the horse, trying to
dialog: get back on.
speaker_heading: COMMENDATORE
dialog: Down! Down!
text: Bewildered, the horse looks about him, but cannot see his
text: small rider who is below his level of sight.
speaker_heading: COMMENDATORE
dialog: I'm here! I'm here!
text: The horse, amidst laughter from the audience, fails to locate
text: him. Exasperated, the dwarf signals to someone in the wings.
text: A tall man strides out carrying a see-saw; on his shoulders
text: stands another man.
text: The dwarf stands on the lowered end of the see-saw. There is
text: a drum roll and the man above jumps down onto the raised end
text: and the Commendatore is abruptly catapulted back onto the
text: horse, only backwards so that he is facing away from Don
text: Giovanni. The two men bow to the applauding audience, and
dialog: retire off-stage.
text: The Commendatore tries to extend his arms in the proper
text: menacing attitude, and at the same time turn around to face
dialog: Don Giovanni. This he finds difficult.
speaker_heading: COMMENDATORE
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Don Giovannnnnnnni!
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: Who the devil are you? What do you
dialog: want?
speaker_heading: COMMENDATORE
dialog: (singing)
dialog: I've come to dinnnnnner!
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman.
dialog: I only dine with people of my own
dialog: height.
speaker_heading: COMMENDATORE
dialog: Are you drunk? You invited me. And
dialog: my horse. Here he is. Ottavio!
text: The horse takes a bow. The dwarf almost falls off again.
speaker_heading: COMMENDATORE
dialog: Whoa! Whoa! Stop it!
text: The three girls rush to his aid and reach him just in time.
text: They sing in the manner of the Tree Ladies later to be put
dialog: into The Magic Flute.
speaker_heading: FIRST LADY

speaker_heading: COMMENDATORE
dialog: (angry)
dialog: Leave me alone! Stop it! I'm a famous
dialog: horseman.
speaker_heading: OTTAVIO
dialog: And I'm a famous horse!
text: He gives the ladies a radiant smile. The three ladies sing,
text: as before, in close harmony.
speaker_heading: FIRST LADY
dialog: (singing)
dialog: He's adorable!
speaker_heading: SECOND LADY
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Adorable!
speaker_heading: THIRD LADY

text: An orchestral chord. The three ladies turn to Ottavio and
text: sing to him.
speaker_heading: THREE LADIES

dialog: Give me your hoof, my darling, And
dialog: I'll give you my heart! Take me to
dialog: your stable, And never more we'll
dialog: part!
speaker_heading: OTTAVIO
dialog: (singing: four male
dialog: voices)
dialog: I'm shy and very bashful. I don't
dialog: know what to say.
speaker_heading: THREE LADIES
dialog: (singing together)
dialog: Don't hesitate a second. Just answer
dialog: yes and neigh.
text: Ottavio neighs loudly, and runs at the girls.
speaker_heading: COMMENDATORE
dialog: (speaking)
dialog: Stop it. What are you doing? Remember
dialog: who you are! You're a horse and they
dialog: are whores.
text: Boos from the audience.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: (speaking)
dialog: This is ridiculous. I won't have any
dialog: of it. You're turning my house into
dialog: a circus!
text: A trapeze sails in from above. On it stands a grand soprano
text: wearing an elaborate Turkish costume, like a parody of
text: Cavalieri's in Il Seraglio. She comes in singing a mad
text: coloratura scale in the manner of Martern aller Arten.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: (speaking)
dialog: Shut up. Women, women, women! I'm
dialog: sick to death of them.
text: He marches off stage.
speaker_heading: SOPRANO

speaker_heading: COMMENDATORE
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: SOPRANO
dialog: (swinging and singing)
dialog: Kill me! Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!
dialog: At last I shall be freed by death.
dialog: At last I shall be freed by dea -
text: The Commendatore pulls out his sword, reaches up and thrusts
text: her through with it. The soprano collapses on the bar of the
text: trapeze. The audience applauds. At the same moment eight
text: dwarves march in bearing a huge cauldron of steaming water.
text: They sing as they march to the sound of the march that was
text: cut from Act III of Figaro. They are dressed as miniature
text: copies of the chorus in that scene except that they are
text: wearing cooks' hats.
speaker_heading: EIGHT DWARVES
dialog: (singing)
dialog: We're going to make a soprano stew!
dialog: We're going to make a soprano stew!
dialog: And when you make a soprano stew!
dialog: Any stupid soprano will do! Any stew-
dialog: stew-stew-stew-stew! Any stewpid
dialog: soprano will do!
text: They set the giant pot down in the middle of the stage. The
text: trapeze with the dead soprano is still swinging above the
dialog: stage.
text: We hear the chromatic scale from the Don Giovanni overture
text: again, repeated and repeated, only now fast and tremolando.
text: To this exciting vamp Schikaneder suddenly rides in on a
text: real horse, waving a real sword. With this he cuts the string
text: of the trapeze, and the soprano falls into the pot. A
text: tremendous splash of water. Schikaneder rides out. More
dialog: applause.
text: All the dwarves produce long wooden cooking spoons and climb
text: up the sides of the pot. The three girls produce labeled
text: bottles from under their skirts. The first is SALT.
speaker_heading: FIRST LADY
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Behold!

speaker_heading: DWARVES

speaker_heading: COMMENDATORE
dialog: (speaking)
dialog: I can't wait that long. I'm starving!
speaker_heading: OTTAVIO
dialog: (speaking; four voices)
dialog: So am I.
text: Schikaneder marches in as Figaro.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: (singing to the tune
dialog: of Non piu ante)
dialog: In the pot, I have got a good dinner.
text: Not a sausage or stew, but a singer.
text: Not a sausage or stew but a singer.
dialog: Is the treat that I'll eat for my

speaker_heading: COMMENDATORE
dialog: Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of

text: CU, Mozart laughing delightedly with the audience.
speaker_heading: THE THREE GIRLS

dialog: Give me your hoof, my darling, and
dialog: I'll give you my heart.
speaker_heading: COMMENDATORE
dialog: Shut up. I'm sick of that one too.
text: All the dwarves climb up the rim of the pot. As they climb,

speaker_heading: COMMENDATORE
dialog: And that one, too!
text: The soprano rises, dripping with water in the middle of the
dialog: pot.
speaker_heading: SOPRANO
dialog: (singing)

speaker_heading: SOPRANO

dialog: Soil me! Foil me! Spoil me!
speaker_heading: HORSE

text: Ottavio the horse gives a piercing neigh and runs down to
dialog: the hay.
speaker_heading: COMMENDATORE
dialog: (holding on)
dialog: Hey! Hey! Watch out!
text: The vamp starts again vigorously. The horse's rear-end swings
text: around on a hinge to turn his hind-quarters straight on to
text: the audience. The rest of him stays sideways. His tail springs
text: up in the air to reveal a lace handkerchief modestly hiding
dialog: his arsehole.
text: Schikaneder offers him a handful of hay. The horse eats it,
text: and out the other end comes a long Viennese sausage. The
text: audience roars with laughter. Another handful of hay and out
text: of the other end falls a string of sausages. Then a large
dialog: pie, crust and all. Then a shower of iced cakes!
text: Suddenly - silence. Schikaneder produces an egg from his
text: pocket. Ottavio the horse rears up in disgust.
speaker_heading: COMMENDATORE
dialog: Whoa! Whoa, Ottavio! Whoa!
text: Leporello pries open the horse's mouth. Schikaneder pops the
text: egg into it. A breathless pause as a drum roll builds the
text: tension, up and up and up, and then suddenly out of the
text: horse's rear-end flies a single white dove.
text: Wild applause.
text: It flies into the audience. Immediately all the cast start
text: humming the lyrical finale from Figaro: Tutti Contenti.
text: More and more doves fly out from the wings and fill the
text: theatre. Everybody picks up the sausages and cakes and begins
text: to eat. The end of the sketch is unexpectedly lyrical and
text: magical, and then, suddenly, the tempo changes and the coarse
dialog: strains of Ich Mochte wohl Der Kaiser take over and the whole
text: company is dancing, frantically. A general dance as the
text: curtain falls.
text: It rises immediately. The audience - including Mozart - is
text: delighted. They applaud vigorously. Schikaneder takes a bow
text: amongst his troupe. Among much whistling and clapping, he
text: finally jumps off the stage and strides through the audience
text: toward the table where Mozart sits with his family. On stage,
text: a troupe of bag pipers immediately appears to play an old
text: German tune. Some of the audience joins in singing it.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: Well, how do you like that?
text: Mozart is smiling; he has been amused. Constanze has been
text: less amused and is looking apprehensive.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Wonderful!
dialog: (indicating his baby
dialog: son)
dialog: He liked the monkey, didn't you?
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: Yes, well, it's all good fun.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: I liked the horse.
text: Schikaneder sits at the table, and drinks from a bottle of
dialog: wine.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a
dialog: bundle, that horse, but he's worth
dialog: it. I tell you, if you'd played Don
dialog: Giovanni here it would have been a
dialog: great success. I'm not joking. These
dialog: people aren't fools. You could do
dialog: something marvelous for them.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: I'd like to try them someday. I'm
dialog: not sure I'd be much good at it.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: 'Course you would. You belong here,
dialog: my boy, not the snobby Court. You
dialog: could do anything you felt like here -
dialog: the more fantastic the better! That's
dialog: what people want, you know: fantasy.
dialog: You do a big production, fill it
dialog: with beautiful magic tricks and you'll
dialog: be absolutely free to do anything
dialog: you want. Of course, you'd have to
dialog: put a fire in it, because I've got
dialog: the best fire machine in the city
dialog: and a big flood - I can do you the
dialog: finest water effects you ever saw in
dialog: your life. Oh, and a few trick
dialog: animals. You'd have to use those.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Animals?
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: I tell you I picked up a snake in
dialog: Dresden last week - twelve foot long -
text: folds up to six inches, just like a
dialog: paper fan. It's a miracle.
text: Mozart laughs.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: I'm serious. You write a proper part
dialog: for me with a couple of catchy songs,
dialog: I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph-
dialog: de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be
dialog: in German.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: German!
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: Of course! What else do you think
dialog: they speak here?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: No, no, I love that. I'd want it to
dialog: be in German. I haven't done anything
dialog: in German since Seraglio.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: So there you are. What do you say?
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: How much will you pay him?
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: Ah. Well. Ah,
dialog: (to Mozart)
dialog: I see you've got your manager with
dialog: you. Well, Madame, how about half
dialog: the receipts?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Half the receipts! Stanzi!
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: I'm talking about now. How much will
dialog: you give him now? Down payment?
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: Down payment? Who do you think I am?
dialog: The Emperor? Whoops, I have to go.
text: He rises in haste for his next number.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: Stay where you are. You're going to
dialog: like this next one. We'll speak again.
dialog: Triumph-de-luxe, my boy!
text: He winks at Mozart and disappears toward the stage. Mozart
text: looks after him, enchanted.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: You're not going to do this?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Why not? Half the house!
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: When? We need money now. Either he
dialog: pays now, or you don't do it.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Oh, Stanzi.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: I don't trust this man. And I didn't
dialog: like what he did with your opera.
dialog: It was common.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: (to Karl)
dialog: Well, you liked it, didn't you?
dialog: Monkey-flunki-punki.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Half the house! You'll never see a

speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: (dirty)
dialog: Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your

speaker_heading: CONSTANZE

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SCHLUMBERG HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY 1780'S
text: Dogs are barking wickedly. Michael Schlumberg comes in from
text: his salon. Mozart stands there looking very unwell and
text: bewildered. He is also drunk, but making a careful attempt
dialog: to keep his composure.
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What
dialog: can I do for you?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Is my pupil still anxious to learn
dialog: the art of music?
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: Well, your pupil is married and living
text: in Mannheim, young man.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Really? Perhaps your dear wife might
dialog: care to profit from my instruction?
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: What is this, Mozart? What's the
dialog: matter with you?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Well. Since it appears nobody is
dialog: eager to hire my services, could you
dialog: favour me with a little money instead?
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: Well, this is hardly the way to go
dialog: about it.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with
dialog: talent, and you with money. If I
dialog: offer mine, you should offer yours.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: I'm sorry. No.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Please. I'll give it back, I promise.
dialog: Please, sir.
speaker_heading: SCHLUMBERG
dialog: My answer is no, Mozart.

speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Please. Please. Please. Please.
dialog: Please. Please.

scene_heading: INT. THE IMPERIAL LIBRARY - DAY - 1790'S
text: Von Swieten and Salieri stand close together. Several scholars
text: and students are examining scrolls and manuscripts at the
text: other end of the room.
speaker_heading: VON SWIETEN
dialog: (keeping his voice
dialog: down)
dialog: This is embarrassing, you know. You
dialog: introduced Mozart to some of my
text: friends and he's begging from
dialog: practically all of them. It has to
dialog: stop.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: I agree, Baron.
speaker_heading: VON SWIETEN
dialog: Can't you think of anyone who might
dialog: commission some work from him? I've
dialog: done my best. I got him to arrange
dialog: some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He
dialog: got a fee - what I could afford.
dialog: Can't you think of anyone who might
dialog: do something for him?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is
dialog: a lost cause. He has managed to
dialog: alienate practically the whole of
text: Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He
dialog: never pays his debts. I can't think
dialog: of one person to whom I dare recommend
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: VON SWIETEN
dialog: How sad. It's tragic, isn't it?
dialog: Such a talent.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter
dialog: of fact I think I do know someone
dialog: who could commission a work from
dialog: him. A very appropriate person to do
dialog: so. Yes.

dialog: in.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE COSTUME SHOP - VIENNA - DAY - 1790'S
dialog: This is exactly the same shop which Mozart and Constanze
text: visited with Leopold. Now Salieri's servant stands in it,
text: waiting. We see a few other customers being served by the
text: staff: renting masks, costumes, etc. One of the staff emerges
text: from the back of the shop carrying a large box, which he
text: hands to Salieri's servant. The servant leaves the shop.
text: Through the window we see him hurrying away through the snowy
text: street full of passers-by, carriages, etc.
scene_heading: INT. SALIERI'S APARTMENT - DUSK - 1790'S
text: The D Minor Concerto continues. Salieri, alone, eagerly opens
text: the box from the costume shop and takes out the same dark
text: cloak and hat that Leopold wore to the masquerade, only now
text: attached to the hat is a dark mask whose mouth is cut into a
text: frown, not a laugh. It presents a bitter and menacing
text: expression. He puts on the cloak, the hat and the mask and
text: turns his back. Suddenly we see the assembled and alarming
text: image reflected in a full-length mirror. The music swells
text: darkly.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. A SNOWY STREET IN VIENNA - DUSK - 1790'S
text: As the tutti of the D Minor Concerto continues, we see

text: with people going to various festivities. Some of them wear
text: frivolous carnival clothes.
scene_heading: INT. MOZART'S LIVING ROOM - DUSK - 1790'S
text: Mozart sits writing at a table. He appears now to be really
text: quite sick. His face expresses pain from his stomach cramps.
text: There is a gentle knock at the door. He rises, goes to he
text: door and opens it. Immediately there is a SHOCK CUT:
text: The dark, frowning mask stares at him and at us. The violent
text: D Minor chord which opens Don Giovanni is heard. Salieri in
text: costume stands in the doorway.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Herr Mozart?
text: The second chord sounds and fades. Mozart stares in panic.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: I have come to commission work from
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: What work?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: A Mass for the dead.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: What dead? Who is dead?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: A man who deserved a Requiem Mass
dialog: and never got one.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: I am only a messenger. Do you accept?
dialog: You will be paid well.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: How much?
text: Salieri extends his hand. In it is a bag of money.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Fifty ducats. Another fifty when I
dialog: have the Mass. Do you accept?
text: Almost against his will, Mozart takes the money.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: How long will you give me?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Work fast. And be sure to tell no
dialog: one what you do. You will see me
dialog: again soon.
text: He turns away. Mozart closes the front door. Instantly we
text: hear the opening of the Requiem Mass (also in D Minor).
text: Mozart turns and looks up at the portrait of his father on
text: the wall. The portrait stares back. Constanze opens the door
text: from the bedroom. She sees him staring up.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Wolfi? Wolfi!
text: He looks at her with startled eyes. The music breaks off.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Who was that?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: No one.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: I heard voices.
text: He gives a strange little giggle.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: What's the matter?
text: She sees the bag of money.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: What's that? Oh!
dialog: (pouncing on it)
dialog: Who gave you this? How much is it?
dialog: Wolfi, who gave you this?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: I'm not telling you.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: You'd think I was mad.

scene_heading: INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 1823
text: Old Salieri is now wildly animated, totally driven by his
dialog: confession to Vogler.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: My plan was so simple, it terrified
dialog: me. First I must get the Death Mass
dialog: and then achieve the death.
text: Vogler stares at him in horror.
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: His funeral - imagine it! The
text: Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there.
text: His coffin, Mozart's little coffin
text: in the middle. And suddenly in that
text: silence, music. A divine music bursts
text: out over them all, a great Mass of
dialog: Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang
dialog: Mozart, composed by his devoted friend
dialog: Antonio Salieri. What sublimity!
dialog: What depth! What passion in the music!
dialog: Salieri has been touched by God at
dialog: last. And God, forced to listen.
dialog: Powerless - powerless to stop it. I
text: at the end, for once, laughing at
dialog: Him. Do you understand? Do you?
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: The only thing that worried me was
dialog: the actual killing. How does one do
dialog: that? How does one kill a man? It's
dialog: one thing to dream about it. It's
dialog: very different when you have to do
dialog: it, with your own hands.
text: He raises his own hands and stares at them. The raging Dies
text: Irae from Mozart's Requiem Mass bursts upon us.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S
text: Mozart sits working frantically at this demonic music. His
text: whole expression is one of wildness and engulfing fever. He
text: pours wine down his throat, spilling it, and grimaces as it
text: hits his stomach. All around him are manuscripts.
text: There is a banging at the front door. Mozart does not hear
text: it; the music raves on. Another knocking comes, louder.
text: Constanze appears from the bedroom and stares at her
text: distracted husband. The knocking is repeated again, even
text: more violently and insistently.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Wolfi. Wolfi!
text: He looks at her. The music breaks off. Silence. An enormous

speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: No. Don't answer it!
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Why?
text: Mozart springs up. He is clearly terrified.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Tell him I'm not here. Tell him I'm

dialog: Am I interrupting something?
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Not at all.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: (peering into he room)
dialog: Where's our friend?
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
text: He's not in. But he's working on it.
dialog: He said to tell you.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: I hope so. I need it immediately.
text: He pushes her into the room.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: Is he happy with it?
text: He sees he manuscript on the table, and goes to it eagerly.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: Is this it?
text: He picks up a page without waiting for a reply.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: What the devil is this? Requiem Mass?
dialog: Does he think I'm in the funeral
dialog: business?
text: Mozart opens he workroom door. We see him as Schikaneder
text: sees him: wild-eyed, extremely pale and strange.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Leave that alone!
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: Wolfi!
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Put it down!
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Put it down, I said! It's nothing
dialog: for you.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have
dialog: you got for me? Is it finished?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: What? The vaudeville, what'd you
dialog: think?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: Can I see it?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Because there's nothing to see.
text: He giggles triumphantly. Schikaneder stares at him.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: Look, I asked you if we could start
dialog: rehearsal next week and you said
dialog: yes.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Well, we can.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: So let me see it. Where is it?
text: Mozart, with a bright, rather demented smile presents his
dialog: head to Schikaneder.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Here. It's all right here, in my
text: noodle. The rest is just scribbling.
text: Scribbling and bibbling. Bibbling
dialog: and scribbling. Would you like a
dialog: drink?
text: He giggles. Schikaneder suddenly grabs his lapels.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: Look, you little clown, do you know
dialog: how many people I've hired for you?
dialog: Do you know how many people are
dialog: waiting?
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Leave him alone!
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: I'm paying these people. Do you
dialog: realize that?
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: He's doing his best.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: I'm paying people just to wait for
dialog: you. It's ridiculous!
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: You know what's ridiculous? Your
dialog: libretto, that's what's ridiculous.
dialog: Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to
dialog: work on that stuff!
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: Oh yes? And what's so intelligent
dialog: about writing a Requiem?
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Money! Money!
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked
dialog: for Kings. For the Emperor.
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Who are you?
text: Schikaneder suddenly takes Mozart by the arms, and speaks to
text: him with intense appeal.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: Listen, Wolfi. Write it. Please.
dialog: Just write it down. On paper. It's

dialog: fuck the Death Mass.

speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Why? What has happened?
speaker_heading: LORL
dialog: You don't know what it's like. Herr

speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: What medicine?
speaker_heading: LORL
dialog: I don't know. He has pains.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: LORL

speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Is he working?
speaker_heading: LORL
dialog: I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he
text: speaks, he doesn't make any sense.
dialog: You know he said he saw - he said he
dialog: saw his father. And his father's
dialog: dead.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Is he working?
speaker_heading: LORL
dialog: I suppose so. He sits there all he
dialog: time, doing some silly opera.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: (startled)
dialog: Opera? Opera!
speaker_heading: LORL
dialog: Please don't ask me to go back again.
dialog: I'm frightened! I'm very, very
dialog: frightened.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: (insistently)
dialog: Are you sure it's an opera?
text: The Overture to The Magic Flute begins grandly. To the music
dialog: of the slow introduction, we see:
scene_heading: INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S
text: The room, lit by a few candles, appears dirty. The camera
text: shows us again Leopold's portrait on the wall, looking down
text: upon a scene of disorder.
text: Papers litter the table; dirty dishes are piled in the
text: fireplace; on the forte-piano lies Mozart's Masonic apron,
text: woven with symbols. To the more lyrical passage of the
text: introduction, we see Mozart take up a candle and enter:
scene_heading: INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S
text: We watch him stand beside Constanze, who lies asleep. Mozart
text: now looks very ill; his wife appears worn out. Tenderly he
text: touches her hair. Then he moves to the cot where his son
text: Karl lies asleep and kneels, pulls up the child's little
text: blanket and for a moment lays his own head down beside the
text: boy's. Constanze opens her eyes and stares at him. Mozart
dialog: rises and returns to:
scene_heading: INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S
text: The Introduction ends and suddenly the brilliant fast fugue
text: begins. Instantly Mozart starts to dance to it, all alone:
text: gleefully, like a child. He looks up at his father's portrait,
text: and makes a silly, rude gesture at it. He is, briefly, an
text: irresponsible and happy boy again.
text: Then suddenly there is a gentle knocking at the door. The
text: music fades down. Warily, Mozart crosses and opens he door.
text: The familiar dark chords from Don Giovanni cut across the
text: happy music. It ends. Before him stands the masked stranger.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: I don't have it yet. It's not
dialog: finished. I'm sorry, but I need more
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Are you neglecting my request?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: No, no! I promise you, I'll give you
dialog: a wonderful piece - the best I ever
dialog: can!
text: He turns and looks. Constanze has come into the living room.
text: Nervously, Mozart indicates her.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been
dialog: sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't
dialog: I?
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And
dialog: he's working on it very hard.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Give me two more weeks. Please.
text: Salieri contemplates them both.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: The sooner you finish, the better
dialog: your reward. Work!
text: He turns and goes down the stairs. Mozart shuts the door; he
text: closes his eyes in fear.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Wolfi, I think you really are going
dialog: mad. You work like a slave for that
dialog: idiot actor who won't give you a
dialog: penny and here. This is not a ghost!
text: This is a real man who puts down
dialog: real money. Why on earth don't you
dialog: finish it?
text: He will not look at her or reply.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Give me one reason I can understand.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: I can't write it!
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: It's killing me.
text: He looks at her suddenly.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: No, this is really awful. You're
dialog: drunk, aren't you? Be honest - tell
dialog: me - you've been drinking. And I'm
dialog: so stupid I stay here and listen to
dialog: you!
text: Suddenly she starts to cry.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: It's not fair! I worry about you all
dialog: the time. I try to help you all I
dialog: can and you just drink and talk
dialog: nonsense and - and frighten me! It's
dialog: not fair!
text: Her tears flow. Mozart looks at her helplessly.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Go back to bed.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay
dialog: here with you. I promise I won't say
dialog: all word. I'll just be here, so you
dialog: know no one's going to hurt you.
dialog: Please, please!
text: She sits down tearfully, staring at him.
text: We hear the Rex Tremendai Majestatis from the Requiem and
text: see on the wall the portrait of Leopold Mozart looking down.
text: The camera pans slowly downward from it back to the table.
text: Mozart is writing the music. He looks up and sees that
text: Constanze is fast asleep in her chair. Mozart gets up quietly.
text: He puts on his hat and cloak, takes a bottle of wine and
text: tiptoes from the house. Without stopping, the music changes
text: from the heavy Requiem to the light-hearted patter of the
dialog: Papa-Papa duet from The Magic Flute.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SCHIKANEDER'S SUMMER HOUSE - NIGHT - 1790'S
text: This little wooden structure stands in a courtyard in the
text: tenement by the Weiden. Inside, we see a table, chairs, a
text: forte-piano, bottles and a chaos of papers. Strewn about in
text: the chairs are the three actresses, giggling. Schikaneder
text: and Mozart, both drunk, are singing the duet of the two bird-
text: people. The actor sings Papageno and the composer, in a
text: soprano voice, sings Papagena at the keyboard. Absurdly,
text: they end up rubbing noses and fall on each other's necks.
scene_heading: EXT. VIENNA STREET - NIGHT - 1790'S
text: Mozart, drunk and happy, staggers back through the snow.
text: There are a few people about. He goes into his apartment
dialog: building.
scene_heading: INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - DAY - 1790'S
text: He comes through he door and stares across the living room
text: at an open bedroom door. Puzzled, he crosses.
text: The bedroom is also empty. We see Constanze's empty bed;
text: Karl's empty bed; empty closets.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Stanzi? Stanzi-marini-bini?
text: He looks about him, puzzled.
scene_heading: INT. FRAU WEBER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY - 1790'S
text: Frau Weber sits grimly talking. Mozart sits also, completely
text: exhausted and passive under the rain of her constant speech.
speaker_heading: FRAU WEBER
dialog: She's not coming back, you know.
dialog: She's gone for good. I did it and
dialog: I'm proud of it. 'Leave,' I said.
dialog: 'Right away! Take he child and go,
dialog: just go. Here's the money! Go to the
dialog: Spa and get your health back - that's
dialog: if you can.' I was shocked. Shocked
dialog: to my foundation. Is that my girl?
dialog: Can that be my Stanzi? The happy
dialog: little moppet I brought up, that
dialog: poor trembling thing? Oh, you monster!
dialog: No one exists but you, do they? You
dialog: and your music! Do you know how often
dialog: she's sat in that very chair, weeping
text: her eyes out of her head because of
dialog: you? I warned her. 'Choose a man,
dialog: not a baby,' I said. But would she
dialog: listen? Who listens? 'He's just a
dialog: silly boy,' she says. Silly, my arse.
dialog: Selfish - that's all you are. Selfish!
dialog: Selfish, selfish, selfish, selfish,
dialog: selfish.
text: And with a scream Madame Weber's voice turns into the shrill
text: packing coloratura of the second act aria of the Queen of
dialog: the Night, in The Magic Flute.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. SCHIKANEDER'S THEATRE - NIGHT - 1790'S
text: On stage we see the QUEEN OF THE NIGHT fantastically costumed,
text: furiously urging her daughter to kill Sarastro. As she sings,
text: we see the interior of the theatre, now re-arranged from
dialog: when we last visited it to watch the Cabaret. An audience of
text: ordinary German citizens stands in the pit area, or sits:
text: they are rapt and excited.
text: The theatre also possesses boxes; some of these show closed
text: curtains - their inhabitants presumably engaged in private
text: intimacies. In one of them sits Salieri.
scene_heading: QUEEN OF THE NIGHT
dialog: (singing furiously)
dialog: A hellish wrath within my heart is
dialog: seething! Death and destruction Flame
dialog: around my throne! If not by thee
text: Sarastro's light be extinguished.
dialog: Then be thou mine own daughter never
dialog: more! Rejected be forever! So sundered
dialog: be forever All the bonds of kin and
dialog: blood! Hear! Hear! Hear God of
dialog: Vengeance! Hear thy Mother's vow!
text: Thunder and lightning. She disappears amidst tremendous

scene_heading: INT. STAGE, AUDITORIUM AND WINGS OF SCHIKANEDER'S THEATRE -
speaker_heading: NIGHT -1790'S
text: We CUT TO the scene immediately before Papageno's song, Ein
text: Madchen oder Weibchen. Papageno, played by Schikaneder,
text: dressed in his costume of feathers, is trying to get through
text: a mysterious door. A voice calls from within.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Go back!
text: Papageno recoils.
speaker_heading: PAPAGENO
dialog: Merciful Gods! If only I knew by
dialog: which door I came in.
dialog: (to audience)
dialog: Which was it? Was it this one? Come
dialog: on, tell me!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Go back!
text: Papageno recoils.
speaker_heading: PAPAGENO
dialog: Now, I can't go forward and I can't
dialog: go back. Oh, this is awful!
text: He weeps extravagantly.
text: In the pit, Mozart indicates to the first violinist to take
text: over as conductor. He slips from his place and goes stealthily
text: backstage. We follow him. Over the scene we hear Papageno
text: being addressed by the First Priest in stern tones.
speaker_heading: FIRST PRIEST
dialog: (on stage)
dialog: Man, thou hast deserved to wander
text: forever in the darkest chasms of the
dialog: earth. The gentle Gods have remitted
dialog: thy punishment, but yet thou shalt
dialog: never feel the Divine Content of the
dialog: consecrated ones.
speaker_heading: PAPAGENO
dialog: Oh well, I'm not alone in that. Just
dialog: give me a decent glass of wine -
dialog: that's divine content enough for me.
text: Laughter. An enormous goblet of wine appears out of the earth.
text: We follow Mozart into the wings. Actors and actresses stand
text: around in fantastic costumes. We see a flying chariot and
text: parts of a huge snake lying about. Also the scenery door of
text: a temple with the word 'Wisdom' inscribed on the pediment.
text: Mozart walks to where there stands a keyboard glockenspiel
text: with several manuals, and a musician waiting to play it.
text: Silently Mozart indicates that he wishes to play the
dialog: instrument himself.
text: On stage Schikaneder is being addressed haughtily by the
dialog: First Priest.
speaker_heading: FIRST PRIEST
dialog: Man, hast thou no other desire on
dialog: earth, but just to eat and drink?
speaker_heading: PAPAGENO
dialog: (Schikaneder)
dialog: Well!
text: Laughter from the audience.
speaker_heading: PAPAGENO
dialog: Well, actually I do have a rather
dialog: weird feeling in my heart. Perhaps
dialog: it's just indigestion. But you know,
dialog: I really would like - I really do
dialog: want - something even nicer than
dialog: food and drink. Now what on earth
dialog: could that be?
text: He stares at the audience and winks at them. They laugh.
text: Now Papageno's aria (Ein Madchen oder Weibchen) begins. It
text: is interpolated, as he pretends to play his magic bells,
text: with the glockenspiel actually being played off-stage by
text: Mozart. Schikaneder looks into the pit and does not see Mozart
text: conducting. He looks into the wings and realizes the situation
text: with amusement. He sings joyfully and the audience watches
text: entranced.
speaker_heading: ANDANTE
dialog: A sweetheart or a pretty little wife
text: is Papageno's wish. A willing,
dialog: billing, lovey dovey Would be My
dialog: most tasty little dish. Be my most

dialog: little dish!

dialog: Then that would be eating and drinking
dialog: I'd live like a Prince without

dialog: be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up
dialog: to heaven be flown!
text: At certain moments we see the stage from Salieri's point of
text: view: Schikaneder singing, then pretending to play; and then
text: we see Mozart playing the glockenspiel with great flourishes
text: in the wings. Then, suddenly, the actor mimes playing, and
text: no sound comes. He mimes again, but still nothing comes. He
text: looks offstage in anxiety; there is evidently some commotion.
text: People are looking down on the floor. The song comes to a
text: near-halt. Schikaneder stares. Then the comedian signals to
text: the deputy conductor to pick up the song and finish it. At
text: this moment Salieri gets up and hastily leaves his box.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WINGS OF SCHIKANEDER'S THEATRE - NIGHT - 1790'S
text: We see the actress playing Papagena, wearing an old tattered
text: cloak and about to tie a little painted cloth representing a
text: hideous old woman over her face. She is looking worriedly
text: down at Mozart, who is lying unconscious on the floor.
text: A few people around him are trying to revive him. One has
text: put a wet handkerchief around his temples. Another is holding
text: a small bottle of smelling salts. There are voices saying,
dialog: 'Doctor! Take him to a dressing room. Someone call a carriage.
text: Take him home.' Etc. Papagena is urged to go on stage by a
text: distracted stage manager. Suddenly we hear the voice of
dialog: Salieri.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: I'll take care of him.
text: He steps forward.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: I have a carriage. Excuse me.
text: The actors step back respectfully. He stoops and picks up
text: the frail composer in his arms. Mozart is quite limp and
text: Salieri has to fling his arms around his own neck. All this
text: is watched nervously by Schikaneder on stage whilst performing
text: his scene with Papagena as an ugly old woman.
speaker_heading: UGLY OLD WOMAN
dialog: Here I am, my angel.
speaker_heading: PAPAGENO
dialog: (appalled)
dialog: What? Who the devil are you?
speaker_heading: UGLY OLD WOMAN
dialog: I've taken pity on you, my angel. I
dialog: heard your wish.
speaker_heading: PAPAGENO
dialog: Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful.
dialog: Some people get all the luck.
text: Audience laughter. The actress raises the little painted
text: cloth with the ugly old face on it to show her own pretty
text: young one to the audience. More laughter.
speaker_heading: UGLY OLD WOMAN
dialog: Now you've got to promise me
dialog: faithfully you'll remain true to me
dialog: forever. Then you'll see how tenderly
dialog: your little birdie will love you.
speaker_heading: PAPAGENO
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: I can't wait.
speaker_heading: UGLY OLD WOMAN
dialog: Well, promise then.
speaker_heading: PAPAGENO
dialog: What do you mean - now?
speaker_heading: UGLY OLD WOMAN
dialog: Of course now. Right away, before I
dialog: get any older.
text: Laughter.
speaker_heading: PAPAGENO
dialog: Well, I don't know! I mean you're a
dialog: delicious, delightful, delectable
dialog: little bird, but don't you think you
dialog: might be just a little tough?
speaker_heading: UGLY OLD WOMAN
dialog: (amorously)
dialog: Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my

text: A waiting sedan chair. Mozart has recovered consciousness,

text: He starts to collapse again. Salieri helps him into the sedan.
text: The door is shut. The chair sets off and Salieri strides
text: beside it, through the mean street. A lantern with a candle
text: swings from the chair.
scene_heading: INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S
text: The door opens. Salieri enters carrying the lantern from the
text: sedan chair. He is followed by Mozart, carried in the arms
text: of one of the porters. The room is now really in complete
text: disarray. The table is piled high with music: the pages of
text: the Requiem lie amongst many empty wine bottles. The porter
dialog: carries Mozart into
scene_heading: INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S
text: This room is miserably neglected. The bed is unmade, clothes
text: lie about on the floor. A sock has been stuck into the broken
text: pane of one window.
text: The porter lays Mozart down on the bed as Salieri lights
text: candles from the lantern to reveal plates of half-eaten food
text: and other signs left by a man whose wife has departed. It is
text: obviously very cold. Another very small bed nearby belongs
text: to the child, Karl.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: (handing the porter
dialog: the lantern)
dialog: Thank you. Go.
text: The porter leaves the room. Mozart stirs.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: (vaguely singing)
dialog: Papa! Papa!
text: He opens his eyes and sees Salieri staring down at him. He
text: smiles.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Come now.
text: He helps him to sit up and takes off his coat and his shoes
text: and puts a coverlet around him.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Where is your wife?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Not here! She's not well, either.
dialog: She went to the Spa.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: You mean she's not coming back?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: You're so good to me. Truly. Thank
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: No, please.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: I mean to come to my opera. You are
dialog: the only colleague who did.
text: He struggles to loosen his cravat. Salieri does it for him.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: I would never miss anything that you
dialog: had written. You must know that.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: This is only a vaudeville.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The
dialog: grandest operone. I tell you, you
dialog: are the greatest composer known to
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Do you mean that?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: I have bad fancies. I don't sleep
dialog: well anymore. Then I drink too much,
dialog: and think stupid things.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Are you ill?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: The doctor thinks I am. But -
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: I'm too young to be so sick.
text: There is a violent knocking at the front door. Mozart starts
text: and looks around wildly.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Shall I answer it?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: No! No, it's him!
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: The man. He's here.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: What man?
text: The knocking increases in loudness, terrifying Mozart.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Tell him to go away. Tell him I'm
dialog: still working on it. Don't let him
dialog: in!
text: Salieri moves to the door.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some
dialog: money now. Tell him if he would,
dialog: that would help me finish it.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Finish what?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: He knows. He knows!
text: Salieri leaves the room.
scene_heading: INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S
text: Salieri goes to the front door and opens it to reveal
text: Schikaneder, who has obviously come straight from the theatre.
text: He still wears his bird make-up and under his street cloak,
text: his feathered costume is clearly seen. He has with him the
text: three actresses, also looking anxious and also in make-up as
text: the three attendants in The Magic Flute.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: Herr Salieri.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Yes, I am looking after him.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: Can we come in?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: But he's all right?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He
dialog: became dizzy, that's all. We should
dialog: let him rest.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: Well, tell him we were here, won't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: And say everything went wonderfully.
dialog: A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell
text: him the audience shouted his name a
dialog: hundred times.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Bene.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: I'll call tomorrow.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (to the actresses)
dialog: And congratulations to all of you.
dialog: It was superb.
speaker_heading: ACTRESSES
dialog: Thank you! Thank you, Excellency!
text: Schikaneder produces a bag of money.
speaker_heading: SCHIKANEDER
dialog: Oh, by the way, give him this. This
dialog: is his share. That should cheer him
dialog: up, eh?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all
dialog: now. It was perfection - truly!
speaker_heading: ACTRESSES
dialog: (delighted)
dialog: Goodnight, Your Excellency.
dialog: Goodnight!
text: They bob and curtsey. Schikaneder stares at Salieri, uneasily,
text: vaguely suspicious. Salieri smiles back at him and shuts the
text: door. He stays for a moment, thinking. He contemplates the
dialog: money.
scene_heading: INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S
text: Mozart is sitting up in bed, staring at the door. It opens.
text: Salieri returns. He holds in his hand the bag of money.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: What happened?
text: Salieri pours the coins out of the bag onto the coverlet.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: He said to give you this. And if you
dialog: finish the work by tomorrow night,
dialog: he will pay you another hundred
dialog: ducats.
text: Mozart looks at the coins astonished.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow
dialog: night? It's impossible! Did he say a
dialog: hundred?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Yes. Can I - could I help you, in
dialog: any way?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Would you? Actually, you could.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: My dear friend, it would be my
dialog: greatest pleasure.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: But you'd have to swear not to tell
dialog: a soul. I'm not allowed.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: You know, it's all here in my head.
text: It's just ready to be set down. But
dialog: when I'm dizzy like this my eyes
dialog: won't focus. I can't write.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Then, let us try together. I'd regard
dialog: it as such an honour. Tell me, what
dialog: is this work?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: A Mass. A Mass for the Dead.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. A SMALL DANCE HALL - BADEN - NIGHT - 1790'S
text: Trivial dance music is playing. Constanze is doing a waltz
text: with a young OFFICER in military uniform. At the moment we
text: see her, she stops abruptly, as if in panic.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: I want to go!
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: I want to go back to Vienna.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Now?
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: I feel wrong. I feel wrong being
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
text: (laying a hand on her
dialog: arm)
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S
text: Mozart is sitting up in bed, propped against pillows. The
text: coins lie on the coverlet; many candles burn in the necks of
text: bottles. Salieri, without coat or wig, is seated at an
text: improvised worktable. On it are blank sheets of music paper,
text: quills, and ink. Also the score of the Requiem Mass as so
text: far composed. Mozart is bright-eyed with a kind of fever.
text: Salieri is also possessed with an obviously feverish desire
text: to put down the notes as quickly as Mozart can dictate them.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Where did I stop?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: (consulting the
dialog: manuscript)
dialog: The end of the Recordare - Statuens
dialog: in parte dextra.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: So now the Confutatis. Confutatis
dialog: Maledictis. When the wicked are
text: confounded. Flammis acribus addictis.
dialog: How would you translate that?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
text: Consigned to flames of woe.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Do you believe in it?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MOZART
text: A fire which never dies. Burning one
dialog: forever?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Oh, yes.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Strange!
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Come. Let's begin.
text: He takes his pen.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Confutatis Maledictis.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: We ended in F Major?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MOZART
text: So now - A minor. Suddenly.
text: Salieri writes the key signature.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: The Fire.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: What time?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Common time.
dialog: Salieri writes this, and continues now to write as swiftly
text: and urgently as he can, at Mozart's dictation. He is obviously
text: highly expert at doing this and hardly hesitates. His speed,
dialog: however, can never be too fast for Mozart's impatient mind.
speaker_heading: MOZART
text: Start with the voices. Basses first.
dialog: Second beat of the first measure -
dialog: A.
dialog: (singing the note)
dialog: Con-fu-ta-tis.
dialog: (speaking)
dialog: Second measure, second beat.
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Ma-le-dic-tis.
dialog: (speaking)
dialog: G-sharp, of course.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Third measure, second beat starting
dialog: on E.
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.
dialog: (speaking)
dialog: And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-
dialog: dic-tis.
dialog: (speaking)
dialog: Do you have that?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Sing it back.
text: Salieri sings back the first six measures of the bass line.
text: After the first two measures a chorus of basses fades in on
text: the soundtrack and engulfs his voice. They stop.
speaker_heading: MOZART
text: Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of
dialog: the first measure - C.
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Con-fu-ta-tis.
dialog: (speaking)
dialog: Second measure, fourth beat on D.
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Ma-le-dic-tis.
dialog: (speaking)
dialog: All right?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Fourth measure, second beat - F.
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam-
dialog: mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.
text: His voice is lost on the last words, as tenors engulf it and
text: take over the soundtrack, singing their whole line from the
text: beginning, right to the end of the sixth measure where the
text: basses stopped, but he goes on mouthing the sounds with them.
text: Salieri writes feverishly. We see his pen jotting down the
text: notes as quickly as possible: the ink flicks onto the page.
text: The music stops again.
speaker_heading: MOZART
text: Now the orchestra. Second bassoon
text: and bass trombone with the basses.
text: Identical notes and rhythm.
text: (He hurriedly hums
dialog: the opening notes of
dialog: the bass vocal line)
dialog: The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: (labouring to keep up)
dialog: Please! Just one moment.
text: Mozart glares at him, irritated. His hands move impatiently.
text: Salieri scribbles frantically.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: It couldn't be simpler.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: (finishing)
dialog: First bassoon and tenor trombone -
dialog: what?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: With the tenors.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Also identical?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Exactly. The instruments to go with
text: the voices. Trumpets and timpani,
text: tonic and dominant.
text: He again hums the bass vocal line from the beginning,
text: conducting. On the soundtrack, we hear the second bassoon
text: and bass trombone play it with him and the first bassoon and
text: tenor trombone come in on top, playing the tenor vocal line.
text: We also hear the trumpets and timpani. The sound is bare and
text: grim. It stops at the end of the sixth measure. Salieri stops
dialog: writing.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: And that's all?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Oh no. Now for the Fire.
dialog: (he smiles)
text: Strings in unison - ostinato on all -
dialog: like this.
text: He sings the urgent first measure of the ostinato.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: (speaking)
dialog: Second measure on B.
text: He sings the second measure of the ostinato.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: (speaking)
dialog: Do you have me?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Show me.
text: Salieri sings the first two measures of the string ostinato.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: (excitedly)
dialog: Good, good - yes! Put it down. And
dialog: the next measures exactly the same,
text: rising and rising - C to D to E, up
dialog: to the dominant chord. Do you see?
text: As Salieri writes, Mozart sings the ostinato from the
text: beginning, but the unaccompanied strings overwhelm his voice
text: on the soundtrack, playing the first six bars of their
text: agitated accompaniment. They stop.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: That's wonderful!
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me.
dialog: Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down:
dialog: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum
dialog: benedictis. Call me among the blessed.
text: He is now sitting bolt upright, hushed and inspired.
speaker_heading: MOZART
text: C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds.
text: Altos on C. Sopranos above.
dialog: (singing the alto
dialog: part)
dialog: Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne-
dialog: dic-tis.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Yes, and on 'dictis'.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Yes!
text: He writes feverishly.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: And underneath, just violins -
text: arpeggio.
text: He sings the violin figure under the Voca Me (Bars 7,8,9).
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: (speaking)
dialog: The descending scale in eighth notes,
text: and then back suddenly to the fire
dialog: again.
text: He sings the ostinato phrase twice.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: (speaking)
dialog: And that's it. Do you have it?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: You go fast!
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: (urgently)
dialog: Do you have it?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Then let me hear it. All of it. The
dialog: whole thing from the beginning -
dialog: now!
text: The entire Confutatis bursts over the room, as Mozart snatches
text: the manuscript pages from Salieri and reads from it, singing.
text: Salieri sits looking on in wondering astonishment. The music
text: continues right through the following scenes, to the end of
dialog: the movement.
scene_heading: EXT. A COUNTRY ROAD - WINTER NIGHT - 1790'S
text: A carriage is driving fast through the night. Snow lies on
dialog: the countryside.
scene_heading: INT. THE CARRIAGE NIGHT - 1790'S
text: The carriage is filled with passengers. Among them Constanze
text: and Karl, her young son. They are sleepless and sway to the
text: motion of the vehicle.
scene_heading: INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S
text: Mozart lying in bed exhausted, but still dictating urgently.
text: We do not hear what he is saying to Salieri, who still sits
text: writing assiduously. Mozart is looking very sick: sweat is
text: pouring from his forehead.
scene_heading: EXT. A COUNTRY ROAD - WINTER NIGHT - 1790'S
text: The carriage, moving through the night, to the sound of the
dialog: music.
scene_heading: INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S
text: Mozart still dictating; Salieri still writing without stop.
scene_heading: EXT. VIENNA STREET - DAWN - 1790'S.
text: The carriage has arrived. Constanze and her son alight with
text: other passengers. Postillions attend to the horses. She takes
text: her boy's hand. It is a cold wintry dawn.
text: The music stutters to a close. End of the Confutatis.
scene_heading: INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Do you want to rest a bit?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: We'll stop for just a moment. Then
dialog: we'll do the Lacrimosa.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: I can keep going, I assure you.
dialog: Shall we try?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: Would you stay with me while I sleep
dialog: a little?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: I'm not leaving you.
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: I am so ashamed.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: MOZART
dialog: I was foolish. I thought you did not
dialog: care for my work - or me. Forgive
dialog: me. Forgive me!
text: Mozart closes his eyes. Salieri stares at him.
scene_heading: EXT. VIENNA STREET - WINTRY DAWN - 1790'S
text: Constanze and Karl approach along the cobbled street, hand
text: in hand toward their house. Snow lies in the street.
scene_heading: INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN - 1790'S
text: Mozart lies asleep in the bed, holding the last pages of the
text: manuscript. Salieri lies across from him on Karl's small bed
text: in his shirt sleeves and waistcoat. The child's bed is
text: obviously too small for him and he is forced in to a cramped
dialog: position.
scene_heading: EXT. MOZART'S APARTMENT HOUSE - DAWN - 1790'S
text: Constanze and Karl arrive at the door. They enter.
scene_heading: INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAWN - 1790'S
text: It is as disordered as before, save that the table, previously
text: littered with pages, is now completely bare. Constanze looks
text: at it with surprise and enters the bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN - 1790'S
text: Mozart is asleep in the bed. Salieri is dozing on the nearby
text: child's bed. The room is full of the trailing smoke from
text: guttering and guttered candles. Startled by Constanze's
text: entrance and her young son, Salieri scrambles up. As he does
text: so, he attempts to button his waistcoat, but does it ineptly,
text: so that the vestment becomes bunched up, making him look
dialog: absurd.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took
dialog: sick. I brought him home.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Why you?
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: I was at hand.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Well, thank you very much. You can
dialog: go now.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: He needs me, ma'am.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: No, he doesn't. And I don't want you
dialog: here. Just go, please.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: He asked me to stay.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: And I'm asking you -
text: She notices a movement from the bed. Mozart wakes. He sees
text: Constanze and smiles with real joy. Forgetting Salieri, she
text: goes to her husband.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Wolfi, I'm back. I'm still very angry
dialog: with you, but I missed you so much.
text: She throws herself on the bed.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: I'll never leave you again. If you'll
dialog: just try a little harder to be nice
dialog: to me. And I'll try to do better,
dialog: too. We must. We must! This was just
dialog: silly and stupid.
text: She hugs her husband desperately. He stares at her with
text: obvious relief, not able to speak. Suddenly she sees the
text: manuscript in his hand.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: What is this?
text: She looks at it and recognizes it.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Oh no, not this. Not this, Wolfi!
dialog: You're not to work on this ever again!
dialog: I've decided.
text: She takes it from his weak hand. At the same moment Salieri
text: reaches out his hand to take it and add it to the pile on
dialog: the table.
text: She stares at him, trying to understand - suspicious and
text: frightened and at the same time unable to make a sound. Mozart
text: makes a convulsive gesture to reclaim the pages. The coins
text: brought by Salieri fall on the floor. Karl runs after them,
text: laughing.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: (to Salieri)
dialog: This is not his handwriting.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: No. I was assisting him. He asked
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: He's not going to work on this
dialog: anymore. It is making him ill. Please.
text: She extends her hand for the Requiem, as she stands up.
text: Salieri hesitates.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: (hard)
dialog: Please.
text: With extreme reluctance - it costs him agony to do it -
text: Salieri hands over the score of the Requiem to her.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Thank you.
text: She marches with the manuscript over to a large chest in the
text: room, opens it, throws the manuscript inside, shuts the lid,
text: locks it and pockets the key. Involuntarily Salieri stretches
text: out his arms for the lost manuscript.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: But - but - but -
text: She turns and faces him.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Good night.
text: He stares at her, stunned.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: I regret we have no servants to show
dialog: you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my
dialog: wish and go.
speaker_heading: SALIERI
dialog: Madame, I will respect his. He asked
dialog: me to stay here.
text: They look at each other in mutual hatred. She turns to the
text: bed. Mozart appears to have gone to sleep again.
speaker_heading: CONSTANZE
dialog: Wolfi?
dialog: (louder)
dialog: Wolfi?
text: She moves to the bed. The child is playing with the coins on
text: the floor. Faintly we hear the start of the Lacrimosa from
text: the Requiem. Salieri watches as she touches her husband's
text: hand. As the music grows, we realize that Mozart is dead.
text: CU, Constanze staring wide-eyed in dawning apprehension.
text: CU, Salieri also comprehending hat he has been cheated.
text: The music rises.
text: CU, The child on the floor, playing with the money.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STEPHEN'S CATHEDRAL - VIENNA - A RAINY DAY - 1790'S
text: The Lacrimosa continues through all of the following: a small
text: group of people emerges from the side door into the raw, wet
text: day, accompanying a cheap wooden coffin. The coffin is borne
text: by a gravedigger and Schikaneder in mourning clothes. They
text: load it onto a cart, drawn by a poor black horse. All the
text: rest are in black, also: Salieri, Von Swieten, Constanze and
dialog: her son, Karl, Madame Weber and her youngest daughter Sophie,
text: and even Lorl, the maid. It is drizzling. The cart sets off.
text: The group follows.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE THE CITY WALLS OF VIENNA - RAINY DAY - 1790'S
text: The group has already passed beyond the city limits following
text: the miserable cart. The Lacrimosa accompanies them with its
dialog: measured thread.
text: The drizzle of rain has now become heavy. One by one, the
text: group breaks up and shelters under the trees. The cart moves
text: on toward the cemetery, alone, followed by nobody, growing
text: more and more distant. They watch it go.
text: Salieri and Von Swieten shake hands mournfully, the water
text: soaking their black tall hats. Schikaneder is in tears.
text: Constanze is near collapse. Salieri moves to assist her, but
text: she turns away from him, seeking the arm of Cavalieri. Madame
text: Weber takes Karl's hand.
text: The music builds to its climax on Dona Eis Pacem! We CUT
dialog: back to:
scene_heading: INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING - 1823
text: Morning light fills the room. Old Salieri sits weeping
text: convulsively, as the music stops. Tears stream down his face.
text: Vogler watches him, amazed.
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery
dialog: by confessing to murder? You didn't
dialog: kill him.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: No, you didn't!
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: I poisoned his life.
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: But not his body.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: What difference does that make?
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: My son, why should you want all Vienna
dialog: to believe you a murderer? Is that
dialog: your penance? Is it?
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: No, Father. From now on no one will
dialog: be able to speak of Mozart without
dialog: thinking of me. Whenever they say
dialog: Mozart with love, they'll have to
dialog: say Salieri with loathing. And that's
dialog: my immortality - at last! Our names
dialog: will be tied together for eternity -
dialog: his in fame and mine in infamy. At
dialog: least it's better than the total
dialog: oblivion he'd planned for me, your
dialog: merciful God!
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: Oh my son, my poor son!
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You
dialog: serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart,
dialog: not I. Took him, snatched him away,
dialog: without pity. He destroyed His beloved
dialog: rather than let a mediocrity like me
dialog: get the smallest share in his glory.
dialog: He doesn't care. Understand that.
dialog: God cares nothing for the man He
dialog: denies and nothing either for the
dialog: man He uses. He broke Mozart in half
dialog: when He'd finished with him, and
text: threw him away. Like an old, worn
text: out flute.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY OF ST. MARX - LATE AFTERNOON - 1790'S
text: The rain has eased off. A LOCAL PRIEST with two boy acolytes
text: is standing beside an open communal grave. Mozart's body is
text: lifted out of the cheap pine box in a sack.
text: We see that the grave contains twenty other such sacks. The
text: gravedigger throws the one containing Mozart amongst the
text: others. An assistant pours quicklime over the whole pile of
text: them. The acolytes swing their censers.
speaker_heading: LOCAL PRIEST
dialog: The Lord giveth. The Lord taketh
dialog: away. Blessed be the name of the
dialog: Lord.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING - 1823
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: Why did He do it? Why didn't He kill
dialog: me? I had no value. What was the
dialog: use, keeping me alive for thirty-two
dialog: years of torture? Thirty-two years
dialog: of honours and awards.
text: He tears off the Civilian Medal and Chain with which the
dialog: Emperor invested him and has been wearing the whole time and
text: throws it across the room.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
text: Being bowed to and saluted, called
dialog: 'distinguished - distinguished
dialog: Salieri' - by men incapable of
dialog: distinguishing! Thirty-two years of
dialog: meaningless fame to end up alone in
dialog: my room, watching myself become
dialog: extinct. My music growing fainter,
text: all the time fainter, until no one
dialog: plays it at all. And his growing
text: louder, filling the world with wonder.
dialog: And everyone who loves my sacred art
dialog: crying, Mozart! Bless you, Mozart.
text: The door opens. An attendant comes in, cheerful and hearty.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: Good morning, Professor! Time for
dialog: the water closet. And then we've got
dialog: your favourite breakfast for you -
dialog: sugar-rolls.
dialog: (to Vogler)
dialog: He loves those. Fresh sugar-rolls.
text: Salieri ignores him and stares only at the priest, who stares
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: Goodbye, Father. I'll speak for you.
dialog: I speak for all mediocrities in the
dialog: world. I am their champion. I am
dialog: their patron saint. On their behalf
dialog: I deny Him, your God of no mercy.
dialog: Your God who tortures men with
dialog: longings they can never fulfill. He
dialog: may forgive me: I shall never forgive
dialog: Him.
text: He signs to the attendant, who wheels him in his chair out
text: of the room. The priest stares after him.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR OF THE HOSPITAL - MORNING
text: The corridor is filled with patients in white linen smocks,
text: all taking their morning exercise walk in the care of nurses
text: and nuns. They form a long, wretched, strange procession -
text: some of them are clearly very disturbed. As Old Salieri is
text: pushed through them in his wheelchair, he lifts his hands to
dialog: them in benediction.
speaker_heading: OLD SALIERI
dialog: Mediocrities everywhere, now and to
dialog: come: I absolve you all! Amen! Amen!
dialog: Amen!
