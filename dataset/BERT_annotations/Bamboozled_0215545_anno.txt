text: All eyes are on Delacroix and he feels it.

speaker_heading: DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
dialog: Question?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: So what do you want us to do?
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: What I want everyone to do is write
text: some material that is FUNNY. The
dialog: junk you've been writing is about
dialog: as funny as a dead baby. It's not

speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: Nobody told me anything.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX

dialog: or dance.
text: They both laugh.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: Let's sit down over there.

speaker_heading: DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry about my blowup but I
dialog: have to have a whipping boy every
dialog: meeting.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: I understand. But again, in all
dialog: honesty I was not informed.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: Forget it. I believe you're my
dialog: most creative person I've got on
dialog: staff. You're hip. You know
dialog: what's happening. I got some corny
dialog: white boys and girls writing for me.
text: Delacroix doesn't join him in his laughter because he
text: doesn't know how to take that comment or where Dunwitty is
text: headed with it.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
dialog: I understand Black culture. I grew
dialog: up around black people all my life.
dialog: If the truth be told I probably
dialog: know "niggers" better than you,
dialog: Monsieur Delacroix. Please don't
dialog: get offended by my use of the
dialog: quote-unquote N word. I got a
dialog: black wife and three bi-racial
dialog: children, so I feel I have a right
dialog: to use that word. I don't give a
dialog: damn what Spike says, Tarantino is
dialog: right. Nigger is just a word. If
dialog: Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every
dialog: other word so can I.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: I would prefer you not use that
dialog: word in my presence.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY

speaker_heading: CLOSE ON

speaker_heading: CLOSE ON
dialog: Delacroix.
text: He straightens his tie.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX (CONT'D)
dialog: Who's a nigger now?
text: POW. This is a fantasy in Delacroix's mind. We go BACK TO
dialog: REALITY. Everything's how we left it.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: The material you've been creating
dialog: is too white bread. White people
text: with black faces. The Huxtable's,
dialog: Cosby, revolutionary. But that's
dialog: dead. We can't go down that road
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: I don't agree. The Negro middle
dialog: class does exist, and it's rich
dialog: material for a dramatic series or
dialog: sitcom.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: I'm telling you it's not.
text: He goes to his desk, picks up Delacroix's scripts and starts
text: throwing them one by one against the window.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
text: The middle class black family moves
text: into a white suburban enclave. The
dialog: middle class black family moves
text: into a small Southern town that is

dialog: single black father raises his
text: teenage daughter. The middle class
dialog: single black father raises his
text: teenage daughter. The middle class
dialog: single black mother raises her

dialog: forth. It's too clean, too
dialog: antiseptic...
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: ...to white? I still feel all of
dialog: my scripts would make good shows.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: Delacroix, wake up, brother man.
dialog: The reason why they didn't get
dialog: picked up was because nobody - and
dialog: I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers
dialog: alike wants to see that junk.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: I've never been given a fair shot.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: You got your head stuck up your ass
dialog: with your Harvard education and
dialog: your pretentious ways. Brother
dialog: man, I'm blacker than you. I'm
dialog: keepin' it real and you're frontin',
text: trying to be white.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: I'm an oreo, a sell out? Because I
dialog: don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM
scene_heading: OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF
scene_heading: DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as
dialog: you might put it, some "nigger"
dialog: show? I'm a Tom? I'm whiter than
dialog: white and you're blacker than black?
dialog: Is that what you think?
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: That's exactly what I think. I
dialog: want you to create something that
dialog: people want to see. Let's be
dialog: honest, the majority of the people
dialog: in the country are deaf, dumb and
dialog: blind and I'm including 35 million
dialog: African-Americans. You know and I
dialog: know "niggers" set the trend, set
dialog: the styles. This is a golden
dialog: opportunity now. These idiots have
dialog: to be led to the water.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: I'm not sure if I can deliver what
dialog: you want.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: You will or you'll be back at BET
dialog: so quick you'll never know what hit
dialog: you. I need a mid-season
dialog: replacement and pronto. It will be
text: on the fast track.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: What is it you want from me? Some
dialog: plantation follies? Some sitcom
text: that takes place on a watermelon
dialog: patch? Some show that follows four
dialog: nigger generations of junkies and
dialog: crackheads? You want me to go back
dialog: to the ante bellum days?
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: Yes! Yes! Yes! I want a show
dialog: that will make headlines, that will
dialog: have millions and millions of
text: households tuned in, glued to their

speaker_heading: MANRAY
dialog: I'm sure that was the only thing he

speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: If that was suppose to be a

speaker_heading: MANRAY

speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: Why do you say that? You've never

speaker_heading: BIG BLACK

speaker_heading: SLOAN

speaker_heading: BIG BLACK
dialog: Yeah, him.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: What makes you think he would write
dialog: a show about the Mau-Mau's.
speaker_heading: BIG BLACK
dialog: C'mon, why not? The Monkees had a
dialog: show. Look at all that other junk
dialog: that's on TV. We got underground

dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: You don't have the demographics.
speaker_heading: BIG BLACK
dialog: So are you telling me that you
dialog: wouldn't even introduce me to

speaker_heading: BIG BLACK
dialog: There is a name, a term for your

dialog: classified as a house nigga.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: If you think I'm a house nigga then
dialog: that's your prerogative. You got

dialog: You know my assistant, Sloan.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: This is Cheeba.
speaker_heading: CHEEBA
dialog: Nice to meet you.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: And this is Manray.
speaker_heading: MANRAY
dialog: How do you do?
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: Good. I like the names. Very
dialog: theatrical.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: We're all happy to be here and I'm
dialog: going to paint a picture for you.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: I'm wid it.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: I've done a lot of soul searching
dialog: and once again you are right. In
dialog: my previous work it's been all
dialog: surface, superficial. I have never
dialog: really dug deep. Not anymore. As
dialog: Mark Twain fully understood satire
dialog: is the way. Race has always been a
dialog: hot button in this country's
dialog: history and it needs to be pushed
dialog: harder. If we are ever to live
text: side by side in peace and harmony.
dialog: It's about promoting racial healing.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: Go on. Good so far.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: I know you're familiar with minstrel
dialog: shows. They came about at the turn
dialog: of the 19th century. It was a
dialog: variety show in which the talent
text: was in blackface - singing, dancing,
text: telling jokes, doing skits.
dialog: Dunwitty, I ask you when was the
dialog: last time there was a good variety
dialog: show on the air. Carol Burnett?
dialog: HeeHaw?
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: Word!!!
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: So let's take this great form, this
dialog: very American tradition of
dialog: entertainment into the 21st century,
dialog: into the new millennium.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: The name of the show?
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
scene_heading: It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW
scene_heading: MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: I'm lovin' it. You know how I know?
dialog: Because I'm getting a boner, my
dialog: Johnson is hard, no disrespect my
dialog: sister.
text: Dunwitty starts walking around his office, pumping his first.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm feelin' dis'!
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: It will take a lot of courage and
dialog: backbone on the part of the CNS to
dialog: get this on the air. In fact, I
dialog: would understand fully if the
dialog: subject matter is deemed too
dialog: risque, too controversial.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: Don't worry about that, that's my
dialog: department. Now who do we cast?
dialog: We need a star. Can Whoopi sing or
dialog: dance?
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: I don't know if Whoopi is the way
dialog: to go.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: Are these our two stars, sitting
dialog: here in front of my nose? Which
dialog: one is Mantan again?
speaker_heading: MANTAN
dialog: That's me.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: And Cheeba is Sleep 'n' Eat.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON
text: Cheeba. A look of surprise is on his face. Complete, utter
dialog: surprise.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: That's a great handle.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat. Two real
dialog: coons. I know we're way out there
dialog: but it's satire.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: I want you take it there. All the
text: way to the edge and back.
text: Sloan looks at Delacroix with concern.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: Every week we follow the trials and
text: tribulations of two real coons -
dialog: Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat. The Dusky
dialog: Duo.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: What are there character traits?
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
text: Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and
dialog: unlucky.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: Exactly!
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
text: Mantan is an uneducated Negro who
dialog: always by some stroke of
dialog: unbelievable stupidity makes his
text: best laid plans go haywire.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical
dialog: sidekick?
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: Yep, you guessed it.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: This could be bigger than "Amos and
dialog: Andy."
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: Protest finally forced "Amos and
dialog: Andy" off the air. Could stop us
dialog: from ever getting on.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: Let'em try. I will kill to make
dialog: this happen.
text: Delacroix looks at Sloan.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
text: Negroes would be in an uproar.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: So what. We would just give the
dialog: NAACP a donation that would be the
dialog: end of that. No such thing as bad
dialog: publicity. So what. Earlier you
dialog: said singing and dancing.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: Mantan right here is a gifted
text: hoofer. He has educated feet.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: Who are the other characters?
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: Do we have characters? How about
dialog: Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus,
dialog: Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny,
dialog: and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.
text: Dunwitty is dying with laughter. He's the only one.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY
dialog: on dis' one. What's the setting?
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: In the projects. Like Eddie
dialog: Murphy's "The PJ's."
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: Ya first bad move. Projects been
dialog: done. That's one of the problems
dialog: now, everything, movies, TV, are
text: set in the urban jungle, da hood.
dialog: That's so tired. Mantan's
dialog: Millennium Minstrel Show should be
text: set on a plantation. In Alabama.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
dialog: And every week these Alabama porch
dialog: monkeys will make us cry, make us
dialog: laugh, make us look at our own
dialog: humanity. Make us feel good to be
dialog: alive.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: I don't know about that plantation
dialog: angle.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: What are you talkin' 'bout? It's
dialog: the move. Stay wid me now. We're
dialog: movin' fast. What does everybody
dialog: else think about this?
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: We'd get a lot of mail.
text: She laughs, it's a fake one at that.
speaker_heading: SLOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. Dunwitty, there wouldn't be
dialog: another show like it.
speaker_heading: CHEEBA
dialog: I've always wanted to be on
dialog: television.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: I like you. Sleep 'n Eat. That's
dialog: funny. Mantan, how do you feel
dialog: about performing in black face?
speaker_heading: MANTAN
dialog: As long as the hoofing is real,
dialog: that I can do my thing, I can
dialog: blacken up. Let me hit it, beats
dialog: and rhythms, express myself.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: Show me a little somethin' somethin'.

speaker_heading: MANTAN
dialog: I'm gonna give you just a taste.
dialog: My tap shoes are brand new. I
dialog: haven't trained 'em yet.
text: He starts to work out.
speaker_heading: MANTAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Rhythms, rhythms, rhythms. Beats,
dialog: beats, beats. No Fred Astaire
dialog: here, baby. Just rawness.
text: Dunwitty clears his desk of everything, just knocks stuff
text: flying onto the floor. And Mantan taking the cue, jumps up
text: on his desk and really starts hitting it.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON
text: Delacroix, as he watches his creation, it's not a happy face.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON

dialog: We think so.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?
speaker_heading: CHEEBA
dialog: I play the straight man. I do some
dialog: singing and dancing also. I also
dialog: manage Mantan.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: Oh you do so?
speaker_heading: CHEEBA
dialog: I'm the man behind the man behind

dialog: You da man.

speaker_heading: CHEEBA
dialog: No, you da man.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: I'm gonna run upstairs with this.
dialog: If CNS doesn't want to do this,

speaker_heading: SMOOTH BLACK

scene_heading: BLACK: B-L-A-K, not B-L-A-C-K.
speaker_heading: HARD BLACK
dialog: I feel dat.
speaker_heading: 1/16TH BLACK
scene_heading: B-L-A-K. BLAK. The darkest of all

scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - NIGHT
text: A middle-aged African-American woman is working in the

text: Orchid puts a plate of food in front of her son.
speaker_heading: ORCHID
dialog: You must think I'm some kind of fool.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: It looks delicious.
speaker_heading: ORCHID
dialog: You hear me talkin' to you. The
dialog: only time you come up here when
dialog: something is wrong.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that
dialog: I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
speaker_heading: ORCHID
dialog: I said no such thing. All I said
dialog: is that something must be wrong.
text: She sits down with him.
speaker_heading: ORCHID (CONT'D)
dialog: How's the food?
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: Can't beat it with a hammer. Well,
dialog: since you asked, it looks like I
dialog: may have a new show, a pilot being
dialog: shot.
speaker_heading: ORCHID
dialog: That's wonderful. Isn't that what
dialog: you always wanted, a show of your
dialog: own?
text: He talks between mouthfuls.
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: It was. It is. But this is a
dialog: different kind of show.
speaker_heading: ORCHID
dialog: If at first it's not what you want,
dialog: just work that much harder, Peerless.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: Mommy, please don't call me that.
speaker_heading: ORCHID
dialog: Son, Peerless is your name. Now
dialog: you might be one of these Hollywood
dialog: types, change your name and all
dialog: that but Peerless Dothan is on your
dialog: birth certificate.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: I know what's on my birth
dialog: certificate. You heard from Daddy?
speaker_heading: ORCHID
text: I guess he's still on the road.
dialog: What kind of show is this? Are
dialog: they some Negroes in it without
dialog: being buffoons?
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: To answer your question, there are
dialog: a lot of Negroes in it and what is
dialog: your definition of buffoons?
speaker_heading: ORCHID
dialog: Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon.
dialog: We have enough of those on
dialog: television already.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: Please let me know when you hear
dialog: from Daddy, get a number or
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: ORCHID
dialog: I will. And good luck with your

scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: I feel like somebody hit me upside

speaker_heading: CHEEBA
dialog: DeLa - what's the matter with you.
speaker_heading: MANTAN
dialog: You ain't happy about the green

speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: People show their happiness in a
dialog: lot of different ways.
speaker_heading: MANTAN
dialog: Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a
dialog: funeral.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: I'm happy for all of us. It's just
dialog: we have a great responsibility now.
text: The pressure is on.
speaker_heading: MANTAN
dialog: Pressure? DeLa, you don't know
dialog: what the hell real pressure is.
text: SHEEETT!!! This is lightstuff.
dialog: Now when you scramblin' out on the
dialog: street in da January winter and the
dialog: hawk is talkin' to you with NO
dialog: money and NO prospects of money
dialog: anytime soon, now that there is
dialog: some pressure.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: I didn't mean it to sound like that.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: MANTAN
dialog: That's the way it came out. Let me
dialog: ask you one question. Have you
dialog: ever been in want, in need your
dialog: entire privileged life?
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: Now I'm privileged?! Why? Because
dialog: I didn't grow up on food stamps and
dialog: welfare? Because I didn't call
dialog: home a cardboard box? No, I never
dialog: ever went to bed hungry and I'm
dialog: proud of it, too. Whoever told you
dialog: that living in poverty earns you
dialog: somekind of badge of honor flat out
dialog: lied to you.
speaker_heading: MANTAN
dialog: The point I'm trying to make is
dialog: that this is a blessing. It's
dialog: going to be fun doing this show and
dialog: we should all look at it that way.
text: Delacroix gets up from the table and leaves.
speaker_heading: CHEEBA
dialog: What's wrong with him?
speaker_heading: MANTAN
dialog: Must be the pressure.
text: Cheeba and Mantan laugh, give each other some dap. A highly
text: attractive PUERTO RICAN female walks over to their table.
scene_heading: This is JESSICA GRILLO.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Sorry I'm late.
text: Cheeba and Mantan are in awe.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: Hey, girl. This is my best friend,

dialog: to celebrate with us.
speaker_heading: CHEEBA
dialog: I'm Cheeba.
speaker_heading: MANTAN
dialog: I'm Mantan.
text: They both rise.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: CHEEBA
dialog: Please, have a seat.
speaker_heading: MANTAN
dialog: Sloan never told us she had friends

speaker_heading: CHEEBA
dialog: In fact, we never knew she had any
dialog: friends period.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: Later for you.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: She has a lot of friends
speaker_heading: CHEEBA
dialog: Male?
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MANTAN
dialog: A lot?
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: Enough.
text: Sloan and Jessica laugh at the expense of these guys.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: I propose a toast.
text: She grabs an empty glass and pours herself some champagne.
speaker_heading: JESSICA (CONT'D)
dialog: To the success of your show. Good
dialog: luck.
text: Everyone raises their glasses. CLINK!
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: Excuse me.
text: Sloan gets up from the table and takes after Delacroix.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: Steps. Sloan catches up with Delacroix at the rest room area.
speaker_heading: SLOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait here.
dialog: 43.

speaker_heading: CLOSE ON
text: Delacroix. He leans against the wall.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON

scene_heading: INT. LADIES' ROOM - NIGHT
text: Sloan locks the door.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: What is your problem?
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: My problem is MANTAN THE NEW
scene_heading: MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: Why did you even come up with that
dialog: shit if you didn't want it made?
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: It was the principle. Dunwitty had
dialog: to be enlightened. I was making a
dialog: point. I take pride in my work.
dialog: Plus, I already told you I wasn't
dialog: gonna walk away from my money.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: Fuck da money. Why do through all
dialog: this effort? Why? Are you looking
dialog: for love from Dunwitty? For
dialog: respect? Dunwitty and his likes
dialog: don't give a goddamn about you. So
dialog: now what are you gonna do?
text: Someone begins to pound on the bathroom door.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Will you please let me in? I have
dialog: to use the toilet.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: You're gonna have to hold it in
dialog: because we're not finished yet...
text: She returns her attention to Delacroix.
speaker_heading: SLOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: ...QUIT then.
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: Even if money wasn't an issue,
dialog: Dunwitty will still go ahead
dialog: without me and that could be more
dialog: dangerous.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: What's the chances of MANTAN being
dialog: picked up?
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: I wouldn't bet against it. My
text: Negroidal ass is stuck between the
dialog: proverbial rock and a hard place.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: Like I said, all this for some
text: twisted, distorted sense of
dialog: principal. Dunwitty, he just
dialog: tolerates your Negroidal ass, he
dialog: doesn't respect it.
text: The banging starts again.
speaker_heading: MANAGER'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Please open this bathroom door
dialog: immediately. You are being very
dialog: inconsiderate.
text: Sloan unlocks the door and they exit.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: Ladies' bathroom. Sloan and Delacroix file past the strange
text: looks of the manager and FIVE WOMEN waiting to use the
text: bathroom as they rush in.
scene_heading: INT. DUNWITTY'S OFFICE - MORNING
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: I strongly feel that a Negro should
dialog: direct this. This kind of satire
text: is a high wire act in a gale storm.
dialog: One misstep and we're doing "Amos
dialog: and Andy." Only a Negro will have
dialog: the sensitivity and cultural
dialog: awareness to navigate this dangerous
dialog: terrain.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: To hire someone solely on their
dialog: ethnicity, gender or religion is
dialog: not right. It's un-American. I
dialog: will hire someone who is most
dialog: qualified for this particular job.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: I was hoping to perhaps direct some
dialog: episodes myself, if not the pilot
text: soon after.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: I want a hot, young white director.
dialog: Maybe the kid, that pheenom who
dialog: just did that hot new sexy Madonna
dialog: video.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: You're telling me some white boy is
dialog: gonna direct this pilot?
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: I just want you to meet him. Keep
text: an open mind.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: Besides, what does he know about
dialog: Negroes?
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: Probably nuthin', but that's why
dialog: it's such a sexy way to go.
dialog: Sometimes an outsider has a fresh
dialog: new outlook, a different unique
dialog: perspective. A black director,
dialog: y'know what he's gonna do given the
dialog: subject matter? With this kid, the
dialog: possibilities are endless.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: What are his qualifications besides
dialog: being a white male and directing a
dialog: hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: If Spielburg can direct "The Color
dialog: Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid
dialog: can direct the Mantan pilot.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: That's exactly my point. Has he
dialog: even directed actors before in
dialog: anything?
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: No!!! Just meet the guy. That's
dialog: all I'm asking. Look, I'll even
dialog: let you choose your own musical
dialog: director. You can have that.
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: In the immortal words of Derrick
text: Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: Derrick Coleman, he possessed all
dialog: the talent in the world, coulda,
dialog: shoulda, been a great ballplayer
dialog: but alas D.C. didn't want it bad
dialog: enough. Delacroix, do you want it?
dialog: Bad enough to kill for it? Do you
dialog: want it that much.
text: Delacroix stares at Dunwitty.
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NEXT DAY
text: Delacroix, followed by Sloan, enters the room full of writers.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON
speaker_heading: Delacroix
text: He surveys the room.
scene_heading: P.O.V. - DELACROIX
text: All of the writers are Caucasian - male and female. Every

speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: Conference room. Delacroix and Sloan sit down at the head
text: of the long oval table.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: Good morning, for those of you who
dialog: don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix.
dialog: I'm running things and this here is
dialog: my assistant Sloan Hopkins.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: I've never worked with any of you
dialog: and you've never worked with me so
dialog: we'll be starting from scratch.
dialog: I'm a fair person, a straight
dialog: shooter and I don't hold my tongue.
dialog: Everybody up in here should know I
dialog: had nothing to do with you being
dialog: hired.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX (CONT'D)
dialog: I would have preferred at least one
dialog: other Negro writer. Any questions?
dialog: Comments?
text: MONA raises her hand.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes, your name?
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: He, I'm Mona.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: Hi, Mona.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: I perfectly understand where you're
dialog: coming from. As a minority I can
dialog: relate to your struggle also. But
dialog: I think you should give us all a
dialog: chance. We want this pilot to be
dialog: successful just as much as you.
dialog: Please don't be so quick to judge
dialog: us based only on our whiteness.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: Oh, is that what I'm doing?
text: BETH jumps in.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I think because of our background
dialog: we can bring a unique perspective
dialog: to Mantan.
text: SETH pipes in also.
speaker_heading: SETH
text: A fresh pair of eyes. A new look,
dialog: insight, new angle that hasn't been
dialog: seen before.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: I've heard this somewhere before.
text: David raises his hand.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: My name is David. I do think it
dialog: would be better to have some
dialog: African-American writers but for
dialog: whatever reason they are not here.
dialog: I don't know if they couldn't find
dialog: any people with experience, they
dialog: wouldn't work for the pay or
dialog: refused to work for the show. I
dialog: don't know and nobody in this room
dialog: probably knows either. I'm looking
dialog: at this as a unique opportunity.
dialog: We all should. I'm a damn good
dialog: writer and I'm ready to go to work.
text: Everyone in the room applauds. Sloan looks at Delacroix.
speaker_heading: FREEZE FRAME
speaker_heading: DELACROIX (V.O.)
dialog: This thing was rigged, the deck was
dialog: stacked, the fix was in. Could Don
dialog: King be near? Good thing Sloan had
dialog: my back. She's my rock. This was
dialog: going to be a whole lot of work.
speaker_heading: UN-FREEZE FRAME
speaker_heading: DELACROIX (CONT'D)
dialog: David, I appreciate your comments.
dialog: Anybody got an ideas? Everybody
dialog: just talk out loud.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: I've always liked the format of
text: Rowan and Martin's "LAUGH-IN."
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: That could be cool.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: What about something like "The
dialog: Jeffersons?" I grew up in Idaho so
dialog: that's how I got my understanding
dialog: of black people. Through Sherman
dialog: Helmsley, LOUISSEE!!!.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: "Good Times" was better. Kid Dy-no
dialog: mite!!!
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: You pole are going to far back for
dialog: me. I think we have to go after a
dialog: hipper feel. Like the stuff Eddie
dialog: Murphy used to do on "Saturday
dialog: Night Live."
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Or Martin. You go girl.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What about the black exploitation
dialog: films? No one has ever tried
dialog: making that work on TV.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And for reason. Have you ever seen
dialog: "Scream Blacula, Scream?"
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: I think, and Delacroix will agree
dialog: with me, the politics of this show
dialog: have to be right. We should always
dialog: be laughing with our characters,
text: not at them.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON
text: Delacroix, as the writers continue to ramble on, he lets
text: them jerk off.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX (V.O.)
dialog: The mission was accomplished. All
dialog: of these people left the room
dialog: thinking they would have real input.
dialog: I was writing this pilot alone,
dialog: myself, me.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: A long line reaches down the block and around the corner.
text: It's a "cattle call," open auditions for "Mantan."
speaker_heading: DELACROIX (V.O.)
dialog: Now came the fun part, finding the
dialog: talented performers to cast in the
dialog: show.
text: WE DOLLY past the hundreds and hundreds of unemployed

scene_heading: INT. REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY
text: Delacroix sits in the first row with Sloan, RUTH, an African
text: American casting director. LEVI, the musical director, also
text: black, is on the stage at the piano.
speaker_heading: AUDITION MONTAGE
text: WE SEE singers, magicians, dancers, acrobats, comedians,
dialog: rappers. Some good, most are terrible. Many come out on
text: stage dressed like mammies, Stepin' Fetchit, slaves, pimps,
text: ho's, hustlers, and basketball players. It is a cavalcade
dialog: of all the stereotypical roles one has seen.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: Space. LULU, a spoken word artist, goes her rendition of
text: "WAY DOWN ON THE SWANEE RIVER."
speaker_heading: DELACROIX (V.O.)

dialog: were looking for? The same old
dialog: image, it damn for sure wasn't me.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON

speaker_heading: DELACROIX (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: LULU

speaker_heading: DELACROIX (O.S.)

speaker_heading: JUKKA

speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: Nice to meet you. If you don't

speaker_heading: JUKKA

speaker_heading: DUNWITTY

speaker_heading: DELACROIX

scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE

speaker_heading: DELACROIX

dialog: I'M A NEGRO!!!
speaker_heading: JUKKA

speaker_heading: DELACROIX

speaker_heading: JUKKA

speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: How did you get this gig?
speaker_heading: JUKKA
dialog: My visual style is very erotic,
dialog: sexy, how do you say - hot?
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
text: This is a TV show, not a music video.
speaker_heading: JUKKA

speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: Why are you here?
speaker_heading: MYRNA
dialog: Good question, straight to the

speaker_heading: DUNWITTY
dialog: Myrna is here to help us plan our

speaker_heading: MYRNA
dialog: The best defense is offense.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: I thought it was the other way
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: MYRNA
dialog: You get my point. I've mapped out
dialog: some strategies to help bolster our

speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: Which is?
speaker_heading: MYRNA
dialog: That this is fun. Nice wholesome
dialog: fun.
speaker_heading: DUNWITTY

dialog: Let the audience decide. Three.
dialog: Who put these critics in charge?
dialog: These so-called cultural police?
dialog: Four. Who determines what is black?

speaker_heading: DELACROIX

speaker_heading: MYRNA

speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: I thought it was appropiate.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: Is that good or bad?
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: It's all good. You got a hit show,
dialog: you're gonna need a bank. Plus, I
dialog: love these old black collectibles.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: How so?
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: To me, it shows part of our history

speaker_heading: GARY BYRD
dialog: Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix.
dialog: He is the creator of the highly
text: controversial TV show MANTAN.
dialog: Let's get right into it. You have
dialog: been called by some in the community
text: a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom.
dialog: Why does your show generate such
dialog: feelings?
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: Because race has always been a
dialog: sensitive issue in this country.
dialog: Gary, I have no problem with people
dialog: disagreeing with the show, it's
dialog: when folks start trying to mess
dialog: with my inherent right as an
dialog: artist, that's when I get mad. No
dialog: one, in any way, shape or form
dialog: should be censored.
speaker_heading: GARY BYRD
dialog: No matter how sexist or racist the
dialog: material may be?
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: Yes. And I say yes because who is
dialog: to judge? Who is to stand before
dialog: us and say this is righteous and
dialog: this is not? Who? Who can play God?
speaker_heading: GARY BYRD
dialog: But the line has to be drawn.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: Don't you people get it? We're in
dialog: the 21st Century. Slavery was over
dialog: four hundred years ago. All that
dialog: stuff people talked in the old
dialog: days, it's over. Folks always
dialog: crying, white man this, white man
dialog: that. Let's all grow up.
speaker_heading: GARY BYRD
dialog: Are you trying to excuse our
dialog: Holocaust?
speaker_heading: DELACROIX
dialog: Can I finish? Thank you. I had a
dialog: great Aunt, we called her Sister.
text: She went to her grave not believing
dialog: man had walked on the Moon.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: DELACROIX (CONT'D)
dialog: When I was a little kid, I would
text: argue with her, "it's on TV." She
dialog: would answer "I don't care what's
dialog: on that idiot box. No MAN is on
dialog: the MOON." Well, there are a lot
dialog: of your Negroes just like my Aunt
dialog: Sister. Face up to it. The world
dialog: has changed and if you don't adapt,
dialog: change with it, you will be left
text: behind. This show is a parody.
dialog: Are you telling me that nobody can
dialog: use some humor, have some laughs in
dialog: their lives? Is that what you're
dialog: telling me?

speaker_heading: MANTAN

speaker_heading: TAVIS SMILEY

dialog: this?
speaker_heading: MANTAN
dialog: Yo, Tavis, check it out. This is

speaker_heading: TAVIS SMILEY
dialog: Don't you feel that is a simplistic
dialog: retort?
speaker_heading: MANTAN
dialog: I don't know what a retort is, but
dialog: it's simple. Mantan - The New
dialog: Millennium Minstrel Show is
dialog: UNIVERSAL. It's not just for
dialog: Negroes in Compton or 125th in
dialog: Harlem. This is America. Our
dialog: ancestors helped build this country,
