speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. HARVEYS BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: A BEDROOM MIRROR.
text: The room is dark. A perfectly square mirror hangs crooked on
text: a wall.
text: Suddenly, out of the darkness, the reflection of a man's
text: face comes into focus. He stares straight ahead, perhaps
text: studying his own unrecognizable reflection. It's quite clear
text: this is a portrait of sickness; the man's pallor is gray,
text: his eyes are confused. There is something most definitely
dialog: wrong.
text: Tentatively, the figure steps away from the mirror, leaving
text: the frame empty and dark.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON BED
text: Like a ghost, the naked man (Harvey) stands over his bed
text: staring down at his sleeping wife (Joyce). In the eerie light,
text: he's almost translucent.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: (faintly)
dialog: Joyce... Joyce?
text: Joyce springs up, alarmed.
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: What's wrong, Harvey? What are you
dialog: doing up?
text: Harvey just stands there for a moment saying nothing.
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: (delirious, out of
dialog: breath)
dialog: Tell me the truth. Am I some guy who
dialog: writes about himself in a comic book?
dialog: Or am I just -- am I just a character
dialog: in that book?
text: Joyce rubs her eyes.
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: Harvey...
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: If I die, will 'dat character keep
dialog: goin'? Or will he just fade away...
text: Joyce just stares at him, unsure how to answer. Suddenly
text: Harvey collapses.
text: Joyce leaps from the bed, nervous, hysterical. She gets down
text: on the floor and shakes him.
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: Omigod, Harvey! Harvey, wake up!
scene_heading: CLOSE ON HARVEY'S FACE
text: His eyes remain closed, his expression far, far away.
scene_heading: FADE TO BLACK:
scene_heading: EXT. CLEVELAND ROW HOUSE - FALL - 1956 - DAY
speaker_heading: FADE UP ON:
text: A surreal kaleidoscope of black, white and red. Similar to
text: the mirror scene above, the colors slowly come into focus,
text: revealing the chiseled features of a familiar face. But this
text: time we see that it is not a real face, but rather a plastic
text: mask of the D.C. Comic hero -- SUPERMAN.
scene_heading: INTERTITLE: CLEVELAND OHIO, 1956
scene_heading: CLOSE ON SUPERMAN MASK
text: It glows eerily in the light of a porch lamp. A child's pupils
text: glare through the eye holes...
text: The camera pans from SUPERMAN to the masked face of another
text: caped-crusader: BATMAN. Batman turns toward his loyal sidekick
text: ROBIN, who clutches a plastic, trick-or-treat pumpkin.
text: Next, we find THE GREEN LANTERN as he reaches up to ring the
text: doorbell. The camera finally rests on the last boy: an unkempt
text: KID wearing no costume at all. Looking irritated and removed
text: from the rest of the group, the KID shoves his hands in the
text: pockets of his shearling coat.
text: He spits and rolls his eyes as a lady answers the door.
text: The brick home is as working class as it gets. The lady at
text: the door is a 1950's HOUSEWIFE.
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: (in unison)
dialog: Trick or treat!!
speaker_heading: HOUSEWIFE
dialog: Well, look at this! All the
dialog: superheroes on the porch! Ain't that
dialog: cute.
text: The Lady drops a candy apple in each boy's container.
speaker_heading: HOUSEWIFE
dialog: (still yelling)
dialog: We got Superman here, Batman, his
dialog: sidekick ROBIN, ohh, The Green Lantern
dialog: even...
text: She finally stops at the costumeless KID. He halfheartedly
text: holds up a ratty, stained pillowcase.
speaker_heading: HOUSEWIFE
dialog: And what about you young man?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: What about what?
text: The other boys giggle. The kid flashes them a "kick yer ass"
dialog: look.
speaker_heading: HOUSEWIFE
dialog: Who are you supposed to be?
text: The kid shrugs.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I'm Harvey Pekar (pronounced "Pee
dialog: Car").
speaker_heading: HOUSEWIFE
dialog: Harvey Pekar? That doesn't sound
dialog: like a super hero to me...
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: (mumbling)
dialog: Pecker, Pecker...
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I ain't no super hero, lady. I'm
dialog: just a kid from the neighborhood,
dialog: alright?
text: The Housewife stares at him, confused.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Ahh, forget this...
text: Frustrated, the kid throws his pillowcase down. He trudges
text: off as the others watch in confusion.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Why is everybody so stoopid?
scene_heading: BEGIN NERVOUS JAZZ SCORE
text: WE FOLLOW the schlumpy kid (aka HARVEY PEKAR) as he sulks
dialog: down the street...

scene_heading: INTERTITLE: CLEVELAND OHIO, 1975
text: A grown-up version of HARVEY PEKAR (now mid-thirties) stomps
text: along the same Cleveland street. Unfortunately, 20 years
dialog: have made this rust belt neighborhood a bit rustier. The
text: "GROWN UP HARVEY" dons the same shearling coat, sports the
text: same disheveled hair, and wears the same curmudgeonly
dialog: expression.
scene_heading: CREDIT SEQUENCE - ANIMATED SEQUENCE INTERCUT HARVEY WALKING
text: WITH COMIC BOOK PANELS OF THE CARTOON HARVEY IN ACTION. This
dialog: is not your typical super-hero stuff.
text: Instead it features our man engaging in such daredevil feats
dialog: as:
scene_heading: INT. CITY BUS - FALL 1975 - DAY
dialog: --Riding the city bus.
scene_heading: INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - DAY
text: --Working as a file clerk at the Veteran's Hospital.
scene_heading: INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT / KITCHEN - DAY
dialog: --Trying to wash dishes.
scene_heading: INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY
text: --Waiting on line at the supermarket.
scene_heading: EXT. GARAGE SALE - DAY
dialog: --Buying used records from a garage sale table.
scene_heading: INT. GREASY SPOON DINER - DAY
text: --Eating junk food at a greasy spoon.
scene_heading: INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Harvey fixes a rip in his coat with Elmer's Glue.
dialog: (Note: Each "Cartoon Harvey" looks similar but unique... A
text: variation on a theme. This is because his cartoons are drawn
dialog: by different comic artists.)
text: Intermittently, bold cartoon credits flash across the screen:
text: FROM OFF THE STREETS OF CLEVELAND COMES...
dialog: Followed by the explosive title:
speaker_heading: AMERICAN SPLENDOR
text: The high-energy music and upbeat titles -- in direct contrast
text: to the sulking image of Harvey -- continue through the
dialog: remainder of the credits.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEVELAND STREET OVERLOOKING FACTORIES - DAY
text: We're now on HARVEY'S back as he continues his forlorn
text: journey. We move forward, past him, to peer over the hill at
text: the factories below.
speaker_heading: REAL HARVEY (V.O.)
dialog: Okay. We're throwing a lot at ya
dialog: here, so lemme step in an' help ya
dialog: catch up. This is the story about
dialog: comic books, an' a guy who made a
dialog: whole life outta them. You could
dialog: even say comics saved his life. This
dialog: guy here, he's our man, Harvey Pekar --
dialog: all grown up and goin' nowhere.
dialog: Although he's a pretty scholarly
dialog: cat, he never got much of a formal
dialog: education. For the most part, he's
dialog: lived in shit neighborhoods, held
dialog: shit jobs, and is now knee deep into
dialog: a second disastrous marriage. So if
dialog: yer lookin' for romance or escapism
dialog: or some fantasy figure to save the
dialog: day, guess what? Ya got the wrong
dialog: movie.

scene_heading: INT. SOUND STAGE - PRESENT - DAY
scene_heading: HIGH DEFINITION VIDEO DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE
text: The REAL HARVEY PEKAR (not the actor who trudged through the
text: credits) sits behind a microphone, supplying the "voice over"
text: above. He clutches a movie script in his hand.
text: The frame is spare, with a few well-chosen items to indicate
text: that he's in a recording session.
text: Although he is significantly older than the man who portrays
text: him, the "Real Harvey" is every bit as much of a sad sack...
text: maybe even more. He is large and slightly threatening with
text: knitted brows and wild eyes. Yet there is something kind and
dialog: vulnerable about him -- a teddy bear who could kick your
text: ass. Off Camera, WE HEAR the voices of the male and female
dialog: directors (us -- BOB and SHARI) coaching the "Real Harvey"
text: through his voice over. Harvey's irritable and contrary,
dialog: saying that the whole Halloween incident never even happened.
dialog: "But I don't care man. I'm just doing this for the dough."
text: We learn that Harvey is a reluctant participant in a film
dialog: being made about his life.
text: SUDDENLY, his third wife JOYCE BRABNER -- an intelligent
text: control freak obsessed with all things negative -- joins in
text: the conversation. Pushing back her huge glasses, she
dialog: reprimands Harvey like he is an infant: "Harvey you are
dialog: talking too loud, Harvey you are being difficult." Harvey
text: just rolls his eyes. Joyce gets offended. It is clear they
dialog: have had this argument a million times. As Joyce storms off...
text: Harvey explains that his wife is trying to take over the
text: movie. He laments that she is his third wife, and he has no
dialog: luck with women. "Man, chicks just don't dig me." That's why
dialog: he marries anyone who will have him. "And I marry them fast
dialog: before they get to know the real me..."

speaker_heading: INTERTITLE: 1975
text: HARVEY sits on a table in his T-shirt and underwear. A DOCTOR
text: unwraps a tongue depressor.
text: Harvey's voice is hoarse, raspy and barely audible. It sounds
text: like it hurts for him to talk. Yet, he can't stop ranting.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Doc, you gotta help me. My old lady's
dialog: dumping me 'cause I can't talk. She
dialog: says I'm a social embarrassment. Now
dialog: that she's got her PhD, she's some
dialog: hot shit academic star an' I'm nuthin'
dialog: but a file clerk with nothin' ta say
dialog: an' no voice ta say it. But me bein'
dialog: a file clerk was fine when I wrote
dialog: the damn check for her tuition --
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #1
dialog: Harvey, stop talking please, and
text: open wide.
text: He points the tongue depressor at Harvey's mouth but he just
text: keeps on going.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I just don't get it... We were doin'
dialog: okay for a while. Then we took that
dialog: stupid belated honeymoon. I started
dialog: losin' my voice on the plane. Can
dialog: you believe that... On the plane,
dialog: doc?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #1
dialog: Bad timing, I guess. Now please say
dialog: "Ah," Mr. Pekar.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: "Ahhh."
dialog: (without missing a
dialog: beat)
dialog: "Ahhh" ruined the trip. I got crazy,
dialog: started to worry my voice would never
dialog: come back. I mean, my wife didn't
dialog: know me so long before we got hitched.
dialog: What if she totally forgets what I'm
dialog: like? Man, it's torture --
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #1
dialog: Shhh...
text: The Doctor shines a penlight into Harvey's mouth and looks
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #1
dialog: Uh-huh.
text: He raises an eyebrow. Harvey catches this. Hypochondria
text: overtakes him.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: (the penlight in his
dialog: mouth)
dialog: What? Is it bad, doc?
text: The Doctor removes the penlight.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #1
dialog: It's not good.
text: Harvey jumps off the table.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: It's cancer? First I got marital
dialog: problems and now yer tellin' me I
dialog: got throat cancer? Omigod...
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #1
dialog: Harvey, calm down. It's not cancer.
dialog: You have a nodule on your vocal
text: chords. Probably from screaming and
dialog: yelling too much. And if you don't
dialog: stop talking and give it a rest,
dialog: you're gonna lose your voice
dialog: completely.
text: Relieved, Harvey calms down. He nods, agreeing to be good.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Whew... Okay, okay. But fer how long?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #1
dialog: A few months.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: Months!!
text: Suddenly Harvey's voice cracks under his effort to raise it.
text: He sheepishly grabs his throat.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #1
dialog: See? More of that and you'll do
dialog: permanent damage. Now go home, keep
dialog: your mouth shut, and hopefully we
dialog: won't have to operate.
text: Operate? Harvey gets nervous again. The Doctor throws him
dialog: his clothing.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CLEVELAND STREET - WINTER - 1975 - DAY
text: A silent sequence. A dejected HARVEY walks home alone along
text: an empty lot. Day-old dirty snow clings to the ground.
text: He wanders through a down-in-the-heels neighborhood, passing
text: run-down stores and ramshackle apartments.
scene_heading: EXT. BUS STOP - WINTER - 1975 - DAY
text: Harvey approaches TOBY -- a dumpy 20-something going on 60-
text: something in ridiculous, mismatched polyester clothing. He
text: is odd, awkward and talks with a monotone, robotic voice. In
dialog: short, he is a super dork.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Hi Harvey. You weren't in work today.
dialog: Are you okay, Harvey?
text: Harvey barely looks up. He nods his head "yes" and keeps
dialog: walking.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: (yelling after him)
dialog: I'm heading downtown to the White
dialog: Castle. Wanna come, Harvey?
text: Harvey leaves Toby behind and turns the corner.
scene_heading: EXT. DELI - WINTER - 1975 - DAY
text: Two WOMEN argue loudly over a payphone.
speaker_heading: SPANISH WOMAN #1
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: I already told you, I'm waiting for
dialog: a call!
speaker_heading: SPANISH WOMAN #2
dialog: Oh yeah? Since when is this your
dialog: private office?!
speaker_heading: SPANISH WOMAN #1
dialog: Since you can kiss my ass.
text: Harvey stops in his tracks and stares at them, jealous of
dialog: their ability to speak.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP: SPANISH WOMAN #1's MOUTH
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Look at 'em yakkin'. How do they do
dialog: it?
text: Out of the corner of her eye, WOMAN #2 notices Harvey
text: eavesdropping.
speaker_heading: WOMAN #2
dialog: (yelling at Harvey)
dialog: Ay, what are you looking at? Maricone!
text: Startled, Harvey moves on.
scene_heading: EXT. ACROSS FROM A PARK - WINTER - 1975 - DAY
text: He passes a group of KIDS playing in the snow. They scream,
text: yell and laugh with abandon.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: They all make it seem so easy.
text: Then, BAM! Harvey is awakened from his reverie by a snowball.
text: The kids laugh loudly. He wipes away the snow and walks on.
text: A VOICE OVER interrupts the scene.
speaker_heading: REAL HARVEY (V.O.)
dialog: Here's our man walking home from the
dialog: doctor's. He's got the weight of the
dialog: world on him. And fer what, really?
dialog: 'Cause his throat's a little screwy?
dialog: Man, people in India are starvin' to
dialog: death every day. His problems are
dialog: nothin'.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE OVER TRAIN TRACKS - DAY
text: Totally dejected, HARVEY crosses over train tracks on his
dialog: way home.
speaker_heading: REAL HARVEY (V.O.)
dialog: Still, he can't help feelin' paranoid,
dialog: like some supernatural force is
text: conspiring against him to rob him of
text: his voice.
scene_heading: EXT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - WINTER - 1975 - DAY
text: Harvey sulks up the steps of his brick low-rise apartment
text: building. He passes an ELDERLY NEIGHBOR coming down the walk
text: with her shopping cart. Harvey unlocks the door.
speaker_heading: REAL HARVEY (V.O.)
dialog: Maybe his old lady will go easy on
text: him today, when she sees how upset
dialog: he is.
scene_heading: INT. HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - WINTER - 1975 - DAY
text: Harvey's second wife LANA -- a hippyish chic with long hair
text: and a bad attitude -- pulls books off a shelf and selectively
text: throws them onto the floor or packs them into a milk crate.
text: An overstuffed suitcase sits beside her. She's obviously
text: leaving him. HARVEY enters the room.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Ay... What is this?
text: Harvey's voice breaks up.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: Exactly what it looks like.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: (loud)
dialog: Whattya mean!! You mean yer dumpin'
dialog: me?! Fer what?
dialog: (his voice really
dialog: rips)
dialog: Ah, shit!
text: That last yell did it. Harvey grabs throat in pain, torn
text: between his throat discomfort and trying to stop his wife
dialog: from leaving.
speaker_heading: LANA
dialog: Look, your plebeian lifestyle isn't
dialog: working for me anymore. Cleveland's
dialog: not working for me anymore. I gotta
dialog: get out of here before I kill myself.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: But --
text: She gathers her bags and heads for the door. Harvey trails
text: her, trying to reason.
text: He opens his mouth, but nothing comes out.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: (mouthing, just a
dialog: wheeze)
dialog: Please! Wait, honey... Just listen
dialog: to what I got to say...
text: She turns and stares at him. Harvey tries to say something.
text: But now nothing at all comes out of his mouth. Only wheezes
dialog: air.
text: He tries again. No sound at all.
text: Finally LANA gives up, turns back towards the door and leaves.
dialog: SLAM!!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - 1975 - DAY
text: At his cubicle in the file room, Harvey fills a cart with
text: files. He's physically at work, but mentally in a daze.
speaker_heading: REAL HARVEY (V.O.)
dialog: Here's our man -- yeah alright, here's
dialog: me -- or the guy playin' me, anyway,
dialog: though he don't look nothin' like
dialog: me, but whatever. So it's a few months
dialog: later an' I'm workin' my flunky,
text: file-clerk gig at the V.A. Hospital.
dialog: My voice still ain't back yet. Things
dialog: seem like they can't get any worse...
text: A nurse pops her head in. Harvey hands her a file.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Thank you, Harvey dear.
text: He doesn't hear her, still stewing about LANA. He shoves the
text: last files in the cart and pushes it away.
speaker_heading: HARVEY

dialog: Plebeian... where the hell did she
dialog: get that shit?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FILE ROOM -- A FEW MOMENTS LATER
text: We see rows and rows of endless files...
text: Still in a daze, Harvey removes the files from the cart and
text: puts them on the shelves.
speaker_heading: MR. BOATS (O.S.)
dialog: Avoid the reeking herd! Shun the
dialog: polluted flock! Live like that stoic
dialog: bird, The eagle of the rock!
text: Harvey turns around. Mr. Boats -- a portly, African-American
text: maintenance worker wearing a bow-tie -- steps into Harvey's
text: row. He has a tool box.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Huh? Oh. Hiya, Mr. Boats.
text: Harvey resumes shelving.
speaker_heading: BOATS
dialog: You know what that means, son?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Yeah. It's from an Elinor Hoyt Wylie
dialog: poem. It means stay away from the
dialog: crowds of common ordinary people an'
dialog: do yer own thing.
text: Mr. Boats laughs.
speaker_heading: BOATS
dialog: Nope, it means don't compromise
dialog: yourself for women. Ain't gonna do
dialog: you no good! Get away from 'em as
dialog: soon as you can!
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Well I ain't got no woman now. So
dialog: I'm living like the stoic bird, man.
speaker_heading: MR. BOATS
dialog: The only way to live, son.
text: Somehow this doesn't make Harvey feel any better about his
dialog: life.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY -- DAY
text: Harvey carries an armful of files. Mr. Boats still trails
text: him, lugging his tool box.
text: Suddenly, Mr. Boats points out a young African-American FILE
text: CLERK wearing a pair of big headphones on his afro. He moves
text: as if he's listening to music.
speaker_heading: MR. BOATS
dialog: Look at that fool over there. What's
dialog: he wearing?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Huh? That's an A.M.-F.M. radio he's
dialog: listening to... They got 'em fixed
text: up now like a pair of earmuffs.
speaker_heading: MR. BOATS
dialog: (inappropriately
dialog: angered)
dialog: MMPH! Isn't that somethin! People
dialog: have gone crazy. They'll buy any
dialog: kinda junk! Probably listening to
dialog: that loud rock stuff. Junk, junk,
dialog: it's all junk!
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Well, I don't know. Rock music's got
dialog: some good qualities. I mean it ain't
dialog: jazz or nothin'.
text: Mr. Boats looks at him like he's crazy.
speaker_heading: MR. BOATS
dialog: Say, when you gonna bring me in some
dialog: good records? Some Nat "King" Cole
dialog: with Strings...
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I don't got any of that, Mr. Boats...
text: Mr. Boats stops and yells down the hall at Harvey.
speaker_heading: MR. BOATS
dialog: Yeah, you got it... You're keepin'
dialog: it at home, though! You won't turn
dialog: loose the good stuff... You just
dialog: sell the junk!
text: Harvey shakes his head as Mr. Boats finishes his diatribe.

dialog: He tells us about his love of jazz and how he started writing

text: reading a book. Crumb makes Harvey look like a smelly, sweaty
text: madman with ratty clothing.
text: Crumb holds the sketch of Harvey up to show him.
speaker_heading: CRUMB
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Check it out, man. Pretty scary.
text: Harvey glances up at his portrait, completely unselfconscious.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Yeah, ya don't know the half of it.
text: Harvey goes back to reading. Crumb back to sketching.
speaker_heading: REAL HARVEY (V.O.)
dialog: Eventually people got hip to Crumb's
dialog: art work and he started hangin' out
text: with a Bohemian crowd. After a while,
dialog: he got sick of greeting cards and
dialog: moved away to San Francisco where he
dialog: got the whole underground comic scene
text: off the ground.
text: Crumb slowly evaporates from the room, leaving Harvey totally
dialog: alone.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON 45 RECORD SPINNING AND SPINNING
speaker_heading: REAL HARVEY (V.O.)
dialog: He'd come back ta Cleveland every
dialog: few years, an' people'd treat him

scene_heading: ANOTHER R. CRUMB DRAWING OF HARVEY (Now circa 1975)
text: On a sketch pad we see a deranged, tormented Harvey sitting
text: alone on a park bench. He pulls at his hair, and looks as
text: though he may murder the next person who walks by.
scene_heading: INTERTITLE: BACK TO 1975
text: As the pencil adds shading to Harvey's face, WE HEAR:
speaker_heading: REAL HARVEY (V.O.)
dialog: Once he came to visit when I was
dialog: really feelin' bad. It was right
dialog: around the time of my throat
dialog: operation, an' right after my second
dialog: wife left me. At first it was pretty
dialog: weird. I mean, here my life was
dialog: falling apart an' everything was
dialog: going great for him. I was on my
dialog: second divorce an' he was a big hit
dialog: with the chicks. I was a nothin'
dialog: file clerk and he was this famous
dialog: cartoonist.
text: HARVEY and R. CRUMB sit on a park bench together by a bus
text: stop. A distraught Harvey whines while Crumb just sketches.
text: Harvey's voice is still raspy.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I dunno, man. On the one hand most
dialog: women gettin' graduate degrees
dialog: wouldn't give a guy like me the time
dialog: a' day. An' she married me an'
dialog: everything, so I gotta give her some
dialog: kinda credit. But then she got so
dialog: mean to me in the end. An' it ain't
dialog: like I tried t'keep her captive or
dialog: anything like that, y'know?
text: Crumb may or may not be listening to Harvey. It's hard to
dialog: tell.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: An' then on top of it I lost my voice
dialog: for three months. I still sound like
dialog: shit, but before I had nothin'. Man,
dialog: talk about hell. I started forgettin'
dialog: what I sound like, y'know? So I
dialog: started writin' stuff down -- stories
dialog: an' things, my points a' view, ideas.
dialog: I even published a couple jazz record
dialog: reviews. I guess that ended up bein'
dialog: a good thing.
speaker_heading: CRUMB
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: But don't think I buy into this
dialog: "growth" crap. Everybody talks about
dialog: how bad experiences can cause ya
dialog: t'grow, an' all that clichéd stuff.
dialog: I've had enough bad experiences and
dialog: growth to last me plenty.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Right now, I'd be glad to trade some
dialog: growth for happiness.
text: For a moment, they both just sit there saying nothing to
text: each other, each man in his own private universe.
text: Finally Harvey looks over to Crumb.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: So how long are ya stayin' in
dialog: Cleveland?
text: Crumb never looks up from his picture.
speaker_heading: CRUMB
dialog: I dunno, man. I gotta go visit this
dialog: chick in New York. And I'm really
dialog: busy with the comic book stuff. It's
dialog: good bread and all man but I'm getting
text: fed up with the whole scene.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: What are ya talkin' about? Yer makin'
dialog: a good living doin' yer art? Sheesh.
dialog: How many guys get that lucky in their
dialog: life, huh?
speaker_heading: CRUMB
dialog: Yeah, I dunno.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Ya know man, people are startin' to
dialog: know the name "Crumb." When you croak
dialog: you're gonna leave something behind.
speaker_heading: CRUMB
dialog: Yeah, my ashes and some crappy
dialog: doodles. It's not like I'm Blind
dialog: Lemon Jefferson or Big Mama Thornton.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: C'mon, man. It sure beats workin' a
dialog: gig like mine -- being a nobody flunky
dialog: and sellin' records on the side for
text: a buck.
speaker_heading: CRUMB
dialog: Yeah, well that's true...
text: Harvey nods in agreement, mulling this over. He's not at all
dialog: offended.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - 1975 - DAY
text: CLOSE ON A FILE DRAWER MARKED: "RECENTLY DECEASED."
text: A hand reaches into the frame and opens the drawer.
text: By rote, HARVEY fumbles with a large stack of "expired
text: patient" files. He places each into the appropriate
dialog: alphabetical "deceased" drawer.
text: Attempting to grab another batch, Harvey accidentally knocks
text: the entire pile onto the floor.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Damn it!
text: He crouches down to survey the mess -- a collage of "expired
text: lives" laid out before his eyes.
text: We move past dozens of anonymous names -- William Anderson,
dialog: Louis Collins, Mark D'Amico, Tyrone Moore, Franklin Ray,
text: etc... Each file has a red "Deceased" stamp.
text: Depressed, HARVEY is transfixed by the files surrounding him
text: on the floor. Suddenly he stops and picks one up.
text: ANGLE ON FOLDER: It is marked, "CHARLIE MARSHALL."
text: He opens the folder and reads the stats...
dialog: Born: 1920 in Cleveland Died: 1920 in Cleveland Occupation:
dialog: Clerk
text: ANGLE ON HARVEY: He swallows hard as he reads about Charlie's
text: small, invisible and now vanished life... He tosses the folder

scene_heading: CLOSE ON: TWO STICK FIGURES IN AN EMPTY FRAME
text: HARVEY sits at a table with a pen in hand and a blank sheet
text: of paper in front of him. Nothing seems to come to him.
text: He flips through a pile of comic books -- everything from
dialog: D.C. Comic Super Heroes to underground works such as Crumb's
text: Mr. Natural and Zap Comix. No inspiration. Harvey throws
text: them down in frustration.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I'm starvin'.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SUPERMARKET - 1975 - DAY
text: HARVEY pushes a cart through the cramped aisles of a crowded
text: supermarket. He pulls a few cans of Beef-A-Roni off the shelf
text: and heads off to pay. Reaching the check-out area, he
text: evaluates the situation.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON CHECK-OUT COUNTERS:
text: There are three lines to choose from. Two of the counters
text: have long waits. The third is much shorter but there is an
text: OLD JEWISH LADY next in line.
text: SUDDENLY, THE SCREEN SPLITS IN TWO:
text: The LEFT SIDE OF THE FRAME remains Harvey at the supermarket
text: deliberating over the check-out lines.
text: However, the RIGHT SIDE OF THE FRAME now contains a CRUMB
scene_heading: STYLE COMIC PANEL DEPICTING THE EXACT SAME SCENARIO. A BUBBLE
text: appears over CARTOON HARVEY'S head revealing his thoughts.
text: It reads: "Pickin' the right check-out line is an art...
dialog: There's a lot of things you gotta consider."
text: ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FRAME... Harvey decides to get behind
dialog: the Old Lady.
text: MEANWHILE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE FRAME... Cartoon
text: Harvey stands behind the Old Lady.
text: A new BUBBLE reads: "It may be the shortest line but I am
dialog: takin' a chance 'cause she's an Old Jewish Lady."
text: BACK TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FRAME... The CASHIER rings up
text: the Old Lady's purchases -- a few kitchen glasses.
speaker_heading: OLD JEWISH LADY
dialog: (Yiddish Accent)
dialog: Listen, goily, dese glasses are six
dialog: for $2.00 because I couldn't carry
dialog: twelf... But I vanted twelf so today
dialog: I'm buying six more... But you should
dialog: only charge me $1.50 for dem... It's
dialog: ok, you can esk de meneger.
text: Harvey rolls his eyes and stamps his foot impatiently. He
dialog: knows he's in trouble now.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Frank! I need a price check.
scene_heading: SUDDENLY, THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN BECOMES FULLY
text: ANIMATED... Instead of still comic panels with balloons, the
text: Cartoon Harvey now rants directly into the camera.
speaker_heading: CARTOON HARVEY
dialog: Man, Old Jewish Ladies will argue
dialog: forever with a cashier about anything.
dialog: Get behind them in a line an' yer
dialog: gonna wait forever!
text: The Human Harvey seems oblivious to his cartoon replica. He
text: impatiently leans on his cart, waiting and seething.
speaker_heading: CARTOON HARVEY
dialog: I mean, I'm a yid myself, an' the
dialog: women in my family are like that...
dialog: But I never got used to it... I may
dialog: be cheap, but I got limits!
text: ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE SCREEN... The MANAGER finally
text: arrives. The Old Lady haggles with him, too.
speaker_heading: OLD JEWISH LADY
dialog: Please. Let me 'splain von more time.
text: MEANWHILE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE... The Cartoon Harvey turns
text: to address the Human Harvey, who actually looks him in the
text: eyes. It now seems Human Harvey can actually hear his cartoon
dialog: alter ego.
speaker_heading: CARTOON HARVEY
dialog: Wake up! You're whole life's gettin'
dialog: eaten away by this kinda crap! What
dialog: kind of existence is this? Is this
dialog: all a workin' stiff like you can
dialog: expect? Ya gonna suffer in silence
dialog: fer the rest a' yer life?! Or ya
dialog: gonna make a mark. Huh? Huh?
text: IN AN INSTANT, THE CARTOON HARVEY DISAPPEARS AND THE LIVE

scene_heading: INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN - 1975 - MORNING
text: A bleary-eyed HARVEY, still clad in an undershirt and boxers,

text: scribbling. He clearly has been slaving over this work all
dialog: night.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON PAPERS:
text: At the top is a quickly scribbled title, "Standing Behind
dialog: Old Jewish Ladies In Supermarket Lines." These are ad hoc

text: An alarm clock goes off. Harvey's eyes fly open.

scene_heading: I/E. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - HARVEY'S POV - 1975 - MORNING

speaker_heading: MATTRESS GUY #1
dialog: So how smart is she?
speaker_heading: MATTRESS GUY #2
dialog: I dunno. I guess she's about average.
speaker_heading: MATTRESS GUY #1
dialog: Average? Hey, man. Average is dumb!
text: They drop the mattress in place. With the window framing
text: these guys, the scene FREEZES, looking just like a comic
dialog: book panel.
scene_heading: INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Harvey turns around from the scene and ponders it. He moves

text: Harvey's mock-ups. Harvey doesn't touch his burger deluxe
text: and nervously talks in his laryngitis-afflicted voice.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: See, ever since I read your stuff,
dialog: man I've been thinking I could write
dialog: comic book stories that were different
dialog: from anything being done.
speaker_heading: CRUMB
dialog: (munching on a fry)
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I'm thinkin', the guys who do animal
dialog: comics and super-hero stuff are really
dialog: limited 'cause they gotta try to
dialog: appeal to kids. And underground comics
dialog: like yours have been really subversive
dialog: or opened things up politically. But
dialog: there is still plenty more ta be
dialog: done with 'em, too, y'know?
speaker_heading: CRUMB
dialog: Pass me the ketchup?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I mean with pictures and words, it
dialog: could be more of an art form. Like
dialog: those French movies are. Or De Sica
dialog: over in Italy, y'know?... So I tried
dialog: writin' some things about real life.
dialog: Stuff the everyman's gotta deal with.
text: Crumb finally looks up from Harvey's work.
speaker_heading: CRUMB
dialog: These are about you.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Er, yeah...
speaker_heading: CRUMB
dialog: You turned yourself into a comic
dialog: hero?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Sorta, yeah. But no idealized shit.
dialog: No phony bullshit. The real thing,
dialog: y'know? Ordinary life is pretty
dialog: complex stuff.
text: Crumb reads more. Harvey waits anxiously. Finally Crumb starts
text: to chuckle.
speaker_heading: CRUMB
dialog: These are really good, Harv.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: (insecure)
dialog: Really? Ya think so?
text: Crumb shuffles through more.
speaker_heading: CRUMB
dialog: Yeah. This is great stuff, man. I

dialog: illustrate them?
text: Harvey is practically bursting.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Wow!!
text: Harvey's voice breaks like a kid in puberty. He clears his
text: throat. And something miraculous happens...

speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: You'd do that for me, man? That'd be
dialog: great! I can't draw a straight line!
speaker_heading: CRUMB

speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Mr. Boats, it's not polite to grab

speaker_heading: MR. BOATS

speaker_heading: MR. BOATS
dialog: Where these sickly men rushin' off

dialog: So what yer sayin' is you identify

speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: (rubbing out the catsup)

text: that he is proud of it and stands up
dialog: for the rights of other nerds. Then,
text: he asks the kids at the pep rally
dialog: who think they are nerds to come
dialog: forward... So nearly everyone in the

speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: 1960 was the year I got my first
dialog: apartment and my first telephone
dialog: book. Imagine my surprise when I
dialog: looked up my name and saw that, in
dialog: addition to me, another Harvey Pekar
dialog: was listed!
text: Images of Harvey's childhood float by, followed by his young
dialog: adult years.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I was listed as Harvey L. Pekar...
dialog: My middle name is Lawrence... He was
dialog: listed as Harvey Pekar -- no middle
dialog: initial... Therefore, his was a purer
dialog: listing.
text: We see Harvey age in the images: he's hanging on the street
text: corner with friends, collecting records, hanging with Crumb.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Then, in the seventies, I noticed
dialog: that a third Harvey Pekar was listed
dialog: in the phone book! This filled me
dialog: with curiosity.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: How could there be three people with
dialog: such an unusual name in the world,
dialog: let alone in one city?!
text: Now, numerous images of Harvey's many years at the V.A.
text: Hospital float by: Harvey filing, Harvey arguing with his
dialog: boss, Harvey and Toby, etc.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Then one day, a person I worked with
dialog: expressed her sympathy to me
dialog: concerning what she thought was the
dialog: death of my father. She pointed out
dialog: an obituary notice in the newspaper
dialog: for a man named Harvey Pekar. One of
dialog: his sons was named Harvey. These
dialog: were the other Harvey Pekars.
text: The comic images fade out. Harvey is once again alone in the
text: empty room.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Six months later, Harvey Pekar Jr.
dialog: died. Although I'd met neither man,
dialog: I was filled with sadness. "What
dialog: were they like," I thought. It seemed
dialog: that our lives had been linked in
text: some indefinable way.
text: We slowly move in on his face. Extremely close. As close as
dialog: the camera can get.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
text: But the story does not end there.
dialog: For two years later another Harvey
text: Pekar appeared in the directory.
dialog: What kind of people are these? Where
dialog: do they come from, what do they do?
dialog: What's in a name?

scene_heading: INT. HARVEY'S BEDROOM - 1980'S - DAY
dialog: BACK TO BEDROOM:
text: We are close on HARVEY'S face as he lays passed out and
text: delirious on the floor. Over this WE HEAR...
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Who is Harvey Pekar?
text: His face slowly fades to black.
text: A MOMENT OF BLACK, AND THEN...
scene_heading: INT. TOWER BOOKS - 1980'S - DAY
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: CLOSE UP: A GLOSSY, FULL-COLOR, NOVEL-SIZED COMIC COVER.
text: Scrawled across the top in yellow and red it read, "Our Cancer
text: Year." The drawing depicts Harvey doubled over on the front
text: lawn, groceries in the snow, with Joyce attempting to help
text: him up. A hand flips the book open and signs the inside leaf.
text: JOYCE and a healthy-looking HARVEY sit at a table signing
text: copies of their opus. About fifteen or so people mill about
dialog: with copies.
speaker_heading: REAL HARVEY (V.O.)
dialog: Here's our man a year later. Somehow
dialog: I made it through the treatments,
dialog: an' the doctors are optimistic. I
dialog: guess Joyce was right about doin'
dialog: the big comic book. We published the
dialog: thing as a graphic novel -- our first
dialog: collaboration -- and ended up with
dialog: rave reviews. We even won the American
dialog: Book Award. Go figure...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - 1980'S - DAY
text: The place is still a mess but somehow it has a better vibe
dialog: than it had before. This might be due to the presence of
text: DANIELLE. She sits crossed legged on the floor making jewelry
text: out of beads. JOYCE guides her.
text: HARVEY shuffles into the room. He watches for a moment as
text: Joyce and Danielle play.
text: ANGLE ON JOYCE: There is an awkward expression almost
text: resembling a smile on her face. He interrupts them.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Hey Joyce.
text: Joyce looks up. Harvey looks like he's trying to hide
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: What is it Harvey?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: That was the doctor.
text: Joyce stops what she's doing and gulps. She hangs on Harvey's
dialog: every word.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: He said I'm all clear.
text: Tears well in Harvey's eyes. Joyce breathes a sigh of relief
text: and Danielle jumps up and runs over to Harvey. She hugs him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CLEVELAND ICE RINK - 1980 - DAY
text: HARVEY sits in the bleachers, watching JOYCE teach DANIELLE
dialog: to ice skate.
text: Harvey's got a box of pizza next to him. He picks up a slice
text: and chomps on it. The cheese drips out of his mouth onto his
dialog: shirt.
speaker_heading: REAL HARVEY (V.O.)
dialog: The weirdest thing that came outta
dialog: my illness was Danielle. With her
dialog: real mother runnin' around who knows
dialog: where, an' seein' how well her and
dialog: Joyce got on, Fred decided she'd
dialog: have a better life with us. I was
dialog: scared at first but then I thought,
dialog: what the hell. She's a good kid. So
dialog: we ended up takin' her an' raising
dialog: her as our own.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - 1980'S - DAY
text: HARVEY and DANIELLE lie on the futon together. Harvey's comics
text: are strewn around the room everywhere. Danielle flips through
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Ya keep readin' 'em backward.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: I like reading them backward.
dialog: (holding up a comic)
dialog: Is that you?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I keep tellin' ya, all of 'ems me,
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: You look like a monster.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Yeah, well wait'll ya see what you're
dialog: gonna look like.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: Me??
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Sure. Yer part of the story too,
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: What story?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: The story of my life.
text: Danielle makes a face.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Yeah, I know I'm not as interesting
dialog: as The Little Mermaid and all that
dialog: magical crap...
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: Maybe I want to write my own comic.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Oh yeah? What about?
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: I don't know yet. But not about you.
dialog: You have enough already.

scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL BUS STOP - FALL - PRESENT - DAY
text: HARVEY walks towards the bus stop to send DANIELLE to school.
text: He holds her hand.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Ya know, you should write about things
dialog: in your own life. Like school and...
dialog: ponies... I don't know, girl stuff...
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: (to Harvey)
dialog: Do you have to hold my hand?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: (wounded)
dialog: What, are you embarrassed a' me? I
dialog: know, I'm embarrassing. I felt the
dialog: same way about my father.
text: Danielle looks up at Harvey like he's crazy.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: No Harvey. You're just squeezing it
dialog: too hard.
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: Joyce is right. You are obsessive
dialog: compulsive.
text: Danielle drops his hand and rushes onto the bus with other
dialog: kids.
text: Harvey waves and watches as it pulls away.
text: He turns and walks by himself down the busy Cleveland street --
text: -- a familiar image from the opening. He's still hunched
text: over. He's still Harvey.
speaker_heading: REAL HARVEY (V.O.)
dialog: Yeah, so I guess comics brought me a
dialog: lot. But don't think this is some
dialog: sunny, happy ending. Every day is
dialog: still a major struggle. Joyce an' I
dialog: fight like crazy, an' she barely
dialog: works. The kid's got A.D.D. and is a
dialog: real handful. My expenses have gone
dialog: up so much that I'm writin' freelance
dialog: 'round the clock, just to make my
dialog: bills. My life is total chaos.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BUS STOP - FALL - PRESENT - DAY
scene_heading: DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE -- SHOT ON FILM
text: NOW THE REAL HARVEY walks down the same busy Cleveland street
dialog: towards his job.
speaker_heading: REAL HARVEY (V.O.)
dialog: With a little luck, I'll get a window
dialog: of good health between retirin' an
dialog: dyin'. The golden years, right? Who
dialog: knows. Between my pension and the
dialog: chunk of change I got for this movie,
dialog: I should be able to swing somethin'.
dialog: Sure I'll lose the war eventually,
dialog: but the goal is to win a few
dialog: skirmishes along the way. Right?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - PRESENT - DAY

text: THE REAL HARVEY slumps at the desk now, flipping through a
dialog: comic book.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON DOOR
text: THE REAL TOBY comes into the file room, carrying a cake with
text: sparklers. He's followed by a group of Harvey's REAL COWORKERS
text: and JOYCE and REAL DANIELLE.
text: Harvey moves the comic off his desk so Toby can put the cake
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON CAKE
text: The festive cake reads "HAPPY RETIREMENT HARVEY." REAL JOYCE
text: cuts the cake and passes slices to the group.
text: ANOTHER WORKER pops a bottle of champagne.
text: CLOSE on a glass of champagne getting filled. The glass sits
text: next to the comic Harvey was reading.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP ON COMIC BOOK COVER
text: HARVEY'S new edition of AMERICAN SPLENDOR is subtitled, "OUR
