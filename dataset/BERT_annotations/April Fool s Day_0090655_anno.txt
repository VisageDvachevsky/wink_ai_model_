scene_heading: EXT. FERRY LANDING - NEW ENGLAND SHORE - DAY
text: The sparkling waters. The chirping spring day. We are on an isolated
text: stretch of country shore , and a quiet, sheltered island is visible
text: distantly across the Sound. There is asense of anticipation,
text: excitement. VOICES can be heard. THE CAMERA is the POV of a VIDEO
text: CAMERA, and a group of college kids wait just o.s. On-screen, however,
text: for the moment, a proper, sweet-faced young COED faces the camera and
text: -- reluctantly, under the urging of her friend behind the video lens -
text: - sets the scene.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SWEET COED
speaker_heading: (SHYLY)
text: Hi... My name is Mary O'Reilly O'Toole O'Shea and...over there is the
dialog: island my friend Muffy owns... It's spring break... and she's invited
dialog: us over for the weekend, and we're waiting for the ferry now to take
dialog: us there...
dialog: (blushing, mortified to cameraman)
dialog: I don't know what else to say!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERAMAN (CHAZ'S VOICE)
dialog: Tell us something about yourself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SWEET COED
dialog: Something about myself? Oh, Gee...
dialog: (composing herself, earnestly)
dialog: Well, I want to work with handicapped children... My parents are my
dialog: best Friends... Next semester I start convent school, and I... fuck on
dialog: the first date.
dialog: 
text: O.S. her friends explode with LAUGHTER. Brassy former deb NIKKI
text: BRASHEARS gives us a big, wet wink, dropping the act.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SWEET COED/NIKKI
dialog: April Fool...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ'S VOICE
dialog: Whoo! Outrageous woman! Nikki, you are my kind o' gal!
dialog: 
text: He PANS THE CAMERA over to KIT-- a pretty, unaffected, natural beauty,
text: bright and very much aware.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ'S VOICE
dialog: C'mon, Kit, how about you?
dialog: 
text: Kit waves him off, laughing in spite of herself. She's got nothing to
dialog: say.
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Pass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ'S VOICE
dialog: C'mon , Arch? Skip?
dialog: 
text: He PANS over to the other two college boys on the dock here - ARCH, a
text: big, good-natured, easygoing WASP jock (rugby and crew); and SKIP, Mr.
text: Preppy, the perfect image of the lazy spoiled, indulged, and reckless
text: upper-crust kid. Skip also happens to be Muffy's cousin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
dialog: (ponders it with due consideration)
dialog: Yeah, sure... I fuck on the first date...
dialog: 
text: Skip cracks up. Arch's laughter follows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI (O.S.)
dialog: Where's Rob?
dialog: 
text: Chaz QUICK-PANS the camera back to Kit, following the action.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ'S VOICE
dialog: (teasing, with innuendo)
dialog: Yeah, Kit, where is he?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH (O.S.)
speaker_heading: (MORE TEASING)
dialog: Oh, Kit...
dialog: 
text: Concerned, Kit keeps her humor anyway, waving the lens away again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Oh, c'mon, Chaz, give me some room, will you?
dialog: 
text: He does, finally shutting down the videopak. The image reverts to FILM
dialog: again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
text: (looks at her, persisting)
dialog: Well?
scene_heading: INT. VOLVO WAGON IN MOTION - MAIN HIGHWAY - DAY
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: The driver -- a still great-looking, turned-out Fairfield County-type
text: SUBURBAN LADY -- and the passenger, ROB FERRIS a cleancut,
text: goodlooking, 20 year old public school grad ­sit in uncomfortable
text: silence on opposite ends of the front seat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: (gestures, awkwardly)
dialog: Here'll be fine, thanks...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY INTERSECTION - DAY
dialog: 
text: The Volvo wagon pulls over. Rob drags out his daypack, too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
speaker_heading: (ABASHED)
dialog: Thanks... for the lift, I mean...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUBURBAN LADY
dialog: (smiles, no reason for disappointment)
dialog: It was a real lift for me, too, hon.
dialog: 
text: A late model Detroit sedan slows at the intersection, turning off the
text: highway to take the junction in the direction Rob is going. A road
text: sign indicates: "BAR HARBOR MOUNT DESERT" in another direction.
dialog: 
text: Rob hefts his gear, hurrying to flag the sedan.
dialog: 
text: The Volvo wagon continues on, braking for the next undergraduate
text: male hitchhiking down the road.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - ST. JOHN HOUSE- DAY
text: CLOSE ON a wall calendar. A HAND reaches INTO FRAME, tearing off
text: "MARCH" to begin "APRIL".
dialog: 
text: WIDEN TO REVEAL CLARA, the middle-aged housekeeper and offseason
text: caretaker for the house. With her overcoat and purse on one arm, she
text: drops the "MARCH" calendar page in a wastebasket, then crosses to the
text: pantry where a door and wooden steps lead down to the basement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLARA
speaker_heading: (CALLING)
text: The rooms are all in order, double- and triple-checked, and I'm on my
dialog: way...
dialog: 
text: She hears a CLATTER from down below.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - DAY
dialog: 
text: MUFFY ST. JOHN drags a woman's body across the floor. The arm comes
text: off in her hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: Shit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLARA'S VOICE
dialog: Need any help down there?
dialog: 
text: Clara comes clopping down the steps. Muffy turns, the mannequin's arm
text: still in her hand. Old workclothes and a head kerchief take the place
text: of Muffy's normally impeccable prep Seven Sisters outfit (including
dialog: the regulation penny loafers) in all this dust. Early 20's, pretty in
text: an off-beat sort of way, Muffy is every inch a blue-blood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: (puffing with the effort)
dialog: No, Clara, thanks. Just trying some last minute straightening down
dialog: here... god, I don't think I've ever worked so hard in my life...!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Sure you don't want me to stay? There's nobody gonna be around
dialog: here to help till first ferry back Monday, y'know...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: (continuing with her work)
text: Nope, you're a peach, Clara. But this one's mine. I told my father I'd
dialog: do it, and I will. My way. I don't want him to have any excuses.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (dubiously , turning to go)
dialog: All right, then. Have a nice party.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: (a buoyant laugh)
dialog: Nice? It has to be better than nice... it's gotta be bloody
dialog: unforgettable!
dialog: 
text: Clara climbs the stairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Good luck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY (CONT)
dialog: Bye, Clara. See you Monday.
dialog: 
text: Soon there's the upstairs SOUND of the kitchen door closing behind
dialog: Clara.
text: Muffy finally props the mannequin, clearing away the remaining
text: clutter. She goes to open a basement window for ventilation. It is a
text: ground-level transom, hinged at the top. Through it Clara is visible
text: departing the grounds.
dialog: 
text: Then Muffy hears a DRIPPING. She turns, hesitating, and follows the
dialog: sounds.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UTILITY ROOM
dialog: 
text: Part of the basement, an old washroom and more, with tub, slop sink
text: and large incinerator. Muffy enters, pulling the chain on the bare,
text: overhead bulb. It illuminates the room, and the tub underneath --
text: slightly rusty at the drain, but otherwise spotless -- and the slowly
text: dripping faucet.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FERRY LANDING - MAINLAND - DAY
dialog: 
dialog: CHAZ, the videocameraman and the only member of the group we haven't
text: seen till now, is the first to spot the ferry approaching.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: Here she comes...
dialog: 
dialog: He's a real hi-tech freak and Ivy League wiseass, a free spirit in
text: neo-punk neck curl and button-down shirt. He shoulders his lightweight
text: videopak again, taping it. Arch and Skip watch with him from the end
text: of the pier. But Kit and Nikki, waiting nearer the office, are
text: distracted by the SOUND of an arriving car.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE - PARKING LOT
dialog: 
text: It's not Rob, though. It's NAN, another newcomer. She pulls her car
text: next to the others in the gravel lot behind the landing office and -
text: gets out quickly, dragging a hefty suitcase out of the back seat. She
text: is an unfamiliar face to Kit and Nikki --a shy, earnest, small-town
text: girl, overdressed for the occasion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAN
speaker_heading: (HURRIED)
dialog: Hi... is this the ferry to the St. John house?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI I
dialog: Any second now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: Oh, thank goodness ! I didn't know if I was on the right road...
dialog: 
text: Kit smiles welcome, lending a hand as Nan struggles the bag up the
dialog: ramp.
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Hi. Kit Graham... Nikki Brashears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: Nan Youngblood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: (needling, about the suitcase)
dialog: Planning on staying a while?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: (flushes, embarrassed)
dialog: Oh, no... just some work for finals, when we get back... you don't
dialog: know how far behind I am...
dialog: 
text: Arch outhustles Chaz for her bag. Her simple attractiveness exerts an
dialog: appeal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
dialog: Hi. Arch Cummings . I've seen you around. Jewett Hall, right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: Chaz Vyshinsky. You got great legs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: (pointed1y, reminds him)
text: Chaz, Arch already has her bag.
dialog: 
text: Meaning, Chaz is Nikki's man, especially for this weekend.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: (volunteering, happily)
dialog: Well, I only met Muffy this term in Drama Society . I volunteered to
dialog: do their costumes... I like to sew... Did you see her in Ghosts? She's
dialog: so talented. She was wonderful!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIP
dialog: (to Nan, approvingly; in greeting)
dialog: Congratulations, on finding your way.
dialog: 
text: The landing BUMPS, the ferry touches down. They look up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE CHANGE
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRYMAN
speaker_heading: (BARKS)
dialog: Stand clear!
dialog: 
text: The large, raw-boned FERRYMAN holds open the wooden stile for the one
text: and only passenger from the island ­ Clara -- to disembark. Clara
text: passes them , giving first Skip and then the others a look, shaking
text: her head in sad appraisal.
speaker_heading: FERRYMAN (cont.)
speaker_heading: (GROWLS)
dialog: Ok, let's go.
dialog: 
text: It's not the friendliest greeting in the world. The ferryman keeps the
text: stile open for them to board singly. There is also a younger assistant
text: on board -- BUCK, a pleasant, openfaced townie in his 20s.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRYMAN (cont.)
text: To the rear. Outa the operator's way.
dialog: 
text: Nikki clutches at Skip's arm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
scene_heading: (IN MOCK-TERROR)
dialog: This is it? No going back? Trapped for days on an island where
dialog: men are men, and women oughta know better?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
speaker_heading: (BEHIND HER)
dialog: Try to control yourself, Sister O'Toole.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
speaker_heading: (SUGGESTIVE )
dialog: You could tie me in chains...
dialog: 
text: Chaz boards, passing Buck, the assistant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: (a low whisper)
dialog: Your fly's open, and your Hostess Twinkie's hanging out...
dialog: 
text: The assistant gapes, falling for it, groping his fly. Which is closed,
text: of course. He looks up, grinning. Chaz kisses him on the cheek, winks
text: and moves on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUCK
dialog: Sh -i-i-t...
dialog: 
text: Kit is hanging back on the dock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRYMAN
dialog: Come on if you're coming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
speaker_heading: (URGENTLY)
dialog: Excuse me. But we're still waiting for somebody --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRYMAN
speaker_heading: (GRUFFLY)
text: It's Friday. My last run of the week. I don't get paid overtime.
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: But you've got to wait. They said it's the only way over.
dialog: If he misses this...
dialog: 
text: Arch WHISTLES loudly, seeing and alerting them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: PARKING LOT - THEIR POV
text: A late model Detroit sedan (the one we saw earlier turning off the
text: highway) pulls to a fast stop in the lot. Rob hurries out; a CHEER
text: comes up from the group on the ferry. Kit closes her eyes in relief.
text: Rob comes hurrying up the ramp.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ­ LANDING
text: ...followed closely by HARVEY 'HAL' EDISON, JR.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Wait up!
dialog: 
text: Harvey is the driver of the sedan, and after he carefully locks up, he
text: comes running with his bag, too. He is a rangy, straight-arrow Ivy
text: League farmboy from the Border South, and he's the last of Muffy's
text: invited guests. He also, somewhat incongruously, sports a Bruce
dialog: Springsteen badge.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: (to Kit, kissing her)
dialog: Sorry... Nik, Chaz...
dialog: (to Skip and Nan whom he doesn't know)
dialog: Rob Ferris...
dialog: 
text: They return greetings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARVEY
speaker_heading: (RIGHT BEHIND )
dialog: Hi! Harvey 'Hal' Edison, Jr., but please call me Hal. Only my folks
dialog: call me Harve... and I can't stand it. Boy, this sure is a pretty
dialog: spot.
dialog: 
text: Stylistically, he's a Martian. Chaz stares at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: You're friends with... Muffy St. John?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARVEY
speaker_heading: (PROUDLY)
text: Sure am. We sit together in Econ 345. I let her copy my marginal
dialog: utility curves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: I get it. That's a joke.
text: Preppy Skip adds his greeting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIP
dialog: (an ironical nod)
dialog: Harve.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: (correcting him, blithely)
dialog: Hal...
dialog: (noticing interest his badge)
dialog: Springsteen, he's still the Boss!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRYMAN
speaker_heading: (IMPATIENTLY)
dialog: Ok, c'mon, I don't have all day.
dialog: 
text: He slams the stile down after Harvey, the last to board, and gets busy
text: with the stubborn motor. His assistant helps. Chaz tapes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARVEY
text: (enthusiastically, putting down his fear)
dialog: YOU all buddies?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Except for Skip and Nan. Them we just met.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
speaker_heading: (AMIABLY)
dialog: But we will be.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
speaker_heading: (MEANING SKIP)
dialog: Watch what you say around him, though. He's Muffy's cousin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: (tickled, to Skip)
dialog: No kiddin'?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIP
text: Distant. Over the horizon.
dialog: Otherwise, I wouldn't be invited...
dialog: (frowns, tellingly)
dialog: Old money never mixes family with friends.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: This is true. For as long as I've known her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
speaker_heading: (JOKING)
dialog: To protect her family, I guess.
speaker_heading: SKIP
speaker_heading: (UNSMILING)
dialog: To keep her friends.
dialog: 
text: He turns to Arch, holds up his hand, and CLICK, a switchblade opens
text: into the lens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIP (cont.)
dialog: Choose your weapons, big guy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
dialog: (nervously, a laugh)
dialog: Hey, what's this...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIP
dialog: You up for a game of stretch?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: (still taping, to Skip)
dialog: Your fly's open.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIP
dialog: Eat it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: (undaunted, to Rob)
dialog: Your fly's open.
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
dialog: Ok, so don't believe me.
dialog: 
text: He keeps the tape rolling. Rob discreetly looks down. His fly is
text: open. Kit looks at him dubiously. Rob zips. Chaz beams, getting it all
text: for posterity. The engine finally engages. The ferry lurches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: (smiles weakly to Kit)
dialog: We're off!
dialog: 
dialog: They are indeed.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE SOUND - DISTANT POV - DAY
dialog: 
text: The ferry pulls away from the mainland.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE FERRY - DAY
dialog: 
text: A CLOSER ANGLE. The sturdy, barge like ship craft makes progress. The
text: Ferryman and Buck remain at the stern.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ECU - THE DECK
dialog: 
text: As Skip's knife flies INTO FRAME, it bites into the boards and holds.
speaker_heading: SKIP AND ARCH
dialog: 
text: at their game. Arch stretches, can't reach the knife, and topples
dialog: over.
dialog: 
text: Skip hoots triumphantly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIP
dialog: First round, the champ!
dialog: 
scene_heading: NIKKI AND HARVEY
dialog: 
text: Nikki, much to her chagrin, finds herself the object of Harvey's
dialog: attentions.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Y'know what I find amazin'? Muffy's her real name. I mean,
dialog: I'm Harvey, but they call me Hal, so I thought, 'Muffy', it must
dialog: stand for something... Muffin?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Muffers, Moffo, Muff-child , Muffin' stuff, the Muffster...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARVEY
speaker_heading: (GRINS)
dialog: I bet you're her oldest friend.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
speaker_heading: (BORED)
dialog: Actually, she's three months older than I am.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: You know what I mean.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Harvey... are you planning a career in politics when you grow up?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I've given it some thought. Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Oh, just a hunch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: First, though, I'm hopin' to interview with her daddy's
dialog: company, Southern Regional Sales, next year before graduation...
dialog: Y'know, he's worth more'n 50 mill over the counter!
dialog: 
text: She just stares at him.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - THE KNIFE
dialog: 
text: digging into the deck again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH (O.S.)
dialog: Jesus...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH and SKIP
dialog: 
text: The knife is at an impossible distance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIP
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: Go for it, big fella.
dialog: 
text: Arch swallows his pride and makes a hopeless attempt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
text: fastens onto Nan, immersed in one of her books. He carries his own.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: (sitting beside her)
dialog: Whatcha readin'?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: Milton. Paradise Lost. For Professor Russo's course on the
text: English epic... It's a shame. It's a dying form. Not too many people
dialog: read it nowadays, even in college. What's yours?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
speaker_heading: (SHOWS HER)
dialog: Suck and fuck.
dialog: 
text: Naked bodies writhing in heat. Women with their tongues sticking out
text: in desparate desire... Nan tries to control her reaction to his stack
text: of graphic pornographic video catalogues and magazines.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ (CONT)
dialog: The origins of American pornographic film. I'm taking an
dialog: independent study this term.
dialog: (the passion and commitment show)
dialog: My advisor's really behind me on it. We're not gonna be sheltered
dialog: college kids all our lives. Someday I'm gonna have kids --
dialog: you're gonna have kids ­ and someday that kid's gonna come up
dialog: to me and say, 'God, Dad, porn's really a major part of our
dialog: lives. You were there, how'd it get started?' I wanna be
dialog: able to answer their questions.
speaker_heading: (SMILES)
dialog: Besides, it's research I can do by myself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB AND KIT
text: They keep their voices low.
speaker_heading: KIT
speaker_heading: (STILL MIFFED)
dialog: That's not my point --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: You don't want me to hitch, you want me to buy a car. OK, but
dialog: I'm a state university boy, I don't have the perks like some
dialog: of you private college kids do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Oh, c'mon, don't pull that.
dialog: 
text: Rob just drops his arms in frustration.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT (cont.)
dialog: I mean, it may show something about your attitude toward me,
dialog: always being late.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Kit...
dialog: 
text: Arch's voice interrupts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH'S VOICE
text: (annoyed, loudly, overriding the other conversations)
dialog: Hey, I'm really not interested anymore --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIP
dialog: C'mon, just one more
dialog: 
text: The others look up at the interruption.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE
dialog: 
text: Arch pushes the knife back into Skip's hand, tired of playing knife-
dialog: toss.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
dialog: I said, enough's enough--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIP
dialog: One more try, double or nothing.
dialog: 
text: He flips the knife to Arch, handle first.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
speaker_heading: (PISSED OFF)
dialog: C'mon, give it a fuckin' rest!
dialog: 
text: He flips it back hard. Something happens. Skip looks up stunned.
text: Arch's voice catches in his throat in horror.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
dialog: 
text: Skip stares back, disbelieving, looking down and pulling his hand away
text: from his chest, where the blood begins to seep and the jackknife
text: sticks out, buried hilt-deep between his ribs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIP
speaker_heading: (PALE)
dialog: Oh, fuck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIP
text: Nan screams. Skip stumbles, teetering there at the edge of the ferry.
text: Rob and Chaz leap to their feet. The ferrymen both look up in
text: disbelief. Arch steps forward to help. But Skip, weaving, topples and
text: splashes overboard. He goes under.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
text: (panicked, hurrying to the side)
dialog: I'll get him, I'll get him!
dialog: 
text: But he stops just at the edge of the ferry, immobilized by fear.
dialog: 
text: Rob rushes forward, with Chaz in reserve, pulling Arch out of ·the
text: way. But Buck, the assistant ferryman, pre-empts them all, diving in.
dialog: 
text: Arch, frozen, watches from the deck with the others.
dialog: 
text: Buck resurfaces, but without any sign of Skip. Rob doesn't wait any
text: longer. He pulls off his shoes and dives in. Chaz gets ready to follow
text: suit. The panic mounts. Suddenly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIP'S VOICE
dialog: Hi, this what you're looking for?
dialog: 
scene_heading: THEY TURN;
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE CHANGE
dialog: 
text: Skip pulls himself up, dripping, on the other side of the ferry. He
text: holds up the knife -- and the padded sash beneath his shirt he used to
text: imbed the knife -- and grins from ear to ear. The others stare,
dialog: totally freaked.
dialog: 
text: Arch lets go, jumping in the air. Rob and Buck surface, to see as
dialog: well.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
dialog: We got 'em! Whoo-ee, did we nail 'em!
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: (as it dawns, to Skip)
text: April Fools... you crazy jerks. You crazy motherfuckin' jerks...
dialog: somebody could've gotten hurt out there!
dialog: 
text: Relief descends. Rob isn't laughing. But nobody's more impressed than
text: assistant Buck, still treading water.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUCK
speaker_heading: (GRINNING)
scene_heading: SH-I-I-I-T
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You maniacs... you almost gave us a heart attack!
dialog: 
text: Kit glowers at them and gives Rob a hand to get out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
speaker_heading: (TO CHAZ)
dialog: Well, at least we don't go in for this your-shoelace­is-untied crap!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: (dripping, to Arch and Skip)
dialog: I owe you one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIP
dialog: (smiles, to Buck in the water)
dialog: How's it goin' out there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUCK
dialog: That was great!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIP
dialog: I was really counting on these other turkeys to save
dialog: my ass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: Oh, too bad.
dialog: 
text: Skip extends a hand to Buck to help him out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIP
dialog: Sorry about that.
dialog: 
text: But Buck's in no hurry. The ferryman steps forward.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRYMAN
dialog: (unamused, to Buck)
dialog: Ok, c'mon, get out.

speaker_heading: CLOSE - HIS POV
text: A newspaper PHOTOGRAPH, circled in red marker, of a garish car
text: accident is pinned to the inside of the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: 
text: He puzzles, taking down the clipping, putting it down on the dresser
text: as he moves there to put away his rolled socks. He opens the top
dialog: drawer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POV
dialog: 
text: The same thing. Full of newspaper clippings of awful, fatal car
text: crashes, all circled in the same accusatory red ink.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RETURN ­ HARVEY
dialog: 
text: getting nervous.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Chaz burst in on him. Harvey turns quickly, shoving the
text: clippings back in the drawer and slamming it shut.
dialog: 
text: They stare at each other for a long, uncomfortable moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
speaker_heading: (FINALLY)
dialog: Wrong room.
dialog: 
text: He ducks back out the door, pulling it quietly closed behind him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Outside Harvey's door. Chaz sighs, shakes his head, starts to move
text: away when suddenly there is a LOUD BANG o.s. from inside Harvey's
text: room. Chaz turns quickly back to the door, reaches for the handle,
text: stops himself, thinks better of it and moves away again.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NIKKI'S ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Nikki steps up to the sink in the adjoining bathroom, turns the faucet
text: and is squirted by a spray of water jetting out of the rigged
dialog: plumbing.
dialog: 
text: She quickly shuts off the water and just stands for a moment,
text: dripping. trying to control her anger. Like, enough with Muffy's,
dialog: jokes already.
dialog: 
text: She comes out of the bathroom with a towel, drying her face, and walks
text: to the dresser. She strips off her shirt, pulls open the top dresser
text: drawers and sees... an eyeless black rubber bondage hood and other
dialog: miscellaneous S&amp;M accessories.
text: She picks them up in disbelief.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ARCH AND CHAZ'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Arch, unloading his shaving bag, which mainly contains a 30-day supply
text: of rubbers, opens the medicine cabinet. On its shelf... a kit neatly
text: filled with hypodermic syringes, needles, rubber tubing, razor blades
dialog: ...everything you could ever want for fixing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
dialog: Jesus...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FPONT STAIRCASE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Muffy, on her way down to straighten up, passes Rob and Kit on their

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: Goodnight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: G'night.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NAN'S ROOM ­ NIGHT
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON the shower head on the bathroom gushing water.
dialog: 
text: Nan is taking a shower.
dialog: 
text: CAMERA DOLLIES BACK slowly out of the bathroom and into the bedroom.
text: O.S. the shower is turned off. All is quiet.
dialog: 
text: Then, very faintly at first, WE HEAR something -- it sounds like
text: crying. As it grows gradually louder we realize that it is crying -- a
text: baby crying.
dialog: 
text: Nan appears suddenly in the bathroom doorway. A towel is wrapped
text: around her. She listens.
dialog: 
text: The crying is louder now, but muffled -- a baby crying for its mother.
text: It seems to come from a large mahogany wardrobe on the other side of
dialog: the room.
dialog: 
text: Nan tenses, slowly approaohing, then flinging open the wardrobe door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE ANGLE
dialog: 
text: A small cassette recorder plays. The tape runs out. The baby's cries
dialog: stop.
text: Nan rips out the cassette, and sinks back onto the bed, burying her
text: head in her hands.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ROB and KIT'S ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Rob and Kit are standing together staring INTO CAMERA. REVERSE to see
text: the object of their attention. Hanging on the wall in front of them is
text: a large oil portrait with the eyes out out. Something is moving behind
text: the canvas ­watching them.
dialog: 
text: Rob steps forward and lifts the painting off the wall. Behind it is an
text: inset bookcase. Sitting on one of the shelves, at the proper height to
text: have lined up with the holes in the portrait, is a child's Felix-the-
text: cat nursery clock. The eyes of the plastic cat move back and forth,
text: like a pendulum marking seconds.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Rob sets the painting on the floor outside their bedroom door, leaning
text: it up against the wall.
dialog: 
text: CAMERA DOLLIES IN for a CLOSE UP of the portrait. It looks much
text: creepier with the now vacant eye sockets.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ROB AND KIT'S ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: They are undressing on opposite sides of the bed. The silence between
text: them is thick enough to be cut with a knife. Kit sits down slowly on
text: the edge of the bed and quietly slips under the covers. Rob gets in on
dialog: his side.
dialog: 
text: They sit in silence for a moment, making no move to join each other in
text: the middle of the bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Rob?
dialog: 
dialog: No answer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: You still angry with me? About dinner?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: No. I'm sorry. I'm not angry with you. I'm just angry.
dialog: 
text: He leans over, turns off the bedside lamp... and the light in the
text: bathroom comes on. Beat.
dialog: 
text: He gets out of bed and crosses to the bathroom, reaches in
text: and turns off the light...
text: ...and the overhead light comes on. Kit starts to laugh and quickly
text: covers her mouth. Rob walks to the door, turns off the overhead
dialog: light...
dialog: 
text: ...and the bedside lamp comes on again. Kit laughs harder, but still
text: tries to stifle it.
dialog: 
text: Rob shoots her a look, then goes and sits on the edge of the bed. He
text: reaches to turn off the bedside lamp again, then thinks better of it
text: and starts to unscrew the bulb instead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: (burning his fingers)
dialog: Ouch! Jesus!
dialog: 
text: Kit can't stop herself any longer. She laughs out loud. Rob
text: perseveres, finally unscrewing the bulb enough to plunge the room into
dialog: darkness.
dialog: 
dialog: Silence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Very funny.
dialog: 
text: Kit breaks up laughing again. To her it is funny. And soon Rob is
text: laughing too. He swings his legs up under the covers beside her.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Muffy turns off the last of the lights downstairs, leaving the porch
text: light on for Skip.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Muffy moves through the quiet to her room. Arch grabs her. She jumps.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
speaker_heading: (COLLECTS HERSELF)
dialog: Arch do you know what time it is?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
dialog: Um-hmm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: (turning down his collar)
dialog: Goodnight, Arch.
dialog: 
text: Gently but firmly, she extricates herself, closing the bedroom door
text: behind her.
speaker_heading: ARCH
dialog: 
text: Undaunted, he scuttles down the hall to Rob and Kit's closed door to
text: listen in. He frowns, the slides farther down to Nikki's room, knocks
text: once softly, and enters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HIS POV
dialog: 
text: Nikki is already occupied, however, with Chaz. She catches Arch's
text: stare, signalling him to get the hell out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REVERSE
dialog: 
text: Arch valorously steps back, closing the door and returning to try Nan.
dialog: 
text: The light underneath her door flicks off, however. The door is also
dialog: locked.
dialog: 
text: Arch curses, returning to his large but empty room. He slams the door
dialog: for everybody's benefit.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MUFFY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Muffy, undressing, hears, and smiles.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ARCH'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Arch is pacing the bedroom, horny and alone. He gets an idea, goes and
text: rummages through Chaz' stuff and comes up with a video cassette of a
dialog: porno movie.
dialog: 
text: Carrying -the cassette he crosses to the door and turns the handle.
text: The doorknob comes off in his hand.
dialog: 
text: He throws it down in disgust, goes and sits in a chair and broods. The
text: chair collapses beneath him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BACK PATH - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Skip makes his way boldly, carelessly, drunkenly along. Overgrown
text: weeds and tall spring grass choke the path, shadowing his way. He
text: takes one last drink, killing the bottle, and hurls it out into the
dialog: night.
dialog: 
text: After a long pause there is the distant sound O.S. of the bottle
text: landing in water with a splash.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OLD , BOATHOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Skip emerges from the overgrowth. The abandoned old structure and its
text: dock squat ahead at water's edge. Beneath the boathouse, floating in
text: the water, is a grungy old skiff covered by a tarp.
text: Skip turns away from the dock, and flicks his lighter among the weeds,
text: finding marijuana growing there. He CACKLES with triumph.
dialog: 
text: Something MOVES nearby. He doesn't pay attention, taking out his knife
text: to cull the dried leaves. He cups them in his hand against the wind,
text: douses his lighter, and hurries out onto the dock to the boathouse
text: entrance to prepare his joint.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BOATHOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: as Skip enters. It is pitch black in here, and aside from the gentle
text: lapping sounds of water against the pilings down below O.S., all is
dialog: still.
dialog: 
text: Skip flips a lightswitch in the darkness and nothing happens. He edges
text: slowly along a wall away from the door. Then he becomes aware of
text: another living presence in the boathouse. It is a slow breathing
text: sound--completely inhuman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIP
dialog: Hello?
dialog: 
text: There is no answer, but the breathing continues. Then a sharp rapping
text: sound very near, like a foot striking the wood flooring.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIP
dialog: Who's there?
dialog: 
text: Pause. No answer. We hear in the darkness the sound of his switchblade
text: clicking open. And then he waits, straining his ears to hear.
dialog: 
text: Finally, Skip reaches into his pocket, puils out his lighter
text: and flicks it on.
dialog: 
text: Something snags him from behind.
dialog: 
text: Skip gasps, helpless, as a thick rope controlled by powerful, shadowed
text: hands tightens around his neck.
dialog: 
text: His knife, dried leaves and lighter cascade to the floor.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ST. JOHN HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER
dialog: 
text: Only the porch light remains glowing. The house is dark.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ROB AND KIT'S ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Rob wakes, hearing the CRY from Muff's room. Kit, naked against him,
text: wakes too. They hear the muffled cry again. It is not from lovemaking.
text: Rob throws off the covers.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Rob wraps himself with a towel, stepping quickly out to Muffy's door.
text: Everything else is dark and quiet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: (hushed, at door)
dialog: Muffy?
dialog: 
text: No answer. He tries her door, but it's locked tight.
dialog: 
text: A beat. Then:
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB (cont.)
speaker_heading: (CONCERNED)
dialog: Muffy?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY'S VOICE
speaker_heading: (UNCERTAINLY)
dialog: Yes?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: You OK?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY'S VOICE
speaker_heading: (DISTANTLY)
dialog: Yes... Thank you...
dialog: 
text: He pulls back from the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: (reluctantly, puzzled)
dialog: OK... well, goodnight...
dialog: 
text: No response. He turns back for his room, catching sight of Chaz, who
text: has come out of Nikki's room, to investigate, too.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - MORNING
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Harvey is out on the second floor balcony exercising vigorously. No
text: one else is in evidence until a bedroom window flies open and Nikki,
text: naked from the waist up and believing herself unwatched, leans out and
text: stretches, breathing in the sweet morning air.
dialog: 
text: Then she sees Harvey grinning at her. She quickly covers herself and
text: pulls back inside.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN ­ DAY
dialog: 
text: Rob and Kit are the first ones down. They enter from the dining room,
text: surprising Muffy at the stove.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
speaker_heading: (BRISKLY)
dialog: Good morning!
dialog: 
text: Muffy turns abruptly, startled. Rob and Kit stop abruptly, too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE
dialog: 
text: Muffy is barefooted, dressed in an old, worn chenille robe.
text: Her hair, normally carefully groomed, is unkempt, wild and stringy
text: about her pale face. Talk about unguarded moments. Her present
text: appearance, is the last way one would ever expect to find Muffy St.
dialog: John.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RETURN ANGLE
dialog: 
text: She shrinks back from them with a frightened, apologetic smile.
text: Scrambled eggs bubble in the skillet on the burner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: I... I was hungry...
dialog: 
text: She bumps against the stove, backing away. She self-consciously runs a
text: hand through her hair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY (cont.)
dialog: I... I must look a mess...
dialog: 
text: She scuttles out the door to the utility room and the back stairs
text: beyond, leaving the eggs to burn.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BACK STAIRS ­ DAY
dialog: 
text: Arch encounters her, too, as he comes bounding down in his workout
dialog: shorts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
dialog: Morning!
text: She backs away from him, scurrying up the stairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: I... forgot to get dressed...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
dialog: 
text: Arch enters, joining his wonderment to Rob and Kit's.
speaker_heading: ARCH
dialog: Who made her night?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BACK PORCH - DAY - LATER
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Arch, Chaz, Harvey and Nikki burst out the door in old clothes,
text: sweats, shorts, whatever -- an unlikely foursome for some informal
text: soccer scrimmaging.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
dialog: (always in search of more players)
dialog: Where's Skip?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: That depends on what he's on.
dialog: 
text: Rob and Kit cross their path, heading down to the water in their
text: swimsuits and overshirts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You gotta be kidding...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
dialog: (teasingly, an invitation)
dialog: Nan? What about it?
dialog: 
text: Nan watches from the porch, book in hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: Oh, no, thanks.
speaker_heading: (FALSELY)
dialog: Besides, I thought I'd wait and see what Muffy wanted to do...
dialog: 
text: Arch shrugs and the soccer free-for-all begins in earnest, with
text: special attention given to the interplay between Harvey and Nikki.
dialog: 
text: Up on the porch, Nan finally sees Muffy emerging from the distant tool
text: shed. Muffy is dressed plainly, oddly conventional, with a perceptible
text: sense of disorder about her. She keeps to herself, turning toward the
text: woods beyond, with cutting blade and mushroom basket in hand.
dialog: 
text: Nan puts down her book, hurrying off the porch. But by the timeshe
text: looks up again, Muffy is gone...
scene_heading: EXT. DOCK - DAY
dialog: 
text: Rob and Kit are standing together on the dock. He is dripping wet and
text: covered with goose flesh. She has not been in yet. And while he is
text: vigorously toweling off his arms and chest, trying to get the blood
text: circulating again, she stands behind him with another towel and
text: gently, lovingly dries his back. She finishes and he steps away from
text: her and gazes out across the sound.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Rob? What's wrong?
dialog: 
dialog: Pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: I swear it wasn't this cold yesterday .
dialog: 
text: This isn't what she meant, and he knows it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Are you giving up?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: (turning to her; gently)
dialog: What about you? What about your future? You're the one with the four
dialog: point.
speaker_heading: (DEJECTED)
dialog: ...maybe it's crazy--you investing so much energy in me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY)
text: I don't know. I'm scared. I don't know if I want what Mom and
dialog: everybody else expects of me. I don't want to go to law school.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
speaker_heading: (PROTESTING)
dialog: You've got a great mind
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: ...only it's not made up.
dialog: 
text: Smiling sadly, he crosses to her, puts his arms around her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Great... Do you realize how perfectly unmatched we are?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: It's made up about one thing though.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Yeah? What's that?
text: She looks up and kisses him softly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Will you feel the same about me a year from now? Two years, five years
dialog: from now?
dialog: 
text: She takes his hand and leads him down the pier and into the boathouse.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BOATHOUSE - DAY
text: As they come inside. Kit closes the door, and immediately they are in
text: each other's arms.
dialog: 
text: The surging waves swirl beneath them, visible through the shrunken
text: floorboards. Rob and Kit stretch out. All the passion, all the
text: tenderness, all the intensity makes them oblivious to the fact that
text: something is moving on the water below...
dialog: 
text: And when Kit finally opens her eyes to it, Skip's face bulges
text: gruesomely up at her through the slatted floor!
dialog: 
text: Kit screams and scrambles to her feet--Rob completely uncomprehending
text: until he sees it too: Skip's body, pale and bloodied, draped within
text: the grungy skiff passing beneath them on the waves.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DOCK - DAY
dialog: 
text: By the time he pulls on his swimsuit and comes rushing out
text: with Kit, however, Rob's shock has turned to rage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Skip! You sonofabitch!
dialog: 
text: But there's no response, Skip's body unmoving on the self-powered
text: skiff which continues bobbing out to sea.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: 
text: starts to wonder whether it really is a joke. He hurries forward,
text: plunging 'into the water to reach the boat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Skip... Skip!
dialog: 
text: But it's too far and getting farther, and the waves are too strong.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ST. JOHN HOUSE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Rob and Kit come struggling up the path. Chaz trains his videopak on
text: them from the porch . He, Arch, Harvey and Nikki unwind with beer and
text: sandwiches after their sweaty workout.
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: (commentary while he tapes)
text: Respectable young Quaker couple returning after quiet afternoon of

speaker_heading: ARCH
speaker_heading: (CALLING )

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Where's Skip? Anybody seen him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Who wants to know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Goddammit, can't you give me a straight answer!
dialog: 
text: They sit up with the force. Nan comes out on the porch, hearing .
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
speaker_heading: (FRANTICALLY)
text: We saw him... on a boat... drifting by the pier. He wasn't movinq. He
dialog: looked dead... unless he was joking...!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: Well, if it was Skip...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: I saw his face!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
speaker_heading: (DEMANDINGLY)
dialog: Has anybody seen him since last night?
dialog: 
text: They all realize they haven't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB (cont .)
dialog: Jesus Christ...
dialog: 
text: Rob turns, rushing into the house.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ENTRY HALL - DAY
dialog: 
text: Rob stops as he notices, near the foot of the stairs where he'd parked
dialog: it upon first entering the house yesterday afternoon, Skip's overnight
dialog: bag.
dialog: 
text: He turns and bounds up the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: Rob runs down to Skip's door and flings it open. A cheap rubber
text: hobgoblin drops suddenly in front of him, suspended from the ceiling
text: on frail, metal springs.
dialog: 
text: Rob jumps back with a startled cry, then angrily tears the thing out
text: of his way and throws it down.
dialog: 
text: This is the last of Muffy's little April Fool's gags, and as with the
text: overnight bag, it signifies that Skip has been nowhere near this room.
dialog: 
text: But Rob steps inside and looks around just to make sure.
dialog: 
text: The room is untouched, the bed unslept in.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT . PORCH - DAY
dialog: 
text: Rob hurries out, as Muffy finally appears, emerging from the wooded
text: grounds, basketful of mushrooms in hand. She approaches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: (noticing their distress )
dialog: Something wrong?
dialog: 
text: Rob rushes by her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
dialog: Wait! I'll go with you!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: Me too!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DOCK - DAY
dialog: 
text: As Rob, Arch and Chaz come running down to the water. They stop and
text: look around, seeing nothing.
dialog: 
dialog: No answer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
dialog: (aloud: for Skip)
dialog: Hey, asshole!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: Wait a minute! Look at this!
dialog: 
text: He has found on the little pebbled beach beside the dock, Skip's
text: switchblade. It is in pieces. There's blood on the broken blade.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: This was Skip's.
speaker_heading: ARCH
dialog: What do you think? That guy on the ferry?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
text: I don't know. I don't know what to think.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
dialog: I say we go looking for him, him or Skip. One of them's bound to still
dialog: be around... somewhere.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: You mean split up?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Let's not take any chances. He was... He was pretty big.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
dialog: No sucker's taken me yet.
dialog: 
text: He rips a loose board off the dock for a club.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. UTILITY ROOM - HOUSE ­ DAY
dialog: 
text: In the gathering twilight, Muffy puts the basket of mushrooms away on
text: a shelf. Someone grabs her wrist. She gasps. It's Nan. Nan steps from
text: the shadows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: I know why you're avoiding me...
speaker_heading: (DISTRAUGHT)
dialog: I guess it's your idea of a joke... that's why you invited me. How'd
dialog: you find out? From one of his preppy 'friends'? Who else have you
dialog: told?... Who else knows, except the father!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
speaker_heading: (ASTONISHED)
dialog: I... don't know what you're talking about.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: Oh? The tape just got there? You know very well... my abortion!
dialog: 
text: She comes apart, in tears. Muffy stares, uncomprehending.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAN (cont.)
dialog: I thought you wanted to be friends... you think you can play with
dialog: people's feelings just because you're rich and can do what you want.
dialog: Well, you can't...!
dialog: 
text: She rushes out the rear door. Muffy tries to recover, confused.
dialog: 
text: She continues on to the back entrance to the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
dialog: 
text: Swinging open the door, she almost runs into Harvey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARVEY
speaker_heading: (SHEEPISHLY)
dialog: Sorry... I was just checkin' to make sure everybody was all right.
dialog: 
text: He beats a hasty retreat the other way, passing Nikki on her way in
text: Nikki raises an eyebrow at Muffy, misinterpreting the tension in the
dialog: air.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Harvey? No kidding'?
dialog: 
dialog: Maybe that explains your clothes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
speaker_heading: (NERVOUSLY)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Oh, c'mon.

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY
dialog: 
text: The path is narrow and tortuous . Arch uses his club to clear the way,

dialog: contact.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
dialog: Hey, shithead! chickendick!... yeah, you! Skip!
dialog: 
text: He moves deeper and deeper into the forest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOW ANGLE
dialog:

speaker_heading: ARCH
speaker_heading: (THUNDERING )

speaker_heading: ARCH

speaker_heading: LOW ANGLE
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Arch's foot comes down just missing it, less than six inches away,
text: when suddenly the ground seems to move. A noose springs up, tightens
text: around his ankle, and Arch is lifted into the air upside down,
text: swinging wildly, dropping his club.
dialog: 
text: Now the viper strikes, and Arch sees it. He is shrieking with horror
text: as he tries to bat the creature away from him. But he keeps swinging

dialog: opening.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly a long, gleaming blade ENTERS FRAME and chops the snake in
dialog: two.

speaker_heading: MUFFY
speaker_heading: (CAREFULLY)

speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Rob? No, we haven 't been able to get through to the mainland yet.

speaker_heading: NIKKI
speaker_heading: (SEEING)

dialog: 
text: She reaches for the wooden bucket attached by metal nook to the thick

speaker_heading: HARVEY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You mean, back home on the farm?
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I know you think I'm a hick, but I'd like to change your mind about

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Because, I'd really like to plow your field.

speaker_heading: NIKKI
speaker_heading: (SMILES" IMPRESSED)
dialog: Draw me some water.
dialog: 
text: He's glad to oblige, opening the hinged wood well cover and lowering

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Aw, crap...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: What happened?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: I lost the bucket.

speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Harve.

speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Hal. The rope was rotten, any fool coulda seen that.

speaker_heading: NIKKI

speaker_heading: HARVEY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HER POV
dialog: 
text: Nan's body lies twisted and jammed among the slime. Her dress is torn,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog:

speaker_heading: NIKKI
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY)
dialog: It's all because of what happened on the ferry, isn't it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
speaker_heading: (HIMSELF UNNERVED)
dialog: It was an accident. Don't they know that?
dialog:

speaker_heading: ROB

speaker_heading: ROB

scene_heading: CLOSE - THE PHOTOGRAPH
dialog: 
text: It is a black-and-white picture, probably Muffy as a child. But

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT

speaker_heading: CHAZ

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Nikki?
dialog: 
text: CAMERA FRAMES the open bedroom window for a beat. The curtains luff
text: slightly in response to a gentle breeze wafting in.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Nikki comes down the hall with some more clothes on her arm. She
text: arrives at her door, opens it (she had not closed it the last time she
text: went out), and goes inside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NIKKI'S ROOM - SAME
text: Chaz is still lying across the bed as last seen, except that now his
text: hands cover his crotch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
speaker_heading: (NOTICING)
dialog: Real subtle, Chaz.
dialog: 
text: She continues packing, moving around the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI (CONT.)
dialog: Now I'm supposed to throw off my clothes and jump on you? Just wind
dialog: her up and watch her go? You've got a lot to learn, buddy.
dialog: 
text: No response. Chaz lies perfectly still. Not even his chest appears to
dialog: be moving.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
text: (looking at his crotch again)
dialog: What is this? Show and tell?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I'll show you mine if you show me yours?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Well, forget it... You may as well just stick it back in your pants.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Chaz?... Chaz?
speaker_heading: (NO ANSWER)
dialog: Say something, goddammit!
dialog: 
text: She swats his hands away from his crotch. Beneath them, on his pants,
text: is a slowly growing blood stain.
dialog: 
text: Nikki gasps, her mouth contorting into a scream that will not come.
text: She turns suddenly in response to .a NOISE O.S., and sees a DARK
text: FIGURE stepping out from behind the slowly closing bedroom door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT . ATTIC STAIRS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: It is almost pitch black. O.S. there is the sound of a lightswitch
text: being flicked on and off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB (O.S.)
dialog: No lights.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly a flashlight beam pierces the darkness, and Rob and Kit can
text: now be seen ascending the stairs to the attic.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: ...as they arrive at the top. Rob sweeps the one large room with her
text: flashlight. Piles of old furniture are stacked here and there, covered
text: with grimy sheets.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: No one's been up here in years.
dialog: 
text: Rob crosses to the garret windows overlooking the sound.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Can you see him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
text: NO. There must not be a light on the boat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Or... he's chosen not to use it.
speaker_heading: ROB
text: Kit? He said something else on the phone, about Muffy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: He said not to trust anybody. That's why we were to stay together. No
dialog: one was to be left alone with anyone else... Then he said, especially
dialog: not with Muffy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: So that's why you let her go upstairs?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: That's why I let her go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: What did he mean by that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: I don't know. He wouldn't explain it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: But that's ridiculous...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Is it? He's known her longer than we have.
dialog: 
text: He sweeps the flashlight back toward the stairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Rob, wait a minute. What's that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Where?
dialog: 
text: She takes the flashlight from him and aims it on something near the
text: door--the Barbie and Ken dolls from the previous night's dinner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: It's just the dolls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: She's been up here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: So?
text: She moves toward them while Rob stays by the windows looking out. As
text: she gets closer to the dolls, however, Kit realizes that they have not
text: just been stuck there haphazardly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
speaker_heading: (ALARMED)
dialog: Rob?
dialog: 
text: Rob comes over to join her as we CUT TO:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HER POV
dialog: 
text: of the dolls as the flashlight moves across them, slowly revealing
text: them one by one. The last to be seen are a Barbie and the heads of two
text: Kens stuck in a bowl of water.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB AND KlT
dialog: 
text: staring at them, frightened and astonished.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Jesus...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
speaker_heading: (LOSING IT)
dialog: Rob? . . .
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
text: It's Arch and Skip and Nan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Rob??...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Wait...
dialog: 
text: He takes the flashlight from her and reveals two more: a Barbie and a
text: Ken lying next to each other with no clothes on, both of them
text: splattered with bright red nail polish.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: What are these other two?
dialog: 
text: Suddenly the room is flooded with light. Rob turns sharply and sees
text: outside the window the Constable's flare hanging in the night sky.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: He's here!
dialog: 
text: O.S. there is a PISTOL SHOT from downstairs. Kit screams.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Come on!
dialog: 
text: He jumps to his feet, grabs hold of her hand and pulls her with him
text: out of the attic.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: as they come racing down from the attic. Rob heads for the
dialog: main staircase...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Hal!
dialog: 
text: ...while Kit runs down the hall to Nikki's room and flings
text: open the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Nikki?
dialog: 
text: She isn't there.
dialog: 
text: Kit backs into the hallway. Downstairs O.S. she can hear Rob moving
text: about, calling for Harvey, but up here all is quiet and threatening.
dialog: 
text: She hurries silently down to Chaz' room, opens the door and steps
dialog: inside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHAZ' ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: It is dark again in here, but the video camera is still operating. Kit
text: closes the door behind her and leans forward, barely whispering...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Chaz?... Nikki?...
dialog: 
text: She turns on the light and sees the bed, both beds: they are drenched
dialog: in blood.
dialog: 
text: Kit reaches for the doorknob. It comes off in her hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Rob!!!
dialog: 
text: She's frantically pounding on the door and trying to jam the doorknob
text: back in, to get it to work.
dialog: 
text: There's a NOISE outside the window. She turns aghast. Suddenly the
text: door flies open.
speaker_heading: ROB
speaker_heading: (ENTERING)
dialog: I can't find Hal--
dialog: 
text: He stops in mid-sentence as he sees the beds. Kit is already through
text: the door. Rob follows her out.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALL . - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Rob is running with her toward the stairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Rob, what about Muffy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Forget her!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
speaker_heading: (STOPPING HIM)
dialog: She's my friend!
dialog: 
text: She breaks away from him and dashes down to Muffy's door. Rob has no
dialog: choice but to follow her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
speaker_heading: (KNOCKING)
dialog: Muffy! Muffy!!
dialog: 
text: She tries the door, but it's locked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: (pulling her away)
dialog: Let's go.
dialog: 
text: Rounding the corner to the shadowy back stairs, Rob suddenly bumps
text: into something, someone there. He screams aloud, dropping his
dialog: flashlight.
dialog: 
text: It is Harvey. His body dangles from the rafters high above the top of
text: the rear stairs, a thick rope around his neck.
dialog: 
text: Now Rob has become unnerved, and it is Kit's turn to take the lead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: This way!
dialog: 
text: And they head back toward the main staircase.
scene_heading: EXT DOCK. -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The flarelight wanes. Constable Potter looks up anxiously. Soon he
text: will be waiting in darkness . (Unlike the previous night's scene, now
dialog: there are no outdoor lights on here.)
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BACK OF THE HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Rob and Kit burst out of the dining room as if the house were on fire.
text: Kit stops to pull the doors shut behind them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: (yanking her away)
dialog: Forget the doors!
dialog: 
text: Within moments they have crossed the back yard and disappeared into
text: the brush leading down to the water.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PATHWAYS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The night is a landscape of terror. As Rob and Kit race through the
text: darkness, the forest seems to fold in on top of them, completely
text: enclosing them within itself.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DOCK - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: They arrive at the water's edge and slow down abruptly. Though they
text: can see Potter's boat rocking gently in the water, moored to the dock,
text: they cannot make out any sign of the Constable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: (in guarded approach)
dialog: Constable... Mr. Potter?
dialog: 
text: No answer. The silence is chilling. They proceed out onto the dock.
text: They come to the boat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
speaker_heading: (WHISPERING)
dialog: If there's another flare, we can signal him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
text: Maybe he went on to the house.
dialog: 
text: Rob unlashes the mooring, grabbing hold of the line to pull the boat
text: in. It won't budge, the line snagged in the water where it dips in.
text: Rob tugs harder, freeing something to the surface.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE ANGLE
dialog: 
text: It is Constable Potter, his body turning once before sinking again
text: under its tethered weights.
text: An animal cries out behind them. Rob wastes no more time, pulling the
text: rope and the boat quickly toward them. They jump in.
dialog: 
text: There is a flashlight in the toolbox. Rob grabs it, shining it onto
text: the controls. But there's no key in the ignition, and no other way to
dialog: start it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Shit... no key!
dialog: 
text: Kit, meanwhile, picks up the LETTER that's lying on the bottom of the
dialog: boat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Rob!
dialog: 
text: He turns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT (cont.)
dialog: Look!
dialog: 
text: She presses it into his hands. He shines the flashlight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSER ANGLE
dialog: 
text: Its waterstained, but still legible... The letterhead reads, 'STATE
text: HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE,' and it is dated 'MARCH 31,'
text: addressed to Potter, and reads:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RETURN ANGLE
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: "...Pursuant to our previous communication, please be advised that the
text: patient under discussion has still not been found and returned to
text: custody, and it now believed to be attempting to return to her home in
dialog: your jurisdiction. If encountered, exercise extreme caution and notify
dialog: us immediately, as Miss St. John has ·been a patient here for three
text: years and is still considered incorrigibly unstable and extremely
dialog: dangerous..."
dialog: 
text: Kit looks up, frantic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
text: Miss .St. John? What's it talking about? Muffy hasn't been in any
dialog: state mental institution for the last three years -- she's been at
dialog: Vassar!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: I don't know... but we've gotta get this boat started.
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: How?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: The house. Didn't Muffy say there was another key back in the kitchen?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
speaker_heading: (IN DREAD)
dialog: Oh, no...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: We've got no choice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: I know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Shit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUSE
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Rob?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Rob, I really don't want to go back there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: I know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Shit.
dialog: 
text: Another pause. Neither one is making the move to go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: I'd have you stay here, but--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Listen, Kit, we'll get out of here, I promise you. We've been through
dialog: so much together...
dialog: 
text: She has started to cry softly.
speaker_heading: ROB (cont.)
dialog: ...it isn't going to end here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
speaker_heading: (BEING BRAVE)
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 
text: He kisses her. Pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Well...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Yeah...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Let's go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Let's go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Let's go.
dialog: 
text: Brief pause, then he turns to go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Shit...
dialog: 
text: They move slowly off the dock.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GROUNDS OF HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Rob and Kit move up to the shrubbery skirting the back lawn and gaze
text: across at the house. It is completely dark within and remains wrapped
text: in silence as before.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
text: Rob, look! The doors. They've been closed.
dialog: 
text: Sure enough, the doors they come out by minutes ago, the ones they
text: didn't stop to close, are now shut tight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Come on.
dialog: 
text: They move stealthily through the bushes around to the side of the
text: house. They stop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: There.
text: He is pointing toward the open basement window across a thirty foot
text: space of clear lawn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: That's how we're going in.
dialog: 
text: Kit swallows hard.
dialog: 
text: She nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Are you with me?
dialog: 
text: They break from their cover and run, keeping low, to the side of the
text: house. Rob peers through the window into the darkness inside , pushes
text: the transom all the way open, and then drags himself through on his
dialog: belly.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: He drops to the floor, turning to give Kit a hand. She enters the
text: same, dusting herself off next to him. Rob turns on the flashlight,
text: using it cautiously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: (moving through darkness)
dialog: The stairs... Where are the stairs?...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: What's that?
dialog: 
text: They pause, hearing
dialog: 
text: DRIPPING SOUNDS in the darkness , comi ng from the depths of the
text: utility room.
dialog: 
text: Rob leads the way, cautiously, toward the sound.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT . UTILITY ROOM
dialog: 
text: The flashlight cuts through the dark, revealing the tap DRIPPING in
dialog: the tub.
dialog: 
text: Before, the tub was clean. NOW, however, stubborn crimson STAINS smear
text: the basin, like blood that has refused to be washed away. Other stains
text: darken the floor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
dialog: 
text: Kit's eyes widen in growing horrow. Rob turns the beam toward the
text: stains that track across the floor, following them.
speaker_heading: KIT
speaker_heading: (FEARFULLY)
dialog: Rob...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT
dialog: 
text: The trail leads out of the utility room to the large, cast-iron
text: incinerator. Rob steps forward, slowly opening its door, angling the
text: beam inside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: THEIR POV - INCINERATOR
dialog: 
text: Inside, Muffy's characteristic attire -- the clothes we saw her
text: wearing yesterday after their arrival -- lie stuffed inside, bloodied
text: and charred.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Muffy's clothes...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
speaker_heading: (PUZZLED)
dialog: I don't get it.
dialog: 
text: The beam momentarily sweeps the wall next to Kit. She sees something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: (an urgent whisper)
dialog: Rob!
dialog: 
text: She gets him to turn the beam back to the wall where she is. She helps
dialog: train it on what she saw.
dialog: 
scene_heading: POV - THE WALL
dialog: 
text: It is a growth ·chart that has been marked in ink faded over the
dialog: years. There are growth measurements for 'MUFFY'... and for ·a child
text: named 'BUFFY"... with similar heights on similar dates.
dialog: 
scene_heading: RETURN ON KIT
dialog: 
text: She gasps, finally connecting it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Oh, god... oh no!...
dialog: 
text: He doesn't yet understand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: ...the picture of the girls in the study... the letter... what the
dialog: Constable was trying to tell you... It's not Muffy it's her twin
dialog: sister, Buffy! She has a twin sister!
text: Rob's eyes have a glazed look. They are fixed somewhere else.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Rob, don't you see?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Rob?
dialog: 
text: She follows his look and sees, on the wall near the growth chart, that
text: he has trained his flashlight beam on the eyeless portrait from the
text: night before. Only now, there are REAL EYES BEHIND THE PAINTING,
text: STARING OUT AT THEM.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
speaker_heading: (HUSHED)
dialog: Rob!
dialog: 
text: He casts about for a weapon, coming up with a length of lead pipe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Pull it away...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: (too frightened to move)
dialog: Rob?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Pull it away!
dialog: 
text: They advance together on the painting, Rob keeping his flashlight on
text: the eyes the entire time. Kit slowly reaces out, lifts the painting
text: from the wall and drops it, jumping back... just as MUFFY'S HEAD rolls
text: forward from a shelf behind the painting, right into Kit's lap!
dialog: 
text: Kit screams as she bobbles the head in her hands like a hot potato,
text: trying to get rid of it.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly a loud NOISE slams at the basement window. Rob grabs Kit,
text: covering her mouth and snapping off .the flashlight. The head falls to
text: the. floor at their feet. They turn...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THEIR POV
dialog: 
text: ...just in time to see the window they entered being nailed shut from
text: the outside. All else they can make out are Buffy's hands and her
text: tell-tale nurse shoes. Then these two move of sight around the outside
dialog: of the house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BASEMENT
dialog: 
text: Rob clicks on the beam in the direction they went and sees the stairs.
text: They race to them, up them, the door to the pantry is not locked. It
text: gives way under Rob's pressure.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PANTRY ­ NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Kit scrambles up behind him. They can hear Buffy outside in the yard
text: APPROACHING the kitchen door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Rob and Kit hurry in. Rob searches frantically for the key board.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: The boat key... it's gotta be here...
dialog: 
text: His flashlight sweeps the walls of shelves. Suddenly, Buffy is at the
text: kitchen door. Though the door in locked, there's no bolt or chain to
text: fully secure it. The knob RATTLES furiously under Buffy's grip, the
text: door SHUDDERS.
dialog: 
text: Rob spots a walk-in cupboard. He hurries to it. Kit gropes along the
text: shelves, searching the objects hanging along the distant wall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KITCHEN DOOR
dialog: 
text: A long, ugly-looking knife blade slips in through the crack in the
text: door. Buffy is using it to try to pry open the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUPBOARD
dialog: 
text: Rob opens the door. Success. His beam falls on the key board on the
text: inner wall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Kit... I
dialog: 
text: He steps in, following his beam into the darkness. The cupboard door
text: SLAMS shut behind him. He turns, trapped.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ANGLE - KITCHEN DOOR
dialog: 
text: The door springs open.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KITCHEN
dialog: 
text: Kit spins, crying out as she sees:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HER POV
dialog: 
text: The shadowed figure of BUFFY, barefooted, disheveled, in a smock,
text: dagger in hand. She advances, breathing heavily.
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: 
text: stumbles back desperately.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: No...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CUPBOARD
text: Rob is desperately trying to break out, but the door won't open.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Kit! Let me out! Let me out of here! Kit!!
dialog: 
text: He is kicking the door, hurling himself at the door, but all to no
text: effect. He barely has room to maneuver.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT (O.S.)
dialog: Rob!!!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
text: Kit turns to Rob's voice, takes a step toward the cupboard, but
text: suddenly Buffy is there, cutting her off.
dialog: 
text: Kit backes away, into the dining room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CUPBOARD
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
scene_heading: (POUNDING FUTILELY)
dialog: Kit! Run, Kit, run!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM
dialog: 
text: Kit reels back under Buffy's steady advance. Kit can't see her clearly
text: in the dim light, but she can make out, beneath Buffy's wild, stringy,
text: dangling hair, the madness, the likeness of Muffy -- the familiar face
text: somehow twisted by hate and madness into a stiff, hideous, unnatural
dialog: deformation.
dialog: 
text: Buffy closes in, readying the long, greedy knife.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CUPBOARD
dialog: 
text: Rob, still struggling, knows Kit is about to die.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Kit! I love you!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT . DINING R.OOM
dialog: 
text: Cornered, helpless, Kit stumbles back toward the closed double doors
text: that lead to the living room.
speaker_heading: KIT
text: Buffy?... please, we didn't mean any harm... we're leaving... we just
dialog: want to go home... please... please...
dialog: 
text: Buffy raises the dagger in hand.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CUPBOARD
dialog: 
text: No longer trying to escape. It's hopeless.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: (for all he's worth)
dialog: Kit! I love you! I love you, Kit!
dialog: 
text: A man's HAND reaches out from the side, lightly touching Rob's
text: shoulder. Rob jumps, turning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE
dialog: 
text: It is Buck, standing practically right beside him, staring at Rob. His
text: face is the same bloody, hideous mess it was the day before, after the
dialog: accident.
dialog: 
text: Rob screams.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUCK
dialog: I love you too, babe.
dialog: 
text: Rob swings at him, but only succeeds in smashing his knuckles against
text: the door.
dialog: 
text: Buck grabs him and violently plants a kiss on his cheek.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM
dialog: 
text: Kit slams back against the double doors, nowhere to go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: No... Oh, God...
dialog: 
text: and Buffy strikes. The knife jabs into the door, close to Kit's head.
text: Kit gasps, momentarily spared. She pushes apart the double doors and
text: stumbles back into...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
dialog: 
text: All the lights are on, and when Kit takes her eyes off Buffy long
text: enough to find out why, she discovers everyone is here -- Skip, Chaz,
text: Nikki, Arch, Harvey, Nan, even the Constable and the ferryman. They
text: sit or casually stand, quietly talking or reading magazines, taking no
dialog: notice of her whatsoever.
scene_heading: INT. CUPBOARD
dialog: 
text: Rob is screaming uncontrollably. Buck calmly peels all the blood and
text: gore right off his face and slaps in onto Rob. Rob keeps screaming.
text: Then Buck reaches out and unlatches the door. It was right there the
dialog: whole time.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
dialog: 
text: Kit is totally bewildered...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
scene_heading: (LOOKING AROUND)
dialog: What.... ?
dialog: 
text: Then she looks back at Buffy who steps into the living room, and
text: smiling, holds up the knife and plunges it into her own hand. The
text: blade is retractable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: (wrought with emotion)
dialog: Oh, fuck you!! Fuck you, you guys!!
dialog: 
text: Suddenly everyone in the room comes to life, roaring with laughter.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
dialog: 
text: Rob stumbles out of the cupboard, Buck's gory make-up still stuck to
text: his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Kit! !
dialog: 
text: Still frightened and confused, Rob hasn't put it together yet. He runs
text: out of the kitchen...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT LIVING ROOM
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Muffy is wiping off the last of her "Buffy" make-up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: You guys are really terrific. I love you all. And I thank you from
dialog: the bottom of my heart for being such good sports.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
speaker_heading: (STILL SHAKEN)
dialog: Oh, sure. Quite welcome. Any time.
dialog: 
text: He sits, or rather lands, on the sofa next to Kit.
dialog: 
text: Laughter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: Rob, you and Kit, you two were the best. You figured it all
dialog: out. The clues really worked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: What clues?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: What's this all about? And don't anyone say "April Fool's" or I'll
dialog: smack them in the teeth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: How about if I told you it was the script for a weekend special
dialog: that's going to help me keep this house...
dialog: 
text: Rob and Kit stare, mystified.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
speaker_heading: (SMILING)
dialog: Look, next month I get the house as part of my inheritance, it's true,
dialog: but only if I can show my father that it can carry itself... what with
dialog: taxes and expenses. Otherwise, he'll just sell it out of the family.
dialog: So, I'm planning on turning it into a country inn. Not just another
text: stuffy old run-of-the-mill country inn, but one that specializes in
dialog: offering once-in-a lifetime Whodunit Weekends. I needed a rehearsal. I
dialog: had to try out the idea on somebody.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
speaker_heading: (TO OTHERS)
dialog: And you guys played along?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
dialog: Don't look at me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: We all got sucked in just as bad as you!
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: Once they were killed off, yes. Everybody had to cooperate. Otherwise,
dialog: none of it would have worked!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: So I guess there's no crazy twin sister Buffy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: Oh, there's a crazy twin all right, but his name isn't Buffy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: His name?
dialog: 
text: Muffy smiles, directing attention toward "cousin" Skip.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: Skip?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: He's your brother?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
dialog: You bastard, you were in on the whole deal, too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIP
speaker_heading: (PROTESTING)
dialog: Only the set-up. Muffy told me to say I was her cousin and to pull
dialog: that prank on the ferry. I had no idea what was going to happen with
dialog: Buck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
speaker_heading: (INTRODUCING)
text: Buck Williams. make-up artist par excellence, from Hollywood.
dialog: 
text: Buck reaches down and tosses Arch's decapitated head to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUCK
dialog: Here, catch.
dialog: 
text: Arch bobbles the head nervously. The others laugh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUCK
dialog: Just some old props I redressed with the help of photographs Muffy
dialog: sent me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: It sure fooled me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
speaker_heading: (TO SKIP)
dialog: So what castle are you going to inherit?
speaker_heading: CONSTABLE POTTER
speaker_heading: (CRITICALLY)
dialog: Well, first he's got to prove he can manage his own allowance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: (to the Constable)
dialog: Which means, I guess, that you're no constable either.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: Kit Graham, meet my Uncle Frank St. John of St. John et Freres, Wall
dialog: Street.
dialog: 
text: Uncle Frank smiles and waves at Kit, but Harvey steps right over to
text: him and starts pumping his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Hi! Harvey "Hal" Edison, Jr. Pleased to meet you, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: Usually we don't even see Uncle Frank in the summer, he's so busy.
dialog: But this time he made an exception.
speaker_heading: UNCLE FRANK
dialog: I haven't had this much fun since my Hasty pudding Show sophomore year
dialog: at Harvard. God, lowe you kids!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FERRYMAN CAL
speaker_heading: (EAGERLY)
dialog: How'd I do? I never did no acting before. Boy, was I shaking!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: Cal's our regular ferryman between the mainland and the islands around
dialog: here... but I thought he was up to the dramatic challenge.
speaker_heading: (BEAT: SMILING)
dialog: Well, that's it. Now you know it all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: We have been had.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: You're lucky you didn't get yourself killed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: I almost did with Harvey. And who could know there would be a snake
dialog: out in the woods with Arch? But with the paying guests, they'll know
dialog: what they're in for: and the scenario won't be nearly so extreme.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE FRANK
dialog: Otherwise, even Lloyd's of London won't cover you.
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: ...And I regret that, well, some of those fake clues I planted in the
dialog: bedrooms I guess were taken too seriously. I'm sorry about
dialog: that.
dialog: 
text: She avoids looking at Nan so as not to draw attention to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY (cont.)
dialog: But we had fun, didn't we? I mean, come on.
dialog: 
text: She starts passing .out chilled champagne bottles to the men
text: to open, and setting up glasses on a sideboard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY (cont.)
dialog: I know I'll never forget this weekend for as long as I live.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
dialog: You're telling me. Man, when I was swinging around out there in the
text: woods, I nearly crapped my pants.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: What do you mean, nearly? I was there, remember?
dialog: 
text: Silence. Arch turns red.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY)
dialog: Arch? You browned your trousers?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
speaker_heading: (BEAT; STAMMERING)
dialog: Well... I...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE FRANK
scene_heading: (GOOD-NATUREDLY)
dialog: It's all right, Arch. They'll be out of the dryer soon.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly everyone roars with laughter. Champagne corks start popping,
text: and before you know it, the scene is resembling the locker room of the
text: winning team of a championship series.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Breakfast. Spirits are high. Friendships rekindled, and the spread is
text: incredible. Muffy enters with a fresh basket of piping hot biscuits.
text: Only Nikki, Harvey, and Cal are not present.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
dialog: Great ham.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUCK
dialog: Great eggs.
speaker_heading: CHAZ
speaker_heading: (TEASING)
dialog: Just what we need. Another country inn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE FRANK
text: Well, if the food's any indication, it's already half-way there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIP
dialog: Pass the toxic wastes, please.
dialog: 
text: Uncle Frank frowns at Skip as Cal enters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAL
speaker_heading: (PLEASANTLY)

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

speaker_heading: ROB

speaker_heading: KIT
speaker_heading: (TURNS; SOFTLY)
dialog: I don't care what Columbia says about you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: I do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Is this the road to med school?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: I think it is. I'm going to try.
dialog: 
text: He takes her by the hand and gazes at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: But if I make it or not, no matter what happens, we'll be together?
dialog: You and me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY)
dialog: If that's what you want.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
speaker_heading: (HUGGING HER)
dialog: That's what I want.
text: Muffy enters with a stack of dishes, followed by Nan who quietly sets
text: her plate on the counter and leaves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: Where's Nikki?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: I don't know. Too much champagne?
dialog: 
text: o.s. they hear a muffled cry.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NIKKI'S ROOM - MORNING
dialog: 
text: ...as Harvey finishes plowing her field. They lie still for a moment.

speaker_heading: NIKKI
speaker_heading: (STILL GASPING)
dialog: God... don't tell me that was something you learned on the farm!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BACK PORCH - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Uncle Frank is hugging Muffy. (nothing seedy). They are alone out
dialog: here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE FRANK
dialog: I'll make a full and glowing report to your father tomorrow so he can
dialog: draw up the deed along with the other trust papers for Wednesday's
dialog: signing. I'm so proud of you.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I wish I could say the same about your brother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: Oh, Uncle Frank, he's been a great help this weekend, really. Let me
dialog: get him out here so you can--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE FRANK
dialog: I've already spoken with him.
dialog: 
text: The screen door opens, and Rob steps out onto the porch. He comes over
text: to them, but does not butt into their conversation, and Uncle Frank
text: just keeps going as if Rob weren't even there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE FRANK (cont.)
text: His conduct and his academic performance remain inexcusable. He knows
dialog: your father can't be expected to entrust him with anything until he
text: shows some signs of responsibility and initiative.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: (embarrassed to be overhearing)
dialog: Excuse me.
text: He turns and walks back into the house.
dialog: 
text: O.S. a horn honking.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - MORNING
dialog: 
text: The van and the old pickup are idling out front. Uncle Frank is
text: honking on the van horn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE FRANK
dialog: Come on! Let's go!
dialog: 
text: Cal is alone behind the wheel of the pickup.
dialog: 
text: Skip walks casually up to the van, then pointedly turns away and heads
text: over to the pickup instead. Uncle Frank scowls.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE - FRONT DOOR
dialog: 
text: Rob and Kit come out the door and stop beside Muffy.
dialog: 
text: More honking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Well, I hate to say it -- I still ought to kill you -- but thanks.
speaker_heading: (THEY HUG)
dialog: See you back there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE FRANK
dialog: Come on. If time is money, we're losing a fortune.
dialog: 
text: Nikki now runs out followed closely by Harvey. They say their quick
text: farewells and move along to the waiting vehicles.
dialog: 
text: Harvey discreetly opts to ride in the pickup, while Nikki climbs
text: aboard the van, passing Chaz who just glares at her. He knows. Finally
text: Nan comes out of the house. With a curt nod to Muffy, she heads on
text: toward the van when...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: Nan!
dialog: 
text: She hurries to catch up with her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: Let me say again how sorry I am. It wasn't intended.
speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: And now all is forgiven. I played along, didn't I? What's done is
dialog: done.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I've learned a lot, Muffy, I really have. I suppose I should say thank
dialog: you, but I don't think I would be able to without it sounding false.
dialog: So I'll just say goodbye.
dialog: (beat; an afterthought)
dialog: Thanks for showing me your house.
dialog: 
text: She turns and crosses to the van and climbs aboard. The others callout
text: their last goodbyes. Muffy waves, and then they are gone and Muffy
text: turns and walks forlornly back into her house.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FERRY LANDING - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Cal and Uncle Frank are the first ones onto the ferry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE FRANK
dialog: Cal, I want to thank you personally. You've been a real sport about
dialog: this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: Aw, it was fun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE FRANK
dialog: I know you've had your eye on that p1ace ever since we were kids.
dialog: And I'm sure we could make a deal with you. I know you haven't been
dialog: spending your money on anything else all these years... But... this
dialog: time it just isn't in the cards.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: It's still in the family.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE FRANK
dialog: Yes, that's the way.
dialog: 
text: He moves on. Others are passing them now. Chaz stops and wags his
text: finger at Cal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: This time, no funny business.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Muffy stand, overlooking the mess. Not knowing exactly where to
text: begin, she starts emptying ashtrays into each other, then just stops.
dialog: 
text: She walks out of the living room and through the entry hall and slowly
text: climbs the stairs.
scene_heading: EXT. SOUND ­ DAY
dialog: 
text: From far away the ferry can be seen chugging away, slowly returning to
dialog: the mainland.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FERRY - DAY
dialog: 
text: closer now we can see what's happening on board... Rob and Skip lean
text: against the rail and talk quietly. Kit and Arch and Buck sit together
text: and chat... Chaz sits alone, and Nikki sits apart from him, also
dialog: alone.
dialog: 
text: Nan is up front, gazing out over the bow, while Harvey stands beside
text: her trying to make conversation. Finally, he gives up and strolls to
text: the back of the craft, pointedly passing Nikki.
dialog: 
text: He alights next to Uncle Frank, who has his briefcase open on his lap.
dialog: 
text: Now Nikki stands and goes and sits down next to Chaz.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Feeling better?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY)
dialog: I'm okay now, thanks.
dialog: 
dialog: Pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Chaz, I'm sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: Why? What do we mean to each other anyway?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: More than this a couple of days ago.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
speaker_heading: (SMILES SADLY)
dialog: A couple of days ago... A couple of days ago I was a great, young,
text: budding filmmaker who was going to turn pornography into high art.
dialog: Today I'm just a stupid college kid with a toy camera and about as
dialog: much idea as where he's going as... as...
dialog: 
text: He gives up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
speaker_heading: (TENDERLY)
dialog: Don't be down.
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 
dialog: Pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: I'll tell you what I've learned from all this. I'm tired of having one
dialog: fling after another. I don't want any more of that. I want a
dialog: boyfriend.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Chaz? Will you be my boyfriend?
dialog: 
text: He looks at her, slowly softening. Yes, he will.
dialog: 
text: Rob turns away from Skip now, steps over and surveys the quiet group.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Some party, huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
speaker_heading: (REFLECTIVELY)
dialog: You know what I think's weird?... how, when we thought 'Buck here got
dialog: hurt because of Skip's prank, and when things started happening and we
dialog: thought maybe some of us were getting killed, how we all just kind of
dialog: naturally accepted the fact that it was 'oh , yeah, sure, because of
dialog: the prank.'
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIP
speaker_heading: (FROWNS)
dialog: What're you talking about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
dialog: Well, it's like pranks really piss people off. It unleashes things,
dialog: you know? Makes any kind of behavior possible, and we accept it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: When anything g.oes, everything goes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: What really amazes me is how easy we made it for her. Everyone was
dialog: just out for himself. We could've stopped Muffy cold if we'd only
dialog: stuck together, if we'd only worked like a team.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: Yeah, she really got us good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIP
dialog: Well, I know what I'd do, if I wasn't her brother...
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: (almost without thinking)
dialog: Go back and give her a taste of her own medicine, that's what we
dialog: should do.
dialog: 
text: Nikki steps. Leeks up, hearing herself. Skip returns the stare.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIP
dialog: (shrugs, smiling)
dialog: Did I say anything?
text: The others look at each other, a beat, registering.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
dialog: Hey...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: Go back and scare the shit outta her for a change? Outrageous!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: She sure wouldn't be expecting it...!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARVEY
speaker_heading: (EXCLUDING HIMSELF)
dialog: Well, I don't know. I got a stack o' books this high...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: (stepping into the fray)
dialog: Harvey's right.
dialog: (to them all)
dialog: Look, what're you talking about? We've had our fun. Now we got work to
dialog: do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARCH
dialog: Yeah. Enough's enough. At least for me anyway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: Pussies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Well, I kinda like the idea -- and I don't have work to get back to.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB

dialog: Kit...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
speaker_heading: (DECIDEDLYL
dialog: Muffy can dish it out. It might be interesting to see if she can take
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: All right! A real catfight!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: (open-mouthed at her)
dialog: I don't believe you...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
speaker_heading: (PROVOCATIVELY)
dialog: Just because you've decided to get serious about your life, doesn't
dialog: mean the rest of us can't have our fun
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: (whoops, turning)
dialog: Buck, got any spare professional tricks you could throw our way!
dialog: 
text: Buck looks up, confused, only now plugging in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: So how many does that make us?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIP
speaker_heading: (EXCLUDING HIMSELF)
dialog: Much as I'd like to...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NAN
speaker_heading: (GENTEELLY)
dialog: No, I don't think so, thank you.
dialog: 
text: Nikki continues count. Rob makes it easy for her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
speaker_heading: (EMPHATICALLY)
dialog: Four.
dialog:

speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: (one of the four)
dialog: Outasight!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Cal, we want to get back to the island.

speaker_heading: KIT

speaker_heading: NIKKI
speaker_heading: (AWKWARDLY)
dialog: Muffy, hi! Surprise!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: Nikki, what on earth are you doing here? Is something wrong?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: No, no, nothing's wrong. Chaz and I just figured there was nothing we
dialog: had to get back to that couldn't wait and you could probably use a
dialog: hand with the clean-up. It's our way of saying thank you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: Oh, great. Where is Chaz?
dialog: 
text: Nikki is already moving into the living room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Muffy and Nikki are seated across from each other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
text: I wonder what's keeping Chaz? He should have been up here by now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: Maybe he stopped to shit in the woods. You know Chaz.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Still... I'm beginning to not like this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: By the way, where did you get the boat to come back here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: The boat? Oh, Cal gave us one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: I see.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Listen, I need a drink of water.
speaker_heading: (RISING)

dialog: 
text: She walks out of the living room. Muffy looks after her and smiles to

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
text: She gazes out into the night for a moment, then backs out of
dialog: the kitchen...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: ...pulling the swinging door closed behind her. She turns, takes two
text: steps toward the living room and stops; remembering her water.
dialog: 
text: She goes back to the kitchen door, but suddenly it will not open for
text: her. Frustrated, she heads back through the dining room, but stops
text: dead halfway across and turns slowly and looks back at the kitchen
text: door. She goes out of the dining room...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT . DOWNSTAIRS HALL - SAME
dialog: 
text: ...and walks up to the other door into the kitchen. It too it's closed

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: as Nikki returns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: What about your water?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKL
dialog: Oh', uh, I drank 'it in there.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Listen. Muffy , I'm really getting worried about Chaz. I think we
dialog: should go out and see what's happened.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: That's okay. You go. I'll wait here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: No, really. I don't want to go alone. I'm still scared from last
dialog: night. Please come with me.
speaker_heading: MUFFY
text: I'm sure Chaz is fine. I'll stay here by the phone just in case. It's
dialog: safer this way.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Do you want a flashlight?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
speaker_heading: (IRRITATED)
dialog: No, that's okay. I'll be fine.

speaker_heading: NIKKI
speaker_heading: (MUTTERING)
dialog: Shit.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL -
dialog: 
text: She comes to the kitchen door, pushes it open... no sweat... and enters.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT . KITCHEN - SAME
dialog: 
text: Muffy doesn't turn any lights on either. She goes to the sink, sees
text: that there is no used water glass, then' she notices the open window.
text: She smiles.
dialog: 
text: She does get herself a bottle of Perrier out of the fridge, opens it,
text: pours it and walks back out of the kitchen, leaving the window
text: untouched.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Nikki stumbles through the darkness. Suddenly she disappears from view
text: with a loud SPLASH.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Fuck!
dialog: 
text: She comes up sputtering to the surface of a small forest pool she has
dialog: fallen into.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Fuck!! Who dug the goddamn swimming pool?!?
text: She drags herself out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT (o.s.)

speaker_heading: NIKKI
speaker_heading: (CALLING BACK)

speaker_heading: NIKKI .

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL - SAME

scene_heading: INT . LIVING ROOM - SAME
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI

scene_heading: INT. FRONT ENTRY - SAME

dialog: 
text: She dashes into...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STUDY - SAME
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Muff--!!!
dialog: 
text: ...and stops short. Muffy is lying face down in a pool of blood. Her
text: throat's been cut. The useless phone receiver is clutched in her hand
dialog: (making that constant phone company noise that lets you know the phone
dialog: is off the hook).
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
speaker_heading: (RISING PANIC)
dialog: Muffy?
dialog: 
text: Her throat gags a couple of times, as if she is about to be sick. She
text: turns and flies out of the room.
text: O.S. the front door slams shut behind her.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI (O.S,)
speaker_heading: (HYSTERICAL)
dialog: Chaz!! Chaz!!
dialog: 
text: She runs into another clearing (the CAMERA has been here waiting for
text: her) where Chaz is revealed lying on the ground, looking much more
dialog: hideous than Muffy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Chaz, get up! ·Hurry, Chaz!... come on!
dialog: 
text: He doesn't move.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Chaz, stop playing around! Get up!!
dialog: 
text: She starts kicking him in the side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Chaz!
dialog: 
text: Chaz doesn't stir, but he does speak now without moving his lips.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: (hissing, pretending to be dead)
dialog: Will you quit kicking me? It hurts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: It's supposed to hurt! The game's over! Get up!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: (still not moving)
dialog: No. I'm dead. You're blowing the whole thing. Where's Muffy?

speaker_heading: NIKKI
speaker_heading: (SHRIEKING)

dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: (turning to the woods)
dialog: Kit! Kit, come out!

speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: What's going on?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STUDY - SAME

scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STUDY - SAME
dialog: 
text: as they come charging in...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: She's gone!
dialog: 
text: Nothing left, but the pool of blood and a thin trail of smeared drying
text: blood to indicate that she's been dragged away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: What?...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: Look, she's been dragged away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
speaker_heading: (PANICKING)
dialog: Chaz! somebody's still in this house!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
dialog: We could follow the trail.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
speaker_heading: (DREAD)
dialog: Oh, no... what about Rob?
speaker_heading: (HALF BEAT)
dialog: Rob!!
dialog: 
text: She races out of the study.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The three of them come clambering up the stairs, Kit in the lead. They
text: turn a corner. Then they see him... dead on the floor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Rob...?
dialog: 
text: They run over to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: (dropping to her knees)
dialog: Rob? Rob??
dialog: (shaking him: wailing)
dialog: Rob!!!
dialog: (dissolving into tears)
dialog: It was only a game!
speaker_heading: CHAZ
speaker_heading: (SCARED SHITLESS)
dialog: What the fuck is going on here?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
speaker_heading: (POINTING)
dialog: Chaz, look!
dialog: 
text: Clutched in Rob's lifeless hand is a leather bookmark we may have
text: noticed before. Chaz slips it out from beneath his fingers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAZ
speaker_heading: (DAZED)
dialog: This was Nan's...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
speaker_heading: (TREMBLING)
dialog: Nan...
dialog: 
text: Suddenly there is a loud KNOCK beneath them O.S. They all look up.
text: Someone is coming slowly up the stairs, the loud footsteps O.S.that
text: could only be made by a heavy boot, thundering closer... and closer...
dialog: 
text: Kit and Nikki and Chaz huddle around Rob's body and await their
text: approaching doom.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly a dark figure fills the doorframe at the top of the stairs. A
text: hand with a knife is raised. ·Nikki screams. Chaz spies a lamp on the
text: floor. He turns it on...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Muffy!
dialog: 
text: Muffy walks into the room , lowering the knife.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: Good job, you guys. I'm really scared.
speaker_heading: (LOOKING DOWN)
dialog: The fun's over, Rob.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: (tears in her eyes)
dialog: Muffy, he's dead!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Somebody else is here! In this house!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: Sure. Sure.
speaker_heading: (BENDING OVER)
dialog: Let's see if the dead are ticklish, shall we?
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: (pulling her away; screaming)
dialog: Don't you touch him!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: Okay, okay, take it easy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Muffy, it's not a game anymore!
dialog: 
text: Just then there is a loud CRASH o.s. of glass breaking down on the
text: first floor. After the slightest pause there is another crash o.s.,
dialog: and another...
dialog: 
text: Someone is smashing in all the bay windows along the back porch. Nikki
text: screams.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
speaker_heading: (ALARMED)
dialog: What the--?
dialog: 
text: And she runs back down the attic stairs, followed quickly by the
dialog: others.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME
dialog: 
text: as Muffy bursts out of the stairway and into the hall. Then
dialog: Kit.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly the door to the stairwell slams shut on Nikki and Chaz
text: cutting them off. A key turns in the lock. Muffy and Kit turn back to
text: see a male figure in the darkness who'd been hiding behind the door.
dialog: 
text: Kit is nearest to him, and without warning, he lunges at her and
text: buries a knife into her stomach ·up to the handle.
dialog: 
text: Kit screams and chokes, trying to fight him off: but he stabs her
text: again, and again and again, plunging the knife deep into her with
dialog: every thrust.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIT
text: Muffy! Stop him! Help! He's killing me! Oh, God! He's killing me!
dialog: 
text: Muffy, initially paralyzed with fear, now runs for her life, down the
text: hallway, down the stairs...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ENTRY HALL - SAME
dialog: 
text: ...and to the front door as Kit's screams O.S. fade to silence. Muffy
text: yanks on the door handle, but the door will not open. She pulls again
text: and again desperately, but it won't budge,
text: She turns and runs out of the entry hall. Just as she CLEARS FRAME,
text: the front door swings silently open...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME
dialog: 
text: Muffy is racing past the back stairs toward the kitchen when A HAND
text: reaches out from the pantry and hooks her around the face.
dialog: 
text: She is pulled backward, screaming, through the swinging door into the
text: darkened pantry.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PANTRY ­ SAME
dialog: 
dialog: It is Skip!
dialog: 
text: He pulls her head back, exposing her throat. He raises a knife to it,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKIP
speaker_heading: (RAVING)
dialog: It's all over, Muffy! Everything'll be mine!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFY
dialog: Skip! No! ! !
dialog: 
text: He makes a move to slit her throat, when Muffy kicks open
text: the swinging door and sees...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HER POV
dialog: 
text: ...standing on the other side, smiling, in various states of fake
