speaker_heading: FIRST PSYCHIATRIST WITNESS (CONT’D)
dialog: Of course, Mr. Breivik is a man who

dialog: Knights Templar, for instance,
dialog: which clearly does not exist. But

dialog: that. Lies.
speaker_heading: FAMILY LAWYER
dialog: Lies?
scene_heading: FIRST PSYCHIATRIST WITNESS
dialog: Yes. Lies about himself and the way
dialog: the world is. Lies to try to
dialog: recruit people to his side. To
text: elevate himself out of his own
dialog: insignificance. Put simply, he lies
dialog: as a defense mechanism. To make
dialog: himself appear less of the failure
text: that inside he feels himself to be.

scene_heading: FIRST PSYCHIATRIST WITNESS
dialog: In an attempt to categorise the
dialog: Defendant, to make sense of him, I
dialog: believe we are missing the point
dialog: entirely. The truth is simple.
dialog: Anders Behring Breivik feels
