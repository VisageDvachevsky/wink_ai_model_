text: SILHOUETTE OF A MAN IN A HAT, head down. Spits... Then --
scene_heading: EMERGING FROM THE DARKNESS: JACKSON (JACK) MAINE (early

dialog: All right, let’s do it.
text: He walks onto --
scene_heading: INT. DOME TENT - MAIN STAGE —- CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: The crowd erupting. With a wave, he flings off his hat
text: and wields his guitar, his RHYTHM GUITARIST now opposite
dialog: him...
text: And at once in tandem they unleash dueling guitars with
text: the sheer force of rock ‘n’ roll -- an explosion of sound
text: as the speakers scream his latest hit, “BLACK EYES” --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (singing)
text: ‘Black eyes open wide,

dialog: And I'm all alone,
text: By the wayside,’
text: The stage lights blaze from above as the song reaches its
dialog: fever pitch... He may be a little drunk, but this is
text: Jackson Maine in his element, a singer-songwriter with a
text: mean guitar. He doesn’t just play, it’s an all-out
text: attack. And as the song ends, we go --

speaker_heading: BACK AT STAGE
text: Ally takes a breath and goes over to the microphone...

dialog: ‘Des yeux qui font baisser les
dialog: miens,
dialog: Un rire qui se perd sur sa bouche,

dialog: remarkable, her voice so exceptional, talent so
text: transcendent, Jack can’t help but just stop and listen --
text: Ally sings as she wanders through the audience. She

text: half-made cocktails and spirits.
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: Would anybody like some French
dialog: tips tonight?
text: She gets up onto the bar and begins walking toward
dialog: Ramon... her performance, all done to a measured
text: perfection minus one tiny moment where her eyes pivot and
text: clock Jack standing there -- only to regroup and continue
text: with the song.
text: She lies back, seductively caressing herself with a rose
dialog: and giving it to Ramon --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: I just, I just don't feel
dialog: comfortable.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why wouldn't you feel comfortable?
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: Um... Well, ‘cause, like, almost
dialog: every single person that I've come
dialog: in contact with in the music
dialog: industry has told me that my nose
dialog: is too big and that I won't make
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Your nose is too big?
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Your nose is beautiful.
text: Jack looks at her, dumbfounded. She turns her head
text: profile, takes her finger and runs it down from her
text: forehead, over her nose, down to her chin.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Are you showing me your nose right
dialog: now?
text: She embarrassingly smiles.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You don't have to show it to me.
dialog: I've been looking at it all night.
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: Oh, come on.
speaker_heading: JACK ALLY
dialog: Oh, I'm gonna be thinking No, you're not. You're
dialog: about your nose for a very full of shit.
dialog: long time.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm not full of shit.
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: Yeah, you are.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm telling you the truth.
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: Yeah, you're full of shit.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Can I touch your nose?
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: Oh, my gosh.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Let me just touch it for a second.
text: She laughs, but he’s serious. He reaches in, she lets
text: him. His finger brushes the top of her nose, intimate,
dialog: surreal.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're very lucky.
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: Oh, really?
dialog: (he nods)
dialog: Yeah, not really. My nose has not
dialog: made me lucky.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I could've had, maybe, a hit song

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That's fucking bullshit.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: Yeah. No, it's not bullshit,
dialog: because, you go into these rooms
dialog: and there’s all these fucking men
text: in there and they’re just staring
dialog: at you, listening to your record
dialog: going, ‘Oh, you sound great, but,
dialog: you know, you don’t look so
dialog: great.’
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You know, I had a thing when I was
dialog: little. I was born with this
dialog: thing in my ear. Couldn’t hear...
dialog: What do I wind up being? A
dialog: singer. So you never know...
dialog: (then)
dialog: Look... Talent comes everywhere,
dialog: everybody’s talented. I bet you,
dialog: fucking everybody in this bar is
dialog: talented in one thing or another,
dialog: but having something to say, and a
dialog: way to say it so people listen to
dialog: it, that’s a whole other bag. And
dialog: unless you get out there and
dialog: you try to do it you’1l never
dialog: know. That’s just the truth. If
dialog: there’s one reason we’re supposed
dialog: to be here, it’s to say something
dialog: so people wanna hear it.
text: She's looking at him.
dialog: They share
speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: ALLY

speaker_heading: ALLY

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: ALLY

speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: He died when I was thirteen, so, I
dialog: guess my brother will tell you
dialog: that he raised me, but I don't
dialog: know... I don't know who was
dialog: raising who. Just a hundred-
dialog: twenty-seven acres of nuts,
text: Navajo, and nowhere to go.
text: She looks at him, he’s gone inside himself a bit, looking

dialog: very own stage...
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: Maybe that could work, like, as a

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I think you might be a songwriter.

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: JACK

dialog: Thank you very much. That was

speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: I'm not going out there, no.

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - LATER

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL - ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (slurring)
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: Just stay right here.
text: He's made it halfway down the aisle... to the beginning
dialog: of the stairs...
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: Just stay right here.
text: And, without thinking, Jack continues to follow her
text: until, realizing he’s in the wrong place...
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: Go sit back there. Go sit back
dialog: there.
text: He stands, looking lost, watching her mouth move without
text: hearing what she is saying. Then we’re WITH Jack as he

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (slurring)
dialog: I'll stay here.
text: Ally at the podium, starting her acceptance speech.
speaker_heading: ALLY

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Should I come up there?

text: the room. Jack stumbles up the stairs...
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: (over speakers)
dialog: I love you so much. I always
dialog: wanted to be a singer on a big
dialog: stage and because of him, I am.
text: Jack’s errant hobble and stupor manages to find Ally at

speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: We're having a lot of fun tonight.
text: Pointing to her on the big screen.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah. Shit. Look.

speaker_heading: ALLY

dialog: Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. Oh, I think

dialog: Yeah. Why don't you come with me?
dialog: We can sing ‘Shallow’ together.
dialog: The fans will go crazy to see you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Come on, cowboy.
text: He caresses her hair.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 129.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah, why not? Okay.
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: Yeah? Okay, good. I'll have a
dialog: car come get you.
text: They kiss, but it’s missing something. Maybe she catches
text: it, but they pull apart...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'll go meet you there.
dialog: Unsure of what to say --
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: I'll see you soon, okay?
text: She stands and starts to walk off --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey.
text: She turns to him.
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I just wanted to take another look
dialog: at you.
text: Ally slides her finger down her nose just the way she did
dialog: the night they met. And with a smile --
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: Bye, honey.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Bye.
dialog: OFF Jack --
scene_heading: INT. JACK’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Jack cooks a steak on a cast iron skillet. He sets it on
text: a plate, then sets down the steak on the floor for
dialog: Charlie...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Come here, Charlie. Come here.
text: Charlie goes after it ravenously... Jack walks out the
text: glass door, leaving Charlie...
dialog: 130.
scene_heading: EXT. JACK’S HOUSE - GARAGE - LATER
text: Jack is in his truck. He sits as it idles, presumably
text: warming it up. Then, after a beat, he backs out of the
dialog: driveway, but then --
text: Stops. Cuts the engine. Sits and waits. We can’t see
text: what he’s doing, but he shifts around in his seat for a
text: moment, almost as if pulling something from his pocket...
scene_heading: INSIDE THE PICKUP
text: Jack fumbles with a bottle of pills in the glove
dialog: compartment.
scene_heading: INT. THE FORUM - BACK STAGE - NIGHT
text: The sound deafening... Ally prays in a circle with her
dialog: crew.
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: (praying)
dialog: Thank You so much for bringing us
dialog: all here together. Please look
dialog: over all of the dancers tonight
dialog: and the band. And my husband,
dialog: Jackson. We're so excited for him
dialog: to be here with us.
text: The Forum crowd cheers.
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: (to her crew)
dialog: We got a big night. We're at the
dialog: Forum. L.A. Let's do this.
scene_heading: EXT. JACK’S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - LATER
text: Jack's pickup is parked. Then he gets out.
scene_heading: HOLD OUR POSITION BY THE TRUCK --
text: Jack walks back into the garage...
text: He has his belt in his hand. He gently sets his cowboy
text: hat on a file cabinet.
text: He turns TO us and, in pulling down the GARAGE DOOR, we
text: get a glimpse of the ceiling fan slowing its spin...
text: The door closes...
dialog: 131.
scene_heading: INT. FORUM - LATER
text: And as Ally’s BAND plays out the last few bars, her voice
text: holds the final note. Long and steady, the audience
text: exhilarated to see how long she can hold it -- which is
dialog: very long.
text: A beat. A breath.
text: The audience on their feet, already wanting an encore...
text: Eruption of a CROWD going crazy as Ally, breathless,
text: comes UPSTAGE RIGHT down their staircase into the bowels
text: below the stage.
dialog: Rez is waiting --
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: Is he here?
speaker_heading: REZ
dialog: He's not here.
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: He's not here?
text: She gulps from a water bottle while the stylists change
text: her costume, Rez in tow.
speaker_heading: REZ
dialog: We have to do ‘Shallow’
dialog: regardless, okay? The guitar's up
dialog: there. Everything's gonna remain
dialog: the same, okay?
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: REZ
text: The guitar's up there.
dialog: Everything's gonna remain the
dialog: same. Both verses. I'm sure it
dialog: was just a bit much for him,
dialog: that's all.
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: Will you send somebody to the
dialog: house, please.
speaker_heading: REZ
dialog: I'm doing it right now.
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: I have fifteen seconds.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 132.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Ally turns and walks back up the stairs and out into the
dialog: thrash of people --
text: The audience applause morphing into a chant.
text: The band plays a familiar intro -- the first few chords
text: of “Shallow”... The audience catches it, they erupt in
text: tandem with the band coming in full force --
text: This is a whole new version of Jack and Ally’s song.
text: This song has evolved much like the performer at center
dialog: stage.
dialog: Tell me something, boy...
scene_heading: INT. FORUM - STAGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Ally plays and sings by herself at a piano on a platform
text: in the middle of the arena along with Jack’s guitar on
dialog: its stand --
text: Ally launches into the CHORUS with the same power we
text: heard echoing through the street their first night...
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: (over speakers;
dialog: singing)
dialog: ‘In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low,
dialog: In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low,
dialog: In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low,
dialog: We're far from the shallow now,
scene_heading: O00 oUuOo OCC0O haaaa.’
dialog: (into mic)
dialog: Give it up for my husband,
dialog: Jackson.
text: And as the SONG ends, breathing heavy --
scene_heading: EXT. JACK’S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
text: Charlie is at the garage door, back and forth trying to
dialog: get in, barking. Something’s wrong...
scene_heading: EXT. JACK’S HOUSE - LATER
text: Red and blue lights flash. Inside through the glass
text: doors it seems Jack has left the “La Vie En Rose” neon
text: light on.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 133.
scene_heading: INT. JACK’S HOUSE - MUSIC ROOM - MORNING
text: Ally at the piano, alone, broken. Bathed in the red
text: light of the “La Vie En Rose” neon sign. She plays a few
text: melancholy chords, a song we’ve only begun to hear...
scene_heading: EXT. JACK’S HOUSE - GRAND WINDOW - DAY
text: LOOKING IN. Ally looking out. The garage in the
dialog: distance... Her roots have grown out, showing the natural
text: brunette, the markings of the Ally we met at the
text: beginning of the movie... Her eyes transfixed on the
text: vista below.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S HOUSE - HALLWAY/BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Ramon sits with Ally in the window seat. Rubs her back.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: I can stay, if you want.
scene_heading: INT. JACK’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - LATER
text: Ally stares at JACK’S TOUR POSTERS. Something building
text: inside her. And then, she snaps --
speaker_heading: CRASH!
text: She begins smashing them, glass flying in a rampage.
scene_heading: SAME SCENE - LATER
text: Ally sits cradling Jack’s guitar amongst everything
text: broken and smashed...
scene_heading: INT. JACK’S HOUSE —- MUSIC ROOM - DAY
text: Bobby sits next to Ally, equally broken, feeling the very
text: same thing, quiet. He doesn’t move, although it feels
dialog: like they need to hold each other.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Some kid started singing one of
dialog: his songs in a bar I was in the
dialog: other night... They're playing his
dialog: songs everywhere.
dialog: He thinks about it...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 134.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: At first I got angry. I don't
dialog: know why. I guess I felt like...
dialog: how can any of these people feel
dialog: like they knew him? Who he really
dialog: was.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But then something changed. And
dialog: it soothed me. That, well, it
dialog: wasn't all for fucking nothing.
text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: (sobbing)
dialog: The last thing I did was lie to
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Listen to me. It isn't your
dialog: fault. It just isn't. You know
dialog: whose fault it was? Jack. That's
dialog: it. No one else. Not you, not
dialog: me. No one but Jack.
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: (crying)
dialog: I just keep going over and over
text: it, over it in my head.
dialog: After some moments...
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Jack talked about how music is
dialog: essentially twelve notes between
dialog: any octave. Twelve notes and the
text: octave repeats. It's the same
text: story. Told over and over.
dialog: Forever. All any artist can offer
dialog: the world is how they see those
dialog: twelve notes. That's it.
text: Ally looks at him, hearing him.
scene_heading: INT. THE SHRINE - NIGHT
text: Packed with people seated in this huge theater.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (V.O.)
dialog: (post-lap)
dialog: He loved how you see them. He
dialog: just kept saying, ‘I love how she
dialog: sees ‘em, Bobby.’
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 135.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: A SILHOUETTE OF A WOMAN, her head down in the wings. Her
text: hands clasping each other -- Much in the same way she
text: would hold Jack’s hand. And it is Ally.
dialog: And we're --
text: WALKING now WITH Ally... She’s in a DRESS, heading into a
text: proscenium larger than we have ever seen. The lights
dialog: find her...
speaker_heading: WE GO --
speaker_heading: WIDE ANGLE
text: The crowd embraces her, “We love you Ally,” and
text: encouragement from all over... She puts her head down...
text: We see she’s a brunette. No makeup.
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: (whispering; into the
dialog: microphone)
dialog: Hello, I'm Ally Maine. Thank you
dialog: for being here tonight to honor my
dialog: husband.
text: The crowd adoring her, accepting her at her most
dialog: vulnerable...
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: (whispering; into the
dialog: microphone)
dialog: He wrote a song for me. I'd like
dialog: to sing it for him tonight. And
dialog: with your help, maybe I can.
dialog: Thank you. Really. Thank you.
text: And with that, she begins to sing an original song, “I‘1l
text: Never Love Again.” We SLOWLY PUSH IN -- The audience a
text: distant sound, their encouragement, their belief...
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: (singing)
dialog: ‘Wish I could,
dialog: I could have said goodbye,
dialog: I would have said what I wanted
dialog: to,
dialog: Maybe even cried for you,
dialog: If I knew it would be the last
dialog: time,
dialog: I would have broke my heart in
dialog: two,
dialog: Tryin’ to save a part of you,
dialog: Don't want to feel another touch,
dialog: Don't want to start another fire,

speaker_heading: ALLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't want to know another kiss,
dialog: No other name falling off my lips,
dialog: Don't want to give my heart away,
dialog: To another stranger...’
text: We see GLIMPSES of their times together performing on
dialog: stage when
text: they were just beginning their relationship.
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: ‘Or let another day begin,
dialog: Won't even let the sunlight in,
dialog: No, I'll never love again,
dialog: I'll never love again,
dialog: Oooouuu ooou ooU,
dialog: Oh,

dialog: I never thought that I would fall,
dialog: I never thought that I'd find
dialog: myself lyin’ in your arms,
dialog: Mmmm mmmm,
dialog: And I wanna pretend that it's not
dialog: true,
dialog: Oh, baby, that you're gone...’
text: We see GLIMPSES of Ally and Jack in bed with the glow of
text: the “La Vie En Rose” neon sign. She runs her finger down
text: his profile, they laugh together.
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: ‘Cause my world keeps turnin’ and
dialog: turnin’ and turnin’ and I'm not
dialog: movin’ on,
dialog: Don't want to feel another touch,
dialog: Don't want to start another fire,
dialog: Don't want to know another kiss,

dialog: ‘Don't want to give my heart away

dialog: Don't let another day begin,
dialog: Won't let the sunlight in,
dialog: Oh, I'll never love again.’
text: She gets up and walks up from behind, placing her arms
text: around him, holding him. Their heads touch and let the
text: final chord slowly ring out.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
speaker_heading: THE SHRINE (PRESENT)
