scene_heading: 1 INT. SCHOOL. DAY 1
scene_heading: JANUARY 1962. MONTAGE
text: A nice girls' school in a south west London suburb. We see
dialog: girls doing what girls did in a nice girls' school in 1962:
text: walking with books on their heads, practising their
text: handwriting, making cakes, playing lacrosse, dancing with
dialog: each other.
scene_heading: 1A INT. CLASSROOM. DAY 1A
text: In one of the classrooms, MISS STUBBS, an attractive,
text: bright, animated schoolteacher, is talking to a small group
text: of sixteen-year-old girls. Some of these girls seem to be
text: daydreaming - looking out of the window, examining their
text: fingernails. A couple, including a bespectacled girl who
text: looks five years younger than everyone else in the class,
dialog: write down everything the teacher says. Only one, JENNY,
text: beautiful and animated, seems to be listening in the spirit
dialog: in which Miss Stubbs would like her to listen. She's
text: smiling, eyes shining - she loves Miss Stubbs, and these
text: lessons. Miss Stubbs asks a question, and Jenny puts up her
text: hand - the only one in the class to do so.
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: (mock-sighing)
text: Jenny. Again.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Isn't it because Mr Rochester's
dialog: blind?
scene_heading: 2 INT. BEDROOM. DAY 2
text: Jenny's bedroom. Books about ponies, a much loved teddy
text: bear; a cello huge in the small room leans against the
dialog: wall.
text: Jenny is bent over a small desk. Victorian novels, Latin
text: primers and dictionaries teeter in huge towers either side
text: of her. She stands and stretches as she turns to us.
text: She kneels and flicks through her half-dozen or so LPs on
text: the floor near a cheap record player - they're all
text: classical, mostly by Elgar, apart from a Juliette Greco
text: record. This is the one she chooses. As the music begins,
text: she sings along.
text: Immediately there is a thumping noise - someone underneath
text: her is banging on the ceiling impatiently.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: I don't want to hear any French
dialog: singing. French singing wasn't on
dialog: the syllabus, last time I looked.
dialog: 2.
text: Jenny sighs, and reaches for the volume control. She turns
text: the music down so low that she has to lie down and put her
text: head right next to the Dansette to hear it.
text: Close on Jenny as she silently mouths the words along with
text: the almost inaudible track.
scene_heading: 3 INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY 3
text: Jenny, her mother and father are finishing Sunday lunch.
text: Jenny's father JACK is in his forties, MARJORIE, her mother
text: is slightly younger than Jack, but every bit as middle-
text: aged. The food is grey and brown, in keeping with the
text: colour scheme of the house. They aren't talking - they're
text: listening to Mantovani on the radio. Jenny gets up from the
text: lunch table.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I've got an English essay to do
dialog: by tomorrow morning.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't want to hear anything
dialog: through the ceiling this
dialog: afternoon, apart from the sound
text: of sweat dripping onto textbooks.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Cello?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No cello.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I thought we agreed that cello
dialog: was my interest or hobby?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's already your interest or
dialog: hobby. When they ask you "What's
dialog: your interest or hobby?" at your
dialog: Oxford interview, you can say,
dialog: "Cello". That wouldn't be a lie.
dialog: You don't need to practise a
dialog: hobby. A hobby is a hobby.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Or interest.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (ignoring her)
dialog: You don't need to be good at it.
dialog: You just have to be interested in
dialog: it.
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Can I stop going to the youth
dialog: orchestra, then?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No. The orchestra shows you're a
dialog: joiner-inner. Universities like
dialog: joiner-inners.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Ah. Yes. But. I've already joined
dialog: in. So now I can stop.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, if you stop, that shows the
dialog: opposite, doesn't it? That shows
dialog: you're a rebel. They don't want
dialog: that at Oxford.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: No. They don't want people who
dialog: think for themselves.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (missing the sarcasm, as
dialog: is his wont)
dialog: Course they don't.
scene_heading: 4 INT. SCHOOL HALL. DAY 4
text: Jenny with cello sits in the string section. Everyone is
text: getting settled, tuning up, latecomers still arriving.
text: Along the row from Jenny, tuning his violin, is a nice-
text: looking boy of her age, GRAHAM, and she waves at him. Two
text: 13 year old boys sitting between them wave too,
text: parodically, and then blow kisses, much to Graham's
text: embarrassment and Jenny's fury.
text: The silly boys dissolve in fits of giggles: this is clearly
text: one of the funniest moments of their lives - until one of
text: them farts noisily and, it would appear from all the
text: frantic gesturing, pungently. The comic value of the fart
text: tops even the comic value of the wave, and they are
text: scarcely able to stay seated, such is their mirth.
scene_heading: 5 EXT. SCHOOL. DAY 5
text: Jenny and Graham are talking while he struggles to take his
text: bike out of a bicycle rack slightly unbalanced by the
text: violin strapped to his back. Graham is nervous,
text: chronically unconfident and shy.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Should I wear, you know, Sunday
dialog: best?
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: You'd better, I'm afraid. Just to
dialog: show my father you're un jeune
dialog: homme serieux, not a teddy boy.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Oh, God.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: It'll be all right. I won't wait.
dialog: It's going to bucket down in a
dialog: minute. I'll see you at the
dialog: weekend.
text: Jenny moves as quickly as she can towards the street.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Oh, yes. Bye.
text: The two silly boys from before arrive to blow more kisses.
scene_heading: SMALLER BOY 1
dialog: Goodbye, darling! See you at the
dialog: weekend! I will miss you with all
dialog: of my heart!
text: Graham blushes. Jenny swipes the chief offender over the
text: head with her sheet music.
scene_heading: 6 EXT. BUS STOP. DAY 6
text: The rain has begun. Jenny attempts to cover herself. A
text: mother and two children cross the road in front of her, and
text: a beautiful, sleek red sports car - a Bristol - stops to
text: let them across. David, possibly in his mid-thirties,
text: dapper, and almost but not quite handsome, is driving the
text: car. David, distracted, impatient, spots Jenny at the bus
dialog: stop.
text: In front of the car a small wellington boot drops off the
text: foot of one of the children,further slowing down their
text: painfully slow progress across the road.
text: Jenny is wet. David makes eye contact. Jenny smiles
text: ruefully, and enchantingly. David sighs, and then hesitates
text: for a moment. The window of the Bristol slowly rolls down.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hello.
text: Jenny ignores him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Listen. If you've got any sense,
dialog: you wouldn't take a lift from a
dialog: strange man.
dialog: 5.
text: Jenny smiles thinly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I am, however, a music lover, and
dialog: I'm worried about your cello. So
dialog: what I propose is, you put it in
text: the car and walk alongside me.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: How do I know you won't just
dialog: drive off with the cello?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Ah. Good point.
text: He winds down the other window and waves on the cars that
text: have stopped behind him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How much does a new cello cost?
dialog: Twenty pounds? Thirty? I don't
dialog: know. Let's say thirty.
text: He pulls out a wallet, takes out three ten-pound notes,
text: hands them to her.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: There. Security.
text: Jenny laughs and waves the money away.
scene_heading: 7 EXT. STREET. NEAR SCHOOL. DAY. 7
text: Later. The cello is in the back seat of the Bristol. Jenny
text: is trotting alongside the car, while David leans
text: nonchalantly across the passenger seat to talk to her while
dialog: driving.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm David, by the way.
text: She says nothing.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And you are...?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Jenny. (Beat) I've never seen a
dialog: car like this before. C'est tres
dialog: chic.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's a Bristol. Not many of `em
dialog: made.
text: Jenny nods, but doesn't know how to respond.
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How did the concert go?
speaker_heading: JENNY
text: It was a rehearsal. The concert's
dialog: next Thursday.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What are you playing?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (making a face)
dialog: Elgar.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Ah, Elgar. I often think it's a
dialog: shame he spent so much time in
dialog: Worcester, don't you? Worcester's
dialog: too near Birmingham. And you can
dialog: hear that in the music. There's a
text: horrible Brummy accent in there,
dialog: if you listen hard enough.
text: Jenny looks at him and smiles. She hadn't expected him to
dialog: be able to make Elgar jokes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Anyway, I'm not sure Elgar and
dialog: Jews mix very well.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I'm not a Jew!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: No. I am. I wasn't...accusing
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Oh. (She smiles awkwardly.) Can I
dialog: sit in the car with my cello?
text: David stops the car.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jump in.
scene_heading: 8 INT. CAR. DAY 8
text: Jenny shuts the door and sinks approvingly into the white
text: leather seat. David regards the dripping girl with
dialog: amusement.
speaker_heading: JENNY
text: It's even nicer on the inside.
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Where to, madam?
text: Jenny makes a face.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I only live round the corner.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What a shame. We'll just make it
dialog: last as long as we can.
scene_heading: 9 EXT. STREET. NEAR JENNY'S. DAY 9
text: The Bristol is crawling along the road at walking pace.
scene_heading: 10 INT/EXT. CAR JENNY'S HOUSE. DAY 10
text: David reaches across Jenny while driving slowly, opens the
text: glove compartment and takes out a packet of cigarettes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Smoke?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I'd better not. I'm a bit close
dialog: to home.
text: David lights one for himself.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I suppose cellists must go to a
dialog: lot of concerts.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: We don't go to any concerts. We
dialog: don't believe in them.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, they're real.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: So people say.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why don't we believe in them?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I suppose...What would he say?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Your father, this is?
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (Darkly)
dialog: Oh, yes. He'd say there's no
dialog: point to them. They're just for
dialog: fun. Apart from school concerts,
dialog: of course, which are no fun at
dialog: all, so we go to those. The
dialog: proper ones don't help you get
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Which of course is what is so
dialog: wonderful about them. Anyway,
dialog: you'll go one day.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (heartfelt)
dialog: Yes. I will. I know. Sometimes it
dialog: seems as though that's what all
dialog: this slog is for. If I get to
dialog: University, I'm going to read
dialog: what I want and think about what
dialog: I want and listen to what I want.
dialog: And I'm going to look at
dialog: paintings and go to French films
dialog: and talk to people who know lots
dialog: about lots.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Good for you. Which University?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Oxford. If I'm lucky. Did you go
dialog: anywhere?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I studied at what I believe they
dialog: call the University of Life. And
dialog: I didn't get a very good degree
dialog: there.
text: Jenny smiles.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: This is me. Thank you.
text: She gets out of the car with the cello. David stares after
text: her for a moment, then drives off.
scene_heading: 11 INT. JENNY'S SITTING-ROOM. AFTERNOON 11
text: Jenny, her parents and Graham are eating afternoon tea -
dialog: neat fish-paste sandwiches, Battenberg cake, best china.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: How's your mother, Graham?
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: She's fine, thanks. She sends her
dialog: best, by the way.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Where are you applying, Graham?
text: Jenny looks embarrassed. She knows what's coming.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I'm not sure yet.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, when will you be sure? You
dialog: can't let the grass grow under
dialog: your feet, you know. Otherwise
dialog: you'll be at the back of the
dialog: queue.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: I suppose so. I suppose the
dialog: growing grass would knock you off
dialog: balance, and then you'd fall
dialog: over, and by the time you picked
dialog: yourself up, there'd be a queue.
text: Her father shoots her a look - is she being cheeky?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I might take a year off.
text: Jenny winces. Jack looks at him as if he's just said he'll
dialog: take all his clothes off.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (mumbling)
dialog: I don't know. Maybe do some
dialog: travelling, that sort of thing.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Travelling? What are you, a teddy
dialog: boy?
text: Close-up of Jenny - she knows what's coming, and can't bear
dialog: it. Beat.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (nodding at Jenny)
dialog: You know she's going to Oxford,
dialog: don't you? Oxford. English. If we
dialog: can get her Latin up to scratch.
text: Jenny sighs.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: So she's studying English at
dialog: Oxford while you're a wandering
dialog: Jew...
text: Jenny looks at him curiously. Graham steels himself to
dialog: speak.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Mr Mellor...I'm not a teddy boy.
dialog: I'm an homme serieux. Jeune. An
dialog: homme jeune serieux homme.
text: Jenny winces again. Her father stares at Graham. Graham
text: blushes.
scene_heading: 12 INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. EVENING 12
text: It's the night of the youth orchestra concert. Jenny, her
text: mother and father are on their way out of the door. Jack is
text: carrying the cello. Jenny is in her school uniform, with
text: her hair scrubbed back in a severe ponytail. The three of
text: them are flustered. Jenny opens the front door for her
text: father and he stumbles outside.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Oh!
scene_heading: 12A INT/EXT. JENNY'S HOUSE. EVENING 12A
text: She has seen something on the doorstep, and she stoops to
text: pick it up - a large bunch of flowers.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: They're for me!
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: (curious)
dialog: Who are they from?
text: Jenny opens the card that's attached to them.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Gosh. Him.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Who's `him'?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Just...A chap I met.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: A chap who sends flowers? So he's
dialog: a man-chap?
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Yes, he is, really.
text: Jack stares at the flowers in disbelief. The bunch of
text: flowers has created in Jack the kind of panic and fear more
text: typically associated with a biochemical attack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What's going on here?
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: (drily, knowing the
dialog: trouble this will
dialog: cause)
dialog: Jack,I'm afraid Jenny has been
text: sent some flowers by a chap.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: A chap? What kind of chap? Who?
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (patiently)
dialog: He's wishing me luck for tonight.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Are you sure that's all he's
dialog: wishing? And where does he get
dialog: the money from?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: He earns it, I expect.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What do you mean, he earns it?
dialog: Why isn't he at school? What does
dialog: he do?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Can we just go? Otherwise the
dialog: bunch of good-luck flowers will
dialog: actually be responsible for me
text: actually missing the concert.
dialog: Which would be ironic, n'est ce
dialog: pas?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well I don't like it.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Objection noted. Jenny?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Noted.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Ten bob's worth of luck, I
dialog: reckon. That's a lot for a
dialog: schoolgirl. You can't leave them
dialog: out here, anyway. I'd burgle a
text: house that had flowers outside.
dialog: They'll think we're made of
dialog: money.
scene_heading: 12B INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. EVENING 12B
text: Jenny sighs, puts them inside the house, shuts the door.
scene_heading: 13 INT. COFFEE BAR. DAY 13
text: Jenny and two school friends, HATTIE and TINA, are sitting
text: at a table in a typical late-50s coffee bar, sipping
text: cappuccinos. Jenny is easily the most attractive of the
dialog: three - and also, we will see, possibly the cleverest.
text: HATTIE is slower than the other two, and a lot frumpier;
text: TINA is pretty, and sharp rather than clever. She is also
text: the least middle-class of the three - she's clearly a
text: scholarship girl. They are all dressed in an unflattering
dialog: and unambiguous school uniform - no attempts to disguise it
text: with more fashionable accessories. Jenny is smoking
text: pretentiously, and seems to be practising some kind of
text: pout. Tina starts to slurp the froth from her cappuccino
text: with a spoon, inelegantly and noisily. Jenny tuts her
text: disapproval. Tina sighs, and puts her spoon down.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: The whole point about him is that
text: he doesn't feel.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: We still don't have to like him.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Camus doesn't want you to like
text: him. What he's trying to say is
dialog: that feeling is bourgeois. Being
dialog: engagee is bourgeois. His mother
text: dies and he doesn't feel
dialog: anything. He kills this Arab and
text: he doesn't feel anything.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: I wouldn't feel anything if my
dialog: mother died. Does that make me an
dialog: existentialist?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: No. That just makes you a cow.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: HATTIE
dialog: Une vache.
text: Laughter.
scene_heading: 14 EXT. STREET/COFFEE BAR. DAY 14
text: Jenny, Hattie and Tina emerge from the cafe, talking.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Well I'm going to be French. I'm
dialog: going to Paris and I'm going to
dialog: smoke and listen to Jacques Brel
dialog: and wear black. And I won't
dialog: speak. Ever. C'est plus chic,
dialog: comme...
text: She breaks off. Parked outside a tobacconists on the other
text: side of the road is the red Bristol. She looks towards the
text: shop, and David emerges with a copy of the Times and a
text: packet of cigars. Jenny crosses the road to talk to him
text: while the others watch.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Hello. Thank you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How did it go?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Oh, fine. I think. I mean, I
dialog: didn't mess my bit up, anyway.
dialog: And no-one got thrown out of the
dialog: orchestra afterwards.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Always the mark of a cultural
dialog: triumph. Listen. I'm glad I ran
dialog: into you. What are you doing on
dialog: Friday?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Going to school.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I meant the evening.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Oh. Yes. Of course. Nothing.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Because I'm going to listen to
dialog: some Schubert in St John's, Smith
dialog: Square. My friends Danny and
dialog: Helen will be going too, so it
dialog: wouldn't be...I'll tell you what.
dialog: I'll come and pick you up, and if
dialog: your mother and father
dialog: disapprove, then you can have the
dialog: tickets and go with one of them.
dialog: How does that sound?
text: Jenny doesn't know what to say. She looks at David, and his
text: eagerness to please seems to convince her.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Thank you. And I'd like you to
dialog: take me. I'd like to go with
text: someone who knows when to clap.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I usually watch Danny. He knows
dialog: that sort of thing.
text: Jenny smiles.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Seven? And we'll probably go for
dialog: a spot of supper afterwards, if
dialog: you...But if you, if that's
dialog: not...Well, we can always put you
text: in a taxi.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (flat disbelief)
dialog: Supper.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: If you want.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: The trouble is, we'll already
dialog: have eaten.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well. I mean, if you'd like
dialog: supper, then, perhaps on Friday
dialog: you could...not eat?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (embarrassed again)
dialog: Oh. Yes. Of course.
text: Jenny smiles, and rejoins her friends on the other side of
text: the road. Tina and Hattie are standing there almost with
text: their mouths open, amazed. She doesn't say anything and
text: starts to walk on.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: I'm sorry. I just had the
dialog: strangest dream. I dreamed you
text: crossed the road and spoke to a
text: handsome man with the most
dialog: beautiful car I've ever seen. And
dialog: then you came back and you didn't
dialog: mention it.
text: Jenny smiles enigmatically. Tina grabs Jenny mock-urgently.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: `Oo wazzee?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (light, playful)
dialog: Just a man who's been trying to
dialog: pick me up. We're going to a
dialog: concert on Friday night. And then
dialog: we're having a spot of supper.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: (shrieking)
dialog: A spot of supper?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: You've heard of supper?
speaker_heading: HATTIE
dialog: We've heard of it. But we've
dialog: never eaten it.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Neither of you is interested in
dialog: the concert part, I notice.
speaker_heading: HATTIE
dialog: No. Of course not.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Oh my God! I've only just
dialog: realised! That's what's going to
dialog: happen to you, isn't it? Look at
dialog: her! Men are going to pick her up
text: in the street and take her out to
dialog: supper!
speaker_heading: HATTIE
dialog: God, you're right, Tina. I hadn't
dialog: thought of that. Look at her.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Don't be so daft.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: We're trying to attract the
text: attention of boys.
dialog: 16.
text: And she's fighting off men.
dialog: Anyway. You're going to have to
dialog: tell us more than that.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: HATTIE
dialog: Because no man's ever going to
dialog: ask us out to supper. Not until
dialog: we're ladies, anyway. You're
dialog: going to have to tell us
dialog: everything. Otherwise it's not
dialog: fair.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: There won't be anything to tell.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Well, make something up, then.
scene_heading: 15 INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. EVENING 15
text: Jenny is dressed up for her evening out. She looks good,
text: but also stiff, uncomfortable - she's not herself in her
text: dress, which looks too old for her. Her father is standing
text: in front of her, shouting.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I won't allow it!
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (coolly)
dialog: Fine. He's quite happy for you to
dialog: take me.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (uncertainly)
dialog: Right. I will.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Where is it?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: St John's Smith Square.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Where's that?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I don't know. I'm sure we could
dialog: find out.
text: Marjorie comes into the room.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
text: It's in Westminster. Just around
text: the corner from the Abbey.
text: Jack looks at her as if she'd just given directions to the
text: nearest opium den.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How d'you know that?
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: I had a life before we were
dialog: married, you know.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: He soon put a stop to that.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: There we are.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Where are we?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Near Westminster Abbey. I'm not
text: going all the way over there.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: The trouble is, that's where St
dialog: John's Smith Square is.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: And I've just said. That's where
dialog: I'm not going. There must be
dialog: something on locally. Where's the
dialog: paper?
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Jack, she wants to see someone
dialog: who can play. She doesn't want to
dialog: see Sheila Kirkland scratching
dialog: away. I'll take her.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: And how are you going to get over
dialog: there? RAF helicopter?
text: The doorbell rings.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: That's him. Now what?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, bloody hell.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Jack!
dialog: 18.
text: Jenny starts towards the door, and then turns.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Oh, and by the way...David's a
dialog: Jew. A wandering Jew. So watch
dialog: yourself.
text: She goes to the door.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (panic-stricken and
dialog: shouting)
dialog: What's she talking about? I've
dialog: never said anything like that in
dialog: my life! Anyway, it's just an
dialog: expression! I'm not against the
dialog: Jews!
text: Jenny comes back in with David, who is dressed stylishly in
text: his early-60s young executive leisurewear - sports jacket,
text: slacks, cashmere sweater. He looks out of place - he is
text: brighter and brasher than his surroundings, the most
text: colourful thing in the room, and he seems intimidatingly
dialog: exotic.
text: David has obviously heard Jack's last line.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (pleasantly)
dialog: I'm glad to hear it. Hello. David
dialog: Goldman.
text: He offers his hand.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I didn't mean I'm not against
dialog: you... Actually, I did mean that,
dialog: because I'm not, but...
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Dad!
text: David's hand is still extended - in his confusion and
text: embarrassment, Jack hasn't yet taken it. He does so now,
text: and shakes it for way too long.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm sorry. What I'm saying is
dialog: that you're not the sort of, of
dialog: person I'd be against, if I were
dialog: the sort of person who was
dialog: against...people. You're not an
dialog: old...Oh, dear. I'm Jack, and
dialog: this is Marjorie.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: You didn't tell me you had a
dialog: sister, Jenny.
text: General confusion, until David chuckles naughtily. Marjorie
text: giggles, and then offers her hand.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You're a lucky man, Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I suppose I am, yes.
text: They all sit down.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: So. Gosh. (He looks around
dialog: approvingly.) This is lovely.
text: Marjorie smiles.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm sorry, David. Can I get you a
dialog: drink?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'd love one, Jack, but we're
dialog: running a little late. If Jenny's
dialog: ready, perhaps we'll shoot off.
text: Jenny looks at her father, and takes a calculated gamble.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Ah. Well. Dad's got something to
dialog: tell you.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, no, nothing...It was more of
dialog: a question, really. How would you
dialog: get to St John's Smith Square
dialog: from here? For future reference?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, it's a pretty straight run,
dialog: really. Up to Hammersmith, take
text: the A4 through Kensington and
dialog: you're there.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Simple as that.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Simple as that.
dialog: 20.
text: Jack smiles broadly.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: (playfully)
dialog: So shall I book some tickets for
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (still smiling)
dialog: No.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Back by ten, please, David. She's
text: usually in bed by then.
text: Jenny winces.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I was hoping Jenny would come
dialog: with me afterwards to have a bite
dialog: of supper with my aunt Helen.
text: Jenny studies him carefully. Suddenly his friends Danny and
dialog: Helen have become `Aunt Helen'.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, well, I suppose...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How about if I promise to have
dialog: her in by eleven thirty?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, it's Friday night. And if
dialog: you're going out to the West
dialog: End...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thanks, Jack. I appreciate it.
dialog: See you again.
text: They exchange warm handshakes. He turns to Marjorie.
text: Marjorie extends her hand. David takes it, but kisses it
text: suavely,leaving her a little flustered.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Have a nice time.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Bye.
text: Jenny and David leave.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (sniffing the air)
dialog: What's that smell? Has he got
dialog: perfume on?
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: It's called after-shave, Jack.
dialog: And it makes a change from
dialog: carbolic soap.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: At least there's no confusion, if
dialog: you smell of carbolic soap.
text: Marjorie rolls her eyes.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Nobody's ever going to get
dialog: confused about you, dear.
scene_heading: 15A EXT. ST JOHN'S, SMITH SQUARE. NIGHT 15A
text: Jenny and David walk toward the beautiful hall. Jenny
text: suddenly looks young in the dress that looks too old for
text: her - other adults are milling around outside, and the
text: women don't look like girls dressed up. David makes for an
text: incredibly glamorous and attractive couple in their late
text: twenties who are waiting outside - DANNY and HELEN. Helen
dialog: is as far from anyone's idea of an aunt as one can get.
text: She's no more beautiful than Jenny, but she's dressed both
text: appropriately and spectacularly, in early-60s, pre-hippy
text: Bohemian gear. She turns heads in a way that Jenny is not
text: yet able to. Danny too is attractive, but soberly so. David
text: and Jenny are, in a way, paler, less striking versions of
dialog: these two.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hello hello. Are we late?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I was hoping we'd miss the
dialog: beginning, and then it wouldn't
dialog: be worth going in, and we could
dialog: go off dancing or something.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Helen is one of the more
dialog: reluctant members of tonight's
dialog: audience.
text: Jenny and David laugh politely.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jenny, these are my friends Helen
dialog: and Danny.
dialog: 22.
text: Jenny shakes hands with the two of them. They both give her
text: fascinated and clearly appraising looks. They have heard
dialog: about her.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Shall we?
text: They walk into the hall.
scene_heading: 16 INT. ST JOHN'S SMITH SQUARE. NIGHT 16
text: It's a beautiful hall - Jenny is dazzled by the
dialog: surroundings and the company. She's particularly bowled
text: over by Helen.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Look. We can leave our coats
dialog: over there. I want to get rid of
dialog: this.
text: She nods at the coat she's carrying. Jenny looks thrilled
text: at the prospect of spending a couple of minutes with Helen.
text: Danny hands Helen his coat, without saying anything. The
text: girls walk over to another reception table a few yards
text: away, behind which is a cloakroom. A lady is exchanging
text: overcoats for tickets. Almost involuntarily, Jenny touches
text: the sleeve of Helen's velvety jacket. She stops herself.
text: Helen notices.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I'm so sorry.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (amused)
dialog: That's OK. It's nice, isn't it?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: It's beautiful. Where did it come
dialog: from?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh, South Ken somewhere.
text: Helen looks at Jenny's outfit, her frumpy `smart' dress,
text: apparently wanting to return the compliment.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (nodding at the dress)
dialog: This is...Well, it's good for
dialog: this sort of concert, isn't it?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 23.
text: Helen is now at the front of the queue, and hands her coat
text: over imperiously.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: We should go shopping together
dialog: one day, if you want.
text: She takes a ticket from the cloakroom lady.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: That would be nice. But South
dialog: Ken... C'est beaucoup trop cher
dialog: pour moi.
text: They stare at each other. Helen is bewildered, Jenny
dialog: embarrassed.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Sorry?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I just said....It was too
dialog: expensive for me.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: No you didn't. You said something
text: completely different.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I just...Well, I said it in
dialog: French.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: In French? Why?
text: Jenny feels humiliated; she is yet to realise what we can
text: see - that Helen is simply very dim.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I don't know.
text: Jenny looks away. Helen stares at her. The performance bell
text: rings, and they make their way back to the men. To Jenny's
text: surprise and pleasure, Helen links arms with her as they
dialog: walk.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Anyway. It's too expensive for
dialog: me, too. We don't have to worry
dialog: about that. If you want something
dialog: in South Ken, get David to take
dialog: you shopping.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Why on earth would he want to
dialog: take me shopping?
dialog: 24.
text: Helen makes a knowing face.
scene_heading: 17 INT. ST JOHN'S SMITH SQUARE. NIGHT 17
text: David, Jenny, Danny and Helen in a row in the middle of the
text: auditorium, watching the stage and listening to the music.
text: Jenny can't concentrate - she's too excited by the occasion
text: and the company. Jenny sneaks a glance at Helen, who stares
text: straight ahead, unblinking and enigmatic. David is smiling,
text: as if he's trying to communicate enjoyment; Danny's eyes
text: flicker across the stage - he understands the music, its
dialog: component parts, which musicians are contributing what.
text: Jenny takes it all in.
scene_heading: 18 EXT. ST JOHN'S SMITH SQUARE. NIGHT 18
text: Jenny, David, Danny and Helen emerge with the other concert-
dialog: goers.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I booked a table at Juliette's.
dialog: Will that kill the mood, do you
dialog: think?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh, I do hope so.
text: The others laugh.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I always think I'm going to my
dialog: own funeral when I listen to
dialog: classical music. (Tentatively)
dialog: That was classical, wasn't it?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yes. Very classical. As classical
dialog: as you can get.
text: Helen looks pleased.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Juliette's it is, then. Heaven
dialog: forbid that we should end the
dialog: evening reflecting on our own
dialog: mortality.
text: Jenny smiles in delight. She's never met people like this.
scene_heading: 19 INT. JULIETTE'S. NIGHT 19
text: A singer in the Julie London mould is singing `I'm In The
text: Mood For Love' while cigarette girls and glamorous
text: waitresses patrol the tables.
dialog: 25.
text: Jenny is sitting with the others at a table in the club,
text: eating and talking. She looks about twelve, but she's
dialog: thrilled to be there. We know now that her life can never
dialog: be the same again, and there will be no going back to fish-
text: paste sandwiches with spotty Graham.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Have you never heard "Chante
dialog: Francoise Sagan"?
text: Jenny shakes her head. Her eyes are wide - she's clearly
text: awe-struck. David offers her a cigarette - a Gitane - which
text: she takes. He lights it for her while she's listening.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Oh, it's wonderful.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I've only got....Well, I think
dialog: it's just called `Juliette
dialog: Greco'. The one with the eyes on
dialog: the sleeve. I saved up and got my
dialog: French conversation teacher to
dialog: bring it back after Christmas.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: You've got a French conversation
dialog: teacher?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Is that why you suddenly speak
dialog: French for no reason?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (ignoring her)
dialog: You must have seen her sing?
text: Jenny shakes her head again and smiles. Where would she
text: have seen Juliette Greco? Danny, meanwhile, is baffled. Who
dialog: hasn't seen Juliette Greco?
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: She's marvellous.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: But you should see her in Paris,
dialog: not here. David will take you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'd love to. You'd fit right in.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (sympathetically)
dialog: Better than here, really.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's wonderful to find a young
dialog: person who wants to know things.
dialog: There's so much I want you to
dialog: see.
text: They sip their drinks pensively, possibly to allow time for
text: the double-entendre to disappear into the smoke.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Are you still all right to come
dialog: and have a look at that Pembroke
dialog: Villas place with me on Friday,
dialog: Danny?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Oh. No. Can't do it. There's a
text: Burne-Jones coming up at
dialog: Christie's on Friday. And I want
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (laughing in disbelief)
dialog: You're thinking of buying a Burne-
dialog: Jones? A real one?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I just have a feeling that the
dialog: pre-Raphaelites are going to take
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I love the pre-Raphaelites.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (excited by her
dialog: education)
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Yes, of course. Rossetti and
dialog: Burne-Jones, anyway. Not Holman
text: Hunt, so much. He's so garish.
text: Danny looks at her. There's clearly more to this schoolgirl
dialog: than he thought.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Absolutely! Why don't we all go
dialog: to the auction? Wouldn't that be
dialog: fun?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: An auction. Gosh. How exciting.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Next Friday morning. David will
dialog: pick you up.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (crestfallen)
dialog: Oh. Friday.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You're busy?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Well. Yes.
text: She doesn't want to explain why.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Tant pis.
text: Helen looks at him aghast. Why has he started speaking
dialog: French?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Are you sure you're busy?
text: Jenny hesitates.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: No. I'm sure I could....re-
dialog: arrange. That would be lovely.
scene_heading: 20 INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. NIGHT 20
text: Jenny lets herself quietly into the house. The hallway is
text: dark, but she can hear noises from the kitchen. She pokes
text: her head round the corner, and sees her mother doing the
text: washing-up.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Oh, hello, love. Did you have a
dialog: nice time?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: I can't get this casserole dish
dialog: clean. We had hot-pot tonight,
dialog: and it's all burnt round...
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: It's twenty-five to twelve. We
dialog: finish tea at seven.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: I know what the time is. How was
dialog: your evening?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: It was...It was the best night of
dialog: my life.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: And he took you home in his car?
dialog: Right to the door?
text: Jenny looks at her. She doesn't seem to have heard what
dialog: Jenny has just said.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Goodnight, Mum.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: And I'm glad you enjoyed the
dialog: concert.
scene_heading: 21 INT. CLASSROOM. DAY 21
text: Jenny, Hattie and Tina are sitting on their desks, waiting
text: for the start of a lesson. Nine or ten classmates are
text: scattered around the room, talking distractedly, but
text: Jenny's group is much more animated: Tina and Hattie are
text: leaning forward, listening to Jenny, their eyes bright.
text: They are clearly awestruck by Jenny's tales of the outside
dialog: world.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: (to Hattie)
dialog: I'm not interested in Schubert. I
dialog: want to know what else was on the
dialog: programme.
text: Laughter.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: There was nothing like that. He
dialog: was the perfect gentleman. He
dialog: just said he wanted to take me
dialog: places and show me things.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Things plural? Oh my Gawd!
text: More laughter. The English teacher, MISS STUBBS, young and
text: fresh-faced and lively-looking, enters, and picks up on
text: the excitement of Jenny's coterie.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: I knew that in the end `Jane
dialog: Eyre' would work its magic upon
dialog: you. I'm presuming that's what
dialog: you're so animated about.
text: The students start to sit down at desks in a more
dialog: conventional arrangement.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: `Jane Eyre' and Jenny's new
dialog: boyfriend.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: He's not my "new boyfriend". God.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: It's true. He's more a man-
dialog: friend, isn't he? He's got a
text: sports-car, Miss Stubbs.
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: Ah. A Mr Rochester figure.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: I think he must be as blind as Mr
dialog: Rochester.
text: Laughter. Jenny pulls a face at her.
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: Is there no end to your thirst
dialog: for literary understanding,
dialog: Jenny? As you may have noticed,
dialog: I'm attempting to turn the
text: subject away from Jenny's lurid
dialog: love-life and towards the matter
text: in hand.
text: She starts to hand out essays.
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: And it's quite clear on this
dialog: evidence that most of you know
dialog: much too much about the former,
dialog: and almost nothing about the
dialog: latter. Reluctantly I must
dialog: concede that Jenny is evidently
dialog: an expert on both matters.
dialog: Excellent as always, Jenny.
text: Miss Stubbs slaps an essay down on Jenny's desk. We can see
dialog: that it's marked `A+'.
dialog: 30.
scene_heading: 22 INT. JENNY'S BEDROOM. NIGHT 22
text: Jenny at her desk, working. She puts down her pen,
text: distracted.
scene_heading: 23 INT. DAVID'S CAR. DAY 23
text: David sitting in his Bristol, waiting.
scene_heading: 24 EXT. SCHOOL. DAY 24
text: We see the Bristol parked outside, and Jenny walking
text: towards it, a small figure in a large playground. She's
text: clearly just changed out of her school uniform, and she's
text: making last-minute adjustments to her civvies. A teacher
text: walks towards her, and Jenny almost freezes - but the
text: teacher merely smiles pleasantly and walks past. Jenny
text: keeps walking at a measured pace for a moment and then
text: breaks into a run.
scene_heading: 25 INT/EXT. CAR/DILAPIDATED HOUSE. DAY 25
text: Jenny and David are driving along a North Kensington
dialog: street.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: How do you know Danny?
text: David is distracted. He's driving slowly, apparently
dialog: looking for an address.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, you know. We kept bumping
dialog: into each other, and we became
dialog: pals, and we've ended up doing a
dialog: bit of work together, when it
dialog: suits us.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: What kind of work?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Property. A bit of art dealing.
dialog: Some buying and selling. This and
dialog: that...
text: He stops the car.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'll be two seconds.
text: He gets out of the car, and Jenny watches him as he crosses
dialog: the road.
dialog: 31.
text: Outside a dilapidated house covered in scaffolding stands a
dialog: large West Indian family, mother, father, three or four
text: small children and a dog. They are surrounded by what
text: appears to be all their worldly goods. David squats down on
text: his haunches, talks to the kids, tousles the hair of the
text: smallest. Then he takes out a bunch of keys and ushers the
text: family down the path. He unlocks the door and leads them
dialog: inside.
text: In an upper window of the house, we see an old lady peering
text: down anxiously.
scene_heading: 26 EXT. STREET/DILAPIDATED HOUSE. DAY 26
text: David emerges from the house, jangling his keys.
scene_heading: 27 INT. CAR. DAY 27
text: Jenny opens the glove compartment where David keeps his
text: cigarettes, takes out the packet, removes one for herself,
text: offers the packet to David as he gets into the car. He
text: lights them both.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm sorry about that.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: How do you know those, those
dialog: ...Negro people?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: They're clients.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Clients?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jenny darling, even schwarzers
dialog: have to live somewhere. And it's
dialog: not as if they can rent off their
dialog: own kind, is it?
text: He starts the car and drives off.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I'm not sure I quite understand
dialog: what you do.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You don't need to. It's too
dialog: boring. All you need to know is
dialog: that I work in property so that I
dialog: can take you to nice places.
text: Jenny's POV of the black family in one window, and the
text: little old lady disappearing from another.
dialog: 32.
scene_heading: 28 INT. CHRISTIE'S. DAY 28
text: Danny intent on a catalogue, Helen gazing dreamily into
text: space, as David and Jenny push their way through the
text: crowded auction room. The auctioneer burbles on in the
dialog: background.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You nearly missed it.
text: Jenny is in awe of rich London in all its finery. The
text: auctioneer clears his throat.
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: We turn to lot 41, The Tree of
dialog: Forgiveness, by Sir Edward Burne-
dialog: Jones. This is a rare opportunity
dialog: to purchase a key work of the Pre-
dialog: Raphaelite movement. Who will
dialog: start me off at five hundred
dialog: guineas?
text: Jenny glances at Danny. He makes no move at this price.
text: Neither does anyone else. He's poised and listening hard.
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: Two hundred?
text: A middle-aged lady, the epitome of the middle-aged
text: contemporary Sloane, twin-set, pearls and a lot of face
text: powder, raises her hand.
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: Thank you, madam. Three hundred?
text: A man raises his hand.
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: Do I hear three-fifty?
text: The middle -aged Sloane nods.
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: Over to you sir. Four hundred
dialog: guineas? Thank you. Four hundred
dialog: and fifty...
text: Danny continues to sit there. Jenny is confused. The middle-
text: aged lady bids four-fifty. David, sitting next to Danny,
text: whispers something to him. Danny nods.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (whispers to Jenny)
dialog: Your turn.
text: Jenny looks at him.
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: No further bids?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Quick!
text: Jenny raises her hand high, just as she'd do at school.
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: Five hundred guineas from the
text: very eager new bidder.
text: People look round and smile when they see who has come in.
text: Jenny blushes, but stares fixedly ahead.
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: Five hundred and fifty, madam?
dialog: Thank you.
text: Jenny looks at David, who nods.
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: Six hundred guineas.
text: Jenny gestures more economically.
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: Six-fifty? Thank you, madam.
dialog: Seven hundred...
text: Jenny is almost insouciant this time.
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: Seven hundred?
text: The middle-aged lady shakes her head and purses her lips.
dialog: when asked if she wants to bid £700.
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: Sold for six hundred and fifty
dialog: guineas. Thank you.
text: He brings down the gavel, and a murmur goes around the
text: room. Jenny is excited and giggly. David pats her on the
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: Your name, please?
text: Jenny looks at Danny.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You know who you are.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (to Danny)
dialog: Jenny Mellor.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I know who you are, too. Tell
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (louder,to auctioneer)
dialog: Jenny Mellor.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Thank you. Couldn't have bought
dialog: it without you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Well done. A nerveless
dialog: performance.
text: Jenny beams. She's thrilled.
scene_heading: 29 INT. DANNY'S FLAT. DAY 29
text: A beautiful, large, airy sitting room in the first-floor
text: flat in Bedford Square. The flat is unusually and
text: tastefully decorated, opulent and indicative of Bohemian
text: good taste. Jenny is sipping a glass of white wine and
text: walking around the room enthralled, looking at Danny's
dialog: existing Pre-Raphaelite art collection; he has three or
text: four big paintings proudly displayed on his walls. Danny
text: is talking her through them while Helen and David, sitting
text: on the sofa, watch - David proudly, Helen impassively.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: A couple of years ago you could
dialog: pick these up for fifty quid, you
dialog: know. Nobody was interested.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Really? Fifty pounds? I don't
dialog: believe you.
text: Suddenly Jenny sees a cello in the corner of the room - a
dialog: good one.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: That's not a Lockey-Hill!
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: There aren't many people who come
dialog: in here and say that.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Certainly not me.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: It's beautiful. Do you play?
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I used to. I vowed to myself that
dialog: one day I'd own one of these. And
dialog: now I own one and never touch it.
dialog: It's vulgar to put it on show,
dialog: really.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Give it to Jenny.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: That would be even more vulgar.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Play for us, Jenny.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Gosh, no. One day. When I'm good
dialog: enough for it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: She's good enough now.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Oh, David. You've never heard me.
text: Danny stands up and stretches.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I shall come to hear you in St
dialog: John's Smith Square. Or in
dialog: Oxford, when you get there.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: We should all go and spend a
text: weekend in Oxford. Straw boaters,
text: punting, cream teas, antiquarian
dialog: bookshops. Bit of business, if we
dialog: can find it. What about next
dialog: weekend?
speaker_heading: DAVID/HELEN
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: A weekend away? I wouldn't be
dialog: allowed to do that.
text: They all look at her.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'll find a way. I'll talk to
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Who?
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Jack and Marjorie.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oxford.
text: Jenny hoots with derision.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: You're going to ask my father if
dialog: I can go away with you for the
dialog: weekend? He'd have you arrested.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We'll see.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I'll bet you you can't do it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How much?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Be careful, Jenny. You don't know
dialog: who you're dealing with.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Half-a-crown.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You're on.
text: They shake hands. Jenny suddenly notice the clock on
text: Danny's mantelpiece.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Mon dieu! You must take me back
dialog: to school. And I've got to change
text: back into my uniform.
text: There is a silence. Danny and David make momentary eye
text: contact - they are clearly contemplating the erotic
text: possibilities of Jenny's last sentence. Helen notices.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh, behave yourselves.
text: Jenny looks at them all, mystified.
dialog: 37.
scene_heading: 30 INT. CLASSROOM/LATIN. DAY. 30
text: Jenny is in her Latin class, waiting for the lesson to
text: begin. Tina and Hattie aren't with her, and she sits on her
dialog: own -the atmosphere of the class is very different from
text: Miss Stubbs' English lessons. The girls are different, more
text: serious, less fun, and the atmosphere is more sombre. The
text: teacher, MRS WILSON, is older, plainer, stricter. She pulls
text: some papers out of her bag.
speaker_heading: MRS WILSON
dialog: Test results for the Virgil
dialog: translation. We will start from
dialog: the bottom...Patricia.
text: Jenny puffs out her cheeks. She's not last.
speaker_heading: MRS WILSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Absent. Margaret. 48%. Jenny...
text: Jenny winces.
speaker_heading: MRS WILSON (CONT'D)
dialog: 52%. That would just about scrape
dialog: a pass in the exam proper. Not
dialog: good enough for Oxford
dialog: candidates.
scene_heading: 31 INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. DAY 31
text: Jenny and her mother are sitting on the sofa, staring into
text: space, clearly upset. On the coffee table in front of them
text: is the test, covered in red ink. They hear a key in the
text: lock, and they look at each other.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: I'll talk to him.
text: Jack enters, back from work. He's wearing a suit and
text: carrying a battered briefcase. He looks at them, and then
text: notices the essay on the table.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's her Latin, isn't it?
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: The test didn't...Well, it didn't
dialog: go as well as we'd hoped.
text: He picks up the paper.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: And you still say I shouldn't go
dialog: down there and have it out with
dialog: whatsername? The Latin teacher?
dialog: Because this is hopeless.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: How are you going to "have it
dialog: out" with her? What are you going
dialog: to do? Shout at her until she
dialog: decides I'm much cleverer than
dialog: she thinks?
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Everyone's doing their best,
dialog: Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What if their best isn't good
dialog: enough, though, eh? What do we do
dialog: then?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: We don't go to Oxford. Any of us.
dialog: Not even you, Dad.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Perhaps it's all a waste of time
dialog: and money anyway.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: You don't mean that.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, what's she going to do with
dialog: an English degree? And if she's
dialog: going to spend three years
dialog: playing that bloody cello and
text: talking in French to beatniks,
dialog: then I'm throwing good money
dialog: after bad. I suppose she might
dialog: meet a nice lawyer. But she could
dialog: do that at a dinner dance
dialog: tomorrow.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Oh, yes. That's the whole point
dialog: of an Oxford education. It's the
dialog: expensive alternative to a dinner
dialog: dance.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: What about private tuition?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Is anyone listening to me? How
dialog: much is that going to cost me?
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Five shillings an hour. Maybe a
dialog: little more for A-level.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Five bob! But... we could spend
dialog: five bob on this and five bob on
dialog: that, and before we know it
dialog: that's our savings down the
dialog: drain.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: And what else are we spending
dialog: five bob on? What else are we
dialog: spending sixpence on?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Oh, nothing. (He gestures round
dialog: the room.) It's all free. That
dialog: vase was free.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: It was, actually. It was a
dialog: present from Auntie Vi.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: That chair was free. The sofa.
dialog: We don't have to pay for
dialog: anything. And even if we did, we
dialog: don't have to work for it. That's
dialog: the beauty of life, Jenny.
dialog: Everything's free. Grows on
dialog: trees. Wonderful, isn't it? (He
text: warms to his theme, and grows
dialog: progressively more berserk.)
dialog: We've got a lovely Oxford tree in
dialog: the garden, lucky for you, so
dialog: that's Oxford taken care of. And
text: a whole orchard of school trees,
dialog: so that's all free. I'm sure
dialog: there are some private tuition
dialog: trees out there. I'll go and have
text: a look.
text: He stands up.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Jack...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, no, won't take me a minute. I
dialog: think I saw some at the back
text: there, right next to the pocket
dialog: money tree. I'll just nip out
dialog: and check, see that they're
dialog: doing all right.
dialog: 40.
dialog: Don't want anyone climbing over
dialog: the wall and scrumping, do we?
dialog: And you never know. Maybe
dialog: there'll be a man with deep
text: pockets growing out there.
dialog: Because God knows we need to find
dialog: you one.
text: He leaves the room, apparently to look in the garden for
text: the mythical trees.
scene_heading: 31A INT. JENNY'S HOUSE 31A
text: Jenny and her mother move to the window to watch him
text: talking theatrically to the trees.
scene_heading: 32 EXT. STREET/COFFEE BAR. DAY. 32
text: Jenny, Hattie and Tina are walking back from school.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: You could always go to
text: secretarial college with Hattie.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Oh, thanks.
speaker_heading: HATTIE
dialog: Charming!
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Oh, no.
text: Hattie and Tina follow Jenny's eyes, and they see Graham
text: coming towards them pushing his bike, red-faced, trousers
text: tucked into socks.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Oh. Graham. Hello.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I haven't seen you for ages....It
dialog: all went wrong, didn't it? The
dialog: tea-party, I mean. Was it because
dialog: of the year off?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: No, no. It's just...I've got so
dialog: much to do if I'm going to get
dialog: the grades I need.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Yes. She's got no time for boys.
text: Hattie and Tina try to suppress giggles. Graham turns an
text: even brighter shade of red. Hattie and Tina enter the
text: coffee bar. Jenny feels sorry for him, is on the verge of
text: inviting him to join them...And changes her mind.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Bye, Graham.
text: She follows the girls inside.
scene_heading: 33 INT. JENNY'S BEDROOM/UPPER HALLWAY. NIGHT 33
text: Jenny is deep in her schoolwork. She has a Latin vocabulary
text: propped open on the window-ledge. She looks at it, walks
text: away, mutters to herself, attempting to memorize. Her
text: concentration is broken by a sudden gale of laughter from
text: downstairs.
scene_heading: 34 INT. JENNY'S HALL. NIGHT 34
text: She stands outside the living room for a moment, listening.
text: She hears a man's voice that does not belong to her father,
text: and then more laughter from her father and mother.
scene_heading: 35 INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT 35
text: David is in the middle of demonstrating his ability to
text: mimic all of the Goons. Jack and Marjorie are laughing so
text: hard that they can hardly see - they certainly miss Jenny's
dialog: entrance.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (curious)
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh. Hello. David does the most
dialog: brilliant Bluebottle, Jenny.
dialog: Actually, he can do all the
dialog: Goons.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't think I'm very good at
dialog: Eccles.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, no, you've got him...
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (impatiently)
dialog: But what's he doing here?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I wasn't going to disturb you. I
dialog: knew you'd have your nose to the
text: grindstone.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: You came to see Mum and Dad?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Is that so hard to imagine?
text: Jenny spies an open bottle of wine on the coffee-table.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: And you're drinking? But it's not
dialog: Christmas!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hark at her! Makes us sound as
dialog: though we've signed the pledge.
dialog: You don't know everything about
dialog: us, you know. We had a life
dialog: before you came along.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Yes, that's true. I'm only going
dialog: on what I've seen over the last
dialog: sixteen years.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: I'm trying to think what you
dialog: missed. Nothing much comes to
dialog: mind.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: They can't stand to see me
dialog: enjoying myself.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Anyway. Would you excuse me? I've
dialog: got a huge pile of Latin
dialog: translation to do.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You didn't tell me David went to
dialog: Oxford.
text: Jenny looks at David, who stares back at her straight-
dialog: faced.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: No. I didn't.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: For all the good it did me.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What did you read?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, English. Just like every
text: other semi-employed layabout in
dialog: London.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (marvelling at the
dialog: coincidence)
dialog: English! Which college?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Merton.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Isn't that funny?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Extraordinary.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I was just telling Jack that I'm
dialog: going back next weekend. I go and
dialog: see my old professor every now
dialog: and again.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That's what you need, Jenny.
text: Someone on the inside track. It's
dialog: not always what you know, is it,
dialog: David?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Too true. And Clive would love
dialog: Jenny. Have you ever come across
dialog: Clive Lewis?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Dad has never come across anyone.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I just thought he might know some
dialog: of the books.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Dad has never read any books.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (stung)
dialog: What's he written?
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He wrote a children's book called
dialog: `The Lion, The Witch and The
dialog: Wardrobe' that did very well, I
dialog: believe.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: CS Lewis? That's the Clive you're
dialog: talking about?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, to us he was just the old
dialog: codger who taught Medieval
dialog: literature. But I came to know
dialog: him very well. We just...got
dialog: along, do you know what I mean?
text: Everyone murmurs their comprehension.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Jenny used to love those books.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Gosh. That dates me. He was
dialog: writing them when I was there.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I'd love to meet him.
text: There is a pause. Jack and Marjorie look at the floor.
text: Somehow, David has manoeuvred a situation where,
text: effectively, he is the one being asked.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm being slow on the
dialog: uptake. Would Jenny like to come
dialog: with me at the weekend?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, I don't know about this
dialog: weekend. But one day, yes, thank
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: How often do you see him?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, once every couple of years.
dialog: But next time, eh?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: Hopefully I'll be there by then.
dialog: So that won't be much use.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (dubiously)
dialog: Well, I suppose...Would she have
dialog: to stay the night?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, I wouldn't want to drive
dialog: back after one of those Oxford
dialog: dinners.
text: Jack chuckles knowingly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Clive will get her a room in
dialog: college. That's easy enough.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Sounds like too good an
dialog: opportunity to pass up.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Please, Daddy. It would be so
dialog: helpful to know something about
dialog: the place.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Would it be a bother to you,
dialog: David?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'd be delighted.
text: Jack, Marjorie and Jenny all beam.
scene_heading: 36 INT. HALLWAY. NIGHT 36
text: Jenny opens the door for David.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (sotto voce)
dialog: That was scandalous.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I told you. You owe me half-a-
dialog: crown.
text: He kisses her on the cheek and disappears into the night.
scene_heading: 37 INT. DANNY'S FLAT. DAY 37
text: David and Danny are waiting for the girls to get ready.
text: Danny is sitting sprawled in an armchair; David is pacing
text: up and down.
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Come on!
scene_heading: 38 INT. HELEN'S BEDROOM. DAY 38
text: An ornate four-poster bed occupies most of the space in the
text: room. Helen is doing something to Jenny, but we can't see
dialog: what.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Nearly ready!
scene_heading: 39 INT. DANNY'S FLAT. DAY 39
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How can they only be nearly
dialog: ready?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I wouldn't be surprised if three
dialog: of them come out, you know.
dialog: That's the only explanation.
dialog: They're making themselves a
dialog: friend. LADIES! Let's go. Please.
scene_heading: 40 INT. HELEN'S BEDROOM. DAY 40
text: Jenny is wearing a floaty print dress that she has borrowed
dialog: from Helen, and there are lots of other beautiful clothes
text: strewn about the place. Jenny is sitting at the dressing
text: table, being made up by Helen. Jenny looks three or four
text: years older, more sophisticated....more like Helen. She
text: can't believe it. She looks in the mirror, and for a
text: moment, she forgets to breathe.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: There. You'll do. You can keep
dialog: it. I can only wear so many every
dialog: day.
text: Jenny emerges from her reverie.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (thrilled)
dialog: Really? Thank you.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What about tonight? Will you be
dialog: needing a nightie? Or not?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: A nightie?
text: Jenny suddenly understands what Helen means.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Will we be sharing bedrooms?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: You're not sleeping with him?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: No. I'm...No.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Good for you.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Really? Do you think so?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: You're only sixteen. And you
dialog: don't want to get into the
dialog: family way, do you?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Oh, I'd make sure that didn't
dialog: happen. I'm going to do it when
dialog: I'm seventeen. On my seventeenth
dialog: birthday, hopefully.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: With David?
text: Jenny pauses.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Well...Golly. I suppose it will
dialog: be with David, won't it?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: When's your birthday?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: April.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh, he'll be around in April. If
dialog: that's what you want. Anyway.
dialog: I'll find you a nightie.
text: Jenny stares at herself in the mirror again.
scene_heading: 41 INT. DANNY'S FLAT. DAY 41
text: The girls emerge. Both men are entranced by Jenny's
text: transformation. David can't take his eyes off her.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (thoughtful)
dialog: Shall, we, ah... Make a move?
dialog: 48.
text: He gets to his feet.
scene_heading: 42 INT/EXT. CAR COUNTRY ROAD. DAY. 42
text: The Bristol on the country road to Oxford.
scene_heading: 43 INT/EXT. CAR OXFORD DAY 43
text: The Bristol drives through Oxford. Jenny catches a quick
text: glimpse of a dreaming spire.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Imagine spending three years
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I know.
text: She shudders, as if someone has walked over her grave.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Can we stop?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Maybe later. There are a couple
dialog: of things we have to do.
scene_heading: 44 INT/EXT. CAR OXFORD BACK STREET. DAY. 44
text: Jenny and Helen in the back seat of the car, which is
text: parked outside a house in the back streets of Oxford.
text: There's no sign of Danny and David. Jenny sighs
dialog: impatiently.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh, it's always like this. There
dialog: are millions of places I've never
dialog: seen because I've been stuck in
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: You never get out?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: There's never anywhere to go in
text: the places they stop.
text: Jenny looks out of the window. This is self-evidently true.
scene_heading: 45 INT. PUB. EVENING. 45
text: Helen and Danny, Jenny and David are standing in a quiet,
text: old-fashioned pub, warming themselves at an open fire.
dialog: 49.
text: David has a pen in his hand, and he's holding a book - `The
dialog: Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe'.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So. Now.Is he Clive, do you
dialog: think? Or CS?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I'm confused now. I thought you'd
dialog: made him up?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (attempting, briefly, to
dialog: be patient)
dialog: No, we...Never mind.
text: David walks over to the nearest table and writes in the
dialog: book.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: There.
text: He stands up, hands the book to Jenny.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (reads)
dialog: "To dear Jenny. With the pleasure
dialog: of meeting you. Come and see me
dialog: again soon. Clive."
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Dirty old man.
text: Laughter. He takes a long drink from his pint of bitter. A
text: group of students enter, all carrying musical instruments.
text: They stand at the bar, waiting to be served. Jenny stares
text: at them with longing - she wants to be one of them. Helen,
text: meanwhile, stares at them as if they were aliens.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (sotto voce)
dialog: Why are university girls so
dialog: strange-looking?
text: Helen's right. The girls in the group are all bespectacled
text: and frumpy. The others laugh.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: It's true. And they can't all
dialog: have started off that way, can
dialog: they? Most girls aren't ugly, but
dialog: most girl students are. So there
dialog: must be something about those
dialog: places that, you know, makes you
text: fat, or spotty, or short-sighted.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, if you look at it that
dialog: way...I mean, that's proper
dialog: scientific analysis. And you
dialog: can't argue with science.
text: Helen looks pleased.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I'm still not quite clear on what
dialog: you want to do when you get here.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I want to read English.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Books?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Sorry?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: You want to read English books?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Oh. Yes. Reading English is just
dialog: another way of saying...
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I wouldn't worry, Jenny. You're
dialog: wasting your breath.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Anyway, tomorrow we'll try to get
dialog: more of a feel for the place.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Absolutely. This would be a good
dialog: place to do a little business.
text: David catches Jenny's eye. This isn't what he meant by
dialog: "getting a feel for the place."
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: All those little old ladies
dialog: wandering around...I'll bet this
text: place is rife with stats.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Please explain what stats are.
dialog: You're always going on about
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: All right. Think of a number. Now
dialog: think about the most boring
dialog: lesson you've ever had at school.
dialog: 51.
dialog: Now double it. Done? Doubled? Now
dialog: multiply it by the number you
dialog: first thought of, and there you
dialog: are. That's the official boredom
dialog: content of stats.
text: Jenny laughs.
scene_heading: 46 INT. B &amp; B BEDROOM. NIGHT 46
text: A rather grotty and certainly unromantic B&amp;B bedroom - so
text: unromantic, in fact, that it even has the same fusty
text: curtains from Jenny's sitting room. David is in bed, his
text: hands behind his head, waiting for Jenny. As far as we can
text: tell - he's wrapped up in the sheets quite tightly - he's
text: in his underwear. The bedroom is lit unromantically by the
text: 40-watt overhead light. Jenny comes into the room wearing
text: one of Helen's nightdresses, a glamorous satiny item quite
dialog: inappropriate for the occasion or the surroundings. She
text: looks nervous.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: We've got exactly the same
text: curtains at home.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Let's not talk about curtains.
dialog: You look beautiful. You really
dialog: are a princess.
text: Jenny was about to get into bed, but his tone makes her
text: pause at the edge of the bed.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: There's something you should
dialog: know, David. I'm...Well, I'm a
dialog: virgin. And I want to stay that
dialog: way until I'm seventeen.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I think that's good. I think
dialog: that's right. And for your
dialog: seventeenth birthday I'm going to
dialog: take you to Paris or Rome or
dialog: Florence and make you feel like
dialog: the most beautiful princess in
dialog: the kingdom of love. But we can
dialog: still be romantic, can't we?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Well, yes. Of course we can. If
dialog: it doesn't mean...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Minnie....
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Is that me?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes. You're my Minnie Mouse, and
dialog: I'm your bubbalub.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Oh. If that's what..
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Minnie.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Yes, David?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (prompting)
dialog: Bubbalub...
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Sorry. Yes, bubbalub?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Would you mind if I had a look at
dialog: what might one day be mine? Just
dialog: a peek?
text: His eyes stray to her breasts. Jenny stares at him.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: You just want to see them?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I just want to see them.
text: Jenny, flustered and nervous, looks at her nightgown - she
dialog: doesn't know what to do.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Let it fall from your shoulders.
text: She does so. He stares.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thank you.
text: He sits up, and lovingly lifts the straps back up. He
text: smiles at her. Relieved, she smiles back.
scene_heading: 47 INT/EXT. CAR COTTAGE. DAY 47
text: The Bristol, containing David and Jenny in the front seats
text: and Danny and Helen in the back, passing through a pretty
text: Oxfordshire village. It pulls up outside a country cottage
text: with a `FOR SALE' sign outside.
dialog: 53.
scene_heading: 48 INT. CAR. DAY 48
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Might be worth a look.
scene_heading: 49 EXT. CAR COTTAGE. DAY 49
text: The four get out of the car, and Jenny follows David and
text: Danny to the front door of the house. Helen hangs back.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Jenny...
text: Jenny turns around.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Aren't you coming?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: We don't go in.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: What are you talking about?

dialog: Helen will look after you. Go and
dialog: find a nice cup of tea somewhere.
text: Jenny is mystified.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I don't need looking after, thank
dialog: you very much. David, I want to
dialog: see...
text: David ignores her.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I'm not going to tell you a
dialog: second time. Now. Run along.
scene_heading: 49A EXT. BENCH. DAY 49A
text: Helen and Jenny waiting for the boys. Helen is blithe,
text: chatty; Jenny has a face like thunder.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: They won't be long. Either way.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: "Either way"?
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Sometimes they find something,
dialog: sometimes they don't.
text: In the distance, David is waving at them urgently.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: And when they do find something,
dialog: we usually have to leave quite
dialog: quickly. They can be a bit
dialog: naughty, sometimes. Anyway. It's
dialog: nice to have company. I'm usually
dialog: outside on my own.
text: Jenny stares at Helen. She's beginning to realise who she
text: is dealing with.

scene_heading: 51 SCENE OMITTED 51
scene_heading: 52 INT/EXT. CAR NEW COUNTRY ROAD. DAY 52
text: An old picture of some kind is wedged between Helen and
text: Jenny on the back seat. Jenny, furious, is staring out of
text: the window. Helen attempts to peer around the partition,
text: but settles for a wave.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Coo-ee. Jenny.
text: Jenny doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Sorry about being a little brisk
dialog: back there, Jenny. We have our
dialog: way of doing things. Silly,
dialog: really.
text: Still no response.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, come on, Jenny. Let's not
dialog: spoil things.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (disbelieving)
dialog: Me? I'm spoiling things?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I think there must be some kind
dialog: of misunderstanding.
text: Jenny shakes her head bitterly. They continue driving in
dialog: silence.
dialog: 55.
scene_heading: 53 EXT. DANNY'S FLAT. DAY 53
text: The Bristol pulls up outside Danny's Bedford Square flat.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Who wants to come up for a
dialog: drink?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jenny?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (still furious)
dialog: No thanks. You go. I'll find my
dialog: own way home.
text: Jenny gets out of the car and starts up the road. David
text: gets out and starts to chase after her.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jenny!
text: He catches up with her in the street.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It was an old map. A Speed. It
dialog: was cooped up in that miserable
dialog: little cottage, and she didn't
dialog: even know what it was. What a
dialog: waste! It shouldn't spend its
text: life on a wall in wherever the
dialog: hell we are. It should be with
dialog: us. We know how to look after it
dialog: properly. We liberated it.
text: Jenny snorts derisively.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Liberated! That's one word for
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (quickly and
dialog: passionately)
dialog: Oh, don't be bourgeois, Jenny.
dialog: You're better than that. I know
dialog: you have fun with us. I can see
dialog: it. You drink everything I put in
dialog: front of you down in one, every
dialog: last drop, and then you slam your
text: glass down on the bar and ask for
dialog: more, and it's wonderful. We're
dialog: not clever like you, so we have
dialog: to be clever in other ways,
dialog: because if we weren't, there
dialog: would be no fun.
dialog: 56.
dialog: We have to be clever with maps,
dialog: and..and.. You want to know what
dialog: stats are? Stats are old ladies
dialog: who are scared of coloured
dialog: people. So I move the coloureds
text: in and the old ladies move out
dialog: and I buy their flats cheap.
dialog: That's what I do. So now you
dialog: know.
text: Jenny nods reluctantly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And if you don't like it, then I
dialog: will understand, and you can go
text: back to Twickenham and listen to
dialog: the Home Service and do your
dialog: Latin homework. But these
dialog: weekends, and the restaurants and
dialog: the concerts..They don't grow on
dialog: trees.
text: Jenny looks at him, startled. Trees again?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Do you understand? Of course you
dialog: do. This is who we are, Jenny.
text: He turns to face her and holds out his hand. On Jenny: is
text: she in or out? Jenny takes his hand. David pulls her
text: towards him, holds her around the waist and begins to dance
text: with her. Further up the pavement, Helen and Danny watch,
text: laughing.
scene_heading: 54 EXT/INT. CAR JENNY' HOUSE. NIGHT 54
text: David pulls up in the Bristol outside Jenny's house, and
text: they sit in the dark for a little while.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I suppose you have homework to
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Gosh. Yes. Loads. (Beat) Thank
dialog: you. I had a nice time.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (surprised, despite his
dialog: speech earlier)
dialog: Really? In spite of the, the
dialog: incident? With the map?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: As you said in the car, it was a
dialog: misunderstanding.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Exactly. A muddle.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: You have no idea how boring
dialog: everything was before I met you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I hope that there's something
dialog: more than excitement to our
dialog: relationship.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Excitement's a lot, when you're
dialog: at school and you live in
dialog: Twickenham.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You know what I'm trying to say.
dialog: I want you to like me for who I
dialog: am, not just what I can do for
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: But that is who you are. I've
dialog: never met anyone like you. Action
dialog: is character, our English teacher
dialog: says.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I think it means that if we never
dialog: did anything, we wouldn't be
dialog: anybody. And I never did anything
dialog: before I met you. And sometimes I
dialog: think no-one's ever done anything
dialog: in this stupid country, apart
dialog: from you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That's a good place to end the
dialog: weekend. I'll give you a tinkle.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Thank you.
text: They look at each other. David is clearly smitten. He moves
text: towards her. He wants to kiss her, but he doesn't want to
text: frighten her - in the end, Jenny makes it easy for him and
text: moves towards him. They kiss gently and tenderly.
text: Flustered, Jenny breaks it off, gets out of the car and
text: goes inside while David watches.
dialog: 58.
scene_heading: 55 INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. NIGHT 55
text: Jenny enters the sitting room with her overnight bag to
text: find the radio on, her father reading the paper and her
text: mother knitting. When Jenny comes in, Jack beams. He has
text: clearly turned some kind of corner.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Here she is! The wanderer
dialog: returns!
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Did you have a nice time?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Lovely, thank you.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Was he nice to you?
text: Jenny unzips her bag and pulls out her copy of the book.
text: She hands it to her father.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Look inside.
text: Jack examines the inscription.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well I never. Look at this,
dialog: Marjorie.
text: He hands it to her. She examines it reverently.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: "Clive"...Lucky girl. What was he
dialog: like?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: He was just...normal. Kind.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: And did he show you round?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Oh, he was busy. David did,
dialog: though.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: What did you think?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Beautiful.
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Did it make you want to work
dialog: harder?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Never a dull moment with David,
dialog: is there? If it's not concerts,
dialog: it's famous authors. Bit
dialog: different from that lad you
dialog: brought home for tea, isn't he?
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: David's a lot older than Graham.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Graham could live to be two
dialog: hundred, and he still wouldn't be
text: swanning around with famous
dialog: authors. Hasn't got it in him.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: He might become a famous author,
dialog: for all you know.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Being one isn't the same as
dialog: knowing one, is it? Anyone can be
dialog: one. But if you move in those
dialog: circles...
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, it says something about
dialog: you, doesn't it? It says you're
dialog: going places. It says you're well
dialog: connected. He's an impressive
dialog: young man, that David. I like him
dialog: more and more.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Well, they say opposites attract,
dialog: don't they? I wouldn't have
dialog: thought he was your sort.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: He wasn't. And now he is.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Is that how you feel, Jenny?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I feel....I Feel I should do my
dialog: homework.
text: She leaves the room. Marjorie watches her go thoughtfully.
dialog: 60.
scene_heading: 56 EXT. PARK. DAY 56
text: A group of girls cross-country running. Jenny and her
text: friends are at the back of the group, and the gym teacher ,
text: jogging backwards, gesticulates at them to get a move on.
speaker_heading: GYM TEACHER
dialog: Ladies, please. Christmas is
dialog: coming.
text: They put on enough of a spurt to satisfy her, and then
text: immediately stop when the teacher is no longer watching.
text: Seeing an attractive bench, they sit down. From somewhere
text: under a skirt, Jenny produces a packet of exotic-looking
text: cigarettes and offers them around.
speaker_heading: HATTIE
dialog: What the hell are those?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Russian Sobranies.
text: Hattie and Tina make snooty faces. Jenny takes a cigarette.
text: The others follow suit. Jenny lights them, and they all
text: grimace. The contrast between the sophisticated cigarettes,
text: and the unsophisticated smokers and context is pronounced.
speaker_heading: HATTIE
dialog: Where did they come from?
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: She might have bought them from
dialog: the Savoy, or Claridges, or the
dialog: opera, or some fancy nightclub.
dialog: Who knows, with Jenny?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Paris. You can't buy them here.
speaker_heading: TINA
text: (suddenly looking at
dialog: her suspiciously)
dialog: You never bought them yourself?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (mimicking Tina's
dialog: grammar cruelly)
dialog: No. I never.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Shut up, you stuck-up cow.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: But I'll bring you some back, if
dialog: you want.
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: You're joking.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Non.
speaker_heading: HATTIE
dialog: He's taking you to Paris?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (smiling smugly)
dialog: Oui.
speaker_heading: HATTIE
dialog: This term?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Peut-etre.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Isn't it your birthday next
dialog: Tuesday?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Might be.
text: The two friends shriek and jump up and down.
speaker_heading: HATTIE
dialog: Oh, my God! Your birthday!
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: I wouldn't like to be you. All
dialog: those dinners you've had off him.
dialog: Ouch.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: You have such a Victorian
dialog: attitude to sex, you two.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Oh, sorry, Dr Kinsey. We're not
dialog: all as experienced as you. I
dialog: mean, you've done it...(She
dialog: counts on her fingers) I make it
dialog: never! Can that be right?
speaker_heading: HATTIE
dialog: But your parents are just going
dialog: to let you swan off like that?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: They don't know yet. David's got
text: a plan, he says. He usually has
text: something up his sleeve.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: I've noticed that. What did he
dialog: tell them when you had your
dialog: weekend in Oxford?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (animated by the memory)
dialog: Oh, it was....(She changes her
dialog: mind) David went to Oxford.
dialog: Merton. English. And he offered
dialog: to show me round.
speaker_heading: HATTIE
dialog: So you have a good-looking
dialog: boyfriend with pots of money,
dialog: brains and a nice car.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Apparently I do.
text: Tina makes a bitter face.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: And they tell us there's a God.
text: Laughter. Jenny glances off into the distance, and spots a
text: portly middle-aged woman heading in their direction.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Sod. Miss Davies.
text: They stand up, grind their Sobranies into the mud, kick
text: them under the bench, and set off at a brisk trot. The
text: Sobranie stubs come to rest near a pile of dog poo.
scene_heading: 57 INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. DAY 57
text: Breakfast on Jenny's birthday. Jenny is at the table
text: buttering toast. Jack is reading the paper, Marjorie is
text: cooking him eggs and bacon.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Is David taking you somewhere
dialog: special tonight?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Not that I know of.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: I've asked Graham round for tea
dialog: and birthday cake.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Graham?
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What do we want him round for?
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: I happened to be talking to his
dialog: mother about something, and...
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: What did you happen to be talking
dialog: to her about?
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: I thought it would be nice.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: What if David turns up?
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Are we expecting David to turn
dialog: up?
text: Jenny shrugs.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It might not be a bad thing if he
dialog: did.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: (doubtful)
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, if you think about it,
dialog: there's more than one way of
text: skinning a cat.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: And who's the skinned cat, in
dialog: this enchanting image? Me?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, of course...
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I have an education to pursue.
scene_heading: 58 INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. EVENING 58
text: Graham, Jenny and her father are at the dinner table,
text: sitting in the dark. Marjorie kicks the door open with her
text: foot and comes in holding a birthday cake with seventeen
text: candles burning on it. She puts it down carefully on the
dialog: table.
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Blow them out, then, before the
text: whole place burns down.
text: Jenny closes her eyes, makes her wish, blows out her
text: candles. Her father and mother both look at her, apparently
text: attempting to read her mind. Jack gets up to turn the
text: lights on. We can see that by Jenny's side are two
text: unopened, carefully-wrapped presents, both exactly the same
text: size - clearly books.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Who'd like a piece?
text: In truth, the cake is a rather sorry and unappetising
text: specimen. There isn't enough icing on the top. She cuts a
text: couple of slices which immediately collapse.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Never mind. I'll have one of
dialog: those.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Come on. Presents.
text: Without any real enthusiasm, Jenny opens the first one of
text: the two, from her mum and dad. It's a Latin dictionary.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Oh. Thank you. I needed a new
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (crestfallen)
dialog: Oh dear.
text: The doorbell rings. Jenny perks up. Jack goes to answer it,
text: and immediately the house is energised: it's David.
scene_heading: 58A INT/EXT JENNY'S HOUSE 58A
text: Jack answers the door to David.
scene_heading: 58B INT. JENNY'S HOUSE 58B
speaker_heading: JACK (O.S.)
dialog: Good grief. You won't believe
dialog: this, Jenny. Did you leave
dialog: anything in the shop?
text: David enters. You can hardly see him for all the parcels
text: and flowers he's carrying.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's a special day.
dialog: 65.
text: He and Jenny exchange a glance. Jack comes in behind him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She's a special girl.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, I know it. (to Graham) Hello,
text: young man.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: This is Graham.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Graham, a pleasure. I'm David.
text: They shake hands. Graham suddenly looks five years younger.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Makes your dictionary look a bit
dialog: feeble, eh Graham?
text: Graham looks pained. Marjorie notices.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: And ours too, come to that.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, we're not the ones trying
text: to impress her.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Clearly.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: David, what can I get you to
dialog: drink?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What's everybody else having?
dialog: What have you got there, Graham?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I've given him a glass of pop.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (stung)
dialog: I'd better be going I have a
dialog: stack of homework to do.
text: Graham says his goodbyes. He tries to catch Jenny's eye,
text: but she looks away. Marjorie shows him to the door.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes. Well. You can put the pop
dialog: away now. What is there for the
dialog: grown-ups?
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: A glass of something warming?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You know me so well.
text: Hearty laughter from the two men.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Can I open anything yet?
text: Marjorie comes back into the room.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Wait for me.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Before you start on that little
dialog: lot , I have a surprise. Next
dialog: weekend, we're all going to Chez
dialog: Georges to celebrate Jenny's
dialog: birthday.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (flatly)
dialog: Lovely.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Chez Georges is in the Boulevard
dialog: St Germain. In Paris.
text: Jenny giggles her delight. Jack's smile is a little more
dialog: forced.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How d'you mean, Paris?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: You know the one, Dad.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (panic rising)
dialog: But..We haven't got any French
dialog: money. And I'm not sure...I just
dialog: don't think it would agree with
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Dad!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: They don't like us, the French,
dialog: you know. John Sutton at work
dialog: went once. They were very rude to
dialog: him. I'm not sure I'd like that.
dialog: 67.
text: Jenny understands David's ploy perfectly, and the role she
text: must play. Her eyes fill with tears. Jack notices.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't want to spoil anyone's
dialog: fun, but...It's not for me,
dialog: Europe. We'll go another time.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: You've just said you don't like
dialog: Europe. What's going to change?
dialog: It'll have to be Europe, won't
dialog: it? Because it isn't going to be
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: I can take her.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (genuinely indignant)
dialog: To France? And leave me here on
dialog: my own?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Oh, for God's sake.
text: Jack looks cornered. He needs to find a way out.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Listen, I'm really sorry to have
dialog: caused all this to-do. I just
dialog: thought it might be nice. But
dialog: I'll go with Aunt Helen and Uncle
dialog: Daniel. They can have your
dialog: tickets.
text: Jack looks at him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Aunt Helen? The one who went to
dialog: the concert with you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes, that's the one.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: Well, there we are.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (perplexed)
dialog: Where are we?
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Aunt Helen! Don't you see? If
dialog: Aunt Helen's going to be
dialog: there...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (the penny apparently
dialog: dropping)
dialog: Of course!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I didn't want to put a spoke in
dialog: anyone's wheels. But if you look
dialog: at it from my angle...A bachelor,
dialog: taking my daughter off to
dialog: Paris...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, impossible. I hadn't thought
dialog: it through properly. I do
dialog: apologise, Jack. Would you prefer
dialog: it if Helen took Jenny on her
dialog: own? I don't mind. I've been to
dialog: Paris before.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, I couldn't possibly ask...No,
dialog: no. If Aunt Helen's going...
text: He smiles broadly. He's off the hook. Jenny catches David's
text: eye and smiles.
scene_heading: 59 INT. CLASSROOM. DAY 59
text: Hattie, Tina and Jenny are sitting on their desks, waiting
text: for a lesson to start. Hattie shows Jenny a piece of paper
text: which apparently contains some kind of shopping list.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: There are some things you must
dialog: buy for us, and some things you
dialog: only have to buy for us if you're
dialog: a proper, true friend. (She
text: points at Hattie, then at
dialog: herself.) Chanel perfume, Chanel
dialog: perfume. (She repeats the
dialog: gesture) Chanel lipstick, Chanel
dialog: lipstick. What have I forgotten?
speaker_heading: HATTIE
dialog: Those funny cigarettes you were
text: smoking. Sobranies. Ten packets
dialog: each.
text: A very small girl, twelve or thirteen, comes in to the
text: classroom and approaches Jenny.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: SMALL GIRL
dialog: Are you the girl going to Paris?
text: Tina, Hattie and Jenny stare at her.
speaker_heading: SMALL GIRL
dialog: Well are you or aren't you?
dialog: Because I'd like some perfume.
text: Miss Stubbs comes into the classroom carrying books and
text: essays. She sees the small girl and shoos her out. She then
text: approaches Jenny and whispers discreetly into her ear.
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: Jenny, the headmistress would
text: like a word at the end of the
dialog: lesson. I'm afraid that the
dialog: legend of Mr Rochester may have
dialog: travelled further than you
dialog: intended.
text: Jenny looks at her, startled and a little sick.
scene_heading: 60 INT. HEADMISTRESS'S OFFICE. DAY. 60
text: The office is dark, wood-panelled, foreboding, apparently
text: designed to put all visitors ill-at-ease. The headmistress
dialog: would probably choose to be wood-panelled if she could.
text: She's tweedy, bespectacled, severe. There is a knock at the
text: door. She doesn't look up from her paperwork.
speaker_heading: HEADMISTRESS
dialog: Come.
text: Jenny enters, looking young and frightened.
speaker_heading: HEADMISTRESS
dialog: Ah. Miss Mellor.
text: Jenny tries to look back at her with all the courage she
dialog: can muster.
speaker_heading: HEADMISTRESS
dialog: We're all very excited about your
dialog: forthcoming trip to Paris. Our
dialog: excitement, indeed, knows no
dialog: bounds. Some of us can talk of
dialog: little else.
text: Jenny looks at her feet.
speaker_heading: HEADMISTRESS
dialog: An older man, I understand. A
text: word of warning, Miss Mellor.
dialog: 70.
dialog: There may well have been the odd
text: sixth-form girl who has lost an
dialog: important part of herself -
dialog: perhaps the best part - while
dialog: under our supervision. These
dialog: things happen, regrettably. If,
dialog: however, we are made aware of
dialog: this loss, then of course the
dialog: young lady in question would have
dialog: to continue her studies
dialog: elsewhere, if she still has any
dialog: use for `A'-levels. Is that
dialog: clear?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Can I go now?
speaker_heading: HEADMISTRESS
dialog: Please.
text: Jenny turns round and walks out without saying another
dialog: word.
scene_heading: 62 INT. HOTEL BEDROOM. EVENING 62
speaker_heading: 62PT 1
text: Through the window of a hotel suite, we see a BEA jet
text: soaring into the sky.
speaker_heading: 62PT 2
text: David and Jenny aren't on it, though. They are letting
text: themselves into the room. Jenny stares at the featureless
text: sitting room.
speaker_heading: JENNY
text: There's no bed.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Ah. I pushed the boat out and got
dialog: us a suite.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: A suite!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, if work stops us getting to
dialog: Paris until tomorrow, then work
dialog: can buy us a nice hotel room.
dialog: Anyway, it's a special occasion,
dialog: isn't it?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I would have thought that tonight
dialog: of all nights we only need a
dialog: bedroom.
dialog: 71.
text: Close on David's reaction - she hasn't forgotten that
dialog: tonight's the night.
scene_heading: 63 INT. HOTEL BEDROOM. NIGHT 63
text: David and Jenny in bed, in a dimly lit bedroom. They are
text: kissing - David more passionately than Jenny. He is making
text: little whimpers of excitement, and Jenny is clearly trying
text: hard to hide her nerves. We're acutely aware of her age,
text: and of her virginity. Suddenly David breaks off.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hold on a second. I've got
dialog: something.
text: Rather absurdly, he half-disappears over the side of the
text: bed, reaching for something on the floor. He comes back
text: with a banana. Jenny stares at him.

dialog: What on earth is that for?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I thought....I thought we might
dialog: want to practice.
text: Jenny shrieks with horror.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: With a banana?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I thought we'd get the messy bit
text: over with first.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: David, I don't want to lose my
text: virginity to a piece of fruit.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: David attempts to kiss her again. Jenny wriggles clear.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Let's wait until we get to Paris.
dialog: I think the moment might have
dialog: gone.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm sorry, Minnie. I'm such a
dialog: fool.
text: Jenny doesn't deny it.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: And David..... if tomorrow night
dialog: does happen, it will never happen
dialog: again, so...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (alarmed)
dialog: Why won't it ever happen again?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Because the first time can only
dialog: happen once.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: So, please...No Minnies. No baby-
dialog: talk. I'm not old enough for baby-
dialog: talk. Treat me like a grown-up.
text: David looks chastened.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (brightly)
dialog: I know. Let's go and sit in our
text: sitting-room.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (cheered up)
dialog: Hooray! I'll order some
dialog: champagne.
text: Jenny looks at him with what might, from one angle, be
text: construed as fondness.
scene_heading: MONTAGE SEQUENCE - PARIS
scene_heading: 64 EXT. LEFT BANK. DAY. 64
text: Juliette Greco on the soundtrack. Jenny leans against a
text: wall, the Seine and Notre Dame behind her. David takes her
text: picture. She looks fantastic in the clothes David has given
dialog: her for her birthday.
scene_heading: 65 INT. ART GALLERY. DAY 65
text: A crowded Left Bank gallery. Jenny is sitting on the floor
text: watching an impossibly handsome young Frenchman paint black
text: the body of an impressively passive naked woman. The young
text: man sitting next to Jenny gives her an appraising look.
text: David, standing at the back and looking square and
text: uncomfortable, notices.
dialog: 73.
scene_heading: 66 INT. RECORD SHOP. DAY 66
text: We see three listening booths, all containing customers.
text: Jenny and David are in the middle booth, listening to the
text: Juliette Greco song on the soundtrack. (For a moment, the
dialog: sound quality changes - soundtrack becomes source music,
text: seamlessly.) Jenny is studying the sleeve. She wants to hug
text: herself, she's so excited.
scene_heading: 67 EXT. CAFE. EVENING. 67
text: A Left Bank cafe - David and Jenny are eating steak frites
text: outside, drinking vin ordinaire, watching the world go by.
text: They are both anticipating the night ahead.
scene_heading: 68 EXT. VIEW OF SACRE COEUR/MONTMARTRE 68
scene_heading: 69 EXT. PARIS HOTEL. DAWN 69
text: Jenny is smoking at the second-floor window of a simple,
text: pretty Parisian hotel, wearing a glamorous-looking slip and
text: looking at the street life below her.
scene_heading: 70 INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAWN 70
text: The bedroom is simple and romantic - everything the airport
text: hotel wasn't. David is lying amid rumpled sheets, smoking
text: what is clearly a post-coital cigarette, and watching Jenny
text: from behind.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Do you still feel like a
dialog: schoolgirl?
text: Jenny turns round, smiles, shakes her head.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And it wasn't too uncomfortable?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Not after the...first bit. It's
dialog: funny, though, isn't it? All that
dialog: poetry, and all those songs and
dialog: films, about something that lasts
dialog: no time at all?
text: David looks at her. She isn't being cruel. She just doesn't
text: know any different. She returns to her people-watching. He
text: smokes ruminatively.
dialog: 74.
scene_heading: 71 EXT. PARK. DAY 71
text: ...Jenny in her games kit, smoking her Sobranie with her
text: friends on the park bench again. Hattie and Tina are
text: examining their bottles of Chanel reverently. Jenny is back
text: to being her seventeen-year-old self; somehow her seventeen-
text: year-old self looks comical, and no longer appropriate.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: How can you go back to double
dialog: French when you've had a weekend
text: with an older man in a posh hotel
dialog: in Paris? You wouldn't catch me
dialog: coming anywhere near this dump.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (artfully)
dialog: It wasn't all glamour. We spent
dialog: half the weekend at Heathrow in a
dialog: hotel suite .
speaker_heading: HATTIE
dialog: A suite? Oh my God. Your life.
text: They smoke their Sobranies ruminatively.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: You're going to miss it. All the
text: swanning around in posh hotels.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Why will I need to miss it?
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: When you go to Oxford. Unless
dialog: you're planning on being with
dialog: David forever.
text: Jenny doesn't say anything.
speaker_heading: HATTIE
dialog: You're not, are you?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: God, no.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: So? Won't you miss it?
text: Jenny shrugs. Clearly she will, and clearly she hasn't
dialog: thought about it before.
speaker_heading: HATTIE
dialog: We'll miss it.
dialog: 75.
text: Jenny laughs.
scene_heading: 72 INT. CLASSROOM. DAY 72
text: Jenny's English class file past Miss Stubbs at the end of a
text: lesson. Miss Stubbs stops Jenny.
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: Jenny, could I have a word?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Of course.(To Hattie and Tina)
dialog: I'll catch you up.
text: Miss Stubbs waits until the room empties.
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: You can do anything you want,
dialog: Jenny. You know that. You're
dialog: clever and you're pretty... But
dialog: sometimes those things fight. I'm
dialog: worried that at the moment clever
dialog: Jenny and pretty Jenny are
dialog: fighting.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: I couldn't bear it if clever
dialog: Jenny lost. It's because of
dialog: people like you that I plough
dialog: through illiterate essays by
dialog: Sandra Lovell about her pony. And
dialog: there aren't many of you, I can
dialog: tell you. One every few years. Is
dialog: your boyfriend interested in
dialog: clever Jenny?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: Interested enough to let her do
dialog: what she wants?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: He couldn't stop me.
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: He might not have to stop you.
dialog: That's what I'm trying to tell
dialog: you.
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: I'm not sure what you're trying
dialog: to tell me.
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: I'm telling you to go to Oxford.
dialog: No matter what. Or you'll break
dialog: my heart.
text: Jenny looks at her.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Where did you go?
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: Sorry?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (louder, bolder)
dialog: Where did you go? Which
dialog: university?
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: Girton. Cambridge.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: What does that mean? `Oh'?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: You're clever. And you're pretty.
dialog: So presumably, Clever Miss Stubbs
dialog: won. And here you are, reading
dialog: all those pony essays. I don't
dialog: know. These last few months, I've
dialog: been to Paris, and to jazz clubs,
dialog: and I've eaten in wonderful
dialog: restaurants, and seen wonderful
dialog: films, heard beautiful music...
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: I'm sure you have. But I was
dialog: filled up with beautiful things,
dialog: books and music and conversation,
dialog: in exactly the same way at
dialog: Cambridge. And I didn't have to
dialog: pay the same sort of price. Are
dialog: you taking precautions, Jenny?
text: Jenny stares at her angrily.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: It's nothing to do with that.
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: Isn't it?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Maybe our lives are always going
dialog: to end up with pony essays. Or
dialog: housework. And yes, maybe we'll
dialog: go up to Oxford. But if we're all
dialog: going to die the moment we
dialog: graduate, maybe it's what we do
dialog: before that counts.
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: I'm sorry you think I'm dead.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I don't think you're dead. But...
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: (coldly)
dialog: You'd better get to your next
dialog: class.
text: She turns her back on Jenny.
scene_heading: 73 EXT. CAR. NIGHT 73
text: Helen, Danny, Jenny get out of David's Bristol, which is
text: parked outside a nightclub called Esmerelda's Barn. David
text: has parked next to a white Rolls-Royce.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (looking at the Rolls-
dialog: Royce)
dialog: And we know the person who owns
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes. Perec Rachman. He's a....
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: A bastard.
text: Danny and David laugh.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He's a business acquaintance, and
dialog: we need to talk to him.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I gathered that much. But why do
dialog: we have to crawl around the West
dialog: End looking for his car? Why
dialog: don't you just make an
dialog: appointment, if you want to see
dialog: him?
dialog: 78.
text: The men snigger.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What? Ring his office? Talk to
dialog: his secretary? That isn't how it
dialog: works with him, dear.
scene_heading: 74 INT. CLUB. NIGHT 74
text: The four walk in and take their coats over to the
text: cloakroom. The club is a smoky West End club, full of
text: smartly-dressed and dubious-looking men, and young,
text: glamorous, dubious-looking women. Jenny and Helen look out
text: of place - Helen too ethereal, Jenny too innocent. There is
dialog: jazz playing.
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: There he is.
text: We see a nasty-looking man in his late 30s/early 40s. He is
text: wearing a white sharksin suit and smoking a big cigar. He's
text: standing by the roulette table, talking to an even nastier-
text: looking man in a dark suit.
text: They find a table at the back and sit down. A waitress
text: comes over to their table.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: A bottle of champagne, please.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Oh-ho. Champagne, eh?
text: He looks at Jenny and David expectantly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Don't be bashful.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: No. Be Sneezy.
text: Everyone ignores her.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: All right, then. If you won't
dialog: tell them I will. Jenny got two
text: As and a B in her mock-A levels.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Fantastic.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Congratulations.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The B was in Latin. But it's much
dialog: better than it was, isn't it,
dialog: Minnie?
text: Rachman is now standing on his own. Danny nudges David, and
text: they go over to talk to him just as the champagne arrives.
text: The waiter pops the bottle of champagne and pours two
text: glasses. The girls smile and clink glasses.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Don't worry.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Someone told me that in fifty
dialog: years no-one will speak Latin,
dialog: probably. Not even Latin people.
dialog: So you shouldn't mind too much
dialog: about your B.
text: Jenny stares at her, trying to think of a response.
scene_heading: 75 INT. CLUB. NIGHT 75
text: Danny and David are at the bar, having just finished
text: talking to Rachman. Danny puffs out his cheeks and shakes
text: his head.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Well, I'm not sure you'd want him
dialog: to marry your sister. I'm not
dialog: even sure you'd want to talk to
text: him in a night-club, come to
dialog: that.
text: They both chuckle. There is a silence for a moment.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (gently)
dialog: You do know what you're doing,
dialog: old chap? With Jenny?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: This is the one, Danny.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: We've heard that before.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You can see she's different.
dialog: She's got everything. You've got
dialog: Helen, and....
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (drily)
dialog: And you've got Helen with brains.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (rumbled)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I don't want to see her hurt.
text: They make their way back to their table.
scene_heading: 76 INT. CLUB. NIGHT 76
text: While David and Helen watch, Danny and Jenny dance. Danny's
text: a good dancer; Jenny is nervous at first, but becomes more
text: comfortable and more expressive, with Danny's help.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (knowing that she should
dialog: make conversation, as
dialog: all the couples around
dialog: her are doing)
dialog: Have you...Have you bought any
dialog: more paintings recently?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Have I? Let's think? Oh, I picked
dialog: up a little Piper the other day.
dialog: A good `un, I think.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I'm still trying to work out what
dialog: makes good things good. It's
dialog: hard, isn't it?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: The thing is, Jenny, you know,
dialog: without necessarily being able to
dialog: explain why. You've got taste.
dialog: That's not even half the
dialog: battle. That's the whole war.
text: Jenny smiles at him with gratitude. There is a sudden
text: closeness between them. David is watching them carefully.
text: They return to their table.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jenny, we should go. It's late.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: Oh. Yes.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Alas. One day, school will be
dialog: over forever, and we can talk
dialog: about art all night.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to Danny)
dialog: You're all right in a taxi,
dialog: aren't you?
text: He guides Jenny firmly out of the club.
scene_heading: 77 EXT. CLUB. NIGHT. 77
text: Jenny is about to to open the passenger door of the
text: Bristol, but David stops her.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Wait there.
text: He runs to the back of the car, opens the boot and starts
text: rummaging through it. It seems to be full of everything
dialog: but the thing he's looking for.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: What are you doing?
text: He slams the boot shut and comes back empty-handed.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Will you marry me?
text: Jenny stares at him for a moment, then laughs.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: What were you looking for?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I thought I had a ring. It
dialog: wouldn't have been the right one.
dialog: But it would have done for
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: JENNY
text: (eyes twinkling with
dialog: amusement)
dialog: Oh, David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm serious.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: You're very sweet.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What do you think?
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (helplessly)
dialog: Please take me home.
text: She gets into the car. We see the desperation in David's
text: face, lit by the headlights of a passing taxi, as he slams
text: the door on Jenny after she's got in.
scene_heading: 78 EXT. SCHOOL YARD. DAY 78
text: Jenny, Tina and Hattie all smoking in the school toilets.
text: Jenny is distracted, and standing apart from the others.
text: Tina looks at her.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: How do you say `A penny for your
dialog: thoughts?' in French?
speaker_heading: HATTIE
dialog: A franc is too much, isn't it?
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: For her thoughts, yes. You'd be
dialog: overpaying by about ninety-nine
dialog: centimes.
text: Suddenly the door bursts open and the Latin teacher comes
dialog: in.
scene_heading: 79 INT. HEAD'S OFFICE. DAY 79
text: The three girls are lined up in front of the headmistress,
text: hands by their sides.
speaker_heading: HEADMISTRESS
dialog: I'm surprised that you two are
text: standing in front of me. I'm not
dialog: surprised to find you here, Miss
dialog: Mellor, though I do feel rather
dialog: like the judge who sent Al Capone
dialog: to prison for tax evasion. We
text: take a very dim view of smoking.
text: We take an even dimmer view of
dialog: some of your other behaviour,
dialog: which as far as we know has taken
dialog: place off school premises. Your
dialog: appearance here today, however,
dialog: allows me to remind you that we
dialog: are trying to teach you how to
dialog: become young ladies, not
text: nightclub hostesses. In reality,
dialog: of course, you are neither. You
dialog: are merely silly little girls.
dialog: Detention after school. Go away.
dialog: 83.
text: Jenny's face sets hard. Something in her shuts down.
scene_heading: 80 EXT. JENNY'S BALCONY. EVENING 80
text: Jenny is smoking on the balcony.
scene_heading: 80A INT. JENNY'S BEDROOM. 80A
text: Jenny is at her desk in her bedroom, trying to work, but
text: she can't concentrate. Her hair is tied back in a pony-
text: tail. She gets up, pulls back the curtains, looks out of
text: the window. We see what she sees: a sleepy suburban street
text: at night. She looks back at her desk. It looks even more
text: boring than the street. She looks at her scrubbed seventeen-
text: year-old face in the mirror - so much younger than the
text: Jenny we have seen with David. She makes herself up, and
text: she gets older and more glamorous before our eyes. In her
text: make-up and her school uniform, she's half-woman, half-
text: child. We hear the noises drifting up from the kitchen: the
text: radio, the washing-up, occasional muffled conversation.
text: Jenny walks out of the bedroom and slips downstairs.
scene_heading: 81 INT. KITCHEN. EVENING 81
text: Jenny's mother and father are doing the washing up and
text: listening to the radio. They have their backs to the door.
text: Jenny enters the room quietly and watches them for a moment
scene_heading: MAN ON THE RADIO
dialog: They do need some looking after,
dialog: but nothing that will require too
dialog: much work. Just leave them in
dialog: your potting shed for a couple of
dialog: weeks, and they'll look after
dialog: themselves.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, aye. The potting shed. Who
dialog: does he think I am? Prince
dialog: Rainier of Monaco?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: What if I got married instead of
dialog: going to college?
text: Jack and Marjorie turn around and stare at this strange
text: apparition wearing too much make-up and a school uniform.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Married?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Married.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It would depend who it was,
dialog: surely?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Would it? That's interesting.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Course it would. I wouldn't want
dialog: you married off just for the
dialog: sake of it.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Has somebody asked you?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Who?
text: Marjorie rolls her eyes.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: What did you tell him?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Nothing yet.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: David?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: No. A man I just met walking his
dialog: dog.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: David's asked you to marry him?
dialog: Bloody hell. Pardon my French.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Do you have any choice? Or is it
dialog: too late.
text: She looks at her daughter knowingly. Jack merely looks
dialog: confused.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Of course she's got a choice. But
dialog: it's an interesting one, isn't
dialog: it?
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: This is where you're supposed to
dialog: say, "But what about Oxford?"
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well. Looked at it one way, you
dialog: wouldn't really need to go now,
dialog: would you? He's a man going
dialog: places. And say what you like,
dialog: but they know how to take care of
dialog: their money, don't they? He'll
dialog: see you're looked after.
speaker_heading: JENNY
text: (quietly, turning the
text: words over in her
dialog: mouth)
dialog: I wouldn't need to go. Would you
dialog: like to expand on that?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You know what I mean.
text: Jenny laughs bitterly. She can't believe it.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: All that Latin! All those essays!
dialog: What was the point? Why didn't
dialog: you just send me out prowling
dialog: round nightclubs? It would have
dialog: been less trouble. And I might
dialog: have had more fun.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We don't know about nightclubs.
dialog: We knew about education. Anyway,
dialog: it all turned out for the best.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: He wouldn't have wanted you if
dialog: you were thick, would he?
text: Jenny stares at them and walks out.
scene_heading: 82 INT. CLASSROOM. DAY 82
text: English. Miss Stubbs is standing at the front of the class,
text: holding a copy of King Lear, and listening as various
text: members of the class massacre the text. Some are messing
text: about by overacting; others read to the best of their
text: ability, tonelessly and with no understanding of the words.
dialog: 86.
text: Lear himself is being read by Ann, the bespectacled girl
text: from the first scene. She's no King Lear, and she's one of
dialog: the bad readers.
speaker_heading: GIRL 1
dialog: May not an ass know when the cart
text: draws the horse? Sings whoop jug
dialog: I love thee.
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: Yes, when it says `Sings', it
dialog: means he sings those words.
text: Girl 1 looks at her blankly.
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: Never mind. Lear...
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Does any here know me. This is
dialog: not Lear. Does Lear walk thus?
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: (sotto voce, to Jenny,
text: in the seat next to
dialog: her)
dialog: No.
text: Jenny starts to giggle.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Speak thus?
text: Tina shakes her head.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Where are his eyes?
text: Tina doesn't need to say anything - she just looks at
text: Jenny, makes a pair of spectacles with her fingers and
text: squints. Jenny's giggling fit increases in intensity.
speaker_heading: ANN
text: Either his notion weakens, or his
text: discernings are lethargied. Ha!
dialog: Waking? Tis not so. Who is it
dialog: that can tell me who I am?
text: Jenny's arm shoots up, as if to answer the question.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Ooh. Miss. Me. I can.
text: Miss Stubbs looks at Jenny more in sorrow than in anger -
text: Jenny's behaviour now is something new in their
text: relationship. Jenny stares back at her defiantly. Suddenly
text: Miss Stubbs notices something glinting on her hand: an
dialog: engagement ring.
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: Oh, Jenny.
text: She is, as she promised she would be, heartbroken.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: Take it off.
text: Hattie, who is sitting behind Jenny, notices the ring, too,
text: for the first time.
speaker_heading: HATTIE
dialog: Oh my God. Is that really what I
dialog: think it is? I'M GOING TO BE A
speaker_heading: BRIDESMAID!
text: There is an excited susurration in the classroom.
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: You know there's a school rule
dialog: about jewelry.
speaker_heading: JENNY
text: Half the girls in this room are
dialog: wearing jewelry.
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: Yes. But none of it is going to
dialog: ruin their lives.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (coolly)
dialog: We have a difference of opinion
dialog: on that.
text: Miss Stubbs stares at her. Jenny can only just steel
text: herself to stare back.
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: Let's see who's right. Come with
dialog: me.
text: Jenny doesn't move.
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: Please don't make me drag you out
text: like a child.
text: Jenny gets to her feet. Teacher and pupil leave the room,
text: while the rest of the class watches.
dialog: 88.
scene_heading: 83 INT. HEADMISTRESS'S OFFICE. DAY 83
speaker_heading: HEADMISTRESS
dialog: How far advanced are these
dialog: ridiculous plans? Have you set a
dialog: date? Have you decided on a
dialog: church?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: We won't be getting married in a
dialog: church. David's Jewish.
text: The headmistress stares at her, dumbfounded.
speaker_heading: HEADMISTRESS
dialog: Jewish? He's a Jew? You're aware,
dialog: I take it, that the Jews killed
dialog: our Lord?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (beginning to feel less
text: intimidated by her
dialog: surroundings)
dialog: And you're aware, I suppose, that
dialog: our Lord was Jewish?
text: The headmistress snorts scornfully
speaker_heading: HEADMISTRESS
dialog: I suppose he told you that. We're
dialog: all very sorry about what
dialog: happened in the War. But there's
dialog: no excuse for that sort of
dialog: malicious and untruthful
dialog: propaganda.
text: Jenny smiles to herself.
speaker_heading: HEADMISTRESS
dialog: Anyway, I can now see that you
dialog: are even more in need of
dialog: responsible advice than I
dialog: realised. Is it true that you
dialog: don't intend to sit for your
dialog: exams? And therefore you won't be
dialog: applying for University?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Yes, that's right.
speaker_heading: HEADMISTRESS
dialog: What do you think you're doing?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Nobody has been able to explain
dialog: to me the point of University.
dialog: 89.
dialog: Therefore I don't see the point
dialog: of the exams, either.
speaker_heading: HEADMISTRESS
dialog: Nobody does anything worth doing
dialog: without a degree.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: And nobody does anything worth
dialog: doing with one, either. No woman,
dialog: anyway.
speaker_heading: HEADMISTRESS
dialog: So what I do isn't worth doing.
dialog: Or what Miss Stubbs does, or Mrs
dialog: Wilson, or any of us here.
text: Jenny doesn't say anything. The headmistress takes her
text: silence as an admission of defeat.
speaker_heading: HEADMISTRESS
dialog: Because none of us would be here
dialog: without our degrees, you realise
dialog: that, don't you? And yes, of
dialog: course studying is hard, and
dialog: boring, and...
text: Jenny can't contain herself any longer.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Boring!
speaker_heading: HEADMISTRESS
dialog: I'm sorry?
speaker_heading: JENNY
text: Studying is hard and boring.
dialog: Teaching is hard and boring. So
dialog: you're telling me to be bored,
text: and then bored, and then finally
dialog: bored again, this time for the
dialog: rest of my life. This whole
dialog: stupid country is bored. There's
dialog: no life in it, or colour in it,
dialog: or fun in it. It's probably just
dialog: as well that the Russians are
text: going to drop a nuclear bomb on
dialog: us any day now. So my choice is
dialog: either to do something hard and
dialog: boring, OR to marry my... my Jew,
dialog: and go to Paris and Rome and
dialog: listen to jazz and read and eat
dialog: good food in nice restaurants and
dialog: have fun. It's not enough to
dialog: educate us any more, Mrs Walters.
dialog: You've got to tell us why you're
dialog: doing it.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: HEADMISTRESS
dialog: Because without formal
dialog: qualifications...
text: She grinds to a halt. She has never had to answer this
dialog: question before.
speaker_heading: HEADMISTRESS
dialog: It doesn't have to be teaching,
dialog: you know. There's the Civil
dialog: Service.
text: Jenny stands up.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I don't wish to be impertinent,
dialog: Mrs Walters. But it is an
dialog: argument worth rehearsing. You
dialog: never know. Someone else might
dialog: want to know what the point of it
dialog: all is, one day.
text: She leaves the office.
scene_heading: 84 EXT. SCHOOL. DAY 84
text: Jenny is half-walking, half-running, towards the school
text: gates. She's scared, of course, but exhilarated, too. All
dialog: that pressure, and all those years of education, suddenly
text: over, unexpectedly, and certainly unceremoniously. She
text: looks neither left nor right, but other girls, younger
text: girls, watch her through the windows as she leaves. Jenny
text: doesn't even look round when she goes through the school
dialog: gates.
scene_heading: 85 INT. KITCHEN. EVENING 85
text: Later. Jenny and Marjorie are sitting at the kitchen table.
text: Jack is standing over them; he hasn't even taken his coat
text: off, or put his briefcase down.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How d'you mean, left?
text: Jenny doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What about your exams?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I'm not sitting them.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What are we going to tell people?
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (witheringly)
dialog: Oh, telling people. I'd forgotten
dialog: that what we tell people is more
dialog: important than anything.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: All that...
text: Marjorie knows what he's going to say, and doesn't want him
dialog: to.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Jack!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No. No need for Jack. She should
dialog: hear it. All that money! Do you
dialog: know how much it's cost me for
dialog: you to go through school and take
dialog: no exams?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I'm sure David will pay you back.
dialog: Send him a bill. As you said, he
dialog: wouldn't have wanted me if I was
dialog: dim, so he should fork out. Just
dialog: tell me why there's a point in
dialog: sitting my exams, and there's no
dialog: point in me going to University.
text: Jack gapes at her. He's floundering.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You know what your trouble is,
dialog: don't you? You're too clever by
dialog: half.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: In which case I should have left
dialog: school years ago, shouldn't I?
dialog: Ask them for the money back. If
dialog: I'm too clever by half, you
text: overpaid by a third.
scene_heading: 86 INT. DANNY'S FLAT. NIGHT 86
text: Danny, Helen, David and Jenny are in Danny's flat; we have
dialog: just missed The Announcement - there is champagne already
text: open. Danny glances quickly and discreetly at David, who
text: catches his eye.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: That's...Gosh. That's fantastic
dialog: news.
dialog: 92.
text: Danny isn't so pleased.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (cool)
dialog: Congratulations.
text: There is much chinking of glasses.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I thought you'd see sense about
dialog: university.
text: Jenny smiles.
speaker_heading: HELEN (CONT'D)
dialog: You'll stay pretty now.
text: Laughter from David and Jenny.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Am I still allowed to read?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: English? Books?
text: More laughter.
speaker_heading: HELEN (CONT'D)
dialog: You won't be laughing when she
dialog: goes all speccy and spotty,
dialog: David.
text: Helen is bemused by their mirth. Danny watches David
dialog: thoughtfully.
scene_heading: 87 EXT. DANNY'S. NIGHT 87
text: David and Jenny come out of Danny's flat and approach
text: David's car.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Danny didn't seem very pleased
dialog: about our engagement.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I thought that, too! I was
dialog: wondering whether he might be a
dialog: bit jealous.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (trying not to be
dialog: pleased)
dialog: Jealous?
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You may have noticed that Helen's
dialog: not really Oxford material. I'm
dialog: going to keep him out of your
dialog: way.
text: They both smile. David opens the door for Jenny and she
text: gets into the car.
scene_heading: 87A INT. JENNY'S KITCHEN. DAY 87A
text: Jenny is making David a cup of tea. Her mother is keeping
text: an eye on Jenny - in Marjorie's mind at least, this is a
dialog: rehearsal for something.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I haven't put my...my stamp on it
dialog: yet. Haven't had time. It needs a
dialog: woman's touch, really. And if you
dialog: don't like it, we can move. Just
dialog: say the word.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Where is the flat again?
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: You have to put the cosy on
text: straight away.
text: Jenny sighs and rolls her eyes. She picks up the hand-
text: knitted tea-cosy and puts it on her head.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Like that?
text: David laughs.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: (oblivious)
text: No. On the tea-pot.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: Ah.
text: She puts the tea-cosy on the tea-pot.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Just down from Russell Square.
text: Two minutes' walk from the
text: underground.
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Jenny! We could walk to...(She
text: tries to think of somewhere Jenny
dialog: might find interesting.) We could
dialog: walk to the British Museum!
text: Jenny gives her a look.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: I'll leave you to it. Don't let
dialog: it stew.
text: She leaves the room.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: And this is where you're living?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I've stayed there for the last
dialog: couple of nights. (Beat) On and
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: You've stayed there two nights
dialog: "on and off"?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Is that tea ready? One sugar,
dialog: please.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (frustrated by his
dialog: evasions)
dialog: David!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm sorry. You must think I'm
dialog: very odd.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: No, but.... You seem to float
dialog: around. I never know where you
dialog: are.
text: She hands him his tea.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: A wandering Jew.(He pauses to
dialog: take a sip.) If I tell you
dialog: something, will you promise not
dialog: to laugh?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: It depends on how funny it is.
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (mumbling)
dialog: I live at home.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: We all live at home.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No. I mean...I live at home...in
dialog: the same way that you live at
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: But I live with my mother and
dialog: fa...(It clicks.) You don't mean
dialog: it.
text: David nods, shamefacedly.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Your mother and father?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Just my mother. My father's dead.
dialog: I've been meaning to tell you,
dialog: Minnie, and it would have been
dialog: much better than all those silly
dialog: lies. But...
text: He looks quite upset. We warm to him. Jenny leans over and
text: takes his hand.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Anyway. You can see how much I
dialog: need you. And you won't regret
dialog: this, I promise. We'll have so
dialog: much fun. And just think. When we
dialog: get married, you won't have to
dialog: wait in the car while I do my
dialog: business.. You'll be waiting at
text: home, looking at the Burne-Jones
dialog: on the wall. Home, Minnie. Our
dialog: home. Can you imagine?
text: Close on Jenny. She can't imagine, really.
scene_heading: 90 INT. COFFEE BAR. DAY 90
text: Jenny, Tina and Hattie in the coffee bar. Jenny is eagerly
text: scanning the English literature exam paper.
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Did you do this one? "Show from
dialog: any TWO scenes in `Pride and
dialog: Prejudice' how far it is true
dialog: that Jane Austen's methods are
dialog: `essentially dramatic'".
speaker_heading: HATTIE
text: Three scenes.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: It says two here. Look.
text: She shows the paper to Hattie. Hattie slumps onto the
text: formica table and groans.
speaker_heading: HATTIE
dialog: Two. Two. Two. I can't believe
dialog: it.
text: Tina rubs Hattie's head sympathetically.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: It was an unfair question. You're
dialog: hopeless at maths. What do you do
dialog: all day, anyway, Lady Muck?
text: Jenny shrugs.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I've been looking at flats. I've
dialog: been to look at dresses. I've
dialog: been reading a lot, too.
speaker_heading: TINA
text: Reading, trying on dresses...
dialog: Where did we go wrong?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: What's this afternoon?
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: French. The translation paper.
text: Jenny is lapping it all up. She might even be envious.
scene_heading: 91 INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. EVENING 91
text: Jenny and Marjorie are in the sitting room, all dressed up
text: and waiting for David to come and pick them up. Jenny looks
text: great, as usual; her mother looks smart, if somewhat old-
dialog: fashioned.
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Don't worry. He'll find a nice
dialog: place in no time. He sees plenty
dialog: of them.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I'm not sure he sees plenty of
dialog: nice places.
dialog: Would you like a radiogram for a
dialog: wedding present? We love ours.
text: Something about this depresses Jenny. Marjorie notices.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: You won't be bored, you know.
dialog: He's not boring.
text: Now they are both thoughtful. As if on cue, Jack comes into
text: the sitting room, pulling at his tie, looking apprehensive.
text: He appears to be wearing Brylcreem. He looks like a little
text: boy who has been made to put on his Sunday best.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What sort of things can you have
dialog: for starters? I mean, how will I
dialog: know what are starters and what
dialog: aren't? I'm all right if it's
dialog: soup or fruit juice. But if it's
dialog: anything more than that...
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: We've been through this, Dad.
dialog: It'll be quite clearly marked on
dialog: the menu.
text: The doorbell rings. Jack stiffens. Jenny goes to answer the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why don't you three go out? I'll
dialog: be happy here with a tin of...
text: David enters the room. He is relaxed, happy. He has worn a
text: tie, possibly because he knew that Jack would wear a tie.
text: Jack and Marjorie stand, and they exchange greetings.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Everybody ready? I think you'll
dialog: like this place, Jack. Their wine
dialog: list is as good as anything I've
dialog: seen in London.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Someone told me that.
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: David, probably. Who else would
dialog: it have been?
scene_heading: 92 EXT. STREET/JENNY'S HOUSE NIGHT 92
text: Jack and Marjorie approach David's Bristol.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I was hoping you'd take us in
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, you won't want to go in
dialog: anything else after tonight. Mind
dialog: you, it drinks petrol. I'm afraid
dialog: we'll have to stop on the way in
dialog: to town.
text: He opens the back door for his future in-laws.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Madame. Monsieur.
text: They get in, he closes the door, runs round to open the
text: front passenger door for Jenny.
scene_heading: 93 INT. CAR. NIGHT 93
text: David starts the car, and glances in the rear-view mirror.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Everyone happy?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I feel like Eamonn Andrews.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Is that a good thing?
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Of course. Eamonn Andrews is the
dialog: poshest person that Jack can
dialog: imagine being.
scene_heading: 94 EXT. STREET/PETROL STATION. NIGHT 94
text: The Bristol cruises down a London arterial road.
scene_heading: 95 INT. CAR. NIGHT 95
text: We see, from David's POV, a petrol station approaching.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sorry about this.
text: He slows the car and turns in to the garage.
scene_heading: 96 EXT. GARAGE. NIGHT 96
text: David gets out of the car as the attendant comes over.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: How can I help you, sir?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You might as well fill her up.
text: David looks around and spots a phone box just outside the
text: garage. He leans in through the open car window.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm just going to make a quick
dialog: call. I'll be two ticks.
scene_heading: 97 INT. CAR. NIGHT 97
text: Jenny watches him walk towards the phone box.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Do you think we should offer him
dialog: some petrol money? Or would he
dialog: feel insulted?
text: Jenny watches David as he dials the number. He notices her,
text: waves, puts the money in the slot.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: He'd feel insulted, probably. He
dialog: said tonight was his treat. That
dialog: must include the petrol, for
dialog: God's sakes?
text: David starts to talk, and turns away, as if he's frightened
text: that someone in the car can lip-read.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What do you think?
text: Nobody pays him any attention. They lapse into silence.
text: Jack starts to fiddle with the features in the car - a
text: table springs down from the seat in front of him, much to
text: his alarm.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: God almighty. What have I done?
dialog: 100.
text: Jenny opens the glove compartment, looking for the
text: cigarettes that David always keeps there. She finds the
text: cigarettes, and closes the glove compartment. But she has
text: seen something in there, so she opens it again. She takes
text: out some letters and papers and starts to look through
dialog: them.
scene_heading: 98 EXT. GARAGE. NIGHT 98
text: David has finished his phone call and is walking towards
text: the car. He sees Jenny looking through letters and papers,
text: sees the open glove compartment, starts to run across the
text: forecourt.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (desperately)
dialog: Jenny!
text: It's too late. We see Jenny's stricken face, gleaming in
text: someone else's headlights.
scene_heading: 99 INT. CAR. NIGHT 99
text: David gets into the car.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jenny, I...
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (as cold as ice)
dialog: Take us home.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: There's been a...Jenny's had a
dialog: bit of a shock.
text: Jenny laughs, mirthlessly, then starts to weep.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What's happened?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: It's another one of David's
dialog: little muddles and
dialog: misunderstandings.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jenny, it's not...
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I don't want to hear another word
dialog: from anybody. Take me home. NOW.
dialog: 101.
text: Marjorie and Jack look at each other. David swings the car
text: around and they drive home in silence; Jenny cries
text: constantly, without making a sound.
scene_heading: 100 EXT. JENNY'S HOUSE. NIGHT 100
text: The Bristol draws up outside Jenny's house. David jumps out
text: of the car and lets Marjorie and Jack out. Jack starts to
text: walk towards the house and then stops.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (desperately)
dialog: You can sort this out, can't you,
dialog: David?
text: Jenny gets out of the car too.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Of course I can. She's just got
dialog: the wrong end of the stick about
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Go inside, Dad.
text: Jenny and David watch Jack and Marjorie go into the house.
text: The moment the door is closed, Jenny walks towards David.
text: She's holding a bunch of letters that she took out of the
text: glove compartment. She starts to throw them at him, one by
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Mr and Mrs David Goldman, Mr and
dialog: Mrs David Goldman, Mr and Mrs
dialog: David Goldman, Mr and Mrs David
dialog: Goldman..
text: When she has thrown the last one, she flies at David - she
text: slaps him, punches him, scratches him. David tries to grab
text: her hands, but she's too wild.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Just let me...
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: You're MARRIED!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Legally, yes, but...
text: Finally he manages to subdue her. She leans against the
text: car, distraught.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: When were you going to tell me?
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Soon. It just - it never seemed
dialog: the right time. You seemed so
dialog: happy, and I was happy, and...It
dialog: would have spoiled everything.
dialog: What can I do, Minnie? What can I
dialog: do? How can...
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: "Oh, Jenny. I'm just too busy to
dialog: find somewhere to live...I live
dialog: with my mummy." You were living
dialog: with your wife! All this time!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jenny...
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: What's your address?
text: David gestures vaguely.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Byron Avenue.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Byron Avenue! It's no wonder we
text: kept bumping into each other,
dialog: then, is it? What number?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: There's no point..
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (screaming)
speaker_heading: WHAT NUMBER?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Seventeen.
text: Jenny picks one of the envelopes up off the ground and
text: looks at it.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (bitterly sarcastic)
dialog: Good grief. It's the truth.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Please. You have to understand. I
dialog: was with you just about all the
dialog: spare time I had.
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Spare time? Spare time? I can't
dialog: tell you how grateful I am.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Don't be like this.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I have nothing. I left school. I
dialog: didn't take my exams. Where's it
dialog: all gone, now? I gave my life
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jenny, I can get a divorce.
dialog: Everything will turn out for the
dialog: best. You'll see.
text: We can see Jack and Marjorie peering through the lace
text: curtains anxiously.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Go and tell them. Go and tell
dialog: them, then go and tell your wife.
dialog: I want to see you. I want to
text: stand there and watch.
text: David stands on the pavement, looking towards the house. He
text: looks away; he can't make eye contact with Jenny's parents.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: They're not going to listen to me
dialog: now. Let me come round tomorrow.
text: When everyone's calmed down a
dialog: bit.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (suddenly desperate)
dialog: Please don't leave me to tell
dialog: them on my own. Please. You owe
dialog: me that much. You owe them that
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: I owe them a lot more than that.
dialog: I owe them everything. They gave
dialog: me you.
text: He opens the boot. It's full of cases of whiskey. Jenny
text: doesn't even bother asking what they are doing there. David
text: takes one of the bottles, opens it, takes a long slug.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Two minutes. And then I'll come
dialog: out and drag you in.
dialog: 104.
text: Jenny marches into the house and slams the door. The camera
text: stays on David. He gets back into the car and takes
text: another slug of whiskey. Then his shoulders begin to
text: shake, and he cries and cries.
scene_heading: 101 INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. NIGHT 101
text: Jenny comes in, leaving the door open for David. Her
text: parents are standing in the sitting room, looking at her
text: anxiously. Their coats are still on, and they haven't put
text: the lights on yet.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: He's helping himself to some
dialog: Dutch courage before facing you.
dialog: Stolen Dutch courage, from the
dialog: look of it. He has something to
dialog: tell you.
text: She stands, pale and young-looking again, opposite her
text: parents. Suddenly they are all three lit up by headlights.
text: Shot from their POV of the Bristol roaring off up the
dialog: street.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: He just drove off.
text: We close slowly in on Jenny's face. But of course he'd
dialog: drive off!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (pathetic)
dialog: Can you tell us? Please? Jenny?
text: Jenny can't deal with her own pain, let alone his. He
text: already looks like a broken, foolish old man. They should
text: hug. But they don't.
scene_heading: 102 EXT. STREET/DAVID'S HOUSE. DAY 102
text: A suburban street, full of semi-detached houses, not far
text: from Jenny's house. Jenny walks down the road tentatively -
text: she's looking at the numbers on the houses. She looks young
text: again - tired, no make-up, no elegant clothes. She can't
dialog: bring herself to wear anything that David bought her.
text: She hesitates at the top of the driveway to the house,
text: steels herself to walk down. But just at that moment the
text: door opens; there's a homely-looking woman, early 30s. She
text: is holding the hand of a three-year-old. Jenny is stunned.
dialog: But there's more to come.
dialog: 105.
text: The woman deposits the child in the drive, goes back into
text: the house, comes out behind an enormous 1950s pram. David
dialog: has found time to father another baby.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Oh. Hello.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (almost inaudible)
dialog: Hello. I'm sorry. I think I must
dialog: have the wrong house.
text: The woman stares at her.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Yes. I wanted number...It's my
dialog: cello lesson. Silly. I...
text: She dries up and looks at the woman helplessly.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Oh, no. Don't tell me. Good God.
dialog: You're a child.
text: Jenny blushes. Beat. She turns and tries to walk back up
text: the driveway, but the woman won't let her go.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: No. No. You stay here. If you're
dialog: old enough to sleep with him,
dialog: you're old enough to look at me.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I can't.
text: But she doesn't move, either.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: You didn't know about any of
dialog: this. Presumably.
text: Jenny shakes her head.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: No. They never do. Did he ask you
dialog: to marry him?
text: Jenny nods.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Yes. Of course he did. You're not
dialog: in the family way, are you?
dialog: Because that's happened before.
text: Jenny shakes her head.
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Thank God for that. At least you
dialog: can escape intact. (Beat)
dialog: Relatively speaking. Not all of
dialog: them have done.
text: She nods at the children.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: That's why he never goes through
dialog: with anything. He does love them.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (looking into the pram)
dialog: She's beautiful.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Thank you. He. (Bitterly) He's
text: four months old.
text: Jenny does the maths. It's all she can do to stop herself
text: from reeling backwards - she's visibly shaken.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Four months!
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Yes. Babies often are that sort
dialog: of age. Perhaps you can remember
dialog: a night four months ago when he
text: seemed a little distracted.
dialog: Anyway. If you'll excuse us.
text: She pushes past Jenny and leaves her standing bereft on the
dialog: path.
scene_heading: 103 INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. DAY 103
text: Marjorie and Jack are in the kitchen. Marjorie is sipping
text: tea, shoulders hunched, defeated. Jack is pacing around the
text: room, furious. Normal life has clearly been suspended
text: during this crisis. Jenny walks in.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Did you see her?
speaker_heading: JENNY
text: I saw her. I didn't talk to her.
dialog: There wasn't any need.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well we've got to have this out.
dialog: If you won't do it, I will.
text: He starts for the door.
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (contemptuously)
dialog: Sit down.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I beg your pardon? I'm still your
dialog: father, Jenny.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Oh, you're my father again, are
dialog: you? What were you when you
dialog: encouraged me to throw my life
dialog: away? I'm a silly schoolgirl.
dialog: Was, anyway. Silly schoolgirls
dialog: are always being seduced by
dialog: glamorous older men. But what
dialog: about you two?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We didn't...
text: He gives up hopelessly. Marjorie says nothing.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: And now I've got nothing.
dialog: I'm...I'm broken.
text: Jack looks at her.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That doesn't mean....what I think
dialog: it means, does it? It can't.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Just tell me that you
dialog: didn't...you haven't, you
dialog: know...You didn't....
text: Jenny looks at him in disbelief.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: I wondered how stupid you were.
dialog: Now I know.
scene_heading: 104 INT. UPPER HALLWAY. NIGHT 104
text: Jack stands outside Jenny's bedroom door with a cup of tea.
text: He knocks tentatively.
dialog: 108.
scene_heading: 105 INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT 105
text: Close-up of the floaty print dress that Helen gave her. The
text: dress is suddenly jerked out of shot, and we pull back to
text: reveal a weeping Jenny stuffing it violently into an
text: already full box of things she is throwing out. The
text: contents represent her now-despised, David-created adult
dialog: self. We can see Juliette Greco albums, photos, expensive-
text: looking jewelry boxes. She continues to stuff things into
text: the box. There's a knock on the door.
speaker_heading: JACK (O.S.)
dialog: Jenny.
text: She continue to put her David-life away into bags. She
text: ignores him.
scene_heading: 106 INT. UPPER HALLWAY. NIGHT 106
text: Jack is almost in tears.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: There's a cup of tea for you
dialog: here.
text: No answer. He puts the tea on the floor, and sits down next
dialog: to it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I know I made a mess of
dialog: everything.
text: He waits for an answer - nothing.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: All my life I've been scared, and
dialog: I didn't want you to be scared.
dialog: That's why I wanted you to go to
dialog: Oxford. So that if someone asked
dialog: you out to a nice restaurant, you
dialog: wouldn't panic about what was a
dialog: starter and what was a main
dialog: course. And then David came
dialog: along, and he had money, and he
dialog: knew famous writers, and he knew
dialog: how to get to classical music
dialog: concerts. But he wasn't who he
dialog: said he was. He wasn't who you
dialog: said he was, either.
scene_heading: 107 INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT 107
text: Jenny is about to rip a poster off the wall, but she
dialog: pauses.
dialog: 109.
scene_heading: 108 INT. UPPER HALLWAY. NIGHT 108
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The other day, your mother and I
dialog: were listening to a programme
dialog: about CS Lewis on the radio, and
dialog: they said he moved to Cambridge
dialog: in 1954. And I said to Marjorie,
dialog: Well, they've got that wrong,
dialog: because how would our Jenny get
dialog: her book signed, if he wasn't in
dialog: Oxford?
scene_heading: 109 INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT 109
text: Jenny's face crumples. She knows he's right.
speaker_heading: JACK (O.S.)
dialog: Jenny, I'm sorry.
scene_heading: 109A INT. DANNY'S FLAT. DAY 109A
text: Jenny is sitting on the sofa in Danny's flat. Danny and
text: Helen are in dressing gowns; there are newspapers strewn
text: around. Danny pours her a brandy. Helen is sitting next to
text: her, holding her hand.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I don't really understand what
dialog: difference it makes. When I found
dialog: out that...
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Helen! Not now.
text: Helen shrugs.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I tried to tell him. I'm not
dialog: speaking to him now, if that's
dialog: any consolation.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: It's a funny world you people
dialog: live in. You both watched me...
text: carrying on with a married man,
dialog: but you don't think it's worth
dialog: saying anything.
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Ah, well if you want that sort of
dialog: conversation...You watched David
dialog: and I help ourselves to a map,
dialog: and you didn't say much, either.
text: He holds Jenny's gaze. She looks away.
scene_heading: 110 INT. HEADMISTRESS'S OFFICE. DAY 110
text: Jenny has put on her school uniform for this meeting; it
text: completes a circle. She's back where she started from, or
dialog: would like to be, anyway. If she seems older than she did
dialog: when we first met her, it's because things have happened to
text: her, and they've left a mark on her face. She's worried and
text: tired. The headmistress, meanwhile, is delighted by her
dialog: return - but only because of the opportunities for smugness
dialog: and schadenfreude it provides.
speaker_heading: HEADMISTRESS
dialog: So. Your Jewish friend turned out
dialog: to be married already, I
dialog: understand. How unfortunate.
text: Jenny doesn't say anything. She has clearly decided to
dialog: swallow anything she has to.
speaker_heading: HEADMISTRESS
dialog: Anyway. How do you think we can
dialog: help?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I'd like to repeat my last year
dialog: at school. Start all over again.
speaker_heading: HEADMISTRESS
dialog: I got the impression the last
dialog: time we spoke that you didn't see
dialog: the point of school. Or of me, or
dialog: of any of us here.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I know. I was stupid.
speaker_heading: HEADMISTRESS
dialog: So what is the point?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I know that I need to go to
dialog: university.
speaker_heading: HEADMISTRESS
dialog: And what happens if some other
dialog: chap wants to marry you during
dialog: your studies next year?
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (laughing bitterly)
dialog: Some other chap? There won't be
dialog: any other chaps. Not for a long,
dialog: long time, anyway.
speaker_heading: HEADMISTRESS
dialog: I'm afraid I think you're the
text: sort of young lady who attracts
dialog: chaps whether she wants to or
dialog: not. No,I think the offer of a
dialog: place at this school would be
dialog: wasted on you. You showed how
dialog: little you valued us only weeks
dialog: ago. And I must confess that it
dialog: gives me a sort of grim
dialog: satisfaction to return the
dialog: sentiment now.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: Is it really so grim, your
dialog: satisfaction?
speaker_heading: HEADMISTRESS
dialog: It gives me no pleasure to see
dialog: our schoolgirls throw their lives
dialog: away. Although, of course, you're
dialog: not one of our schoolgirls any
dialog: more. Through your own volition.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I suppose you think I'm a ruined
dialog: woman.
speaker_heading: HEADMISTRESS
dialog: Oh, you're not a woman.
text: Beat. Jenny stands up and leaves without saying a word. The
text: headmistress is pleased with her final line.
scene_heading: 111 INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT 111
text: Jenny working hard in her room. It's been completely
text: stripped bare of everything except schoolbooks. She has
text: become ageless, genderless - her life is now monastic.
scene_heading: 112 EXT. PARK. DAY 112
text: Jenny walking alone through her old park.
dialog: 112.
scene_heading: 113 INT. COFFEE BAR. DAY 113
text: Jenny on her own, smoking nervously. Hattie and Tina come
text: in. They obviously haven't seen her since it all happened.
text: They both hug her sympathetically and sit down. Nobody
dialog: knows what to say.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: I'm sure my uncle knows someone
dialog: who could kill him. If that would
dialog: help.
text: Jenny smiles wanly, and briefly.
speaker_heading: HATTIE
dialog: We should have stopped you.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Did you want to?
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Of course we didn't. Why would we
dialog: stop you? Restaurants, hotels,
dialog: foreign cities, no exams...
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (Bitterly)
dialog: Yes. Who'd have thought there'd
dialog: be a down side to all that? I
dialog: could tell you all about the
dialog: imagery in Jane Eyre. But I
dialog: couldn't see that a man who stole
dialog: maps from old ladies might be a
dialog: liar.
text: They look at her. This is new information.
speaker_heading: HATTIE
dialog: Well, if you'd told us that we
dialog: might have tried to stop you.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: There are a lot of things I
dialog: didn't tell you. I was dreaming.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: That's the thing about our lives,
dialog: isn't it? It's so easy to fall
dialog: asleep, when there's nothing to
dialog: keep you awake.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: HATTIE
dialog: Are you getting on with the work
dialog: all right on your own?
dialog: 113.
text: Jenny thinks.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (heartfelt)
dialog: No. No, I'm not.
scene_heading: 114 EXT. STREET MISS STUBBS FLAT. DUSK. 114
text: Jenny in a suburban street. She's looking for an address.
text: She finds the house, walks down the path, rings on a bell.
text: Miss Stubbs comes to the door.
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: Jenny!
text: It's a warm greeting. She ushers her inside.
scene_heading: 115 INT. MISS STUBBS' FLAT. DUSK. 115
text: It's a proper Bohemian flat, up in the eaves. There are
dialog: books and papers and paintings covering every available
text: surface. Jenny looks around. Finally, for the first time,
text: we see her in somewhere she can feel at home.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: This is lovely.
text: Miss Stubbs makes a face.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: But it is. Really. I'd love to
dialog: live somewhere like this.
text: Miss Stubbs laughs.
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: Oh, it's not hard. Go to Oxford
dialog: and become a teacher and this is
dialog: what you end up with.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: But all these books and
dialog: pictures....
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: Penguin paperbacks. Posters and
dialog: postcards.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (apparently
dialog: understanding
dialog: something)
dialog: Yes, but...That's all you need,
dialog: isn't it?
dialog: 114.
dialog: Just a place to...I'm sorry I
dialog: said those silly things. I didn't
dialog: understand.
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: Let's forget all about it.
text: A poster catches Jenny's eye.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: A Burne-Jones.
text: Miss Stubbs laughs.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: You make it sound as though it's
dialog: an original. Do you like him?
text: Jenny pauses.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Yes. I do. Still.
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: Still? Gosh, you sound very old
dialog: and wise.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (heartfelt)
dialog: I feel old. But really not very
dialog: wise. Miss Stubbs, I'm....I need
dialog: your help.
speaker_heading: MISS STUBBS
dialog: I was so hoping that's what you
dialog: were going to say.
scene_heading: 116 EXT. STREET IN OXFORD. DAY 116
text: Eighteen months later. Swelling orchestral music. Close on
text: Jenny cycling, absorbed, happy, the cello strapped to her
text: precariously. The camera pulls back to show her cycling
text: through the streets of Oxford. She's done it. We follow her
text: for a little while. She dismounts outside a church and
text: leans the bike against a wall. Just as she's about to leave
text: it, she sees something and freezes. We follow her gaze:
text: it's the red Bristol, parked a little way down the road
text: just in front of her. She scans the street to see if she
text: can find David. She can - he's coming round a corner, a
text: littler further down the street, unwrapping a packet of
text: cigarettes. Jenny moves into his eye-line. He sees her,
text: stops, then walks towards her.
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jenny.
text: Jenny says nothing.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jenny. Minnie. I wanted to tell
dialog: you that I am going to ask my
dialog: wife for a divorce.
text: Jenny looks at him disbelievingly.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Don't you understand what you've
dialog: done?
text: David looks at her. This isn't going to be as easy as he
dialog: thought.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I can see my behaviour must have
dialog: been... confusing. But we've
dialog: never sat down and had a proper
dialog: chat about it all. About the whys
dialog: and wherefores. They can wait.
dialog: The important thing is that
dialog: you're still my Minnie Mouse, and
dialog: I love you, and you had fun. You
dialog: know you had fun.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Yes. I had fun. But I had fun
dialog: with the wrong person, at all the
dialog: wrong times. And I can't ever get
dialog: those times back, now.(Beat)
dialog: Look, David. I'm in Oxford. Every
dialog: day I wake up and pinch myself.
dialog: And when I think how close I
dialog: came...
text: She looks at him and shakes her head, as if awaking from a
text: dream. A young man stops behind her on his bike, dismounts,
text: leans his bike against the wall next to hers, waits for her
text: to finish. She turns her back on David, and the young man
text: offers her his arm. They walk away together, and David
text: stares longingly after them.
speaker_heading: THE END
