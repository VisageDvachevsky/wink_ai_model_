text: Then Austin' notices a SELF-DESTRUCT switch and hits it.
text: She starts to twitch, her head spins, and she EXPLODES.

scene_heading: MUSIC: VERY SAD PIANO
speaker_heading: AUSTIN

scene_heading: INT. LOBBY - HOTEL

speaker_heading: SEQUENCE CREDIT

speaker_heading: FREEZE FRAME.
scene_heading: EXT. BOARDWALK - FRENCH RIVERA
text: European types stare and point. We see Austin from behind.
text: His bottom half is blocked by a bicycle. The bicycle moves

text: A CREDIT APPEARS blocking it. Austin turns his head around
text: to the camera and puts his hand to his mouth in an 'oh my!'
dialog: take and we FREEZE FRAME.
text: A MAN IN A RAINCOAT flashes Austin, his thingy blocked by a
dialog: credit. Austin just laughs...crazy, man!
text: Austin goes around a corner. A moment later he returns,
text: followed by a NUDE MARCHING BAND.
text: A SIGN on the left side of the screen reads "Warning! Nude
text: Beach". Austin enters from the left.
text: We see his naked, hairy torso from the waist up. Just as he
text: is about to appear from behind the sign, a...
text: CREDIT APPEARS MOVING LEFT TO RIGHT Blocking his penis
text: lengthwise as he walks.
scene_heading: NUDE BEACH - CREDIT SEQUENCE
text: A girl sits on a blanket; a HORIZONTAL CREDIT blocks her

text: suave; A VERTICAL CREDIT appears.
text: The wind blows away a kite, revealing a stark-naked girl.
text: The credit "PRODUCTION DESIGN" blocks her chest; the credit
text: "BY" blocks her you-know-what. Austin walks into frame; the
text: "PRODUCTION DESIGNER'S NAME" disguises his growing interest.
text: Austin joins a nude volleyball game in progress. CREDITS
dialog: appear everywhere to block all possible combinations of
text: nudity. People leap in all directions to make saves, causing
text: CREDITS TO APPEAR at crazy angles.
text: A pretty girl watches Austin lift weights. Her boobs are
text: blocked by the "WRITTEN BY" credit.
text: Austin lifts a dumbbell. The credit "MIKE MYERS" sticks out
text: from his waist. Austin looks proud.
text: A BUFF NAKED BODYBUILDER joins them. He lifts a much heavier
text: weight. A much longer credit sticks out from his waist: "AND
text: MICHAEL MCCULLERS". Austin pouts.
text: Austin runs down the beach, his bum blocked by the credit
text: "DIRECTED BY". He jumps on a trampoline and does the splits
dialog: in mid-air:
text: FREEZE FRAME AND PAN AROUND LIKE IN THE GAP "KHAKI SWING"
text: AD. Austin smiles crazily, his penis blocked by "JAY ROACH."
text: Austin does a super-duper double flip into his JAGUAR.

dialog: something you wanted to share with your father before the

speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Dad, I know you're against race mixing
dialog: and all that, but I met someone...
speaker_heading: KLANSMAN
dialog: Don't say it!
text: The crowd WHOOPS.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I met someone... and he's black.
text: The crowd goes crazy.
speaker_heading: KLANSMAN
dialog: He?
text: The Klansman holds his hooded head in his hands.
scene_heading: JERRY SPRINGER
dialog: Please welcome Tim.
text: A handsome Blair Underwood look-alike enters and hugs the

text: JERRY MOVES TO SCOTT EVIL.
scene_heading: JERRY SPRINGER
dialog: Now Scott, tell us about your father.
dialog: Share with us.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Well he's the head of an evil

dialog: for world domination.
scene_heading: JERRY SPRINGER
dialog: And where is your father right now?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
text: He's in outer space, like frozen in
text: a giant egg and stuffed inside a Big
dialog: Boy rocket with his cat, Mr.
dialog: Bigglesworth.
scene_heading: JERRY SPRINGER
dialog: Really? Well, we have a surprise for
dialog: you, Scott. Let's bring out
speaker_heading: SCOTT'S
dialog: father, Dr Evil.
text: Dr Evil enters.
text: Lower Third Chyron: "WANTS TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD"
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Hello Scott, I'm back.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: I can't believe you'd do this to me
dialog: on national television!
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: They offered me a free makeover.
scene_heading: JERRY SPRINGER
dialog: Dr. Evil, we've seen a lot of the
dialog: fathers here today open up to their
dialog: sons, sons to the fathers. Is there
dialog: anything you'd like to share?
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Share?
scene_heading: JERRY SPRINGER
dialog: Yes, don't you have any secrets?
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: OK. I have a vestigial tail.
text: Everyone is a little grossed out.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: It's more of a nub, really. The spine
text: just goes on a little longer than it
dialog: should. Also, I've dabbled. I mean,
dialog: perform fellatio once and you're a
dialog: poet, twice and you're a homosexual.
dialog: I remember once I was being fisted
dialog: by Sebastian Cabot- but here's where
dialog: the story gets interesting. He was
text: lactose-intolerant. He could eat red
dialog: meat all night long, but one sip of
dialog: milk and it was gastric hell. And I
dialog: remember we were caught in fragrance
dialog: delicto by Henry Kissinger, and you
dialog: can imagine my humiliation at having
dialog: Hank hear me say, "Mr. French, no
dialog: teeth." One of my greatest
dialog: disappointments is that I never became
dialog: a song and dance man. I could have
dialog: been a quadruple threat, kind of
text: like a despotic Ken Barry. Dancer,
dialog: singer, actor, and I would possess
dialog: nuclear weapons, the latter being
dialog: the most threatening of the four. I
dialog: once sat on a bus and tried to will
dialog: myself a menstrual cycle. All I ended
dialog: up with was a sense of failure and a
dialog: mild neuralgia in my incisor teeth
dialog: and perhaps a grudging respect for
dialog: the weaker sex. I love toe cleavage.
dialog: For the most part I distrust dogs. I
dialog: slept in a horse once. It was quite
dialog: roomy. On second thought, it was the
dialog: Ritz. I named my left testicle 'piss'
dialog: and my right testicle 'vinegar'. I
dialog: wrote "It's Raining Men", or so the
dialog: Christmas babies told me. Oh yes, I
dialog: also made a Marzipan voodoo effigy
dialog: of The Fonze while I was in coma
dialog: after smoking some Peruvian prayer
dialog: hash, but who at the end of the day
dialog: can honestly say they haven't done
dialog: that?
text: The Springer audience is stunned, slack-jawed and for once
dialog: quiet.
speaker_heading: KLANSMAN
dialog: What are you, some kind of freak?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Shut up, jagoff!
text: Studio audience whoops at this.
speaker_heading: KLANSMAN
dialog: I'll kick your ass punk!
text: Crowd goes crazy.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: No one talks to my boy that way!
text: Dr. Evil charges at Klansman and starts to bitch slap him.
text: Security men, with headsets on, rush in to separate them.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: I'm OK, I'm OK.
text: There is a BEAT, then Dr. Evil CHARGES the guy again, knocking
dialog: him down.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Come Scott, let's go to daddy's new
dialog: evil lair.
scene_heading: EXT. WORLD HEADQUARTERS BUILDING - DAY
text: We pan up a modern office building. The camera reaches the
text: top of the building and we see a giant STARBUCKS LOGO and
text: the words: Starbucks World Headquarters.
scene_heading: INT. STARBUCKS BOARD ROOM
text: The penthouse boardroom is adorned with Starbucks
text: paraphernalia: large logo, clear canisters full of beans,
text: and a large world map with a little logo everywhere there is
dialog: a Starbucks.
text: Around a large table are Dr. Evil, Number Two (bandaged and
text: lightly spotted with soot), Frau, Scott and a couple of NEW
text: HENCHMEN. A Starbucks employee serves everyone steaming hot
dialog: coffee products.
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
dialog: Dr. Evil, as the legitimate frontman
dialog: of your organization, I seized upon
dialog: the opportunity to invest in a small
dialog: Seattle-based coffee company several
dialog: years ago. Today, Starbucks is a far-
dialog: flung empire with 2000 outlets
dialog: worldwide.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Oh good, Number Two, I do enjoy a
dialog: good cuppa joe.
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
dialog: If I may continue, I believe if we
dialog: shift our resources away from world
dialog: domination and focus on providing
dialog: premium quality coffee drinks, we
dialog: can increase our gross profits
dialog: fivefold.
text: Dr. Evil takes a sip of cappuccino, leaving a WHITE FROTHY
text: MILK MUSTACHE on his upper lip.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Right. Perhaps you've confused me
dialog: with someone who gives a shit. Might
dialog: I remind you that I run the show
dialog: here? I demand a little respect.
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
dialog: (indicating Dr. Evil's
dialog: milk mustache)
dialog: Dr. Evil, I think you--
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Silence! I will not tolerate your
dialog: insolence! Remember what happened
dialog: last time.
scene_heading: FLASHBACK (FOOTAGE FROM FIRST MOVIE)
text: Number Two disappears backwards into the fiery pit.
scene_heading: INT. STARBUCKS WORLD HEADQUARTERS
text: Number Two smiles weakly, breaking into a sweat on his brow.
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
dialog: May I add, I appreciate you
dialog: reinstating me after our little...
dialog: misunderstanding.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Frau Farbissina. Wie gehts is einen?
text: We see Frau. She looks a little more 'masculine' than before.
speaker_heading: FRAU
dialog: Zehr gut, Herr Doctor.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: How are things?
speaker_heading: FRAU
dialog: I have come to embrace the love that
dialog: dare not speak it's name. To my right
dialog: is my lover.
text: We see a severe-looking German woman with one continuous
dialog: eyebrow.
speaker_heading: FRAU
dialog: Her name is Unibrau. I met her on
dialog: the LPGA Tour.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Right on. Welcome, Unibrau.
text: Dr. Evil takes another sip of cappuccino, making the frothy
text: milk mustache even larger.
speaker_heading: FRAU
dialog: Doctor, you have a 'milk mustache.'
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: (wiping it off,
dialog: embarrassed)
dialog: Oh, I know. I know.
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
dialog: Dr. Evil, I'd like to introduce the
text: Greek assassin, Oedipus.
text: We see a swarthy Greek army guy.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Welcome to my private army, Oedipus.
dialog: Excited?
speaker_heading: OEDIPUS
dialog: I could give a shit.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Kiss your mother with that mouth?
speaker_heading: OEDIPUS
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Of course you do.
text: Dr Evil begins to press a button labelled "Oedipus" on his
text: control panel, but Number Two interrupts.
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
dialog: (clearing throat)
dialog: Dr. Evil, as you know, the rate at
dialog: which you liquidate henchmen far
dialog: exceeds our ability to replace them.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: I have so few pleasures left to me,
dialog: Number Two. The key to life is to
dialog: rotate your vices. One day it's
dialog: executions, another day it's creamy
dialog: French cheese. It's like frickin'
dialog: heroin.
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
dialog: Well, Dr. Evil, perhaps I have the
dialog: answer. While you were frozen, we
dialog: began a program to clone you.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Cool.
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
dialog: We had a few glitches, but I think
dialog: you'll be pleased with the results.
speaker_heading: FRAU
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Send in the clone!
text: MUSIC: dramatic sting We see the shadow of an approaching
text: figure. The shadow looks like Dr. Evil, only much larger and
dialog: scarier.
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
dialog: He is identical to you in every way,
dialog: except he is one-eighth your size.
text: We see that the source of the shadow is a MINIATURE DR. EVIL,
text: just like the creepy mini-Marlon Brando in The Island of Dr.
text: Moreau. He mimics Dr. Evil's mannerisms including holding
text: his tiny pinky to his tiny mouth.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Breathtaking. I shall call him Mini-
dialog: Me.
dialog: (to clone)
dialog: Mini-Me, you will sit to my right.
text: Mini-Me sits down in a miniature version of Dr. Evil's command
dialog: chair.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Come Mr. Bigglesworth!
text: The bald Mr. Bigglesworth runs and jumps into Dr. Evil's
text: lap. A bald MR. BIGGLESWORTH KITTEN jumps into Mini-Me's
dialog: lap.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Mini-me, something to eat?
dialog: (expectant pause)
dialog: No?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: OK.
dialog: (to room)
dialog: Tired. Gentleman, I have a plan. As
dialog: you know, the most powerful man in
dialog: the world is the President of the
dialog: United States. But he is just that-
text: a man, subject to temptations of the
dialog: flesh like any other man. Here's
dialog: what we do: we make it seem that the
dialog: President has had "extra-marital
dialog: oral relations" with- and this is
dialog: the kicker-
scene_heading: DRAMATIC STING, SNAP ZOOM TO DR. EVIL.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: With a White House intern!
text: Dr. Evil gloats. So does Mini-Me.
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
dialog: (clearing his throat)
dialog: Uh-hem.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: What, that already happened?
text: Number Two nods.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: This is ri-goddamn-diculous. Oh well,
dialog: how about a frickin' time machine?
dialog: Does the president have a time
dialog: machine? Have I been scooped on that?
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
dialog: No, not that I'm aware of.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Alright, time machine it is. As you
dialog: know, every diabolical scheme I've
text: hatched has been thwarted by Austin
dialog: Powers. And why is that, ladies and
dialog: gentlemen?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Because you never kill him when you
dialog: get the chance and you're a dope?
text: Mini-Me hops upon the table and tries to push the "Scott
text: Evil" button on Dr. Evil's control panel.
text: Frau SQUIRTS him with a water bottle. Mini-Me glares at Scott
text: and GIVES HIM THE FINGER.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: No, because Austin Powers has "mojo".
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
dialog: Mojo?
speaker_heading: FRAU
dialog: Yes, mojo. The mojo is the life force,
dialog: the essence, the libido, the "right
dialog: stuff".
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: It's what the French call a certain
dialog: 'I don't know what.'
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: If you've got a time machine, why
dialog: don't you just go back and kill Austin
dialog: Powers when he's a baby or something?
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: No, no, no.
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Dr. Evil, wouldn't it be easier to
dialog: use your knowledge of the future to
dialog: play the stock market? We could
dialog: literally make trillions.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: (smug laugh to himself)
dialog: Why make trillions when we could
dialog: make...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Billions?
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Why think small is all I'm saying.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: A trillion is more than a billion,
dialog: numb-nuts.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Zip it. Unveil the time portal!
text: A wall panel opens to reveal a Stargate-like wall of
text: shimmering energy.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the
dialog: time portal. As you know, Austin
dialog: Powers was frozen in 1967. Therefore,
dialog: I time travel to 1969, two years
dialog: after he was frozen. Security will
dialog: be lax and I'll strike when he is
text: totally helpless.
text: First, I take Austin Powers' mojo. Then I begin my domination
dialog: of the world.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Can I come?
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: No, Scott, Daddy has a score to
dialog: settle. Austin Powers is the snake
dialog: to my mongoose, or the mongoose to
dialog: my snake. Either way it's bad, I
dialog: don't know animals. But I do know
dialog: this: This time it's personal. Frau,
dialog: Number 2, I'll see you both in 1969.
dialog: Come, Mini-Me.
text: Dr. Evil walks to the portal. Mini-Me follows, imitating him
text: perfectly. They enter the portal.
text: There is a FREEZE FRAME effect and they FADE AWAY, like in
dialog: Star Trek.
scene_heading: INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR -
text: Dr. Evil and Mini-Me emerge on the other side of the portal
text: into a NEW LAIR. It is a large hollowed-out volcano room
text: dominated by chrome conduits and tasteful art pieces. A
text: younger Frau sits with NUMBER TWO, now played by ROB LOWE in
text: an eye-patch.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Ah, here we are Mini-Me, 1969. Number
dialog: Two, you look very youthful and
dialog: healthy.
dialog: (turning to Frau)
dialog: And Frau you look...right.
text: As Dr. Evil walks to the center of the room, chairs rise
text: from the floor. Everyone takes a seat, but Dr. Evil gets
text: caught in the middle as chairs rise around him. He is
text: frightened. One of the rising chairs hits him in the crotch.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: OK, people, we now officially have a
dialog: chair problem. If another one of
dialog: these chairs hits me in the nuts,
dialog: I'm gonna go postal. Mini-Me, I want
dialog: you to meet Number Two.
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
dialog: Hello there.
dialog: Mini-me says nothing.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Mini-Me?
text: Mini-me still says nothing.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Shy. Low blood sugar.
dialog: (to room)
dialog: Gentlemen, Phase Two is beginning. I
dialog: have an operative inside the Ministry
dialog: of Defense. By this time tomorrow,
dialog: Austin Powers' mojo will be mine.
text: Dr. Evil goes over and looks out the large window.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: (maniacal laugh)
dialog: Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!
scene_heading: EXT. DR. EVIL'S TROPICAL ISLAND -
text: We cut outside to see that window is in fact the left eye of
text: a Mt. Rushmore-type depiction of Dr. Evil carved into the
text: side of a volcano on a tropical island.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL (V.O.)
dialog: (maniacal laugh)
dialog: Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!
scene_heading: INT. MOD - CRYOGENIC FREEZING ROOM -
text: We see Austin's FROZEN BODY in cryogenic storage. Above it,
text: we see two digital clocks. One reads:
scene_heading: CURRENT DATE: MAY 25, 1969, the other reads: DATE FROZEN:

text: The other soldiers COLLAPSE, unconscious.
text: He bores through the ice and pulls out a Sixties high-tech
text: syringe type device with an LED graph on the side. He places
text: it in Austin's navel. The LED meter goes from red to green,
text: indicating FULL MOJO.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. AUSTIN'S SHAGUAR - DRIVING - DAY
text: Austin drives in MODERN TRAFFIC. He is drinking a STARBUCKS

text: reads empty.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Gor blimey, I'm on empty! That's

scene_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION
dialog: You'll be doing a photo shoot. We
dialog: know that one of the models is an ex-
dialog: KGB agent selling top secret material
dialog: to the highest bidder.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: That sounds easy enough, you know
dialog: what they say: all work and no

scene_heading: INT. SKI LODGE

speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Hobbies, man! I for one enjoy making

speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: How do you do, Austin? I'm Rebecca.
dialog: (indicating the photo
dialog: gear)
dialog: Your equipment is quite impressive.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Thank you. Your breasts are amazing.

speaker_heading: MODEL

speaker_heading: IVANA

speaker_heading: AUSTIN

text: Austin looks over the girls, trying to decide who is the
dialog: spy.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN (V.O.)
dialog: (inner monologue)
dialog: Now, which one is the Russian spy?
dialog: Cindy Crawford, Rebecca Romajin...
dialog: or Ivana Humpalot? Think, man, think!
text: Austin begins snapping pictures. The sequence is shot like a

speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Alright, baby! Love it. Turn and
dialog: pout for me baby! Smashing!
text: Cindy gets on all fours.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN

speaker_heading: REG
dialog: Hel-lo, you forgot about Ivana.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: I didn't forget, baby. Miss Humpalot
dialog: and I are going to have a 'private

speaker_heading: IVANA
dialog: Are you cold, Mr. Powers?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN

speaker_heading: IVANA
dialog: Do you know how we keep warm in

speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: I can guess, baby.
speaker_heading: IVANA
dialog: We play chess.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: I guessed wrong.
speaker_heading: IVANA
dialog: It takes a keen intelligence to play
dialog: chess. Of course, you know what they
dialog: say about men with big brains, don't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: They wear large hats?
speaker_heading: IVANA
dialog: No, they make better lovers.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Wrong again.
text: Ivana starts playing with the chess pieces sexily (like in
dialog: The Thomas Crowne Affair).
speaker_heading: IVANA
dialog: I assume you know how to play.
text: She runs the bishop across her lips sexily.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Of course. The... horsey... moves
text: in an L shape.
text: Austin tries to match her sexy moves and CHOKES on a piece.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Let's stop playing games with each
dialog: other... especially difficult ones.
dialog: May I ask you a question, Miss
dialog: Humpalot?
speaker_heading: IVANA
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Do I make you horny? Do I?

dialog: Austin, I came as soon as I heard.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: There must be some kind of mistake,

text: Austin holds his neck very stiffly.
scene_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION
dialog: What's wrong with your neck, Austin?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: (turning stiffly to

speaker_heading: AUSTIN

speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: But the test hasn't even started!
scene_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION
dialog: Agent Haggerty was the test, Austin.
dialog: Not only were you actually reading
dialog: an article in that Playboy, but a

dialog: turn your head.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Wait, I can explain, man! I was going

scene_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION
dialog: I'm sorry, Austin, I'm afraid it's

scene_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION

text: Basil shows Austin altered photos of Dr. Evil with famous
text: villains, such as Sadam, Nixon, and Donald Trump.
scene_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION
dialog: Our researcher noticed that these
text: photos from the archives have changed.
dialog: That means Dr. Evil is traveling
dialog: back in time and creating alliances
dialog: with each decade's most despised
dialog: villains.
text: Austin tries to read them and gets queasy.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: I can't read in the car. I get a bit
dialog: vomy.
text: Austin burps and swallows it.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Got it. I almost gipped.
speaker_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION (V.O.)
dialog: Our data indicates that Dr. Evil is
dialog: in the year 1969. Luckily, we also
dialog: have a time travel device. After
dialog: years of research we've developed a
dialog: machine that will transport you back
dialog: to the Sixties.

dialog: But Basil, isn't that the new

scene_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION
dialog: That's what they'd like you to
dialog: believe.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: So, Basil, if I travel back to 1969
dialog: and I was frozen in 1967, I could go
dialog: look at my frozen self. But, if I'm
dialog: still frozen in 1967, how could I
dialog: have been unthawed in the 90's and
dialog: traveled back to the Sixties?
dialog: (goes cross-eyed)
dialog: Oh, no, I've gone cross-eyed.
scene_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION
dialog: (to camera)
dialog: I suggest you don't worry about those
dialog: things and just enjoy yourself.
text: Austin gets into the car and turns it on.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: This is smashing Basil. I'll go back

scene_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION
dialog: Good luck, Austin.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Luck has nothing to do with it, Basil.
text: Austin steps on the gas. The car lurches in reverse and

speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: (changing gears)
dialog: Swinging Sixties, here I come, baby,
dialog: yeah!
text: The car takes off, heading for the wall. It DISAPPEARS,

scene_heading: FLASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - LONDON -

speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: I feel better already, man!
text: Austin smiles and we see that his teeth are back to being
text: TERRIBLE. He walks off as a crowd gathers around the car.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - LONDON
text: Austin enters the park in high spirits. We PULL BACK to see
text: that Austin is being watched through binoculars by a big
scene_heading: ARYAN ASSASSIN.
text: PULL BACK FURTHER to reveal a beautiful MYSTERIOUS WOMAN
text: watching both of them. From this distance we can't tell who
dialog: she is.
text: A sign reads "BE-IN FOR PEACE". HIPPIES, MODS, and FREAKS of
text: all descriptions dance to the music of a PSYCHEDELIC BAND.
text: The band's name is on the drum kit: "MING TEA."
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Alright, baby, a swinging shin-dig!
text: Austin gets into the dancing, quickly becoming the center of
text: the scene. The lead singer of the band invites him on stage
text: and hands him the microphone as the band starts a new song:
scene_heading: "SEXUAL REVOLUTION."
text: Austin begins singing and a choreographed musical number
text: begins involving the outdoor crowd a la Bob Fosse's Sweet
dialog: Charity or Hair.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: (singing)
scene_heading: 'THERE'S A SEXUAL REVOLUTION, YOU

dialog: (singing)
text: HEY SQUARE WORLD THE END IS NIGH.
text: WHEN WE SAY HUMP YOU SAY 'HOW HIGH?'
text: Three GROOVY CHICKS behind Austin suddenly have tambourines
text: for the big finale. The assassin and the mysterious woman
text: are both in the audience, keeping an eye on Austin. All we
text: see of the woman are shots of her BOOTS, CLOTHES, and a FEMALE
scene_heading: SYMBOL MEDALLION.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: (singing)
scene_heading: SO GO MAKE LOVE OR MASTURBATE--
scene_heading: SEXUAL FREEDOM WILL NEVER BE
text: OUT OF DAAAAAAAAAAATE!

dialog: (louder)
scene_heading: FREE-- LOVE!
dialog: (louder)
scene_heading: FREE-- LOVE!

dialog: IT'S THE SIXTIES!
text: The SONG ENDS and all the dancers end up on one knee with
text: their arms outstretched, panting. Austin breathes heavily
text: and smiles smugly like Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance.
text: We are TIGHT ON Austin's ass. PULL BACK to see that it is
text: the MYSTERIOUS WOMAN who is watching Austin's ass. She SMILES
text: behind the binoculars hiding her face.
scene_heading: 37 EXT. CARNABY ST.
text: Austin walks down the street looking at his new BEATLES ALBUM.
text: Sitting in a parked Citroen watching him is the ASSASSIN.

text: The Beefeater salutes with his pike to a SEXY TICKET COLLECTOR
text: on a double-decker bus.
text: The sexy ticket collector signals a TAXI DRIVER.
text: The taxi driver nods back to the assassin as he drives by.
scene_heading: INT. CITROEN
text: The assassin gets the signal and starts the car. The whole
text: nodding sequence was a circular waste of time.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - VARIOUS ANGLES
text: Austin walks along. Suddenly, he sees the Citroen coming at
text: him. He dives out of the way and takes off running. He rounds
text: a corner and pretends to be a COUPLE MAKING OUT against a
text: wall by hugging himself.
text: The assassin sees him and slams on the brakes. He raises his
dialog: gun.
text: Austin turns as he hears a car HONK.
text: It's Austin's BEETLE CONVERTIBLE. The mysterious woman steps
dialog: out.
text: We see her in her entirety for the first time, and what a

dialog: medallion.
text: She is FELICITY SHAGWELL.

text: The assassin FIRES.
scene_heading: INT. BEETLE
text: Felicity turns around to look.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: Grab the wheel, would you?
text: Austin grabs the wheel and Felicity pulls a gun. She turns
text: and FIRES out the window.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD
text: The assassin's tire BLOWS. The car skids towards a Cliff and
text: he jumps out as it goes over.
scene_heading: EXT. CLIFF SEEN FROM THE OCEAN
text: The car goes over and tumbles down the cliff, bouncing three

scene_heading: EXT. CLIFF

speaker_heading: ASSASSIN
dialog: Ahhhhhhhh!
scene_heading: EXT. CLIFF SEEN FROM THE OCEAN

speaker_heading: AUSTIN

speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: I was talking about me.

scene_heading: INT. AUSTIN'S PAD

speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Welcome to my shag pad, baby.
text: Light floods the pad, revealing hanging basket chairs, Hi-

speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Care for something to drink?

speaker_heading: AUSTIN

speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: No, I'm ready for bed.

speaker_heading: AUSTIN

speaker_heading: FELICITY

text: Austin sits up.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: (reflective)
dialog: Felicity, I used to think that way,
dialog: too, but I guess... I guess I've
dialog: changed. Not to make a short story
dialog: long, or to ramble on and on, or to
text: keep talking in a repetitive manner
dialog: ad infinitum until it becomes
dialog: impossible to remember what I was
dialog: talking about in the first place,

speaker_heading: DISCIPLES
dialog: Ahhhhhh!
speaker_heading: GURU PITKA
dialog: Now, perhaps you are wondering where
dialog: I got the nickname Sparky. Well,
dialog: when we were young we used to play a
dialog: game called "Stinkmop". We would
text: urinate into a bucket, dip a mop
dialog: into it, and play tag. I did not
dialog: care for "Stinkmop" and a very wise
dialog: old man said to me 'oh lighten up,
dialog: Sparky', and I don't know, the name
dialog: kind of stuck.
speaker_heading: DISCIPLES
dialog: Ahhhhhhhh...
speaker_heading: GURU PITKA
dialog: Now, the reason I am a spiritualist
dialog: instead of a therapist is that
dialog: 'therapist' often becomes 'the rapist'
dialog: and that will not help us attain
dialog: potentiality. Now what is
dialog: potentiality? It is the ability to
dialog: achieve those goals that we wish to
dialog: achieve for ourselves. People often
dialog: say to me that they feel "nowhere",
dialog: and I am going to change that to
dialog: "Now here."
text: The guru holds up a card which says "NOWHERE = NOW HERE!"
speaker_heading: DISCIPLES
dialog: Ahhhhhhh...
speaker_heading: GURU PITKA
dialog: And you have many assumptions about
dialog: your goals, but when you "assume"
dialog: You make an "ass" out of "u" and
dialog: "me".
text: Guru holds up a card which says "ASSUME = ASS - U - ME."
speaker_heading: DISCIPLES
dialog: Ahhhhhhh....
speaker_heading: GURU PITKA
dialog: The being, or that which we call
dialog: 'ourselves', is not the tinker. It
dialog: is not the taughts. It is the Gap
dialog: between the tinker and the taughts!
dialog: We are not our mind, we are not our
dialog: body, we are the Gap!
text: Guru holds up a card that says "NOT TINKER, NOT TAUGHTS, BUT
text: THE GAP" with the familiar Gap font.
speaker_heading: DISCIPLES
dialog: Ahhhhh...
speaker_heading: GURU PITKA
dialog: (rapid fire)
dialog: The heart of the matter is that you
dialog: are the heart of the matter. There
dialog: is no "I" in "team". Beer before
dialog: liquor, never sicker. Don't take a
dialog: wooden nickel. If your pipe is short
dialog: and your pump is weak, you better
dialog: stand close or you'll piss on your
text: feet. He who goes to bed with itchy
text: bum wakes up with smelly finger.
speaker_heading: DISCIPLES
dialog: Ahhhhh...
speaker_heading: GURU PITKA
dialog: Finally, the path to spiritual
dialog: awakening requires the death of ego.
dialog: Leggo of my ego! Let us end with the
dialog: mantra: Om Ay Vant Yu Uh... Mo Ay
dialog: Vant Yu Uh... Mo Ay Vant Yu Hu.
speaker_heading: DISCIPLES

speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Guru, I've lost my mojo.
speaker_heading: GURU PITKA
dialog: Oh, mojo! You should have said so.
dialog: Well, you've lost your mojo because

dialog: have lost love.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Lost love? Oh, you mean Vanessa?
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: Who's Vanessa?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: She was an evil robot minion of Dr.

speaker_heading: GURU PITKA
dialog: Denial ain't just a river in Egypt,

speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Oh, I get what you're saying now!
dialog: He's talking about free love, baby!
dialog: Tune in, turn on, and drop out!
speaker_heading: GURU PITKA
dialog: I am talking about true love. You

speaker_heading: AUSTIN

dialog: I'm sorry, I don't understand.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: You know, kwan? Show me the money?
dialog: No? Nothing?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: It's 1969. That movie won't come out
dialog: for another 30 years, ass. They
dialog: don't know what you're talking about.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Right. OK, see if you understand
dialog: this: give me the money or I'm going
dialog: to blow you to frickin' bits, OK?
text: The President and his advisors MURMUR.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: But-
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: (making 'stop' gesture)
dialog: Talk to the hand!
text: Dr. Evil signs off.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: (to Scott)
dialog: I did love that, though. Cuba Gooding
dialog: Jr. was outstanding. Oscar speech,
dialog: very touching.
text: Scott looks at him with disgust.
speaker_heading: DR.EVIL
dialog: Okay, everybody clear the room!
text: Everyone leaves and he walks over to a panel bearing his
text: logo. He presses a button, the panel opens up to reveal... A
text: SECRET SHRINE TO AUSTIN POWERS!
text: In it we see a huge full-length photo of Austin Powers, and
dialog: various magazine covers.
text: He presses a button and an Austin wig descends from the
text: ceiling landing perfectly on his bald head. A backless mockup
text: of Austin's suit rises from the floor. He puts on a pair of
text: glasses. He has become Austin Powers.
text: Dr. Evil cautiously tastes the mojo.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Yeah, baby. Very shagedelic.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: This isn't working. I don't feel
dialog: anything.
text: We PUSH IN towards Dr. Evil's head.
scene_heading: FLASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: DR. EVIL ANIMATED SEQUENCE
text: A Yellow Submarine-like depiction of Dr. Evil. Zoom in on
text: his head which explodes into 30 other small Dr. Evil heads
text: which rain on a Peter Max-ian valley of flowers. The flowers
text: sprout the word "EVIL'.
text: A psychedelic flying Austin head with spirals in the glasses
text: smashes the flowers, changing the words from "EVIL" to "VILE"
text: and to "LIVE" and then to "LOVE".
text: Turn-of-the-century fat cat capitalists on stilts with teeth
text: coming out of their stomachs drop penis rockets that have
text: the word "GREED" written on the shaft, smashing the "LOVE"
text: flowers into "IRELO" which sprouts into "YELLOW" which turns
text: into submarines, which becomes yellow penises of huge, goose-
text: stepping Dr. Evils, each of them peeing, creating a rain of
text: urine that falls on the Peter Max-ian valley of a hundred
text: Austin Powers citizens. They each open an umbrella that says
text: "LOVE TRIUMPHS OVER LUST". The urine turns into a stream
text: that flows into the mouth of a huge head of Dr. Evil.
scene_heading: FLASH CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR - AUSTIN SHRINE
text: Pull back from Dr. Evil's head. He looks dazed and confused.
text: Just then, Number Two re-enters the room, catching Dr. Evil
text: with all his Austin paraphernalia.
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
dialog: Dr. Evil, one last thing. I-- oh.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: I was just... right. Would it kill
dialog: you to frickin' knock?
scene_heading: EXT./INT. CARNABY STREET - DAY
text: Austin and Felicity walk along the street.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: Austin, tell me about the Nineties.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: You know I can't tell you details
dialog: about the future, baby, it could
dialog: alter history.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: Not details, just what it's like.
dialog: You know, what's the scene? Where's
dialog: it at?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: There've been a lot of advances in
dialog: the Nineties, baby. The economy is
dialog: stable, people take better care of
dialog: their health concern for the
dialog: environment is on the rise and, um,
dialog: let's see, there's an entire
text: television channel dedicated to golf.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: Sounds awful.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: It's not so bad once you get used to
dialog: it. The Nineties are about
dialog: responsibility. You know, having
dialog: respect for yourself and other people.
dialog: I even got married.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: You? Married? What about the sexual
dialog: revolution?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Well, it turns out there were some
dialog: casualties, baby. Don't you think
dialog: you'll ever get married?
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: No, not until I get a little more
dialog: 'experience' under my belt.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Oh, behave!
text: Suddenly Austin notices something outside and puts his hand
text: to his mouth in fear.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: (wide-eyed)
dialog: Oh my God!
text: Felicity is immediately on her guard. She pulls her gun.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: What is it! Is it Fat Bastard?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: No, written here on my hand, see?
text: Austin turns his hand around to show her. He has written 'oh
text: my God' on his hand with the pen.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Says 'Oh my God!'
text: They laugh.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: Austin, look.
text: Austin and Felicity duck into a CAMERA SHOP and come out an
text: instant later with SUPER-8 CAMERAS.
text: They run down the street filming each other.
scene_heading: AUSTIN AND FELICITY - SUPER-8 MONTAGE
text: This is a Richard Lester-like sequence shot on grainy film
text: from Austin and Felicity's POVs.
text: There's lots of SPEEDED UP stuff and POPPING IN AND OUT of
text: frame like the MONKEES TV show.
text: BACK ON THE STREET
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Felicity, I haven't had this much
dialog: fun since I worked undercover in
dialog: Amsterdam-- '66 I think it was.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: 1965, actually. You posed as a Dutch
dialog: cheese expert to stop Dr. Evil from
dialog: poisoning the world's water supply.
text: Austin is impressed.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: I've studied your file, Austin. I
dialog: want to be a trailblazer, just like
dialog: you. The Seventies are right around
dialog: the corner. It's going to be a
dialog: glorious time for fashion and music
dialog: and technology-- it won't be long
dialog: before every flying car has its own
dialog: 8-track.
text: Austin starts to say something, then bites his tongue.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: The CIA has always been a boy's club
dialog: until now. Well move over, this
text: chick's taking over.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: (hoarse)
dialog: Very impressive.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: Austin, your voice!
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Yes, I think I'm coming down with
dialog: something.
text: Austin and Felicity stop at an ICE CREAM MAN with his
dialog: pushcart.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: I'll get some ice cream. Would you
dialog: like some?
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: (hoarse, to ice cream
dialog: man)
dialog: Could I have two scoops of Vanilla,
dialog: please?
speaker_heading: ICE CREAM MAN
dialog: Right away, governor. Would you like
dialog: chocolate syrup?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: (hoarse)
dialog: Yes, please.
speaker_heading: ICE CREAM MAN
dialog: Will you have any whipped cream?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: (hoarse)
dialog: I will, thank you.
speaker_heading: ICE CR@ MAN
dialog: Candy sprinkles?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: (hoarse)
dialog: Yes please.
speaker_heading: ICE CREAM MAN
dialog: Crushed nuts?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: No, laryngitis.
speaker_heading: ICE CREAM MAN
dialog: Here's your change, sir. Oh, and
dialog: Austin--
text: We cut back to the ICE CREAM MAN to see him pulling off a
text: very fake beard. It is BASIL (though it was clearly another
dialog: actor before).
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: (now with phlegmy
dialog: throat)
dialog: Basil!
scene_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION
dialog: Hello, Austin. What's wrong with
dialog: your voice?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: (still phlegmy throat)
dialog: I just had ice cream. Listen to me,
dialog: I have dairy throat. "Mary had a
dialog: little lamb and it was always
text: gruntin'. She tied it to a five bar
dialog: gate and kicked it's little-
scene_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION
dialog: (Interrupting)
dialog: Austin! Things are heating up, so I
dialog: thought it best to contact you in
dialog: disguise. Felicity, your plan worked.
dialog: You and Austin track Fat Bastard
text: back to Dr. Evil.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: But how can we track Fat Bastard?
speaker_heading: FELICITY
text: I planted a homing device on him
dialog: last night.
scene_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION
dialog: Yes, and we're starting to pick up
text: the signal now.
text: Basil hands Felicity a tracking device that BEEPS.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: How did you get close enough to plant
dialog: a homing device?
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: I shagged him, I shagged him rotten.
text: Austin and Basil are confused and grossed out at the same
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: You... him? Just like that?
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: Yes, Austin, we needed that
dialog: information.
scene_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION
dialog: Well, thanks to your effort, Felicity,
dialog: we now know that-
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: (interrupting, to
dialog: Felicity)
dialog: Did you use an elaborate set of
dialog: pulleys? A block and tackle?
scene_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION
dialog: Anyway, you two follow the signal
text: back to Dr. Evil's headquarters and
dialog: then-
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: (interrupting, to
dialog: Felicity)
dialog: I just can't get my head around it,
dialog: baby. You're so small and he's so
dialog: ... not small. The sheer mechanics
dialog: of it are mindboggling!
scene_heading: BASIL EXPOSITION
dialog: Never mind, Austin, you two have
dialog: work to do. You must find Dr. Evil.
scene_heading: INT. BEETLE
text: We hear the BEEP-BEEP of the tracking screen built into the
dialog: dash.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: I got it! A Chinese basket with a
dialog: counter-weighted ballast. That's
dialog: how you did it, right?
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: Austin, it almost sounds like you're
dialog: jealous.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Who, me? That's not possible, baby!
dialog: (beat, to himself)
dialog: is it?
text: Just then a-car pulls beside them. Two Dr. Evil Private Army
text: guys pull machine guns and start SHOOTING.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Get down!
text: Felicity ducks. Austin reaches back and pulls ROBIN SWALLOWS
text: from the back seat and USES HER AS A SHIELD.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: We're obviously on the right track.
dialog: (re: tracking screen)
text: It looks like Fat Bastard is-on an
text: island in the middle of the ocean.
scene_heading: EXT. DR. EVIL'S ISLANDNIGHT
text: We hear the BEEP-BEEP of the tracking screen.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - DR. EVIL'S ISLAND - NIGHT
text: The Beetle comes from under the water and lands on the beach.
text: We still hear the BEEP-BEEP.
scene_heading: EXT. TENT - WOODS - NIGHT
text: Austin and Felicity have set up a tent with a view of the
text: Dr. Evil Mt. Rushmore face. Austin is looking at the mountain
text: through a pair of binoculars which hang around his neck.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
text: According to the readings, Dr. Evil's
text: headquarters is over the next ridge.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: Can I have a look?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Sure.
text: Austin hands her the binoculars. Unfortunately the strap is
text: still around his neck, pulling his face into her cleavage.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: Question is, how do we get in?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: (muffled)
text: Mmmmmmm...mmmmm...
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: Austin, did you hear me?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: I seem to be stuck in your dirty
dialog: pillows.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: Where are the topographical maps
dialog: that Basil drew up?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: I think they're in the tent.
text: He and Felicity enter the tent. A LIGHT is on inside casting
text: shadows of Austin and Felicity on the side of the tent. From
text: the outside it appears the shadow Austin is leaning over
text: with his back to-the shadow Felicity, who appears to have
text: her hands up his butt.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN (V.O.)
dialog: Have you got it out yet?
speaker_heading: FELICITY (V.O.)
dialog: Good Lord, Austin, what sort of things
dialog: do you put in there?
text: The shadow Felicity appears to be tugging a string of sausage
text: links from his ass.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN (V.O.)
dialog: Oh, anything that catches my fancy.
speaker_heading: FELICITY (V.O.)
dialog: How do you manage to fit it all in?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN (V.O.)
dialog: Oh, it stretches to fit.
text: The shadow Felicity appears to pull a tennis racket out of
dialog: Austin's ass.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN (V.O.)
dialog: Are you almost done? I can't hold it
dialog: much longer.
scene_heading: INT. TENT
text: We see that Austin is leaned over holding part of the tent.
text: Felicity is rummaging through a duffel bag across the tent.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: Here we go, one hammer. It's amazing
dialog: how much this duffel bag will hold.
scene_heading: INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR
text: We see Dr. Evil playing a piano. We pan to see Mini-Me on
text: top of the piano, himself playing a miniature baby grand.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: (singing)
dialog: 'WHAT IF GOD WAS ONE OF US?
dialog: JUST A SLOB LIKE ONE OF US?'
text: We see that Number Two and Frau are the audience. They
text: applaud.
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
dialog: Dr. Evil, that was fantastic, but I
dialog: do have some bad news. Powers' is
text: on the island.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: How tedious.
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
dialog: Don't worry, Dr. Evil, we can get to
text: him by using the girl.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
dialog: I have the perfect weapon. Frau?
speaker_heading: FRAU
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Bring in the He-Bots!
scene_heading: MUSIC: It's Rainina Men by THE WEATHERGIRLS Three HE-BOTS
text: enter in unison. They are robotic studs in Logan's Run type
dialog: outfits.
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
dialog: Dr. Evil, may I present the He-Bots.
dialog: What kind of woman could resist these
dialog: perfect specimens of masculinity?
text: Their clothes are stylish, their
text: posture is ramrod straight, and their
text: buttocks are tight, like tigers.
text: And, each He-Bot is armed with a
dialog: secret weapon.
text: ANGLE ON THE FIRST HE-BOT.
text: A nozzle flips up from his codpiece and white smoke pours
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO (O.S.)
dialog: Poison gas...
text: ANGLE ON THE SECOND HE-BOT.
text: A gun barrel flips out form his crotch and FIRES machine-gun
dialog: style.
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO (O.S.)
dialog: Machine gun...
text: ANGLE ON THE THIRD HE-BOT.
text: A nozzle flips up from his crotch and yellow liquid drizzles
text: out onto the floor, where it smokes.
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO (O.S.)
dialog: And deadly acid.
text: Dr. Evil is disgusted by the last one.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Right. I object to the last one on
dialog: aesthetic grounds, but I don't care
dialog: how you get Powers, just bring him
dialog: to me.
dialog: (to Mini-Me)
dialog: Ready Mini-Me? A one and a two and...
dialog: (singing)
text: ME, AND MY SHA-DOW STROLLING DOWN
speaker_heading: THE A-VA-

speaker_heading: MINI-ME

speaker_heading: BLUE!
scene_heading: EXT. TENT
text: We see the shadows again. It now looks like Felicity is
text: putting things into Austin's ass.
speaker_heading: FELICITY (V.O.)
dialog: Do you want everything to go back
dialog: in?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN (V.O.)
dialog: Yes. Listen, Felicity, about Fat
dialog: Bastard-
speaker_heading: FELICITY (V.O.)
dialog: It's my job, Austin. You of all people
dialog: should understand that. Marakesh,
dialog: 1962. Rome, 1964. Tokyo, 1966. I
dialog: know your record backwards and
dialog: forwards. You've had more sex on
dialog: the job than a Swedish stewardess.
text: The shadow Felicity tries to cram the tennis racket into
text: what appears to be Austin's ass.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN (V.O.)
dialog: You're right, Felicity, I can't deny
dialog: it. But the world changed, and I
dialog: changed too.
text: Pull back to reveal that THE HE-BOTS are watching. Felicity
text: shoves the tennis racket extra hard.
text: Austin stands up rapidly.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN (V.O.)
dialog: Ow!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: My back hurts.
speaker_heading: FELICITY (V.O.)
dialog: Are you OK?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN (V.O.)
dialog: I'm fine, just keeping packing.
text: The He-Bots shrug their shoulders and march towards the tent.
scene_heading: INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR - 60'S
text: Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, Scott, Number Two and Frau are seated.
speaker_heading: FAT BASTARD
dialog: Christ Almighty, it smells terrible
dialog: in here.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: It's the volcanic sulphurous
dialog: emissions. We've put up some air
dialog: fresheners.
speaker_heading: FAT BASTARD
dialog: Great, now it smells like someone
text: took a shite in a pine tree.
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
text: Dr. Evil, the laser has been loaded
dialog: into the rocket. You're ready for
dialog: launch.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
text: I'm just waiting to taunt my nemesis.
dialog: I have so few pleasures, you know.
text: Austin and Felicity are brought in at gunpoint by Private
dialog: Army Men.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Ah, Mr. Powers, Ms. Shagwell, welcome
dialog: to my hollowed-out volcano.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: We meet again, Dr. Evil.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Yes, the only reason I'm keeping you
dialog: alive is so you can feel the agony
dialog: of watching my plan unfold.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Dr. Evil your plan will never--
text: Austin trails off as he spots his MOJO in the beaker behind
dialog: Dr. Evil.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Oh, is that yours?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: My mojo!
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: You know what they say: finders
text: keepers, loser weepers.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: Dr. Evil, do you like real estate?
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Of course. Why?
text: Felicity kicks Dr. Evil in the balls.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: Now you've got a couple of achers.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Oww! My stomach hurts!
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: (wincing)
dialog: I don't care if he is evil, you don't
dialog: give a man a shot in the pills. It's
dialog: just not cricket, baby.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: Take them away.
text: The guards lead Austin and Felicity away.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: She just hoofed you in the sack and
dialog: you're going to leave them alone in
dialog: a jail cell with one inept guard?
dialog: They'll escape, dipshit. You do this
dialog: every time!
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: You're going the right way for a
text: smacked bottom, young man.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: You don't own me!
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: I do actually.
dialog: (pulling out paper)
dialog: It's complicated. Usually it's illegal
dialog: but this buddy of mine... but I
dialog: digress. Fat Bastard, I'm leaving
dialog: you in charge. I'm going up the moon
dialog: to hold the world ransom with my
dialog: giant laser, I shouldn't be long.
speaker_heading: FAT BASTARD
dialog: What about Powers?
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
text: He's tucked away safely in his cell.
dialog: He's harmless without that mojo.
dialog: Guard it with your life.
dialog: (to Number Two)
text: Number Two, begin the countdown.
text: The area around Dr. Evil's command chair, including the time
text: portal behind it, is enclosed by a circular door, becoming

speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
dialog: Five, four, three...
scene_heading: EXT. VOLCANO ISLAND (CHEAP BLUE SCREEN)
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO (V.O.)

speaker_heading: COLONEL

speaker_heading: WOMAN

speaker_heading: MAN

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ARMY BASE
speaker_heading: SERGEANT

scene_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. RADAR ROOM
speaker_heading: COLONEL
dialog: Johnson!
speaker_heading: RADAR OPERATOR
dialog: Yes, sir?
speaker_heading: COLONEL

scene_heading: INT. JAIL CELL
text: Austin and Felicity are in a bare cell with cement walls.

speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: How are we going to get out of here?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Why don't you just shag Fat Bastard
dialog: again?
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: (exploding)
dialog: Austin, that is it! I don't know
dialog: what happened to you in the Nineties,
dialog: but I'm still here, in the Sixties,
dialog: and I still swing! Don't try to lay
dialog: your hang-ups on me just because you
dialog: lost your mojo! That one hurts.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Ouch, baby, very ouch. I'm wounded.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: I'm sorry, Austin, that was a cheap
dialog: shot.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: No, baby, you're right. I was wrong
dialog: to judge you. I guess I am... jealous.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: But the Austin Powers I knew was
text: wild and crazy and free. He could
dialog: never be jealous.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: That Austin is gone. I've changed. I
dialog: knew someone, not long ago, a very
dialog: special woman. She taught me that
dialog: life isn't about jumping into the
dialog: sack with whoever comes along, it's
dialog: about caring and responsibility. And
dialog: while it is true she turned out to
text: be an evil robot minion of Dr. Evil,
dialog: I suppose I really did... love her.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: Was that your wife?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Yes, Vanessa.
text: Felicity is touched.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: Listen, Austin, I can't pretend to
dialog: understand everything you've gone
dialog: through, but I trust you. I'll make
dialog: you a deal: if we get out of here
dialog: alive, I'll give monogamy a try.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: With me?
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: Yes, silly.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Groovy, baby!
text: They kiss.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: We need to lure the guard inside and
dialog: get his key.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Alright, what if I pretend to be
dialog: desperately ill with food poisoning?
text: The guard, drawn by my cries of pain,
text: will come to investigate. Meanwhile,
dialog: you dig a pit and line it with
text: makeshift punji sticks made from
text: sharpened toothbrushes. The guard
dialog: falls in, Bob's your uncle, and we've
dialog: got the key. What do you think?
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: That might work, but how about this?
text: Felicity charges towards the window in the door, ripping
text: open her blouse as she goes, showing her breasts to the guard.
dialog: We, however, can't see them.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: (giving a wolf whistle)
dialog: What do you think of these, my man?
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE CELL
text: The guard is mesmerized by Felicity.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Mommy...
text: He unlocks the door and enters.
scene_heading: INT. JAIL CELL
text: The guard enters an apparently empty cell. We see that Austin
text: is wedged spread-eagle above the door, ready to pounce.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: (seductive, to guard)
dialog: It's very hot in here, don't you
dialog: think?
text: The guard follows her into the cell.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: It's very hot in here, don't you
dialog: think?
text: The guard advances on her.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: (breaking cover)
dialog: Austin!
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: (from above)
dialog: I'm very firmly wedged.
speaker_heading: FELICITY
dialog: If you want something done...
text: She PUNCHES the guard right in the face and he collapses.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Almost... got it!
text: Austin falls flat on his face with a THUMP and pops back up.

speaker_heading: FELICITY

dialog: But isn't it interesting, Mr. Powers,
dialog: you really have become a product of
dialog: the Nineties.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: How so?
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: You're more interested in your job
dialog: as glorified policeman than you are
dialog: in love. You won the battle, but I
dialog: won the war. Love means nothing,
dialog: you've proved it.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: I didn't think that Felicity was
dialog: going to die, man.
speaker_heading: DR. EVIL
dialog: What a cowardly response. I'm
