text: The following script takes place in real time, and - with the
dialog: exception of one moment - is written and designed to be one single
text: continuous shot.
scene_heading: EXT. MEADOW - DAY, APRIL 6TH 1917
text: A rolling landscape. The rustling of leaves, and birdsong.
text: Thunder rumbles in the distance. There is no rain.
text: A figure lies against a tree, eyes closed - this is
text: SCHOFIELD, early-20s. Soft features.
text: A man is sleeping next to him on the grass - BLAKE, 19,
text: youthful, strapping.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT SANDERS (0.S.)
dialog: Blake.
text: Blake doesn’t stir.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT SANDERS (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Blake!
text: Blake wakes. He’s in uniform, damp and crumpled - Lance
text: Corporal chevrons adorn it.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: (sleepily)
dialog: Sorry, Sarge.
scene_heading: SERGEANT SANDERS
dialog: Pick a man, bring your kit.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Yes, Sarge.
text: Blake stands, stiff limbs coming back to life.
text: Schofield’s eyes are still shut. Blake holds out his hand to
text: Schofield. Schofield opens his eyes - they are gentle, wise.
text: Schofield grudgingly raises his hand for a lift.
text: Blake heaves him to his feet - his uniform is identical to
text: Blake's, same rank, the only difference is the brass wound
text: stripe on Schofield’s left sleeve.
text: They trudge towards Sanders, fastening their webbing. A
text: smattering of SOLDIERS - same regiment - same state of
text: fatigue and filth, lie around them. Stealing sleep.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT SANDERS (0.S.)
dialog: Don’t dawdle.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: No, Sarge.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: After a few paces the long grass begins to give way to well
text: trodden earth. Washing lines appears on either side of them.
text: Blake and Schofield move past them. After a while -
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Did they feed us?
text: Schofield shakes his head, he hands an envelope to Blake.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: No, just mail.
text: Blake’s eyes light up at the sight of the envelope, he tears
text: it open, reads it as he walks. Eyes scanning quickly, his
text: face filling with warmth.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: (reading)
text: Myrtle’s having puppies.
text: Blake finishes the note and slips it into a pocket.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: You get anything?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: No.
text: Schofield doesn’t seem to mind.
text: The mess tents are now alongside. Fires are stoked, cooking
text: is underway. More soldiers mill about.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: I'm bloody starving, aren’t you? I
dialog: thought we might get some decent
dialog: grub out here - only reason I
dialog: decided against the priesthood.
text: Schofield lets out a laugh. Blake looks on hungrily as they
text: pass by the mess tents.
text: Schofield rummages in his pockets, finds what he’s looking
text: for - a handkerchief with some food wrapped in it. Blake’s
text: eyes fall on it hungrily.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: What you got there?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
text: Ham and bread.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Where did you find that?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: I have my uses.
text: Schofield breaks the bread in half. As he does this, they
text: move down a slope, and begin to descend down into the earth,
dialog: into--
scene_heading: EXT. COMMS TRENCH —- DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: A narrow Comms trench.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Here-
text: The bread is stale, practically cardboard. Blake’s teeth
text: struggle to get through it.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: (mouth full of food)
text: Tastes like old shoe.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Cheer up. This time next week it’1l
dialog: be chicken dinner.
text: The trench drops deeper into the earth...
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Not me. Leave got cancelled.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: They say why?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: No idea.
text: A beat. The world above has now disappeared.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: It’s easier not to go back at all.
text: Blake registers this - looks at him.
text: The wider Rear Trench crosses their path. Chains of soldiers
text: move past them - shifting crates, ammunition, cooking, and
dialog: medical supplies.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: (looking at the soldiers)
dialog: Something’s up.
text: Expectation is growing in Blake. But Schofield looks
text: concerned. They cut a route through the bustle.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you hear anything?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Has to be the push, right?
text: Men carrying things push past them. Blake watches.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ten bob says we’re going up.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: I’m not taking that bet.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Why? ‘Cos you know I’m right?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: No. ‘Cos you haven’t got ten bob.
text: Blake laughs.
dialog: They follow Sanders into-
scene_heading: EXT. SECOND TRENCH - CONTINUOUS
text: They turn into a wider second line trench.
scene_heading: SERGEANT SANDERS
dialog: In your own time, gentlemen...
text: Up ahead, Sanders waits.
text: Blake and Schofield put on speed, catch Sanders.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Is there news, Sarge?
scene_heading: SERGEANT SANDERS
dialog: News of what?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: The big push. It was supposed to
dialog: happen weeks ago. They told us we’d
dialog: be home by Christmas.
scene_heading: SERGEANT SANDERS
dialog: (mild sarcasm)
dialog: Yes, well, sorry to disrupt your
dialog: crowded schedule, Blake, but the
dialog: Brass Hats didn’t fancy it in the
dialog: snow.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: More’s the pity Sarge, I could have
dialog: done with some turkey.
scene_heading: SERGEANT SANDERS
dialog: Well, I’1ll make sure to relay your
text: displeasure to command.
text: Ahead and above them is a web of telegraph wires - stretching
text: overhead and along the trench. THREE ROYAL ENGINEERS are
text: working on them, tagging and testing. They duck around them.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: So what’s on the cards then,
dialog: Sergeant?
scene_heading: SERGEANT SANDERS
dialog: The Hun are up to something.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Any idea what?
scene_heading: SERGEANT SANDERS
dialog: No - but it’s bound to ruin our
dialog: weekend.
text: Sanders turns a corner, and comes to a stop. Just beyond him
text: is the dark, yawning mouth of a Dugout.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT SANDERS (CONT'D)
dialog: Now listen, Erinmore is inside, so
dialog: tidy yourselves up.
text: They are suddenly alert.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT SANDERS (CONT'D)
dialog: You never know - might be mentions
dialog: in dispatches for this one, if you
dialog: don't bugger it up.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: Sanders gives them a look, and disappears inside the dugout.
text: Schofield quickly buttons up his tunic, hiding any sins there
text: may be underneath.
text: Blake nervously tidies himself, leans in to Schofield.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Must be something big if the
dialog: General’s here.
text: They enter.
scene_heading: INT. DUGOUT - CONTINUOUS
text: Lit by paraffin lamps, it takes Schofield a moment for his
text: eyes to adjust to the half-light. He and Blake hand their
text: rifles to the ORDERLIES, salute, and stand at attention.
text: There is a simmering sense of unease in this place.
text: In the centre of the room, there are two tables. On one table
text: lie several maps, on the other are a number of large aerial
dialog: reconnaissance photographs.
scene_heading: GENERAL ERINMORE (50s), LIEUTENANT GORDON (40s) and a CAPTAIN
text: are gathered around the far table, looking down at the
text: aerials, talking in hushed tones.
text: Other men watch from the shadows - TWO NCOs and ANOTHER
speaker_heading: ORDERLY.
scene_heading: SERGEANT SANDERS
dialog: Lance Corporals Blake and
dialog: Schofield, Sir.
text: General Erinmore turns around. Looks at Blake and Schofield.
speaker_heading: GENERAL ERINMORE
dialog: Which one of you is Blake?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Sir.
speaker_heading: ERINMORE
dialog: You have a brother, a Lieutenant in
dialog: the 2nd Devons?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Yes, sir. Joseph Blake. Is he-
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ERINMORE
dialog: Alive, as far as I know. And with
dialog: your help I’d like to keep it that
dialog: way.
text: Blake stares at Erinmore, he would do anything.
speaker_heading: ERINMORE (CONT'D)
dialog: Sanders tells me you’re good with
dialog: Maps. That true?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Good enough, Sir.
speaker_heading: ERINMORE
dialog: So.
text: Erinmore turns the map to face Blake. The British lines are
text: marked in blue, the German lines in red.
speaker_heading: ERINMORE (CONT'D)
dialog: We are here. The 2nd Devons are
text: advancing here.
text: He points out a cross on the map at Croisilles Wood.
speaker_heading: ERINMORE (CONT'D)
dialog: How long will it take you to get
dialog: there?
text: Blake hesitantly studies it. Croisilles Wood sits in the
text: centre of a huge area of land, which is scored as occupied
dialog: territory.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: I don’t understand, Sir.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Sir, that land is held by the
dialog: Germans.
speaker_heading: ERINMORE
dialog: Germans have gone.
text: Shock plays on their faces.
speaker_heading: ERINMORE (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t get your hopes up. It appears
dialog: to be a strategic withdrawal. They
dialog: seem to have created a new line,
dialog: nine miles back here, by the looks
dialog: of it.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: Erinmore runs his finger along the massed red lines of the
text: German trenches and fortifications, newly drawn on the map.
dialog: The new German Line - what came to be known as the Hindenburg
text: Line - is huge, and cuts its way across the paper, almost
text: intersecting with Croisilles Wood.
speaker_heading: ERINMORE (CONT'D)
text: Colonel Mackenzie is in command of
dialog: the 2nd. He sent word yesterday
dialog: morning that he was going after the
text: retreating Germans. He is convinced
dialog: he has them on the run - that if he
dialog: can break their lines now, he will
dialog: turn the tide. He is wrong.
text: Schofield watches Blake as he begins to register what this
dialog: might mean.
speaker_heading: ERINMORE (CONT'D)
dialog: Colonel Mackenzie has not seen
dialog: these aerials of the enemy’s new
dialog: line.
text: Erinmore turns to the other table.
speaker_heading: ERINMORE (CONT'D)
dialog: Come round here, Gentlemen.
text: Blake and Schofield move to the next table. They look down at
text: the large aerial photographs.
speaker_heading: ERINMORE (CONT'D)
text: Three miles deep. Field
dialog: fortifications, defences and
dialog: artillery the like of which we've
dialog: never seen before.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: ERINMORE (CONT'D)
dialog: The 2nd are due to attack the line
text: shortly after dawn tomorrow. They
dialog: have no idea what they are in for.
dialog: And we can’t warn them - as a
dialog: parting gift, the enemy cut all our
dialog: telephone lines.
text: Blake and Schofield are silent while they take this in.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: ERINMORE (CONT'D)
dialog: Your orders are to get to the 2nd
text: at Croisilles Wood, one mile south
text: east of the town of Ecoust.
text: Erinmore hands over an envelope to Blake. We see the
text: distinctive red stamp of Army Command.
speaker_heading: ERINMORE (CONT'D)
dialog: Deliver this to Colonel Mackenzie.
dialog: It is a direct order to call off
text: tomorrow morning’s attack.
text: Erinmore speaks slowly, desperate to impress upon Blake and
dialog: Schofield the gravity of this situation. Nothing can be
dialog: misunderstood.
speaker_heading: ERINMORE (CONT'D)
dialog: If you don’t, it will be a
dialog: massacre. We would lose two
dialog: battalions. Sixteen hundred men,
dialog: your brother among them.
text: Schofield hides his shock. But Blake looks at Erinmore,
text: determination etched in his face: understood.
speaker_heading: ERINMORE (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you think you can get there in
dialog: time?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Yes, Sir.
speaker_heading: ERINMORE
dialog: Any questions?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: No, Sir.
text: Schofield eyes flick to Blake: No questions? Blake purposely
text: doesn’t catch Schofield’s eye.
speaker_heading: ERINMORE
dialog: Good. Over to you, Lieutenant.
text: The men salute Erinmore. Lieutenant Gordon, stands to one
dialog: side.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT GORDON
dialog: Supplies, Gentlemen.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
text: Lt. Gordon nods them over to a table. Various items are laid
text: out on it.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT GORDON (CONT'D)
text: Map, torches, grenades, and a
text: couple of little treats.
text: They look. A folded map, two electric torches, two grenades
text: and two small packs of Huntley and Palmer biscuits lie on the
text: table. They take them and start hastily putting them into
dialog: their webbing. While they do:
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT GORDON (CONT'D)
dialog: Leave immediately, take this trench
text: west, up on Sauchiehall Street,
dialog: then north west on Paradise Alley
text: at the front. Continue along the
dialog: front line until you find the
dialog: Yorks.
text: Gordon slides a note into Blake’s top pocket.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT GORDON (CONT'D)
dialog: Give this note to Major Stevenson.
text: He’s holding the line at the
dialog: shortest span of No Man’s Land.
dialog: You'll cross there.
text: Both men turn at the mention of No Man’s Land.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: It will be daylight, Sir. They’1l
dialog: see us.
speaker_heading: ERINMORE (0.C.)
dialog: No need to be concerned. You should
dialog: meet no resistance.
text: An Orderly hands them back their rifles.
text: Blake moves towards the doorway. Schofield turns to Erinmore.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Sir, is it just us?
text: Erinmore looks up.
speaker_heading: ERINMORE
dialog: “Down to Gehenna or up to the
dialog: Throne

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (5)
speaker_heading: ERINMORE (CONT'D)
dialog: He travels the fastest who travels
dialog: alone."
dialog: Wouldn't you say, Lieutenant?
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT GORDON
dialog: Yes, Sir. I would.
text: The General looks at them levelly.
speaker_heading: ERINMORE
dialog: Good luck.
text: Blake and Schofield turn and head through the door-
scene_heading: EXT. SECOND LINE TRENCH - CONTINUOUS
text: Schofield’s eyes wince in the daylight. A small curved branch
text: leads from the rear of the dugout back to the Second Line.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Blake - let’s talk about this for a
dialog: minute.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Why?
text: Blake is already off, moving fast.
text: Schofield moves after him, trying to fill and fasten his
text: webbing as he goes.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Blake!
text: Blake begins to move faster, setting a punishing pace. Boots
text: clattering over the wooden boards.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: We just need to think about it-
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: -There’s nothing to think about.
dialog: It’s my big brother.
text: Schofield runs to catch up, he falls in behind Blake,
text: breathing heavy.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: We should at least wait till it’s
dialog: dark-
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: The Second
dialog: cottages.
dialog: collect th
dialog: Schofield
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Erinmore said to leave immediately.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Erinmore’s never seen No Man's
dialog: Land. We won’t make it ten yards.
dialog: If we just wait-
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: You heard him. He said the Boche
dialog: have gone.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Is that why he gave us grenades?
text: line runs through a small row of derelict railway
text: Braziers have been lit, men mill around queueing to
dialog: eir rations.
text: and Blake push themselves to the edge of the trench
dialog: to get around the crush.
text: Blake is through and clear, but Schofield bumps into a
dialog: Sergeant.
dialog: Blake keep;
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Watch where you’re going!
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Sorry.
text: s pace, Schofield jogs to catch him.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: All I’m saying is that we wait.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Yes, you would say that, because
dialog: it’s not your brother, is it?
text: Schofield moves alongside Blake again, grabs his arm.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Look, the last time I was told the
dialog: Germans were gone, it didn’t end
dialog: well.
text: Blake shakes him off, and pushes his way forward, squeezing
dialog: in and out
text: of the lines of traffic - His shoulder and pack
text: battering against MEN as he passes them.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: You don’t know, Blake, you weren’t
dialog: there.
text: Ahead a group of men are bunched up collecting mail and
text: parcels from the post bag. Gumming up the trench.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Excuse me... Excuse me!
text: Blake and Schofield squeeze past them.
text: Another junction. A painted sign: “SAUCHIEHALL STREET” points
text: to a smaller branching comms line. Blake turns up it.
dialog: Schofield follows-
scene_heading: EXT. SAUCHIEHALL LINE (COMMS “DOWN” TRENCH)- CONTINUOUS
text: Much narrower. Blake pushes onwards, going against the
text: direction of the traffic. Schofield follows after him, single
text: file, increasingly frustrated. Soldiers buffet against them.
text: A Sergeant snarls at them.
scene_heading: SERGEANT MILLER
dialog: You're going up a down trench you
dialog: bloody idiots.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Orders of the General, Sir.
text: Schofield follows, catching the ire from the men Blake has
text: just passed. He checks his watch.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Alright, say the Boche have gone.
dialog: Nine miles will take us, what, six
dialog: hours? Eight at the very most. So
dialog: we've got time to wait until the
dialog: sun sets. Otherwise we'll be wide
dialog: open-
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: -It’s enemy territory, we’ve got no
dialog: idea what we’re walking into-
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: -Blake, if we're not clever about
dialog: this, no one will get to your
dialog: brother.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: I will.
text: Blake’s tone indicates that this is the end of the
dialog: conversation.
text: They are approaching a junction. They slow down. A flicker of
text: fear on both of their faces.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: We're here. This is the front line.
scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE (FRONT LINE) TRENCH —- CONTINUOUS
dialog: The Front Line.
text: A sign hangs on the junction wall: PARADISE ALLEY. Just
text: visible above the trench wall to the front is an endless line
dialog: of wire.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Now we need to find the Yorks.
text: There is an eeriness here, a sudden smothering silence.
text: Blake looks around. Trying to work out which way is North
dialog: West.
text: Blake heads in that direction, moving fast again. Schofield
text: follows alongside him.
text: The trench stretches away from them, in a long line.
text: Duckboards slick with mud mark out a path.
text: There are many men here, and many pairs of eyes watch from
text: the shadows of dugouts.
text: Crudely painted signs are strung up along the walls, dire
text: warnings. We catch glimpses as Blake and Schofield pass:
text: KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN IN DAYLIGHT! ENEMY SNIPERS AT PLAY!
text: They walk single file down the Front Line.
text: TWO STRETCHER BEARERS are heading towards them, A MAN carried
text: between them. Schofield drops back, looks down. The man is
text: unconscious, his face bandaged - two red bloodstains in place
text: of eyes.
text: Fear is rooting itself in Schofield. He fights it.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Schofield looks up, he’s briefly lost sight of Blake round
text: the next bend. He moves to catch up. He hears voices.
speaker_heading: PRIVATE STOKES (0.S.)
dialog: Here, watch who you’re shoving.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (0.S.)
dialog: Get out of the way then.
text: Schofield’s puts on speed, quickly pushes aside the soldier
text: in front of him.
text: He makes his way to Blake, three SOLDIERS have surrounded
text: him. One, PRIVATE STOKES - a large red-haired bruiser, with
text: tattoos on his forearms - is gripping Blake’s tunic. Blake
text: has him by the collar. Both are angry. Blake is on the verge
dialog: of tears.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Let go.
speaker_heading: PRIVATE STOKES
dialog: Fuck you think you are, pushing
dialog: wounded men around?
text: Schofield is quickly into the fray, putting himself in
text: between Blake and the Private.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Let go of me!
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Stop.
speaker_heading: PRIVATE STOKES
dialog: Arsehole knocked our Sergeant down,
dialog: the man’s fucking wounded-
text: Beside them an NCO with a sling on, is being helped out of
dialog: the mud.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Alright. I’m sorry, alright, I’m
dialog: sorry.
text: Blake struggles to get free, tears of frustration well in his
text: eyes. Schofield sees this, realises Blake is on the verge of
dialog: losing control.
text: The Private’s hand balls into a fist, his anger simmering.
text: Schofield gets between them.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: We’re on commission. Orders from
dialog: the General.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Let me through.
text: Stokes stops.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: (levelly)
dialog: Get out of the way.
speaker_heading: PRIVATE STOKES
dialog: Right. Just watch where you’re
dialog: going.
text: The other men move aside to give them a passage through.
text: They keep moving. Schofield is a step behind Blake, he steals
text: glances at him, concerned.
text: The two men walk on, the silence heavier. After a while -
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: It’s bloody quiet...
text: A beat. Blake looks at Schofield.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Was it like this before Thiepval?
text: The name does something to Schofield. Fear clings to him. He
text: pushes it away.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: I don’t remember.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: You don’t remember the Somme?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Well, you did alright out of it. At
dialog: least wear your ribbon.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Don’t have it anymore.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: They push on round the next bend.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: What? You lost your medal?
text: Before he can answer, the trench suddenly expands - the back
text: wall has been blown out into a large crater. Debris and
text: sandbags are strewn around. A small team of DIGGERS work on
text: it with picks and shovels, breaking up the earth, pulling out
text: body parts from the mud, putting them in empty sandbags.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Stay low.
text: Schofield climbs over the rubble and sandbags, crushing his
text: body to keep his head below the front parapet.
text: Blake follows. One of the diggers turns to Schofield, his
text: voice a harsh whisper.
speaker_heading: NCO HARVEY
dialog: God's sake. Careful there, you’re
text: stepping on the dead.
text: Schofield looks at the sandbag, 15 inches by 25. Red is
text: rusting through it.
speaker_heading: NCO HARVEY (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s our Sergeant -
text: Schofield quickly moves off the bag.
speaker_heading: NCO HARVEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Be better washing them out of this
text: dugout with a bloody hose.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Do you know where the Yorks are?
speaker_heading: NCO HARVEY
dialog: The next bend you’1l be standing on
dialog: top of half of them. Shot to hell
dialog: two nights ago.
text: Blake and Schofield continue. They slip round a bend and into
text: a small bay.
text: They stop by two men - one is burning the lice from his
text: clothes with a lighter Another, BUCHANAN, sits against the
text: back wall, a small dog on his lap.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )

text: Buchanan nods.
speaker_heading: PRIVATE BUCHANAN
dialog: Yes, Corp.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Where’s Major Stevenson?
speaker_heading: PRIVATE BUCHANAN
dialog: Killed a couple of nights ago,
dialog: Corporal. Lieutenant Leslie has
dialog: command.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Where can we find him?
text: Buchanan nods down the line.
speaker_heading: PRIVATE BUCHANAN
text: Next dug-out.
text: They round the bend and spot the dugout. It has been badly
text: shelled, but patched and re-built. A fire is lit in a brazier
text: just outside the door. Inside, a provisions bag and a few
text: other wooden items hang from a rafter, out of reach of the
dialog: rats.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Here.
text: LT. LESLIE is asleep on a small camp bed, his arm over his
text: eyes. A couple of ORDERLIES sit or lie nearby.
text: They approach the sleeping Leslie.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Sir?
text: He doesn’t stir. Blake speaks louder.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Lieutenant Leslie, Sir?
text: Leslie stirs a little, he doesn’t move his arm from his eyes.

dialog: We have a message from General
dialog: Erinmore.
text: Leslie looks up, his face shines with sweat, his voice is
text: croaky, full of flu, a little delirious.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT LESLIE
dialog: Are you our relief?
text: Schofield shakes his head.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: No, Sir.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT LESLIE
dialog: Then when the fucking hell are they
dialog: due?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: We don’t know, Sir. But we’ve got
dialog: orders to cross here.
text: Blake offers the letter.
text: Leslie sits up. Looks at them queerly.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT LESLIE
dialog: That is the German front line.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: We know, Sir. If you'll just take
dialog: the letter-
text: Blake hands over Erinmore’s letter. Leslie sighs, tears it
text: open and reads quickly.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT LESLIE
dialog: (as he reads)
dialog: Settle a bet, what day is it?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Friday.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT LESLIE
dialog: Friday. Well, well, well. None of

speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: (looking at Blake)
dialog: Do you think they’re wrong, Sir?
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT LESLIE
dialog: We lost an officer and three men
dialog: two nights ago. They were shot to
dialog: bits patching up wire. We dragged
dialog: two of them back here. Needn’t have
dialog: bothered.
text: Blake is determined to press on.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Sir, the General is sure the enemy
dialog: have withdrawn. There are aerials
dialog: of the new line-
text: Leslie gets to his feet.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT LESLIE
dialog: Shut up. We’ve fought and died over
dialog: every inch of this fucking place,
dialog: now they suddenly give us miles?
text: Schofield turns and stares at Blake.
text: Blake won’t meet his eye.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT LESLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s a trap.
text: Leslie leans in to Schofield.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT LESLIE (CONT'D)
text: But, chin up. There’s a medal in it
dialog: for sure. Nothing like a scrap of
text: ribbon to cheer up a widow.
text: Schofield stares at him like he would lift him out of his
text: boots with one punch.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT LESLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright.
text: Leslie walks out of the dugout. As he walks-

speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Where’s the nearest way through,
dialog: Sir?
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT LESLIE
dialog: Our wire’s a mess. But there is a
dialog: path through. Of sorts.
text: He leads them a few paces to a small dead-end lookout trench,
text: half earth, half corrugated steel. At the end of it isa
text: rudimentary periscope.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT LESLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (to the soldier)
dialog: Rushworth! Let him look.
text: The soldier manning it steps away to allow them to look.
text: Blake presses his eye to the lens.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT LESLIE (CONT'D)
text: Straight ahead, to the left, past
dialog: the dead horses-
text: Blake squints, moves the periscope. While Blake does this,
text: Leslie lights a cigarette, his hands shaking.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT LESLIE (CONT'D)
text: There’s a gap directly behind them.
dialog: Useful, because if it’s dark you
dialog: follow the stench. When you get to
dialog: the second wire, look out for the
text: bowing chap. There’s small break
text: just beside him.
text: As Blake scans the terrain with the periscope, Schofield
text: methodically prepares himself.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT LESLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: The German line is a hundred and
dialog: fifty odd yards after that. Watch
text: out for the craters. They’re deeper
dialog: than they look. You fall in,
dialog: there’s no getting out.
text: Leslie indicates for them to follow.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT LESLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: This way.

speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT LESLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Wake up, Kilgour.

dialog: Bloody waste of space.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Any cover, Sir? Anywhere to jump
dialog: off from?
text: Leslie leads them to a wide ladder leaning against the trench
dialog: wall.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT LESLIE
text: No. The sap trench was blown to
text: hell weeks ago. It’s full of bodies
dialog: anyway. Your best bet is to pop
dialog: over here.
text: Blake and Schofield stop by the ladder, ready themselves,
text: checking and loading their rifles, fixing their bayonets
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT LESLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: If you do get shot, try to make it
dialog: back to the wire. We won’t come
dialog: after you, not until it’s dark.
dialog: And, if by some fucking miracle you
dialog: do make it, send up a flare.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Don’t have any, Sir.
text: Leslie gestures impatiently to a nearby PRIVATE KILGOUR.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT LESLIE
dialog: Well get him one, Kilgour! Make
dialog: yourself useful.
scene_heading: PRIVATE KILGOUR
dialog: Yes, Sir.
text: Kilgour goes to fetch the flare gun, Leslie amuses himself:
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT LESLIE
dialog: (sprinkling whisky on the men)
dialog: “Through this holy unction may the
dialog: Lord pardon thee whatever sins or
dialog: faults thou hast committed”
text: Leslie laughs mirthlessly. Schofield and Blake try to stay
dialog: focused.
text: Kilgour hands Leslie a flare pistol and two cartridges.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (9)
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT LESLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I do hate losing these to the Hun.
dialog: So when they start shooting at you,
dialog: could you be so kind as to throw it
dialog: back, there’s a good chap.
text: Blake tucks the flare and cartridges into his pack.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT LESLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Cheerio.
text: Leslie steps back. A crowd of MEN have now gathered behind
text: him to watch Blake and Schofield, their faces a combination
text: of shock and fascination.
text: Blake and Schofield climb onto the firing step.
text: Schofield looks at Blake, speaks quietly to him.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: You sure?
text: Blake isn’t. But he nods.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Yes.
text: Blake goes to climb over. Schofield stops him.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Age before beauty.
text: Schofield takes a deep breath, and goes first. He puts one
text: hand over the parapet. Then the other.
text: Slowly he advances up, his head inching over the protection
text: of the trench. His hand is shaking, he drives it into the
text: mud, grasping for purchase.
text: Everyone is still, breathless, listening for the enemy to
dialog: fire.
text: Schofield drags his body up and over into -
scene_heading: EXT. NO MAN'S LAND - CONTINUOUS
text: Vast, almost unbearably open after the close quarters of the
dialog: trench.
text: A light mist hangs low over the land.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The ground is treacle-like. Schofield’s hands and knees sink
text: into it as he pulls himself forward, his eyes are trained
text: through the British wire towards the German lines.
text: The whole world is lunar and empty. Earth pounded to atoms,
text: all mounds and holes.
text: Nothing moves. Nothing lives.
text: The only sound is Blake’s breathing as he heaves himself out
text: of the trench beside Schofield.
text: Both men are still for a beat. Hunched down low on their
text: knees, two nocturnal animals caught in the daylight.
text: British wire runs in loops ahead of them, tangled and
text: haphazardly strung. A mess to navigate through.
text: They get to their feet and move forwards over the slick
text: earth, towards the putrid remains of the horses. Breathing
text: through their mouths, trying to deal with the stench.
text: A layer of black fur covers the animals, as Schofield and
text: Blake close in on them they see the fur is actually flies,
text: hundreds of them.
text: Schofield moves past the remains and through the first break
text: in the wire. The path is pocked with craters and puddles,
text: shrapnel litters everything.
text: Blake follows Schofield through the channel - ahead, on the
text: second wire, is “the bowing chap” - a GERMAN SOLDIER, dead,
text: bent double over the wire, one arm outstretched in a courtly
text: manner, as if bowing.
text: Schofield doesn’t linger on the dead German, doesn’t look at
text: his face. He focuses on the task at hand. To the side of the
text: man is a small gap in the razor wire, easy to miss without
text: the landmark. Schofield struggles to further pull apart the
text: dense tangle of wire. He indicates for Blake to pass through.
text: As he does so, Schofield slips in the mud. His hand
text: instinctively closes around the wire. It slices into his
text: palm, hooking into his flesh.
text: Bright red seeps along his hand, he wrenches it back, tearing
text: the skin to free himself. A heavy breath hisses out of him.
text: He balls his hand into a fist to stem the bleeding.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (0.C.)
dialog: You alright?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: Blake looks at him with concern. Schofield nods that he’s
dialog: fine.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Look for cover.
text: Everything after here is unnatural land. Craters are gouged
text: out of the earth. There is a rise and fall to this stretch,
dialog: but no flow or reason to it.
text: About a hundred yards from them, in the distance, is an
text: artificial horizon, something grey, mesh-like, stretching the
text: entire length of the land - The German Wire. Occasional dead
text: trees dot the land beyond.
text: Blake goes into the closest crater. He looks to Schofield,
text: some silent communication. Schofield’s eyes pull out a path
dialog: where there isn’t one.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD (CONT'D)
text: Sap trench.
text: Schofield goes first, crouching low, moving faster now,
text: picking his way towards a hole in the earth.
text: And then jumps directly into the old sap trench.
text: Blown out and neglected, it is now little more than a ditch,
text: but it offers a stretch of cover.
text: Schofield checks his wounded hand. It pulses blood. He feels
text: as if he is being watched. He looks around.
text: Next to him is the body of a German soldier; face down in the
text: mud, rats are on the corpse, feasting.
text: Blake jumps into the sap just next to Schofield. He lands
text: right next to A DEAD MAN, looking straight at them. He is
text: sitting up, his lips and eyes have been chewed off by rats.
text: White teeth grin in a pale face.
text: Blake reflexively scrambles back in horror, knocking into
text: Schofield. Schofield slips, reaches out to steady himself,
text: and grabs at the first thing he finds - the BODY OF THE
speaker_heading: GERMAN.
text: Schofield’s wounded hand lands on the man’s back and sinks -
dialog: right through.
text: Schofield’s cut hand goes into the putrid flesh.
text: Beside him, Blake is frozen. Panicking.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: Schofield gestures to him - ‘stay calm’. Blake tries to
dialog: steady himself.
text: They move further along the side of the sap trench. Schofield
text: peers out. About eighty yards now to the German wire.
text: They gather themselves. Schofield takes the lead. He pulls
text: himself out of the sap, Blake follows.
text: They move, crouched low. Watching. Waiting for guns to open
text: on them.
dialog: Silence.
text: The land is flatter here. There is an eerie feeling of
text: emptiness and silence. Schofield and Blake keep moving
text: forwards, trying to stay focused. Crouching to keep low.
text: The mud is like oil, but some things are solid underfoot.
text: Outlines of guns, shrapnel, unexploded shells, bodies.
text: Suddenly a loud sound approaching.
scene_heading: TWO PLANES.
text: Blake and Schofield both move quickly to the nearest shell-
text: hole. They throw themselves in and freeze. Keeping the brims
text: of their helmets low, hiding their faces from the planes
text: above. Blending in to the landscape around them.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: (Sotto)
dialog: Stay still.
text: The engines grow louder. The planes fly close overhead, and
text: then begin to recede into the distance.
text: Both men now turn their heads to look at them.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: (Sotto)
dialog: They’re ours.
text: Blake nods.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: (Sotto)
dialog: Keep going. We’re half way.
text: They move back out into the open expanse.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
text: Large shell holes appear on either side of them. They pick
text: their way through them, balancing carefully along the ridges.
text: They climb to the top of a small hillock and suddenly on the
text: other-side - vertigo. The ground falls away steeply in a mine
text: crater, stories deep.
text: They look down into it.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
text: There’s a gap in the wire.
text: We can see the base of the crater: The nearest line of German
text: wire has been split by the blast, and hangs limply down the
text: side wall of the crater, the other half of it disappears into
text: a huge pool of water at its base.
text: They meet each other’s gaze. An obvious way through the wire.
text: It’s clear they need to go down into the crater.
text: They slide carefully down the steep bank.
text: At the base of the crater the water is fathomless - the
text: colour of mucus, and the same consistency. A DEAD GERMAN
text: floats in it, bloated.
text: Blake follows in Schofield’s exact footsteps, walking around
text: the edge of the pool.
text: Blake looks into the pool. Things float in it. Bodies. The
text: pages of a letter, a cigarette tin, a water canteen.
text: Ahead of them, halfway up the far bank another line of German
text: wire - the main one - is suspended across the crater. There
text: is a gap beneath the wire.
text: They climb up the far bank towards the gap. Blake is
text: struggling.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Sco...
text: Schofield helps him up the slope.
text: The main German wire is a huge thicket of razor wire, denser
text: than a hedgerow. Using their hands, they dig into the muddy
text: sides of the crater, and pull themselves upwards, through the
dialog: German wire.
text: Schofield looks - close to him, caught on the wire, a small
text: clump of human hair blows in the breeze.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (5)
text: Hands and bayonets digging deep into the muddy bank, they
text: haul themselves out of the crater. Ahead of them is the
dialog: German Front Line.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: There! That’s the front line.
text: They lift their rifles and aim them towards the German line.
text: Blake moves first. He quickly approaches the German trench.
text: Schofield is next to him.
text: Both men suck in a breath and stand tall, leaning over the
text: German sandbags.
text: Their rifles sweep in unison down the length of the trench.
text: Empty. Schofield turns to Blake.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck me. They really have gone.
text: They look around in awe - this trench is massive,
text: fortified... and seemingly abandoned. Intermittent shell
text: holes have levelled large sections.
text: Blake and Schofield drop down into the trench.
scene_heading: EXT. GERMAN FRONT LINE TRENCH - CONTINUOUS
text: This trench is better crafted than the British trench. Deeper
text: and well reinforced, and eerily empty. They are alone.
text: To one side the trench is smashed in. A mountain of earth and
text: debris. Blocked.
text: Schofield crouches, attends to his bleeding hand. Blood oozes
text: out of it.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Your hand alright?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Put it through an effing German.
text: Schofield has taken out his canteen, he pours water on his
text: sliced up palm. Blake keeps watch.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Patch it up. You’ll be wanking
dialog: again in no time.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Wrong hand.
text: Blake laughs.
text: Blake moves off, rifle ready. Schofield follows, wrapping a
text: bandage round his hand as they move. He tightens the dressing
text: with his teeth. Red seeps through the white gauze.
text: Ahead of them is a brazier, full of spent white coal dust.
text: Blake kicks it over, the white dust crumbles, red embers glow
text: - wisps of smoke. Still smouldering.
text: Schofield turns to Blake, his eyes are on the embers too.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: They’re not long gone.
text: Blake hands tighten on his rifle, he pushes off, heading east
dialog: down-
scene_heading: EXT. GERMAN COMMS TRENCH - CONTINUOUS
text: Blake leads them into the deep, narrow trench. Creeping
text: forward quickly, eyes darting ahead, looking for any enemy.
text: The comms trench opens out into-
scene_heading: EXT. GERMAN SECOND LINE TRENCH - CONTINUOUS
text: Blake hovers by the mouth of the comms trench, peeking out.
text: Another dead end.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: No good.
text: Schofield is at his back. Their eyes scan the empty second
dialog: line trench.
text: They push on in silence.
text: Their footsteps click and echo over the duckboards. They
text: move, bayonets pointed forward.
text: The trench takes a sharp turn. Schofield and Blake inch
text: round, rifles up, checking.
text: Ahead of them the trench is destroyed. A direct hit. Earth,
text: sandbags, and huge splinters of timber jut out of the pile of
dialog: dirt.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Blocked.
text: It is impassable.
text: Next to them is the mouth of a dugout. A doorway.
text: Blake peers into the darkness.
text: Timber stairs descend two storeys down into the earth.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: This might be a way through.
text: They click on their torches and move down the stairs.
text: Whole tree trunks have been used to reinforce the walls. They
text: share a look. The sophistication of the Germans amazes them.
text: At the foot of the steps, Blake turns the corner.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus...
text: Schofield follows him quickly, the timber creaks under him as
text: he rounds into the mouth of-
scene_heading: INT. GERMAN DUGOUT - CONTINUOUS
text: He turns the corner and sees Blake, torch in hand.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Look at this. It’s massive.
text: The dugout is huge - an entire barracks carved out of the
text: chalky earth. It’s ghostly in the torch light.
text: Timber struts run along walls and ceilings. Rows of bunk beds
text: run along the length of the huge room, stacked up to the
dialog: ceiling.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: They built all this.
text: Blake and Schofield move through it, their torchlights
text: slicing through the darkness. It is palatial compared with
dialog: what we have seen on the British lines.
text: Schofield’s eyes land on something - a photograph, someone's
text: wife and child, pinned to a bed frame. Schofield stares at it
dialog: for a beat.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Blake noses through some of the detritus left behind by the
text: Germans, then moves through into:
text: The Officer’s Quarters: Iron bed frames, an arm chair, a
text: desk. In one corner are the remains of a cooking area, some
text: boxes of supplies lie abandoned.
text: Next to one of the beds a tunnel stretches away from him into
dialog: the darkness.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Here’s our way through.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (0.C.)
dialog: Sco - how about this?
text: Schofield turns to see Blake sitting on one of the officers’
text: beds, bouncing gently. The springs squeak loudly in the
text: silence, he grins. Then movement catches his eye. A massive
text: rat gnaws on a canvass sack suspended form the roof beams.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Bloody hell... Even their rats are
dialog: bigger than ours.
text: By the light of their torches, they can see a large, bloated
text: rat moving quickly along one of the roof beams.
text: Their torches follow the rat, as it scampers along the beam.
text: The light catches more canvas sacks, all suspended from a the
text: ceiling. Grease is pooling at the base of them, turning them
text: translucent - bags of food, or at least an approximation of
text: it. Other frayed and empty canvas sacks lie around.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you think’s in the bags?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: You cannot be that hungry.
text: Blake thinks for a beat.
text: The rat makes a leap for one, dropping from the rafter to the
text: canvas. The bag swings violently under the rat’s weight, a
text: pendulum in the middle of the room.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Look at him. Cocky little bastard.
text: Something has caught Schofield’s eye. A crate full of food
text: tins has been left in the corner. Schofield walks over and
dialog: grabs one.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: You could eat this, though.
text: He turns to read the writing in Blake’s torch light:
dialog: “Fleischkonserve”
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: What is it?
text: Schofield tosses a tin across the room to him. Blake catches
text: it, reads the label.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Boche dog meat.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: What’s in the other boxes?
text: Schofield goes for the other crate... and freezes.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Trip wire.
text: Blake stands stock still.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t move.
text: The two men are frozen.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Where is it?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Goes from here to the door.
text: Blake’s breath quickens as he scans the room, trying to pick
text: out the wire in the torchlight... The door is about ten feet
dialog: away.
dialog: Suddenly -
speaker_heading: BAM!
text: Both men jump - The rat and the canvas bag are on the floor.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Jesus!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )

speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: No...no! —-
text: Blake's eyes go wide, he starts forward for the rat-
text: The rat lets go of the bag and flees - into the wire. A flash
text: of blinding light then almost simultaneously-
speaker_heading: BOOM!
text: Impossibly loud. The blast is reflected back in off the solid
text: walls, a section of roof drops. Dirt and chalk dust blast
dialog: outward.
text: Blake is flung backwards against the wall with a thud.
text: White chalk dust swirls in the room, bright in the
text: torchlight. Blake’s torch lands on the floor, beam pointing
text: upwards at the ceiling.
text: For a second there is silence.
text: Blake begins to pant. The wind is knocked out of him. He
text: catches his breath.
text: He feels his head, reaches for his torch. His eyes scan the
dialog: room.
text: His torchlight slices through the dust and smoke. The world
text: has been turned over. Some parts are buried. And where
text: Schofield was standing - a pile of rubble.
text: Panic streaks across his face.
text: Then there is a sound. Muffled, from deep in the white dirt.
text: Screaming.
text: Schofield is buried.
text: Blake is on his feet, staggering towards the mound of chalk
text: and dust. Moving over it, ears to the dirt, listening.
text: Schofield’s screams slip through it.
text: Blake frantically begins to dig.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Sco?!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)

speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: sco!
text: The screams are getting weaker. Disappearing beneath the
text: sounds of the timber creaking and groaning.
text: Blake swims through the earth, sweeping it away-
text: Schofield’s screams stop.
text: Blake thrashes in the chalk - at last unearths -
text: Lips. Schofield’s mouth, wide open, filled with pale grey
text: dirt. Still.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: sco! sco!
text: Blake tears the chalk away from his mouth and nose and
text: suddenly Schofield heaves into life, retches, coughing up
text: dirt, sawing in breaths.
text: Blake uncovers Schofield’s face, his eyes are packed with
text: dirt and chalk. Blake keeps digging, frees Schofield’s arm,
text: chest. Schofield thrashes in the debris, trying to free
text: himself. He can’t. It’s too tightly packed.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Sco! Wake up! Wake up! Sco!
text: Blake grabs at Schofield’s arm and with all his might
text: wrenches him out of the dirt.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Sco... Stand up! Stand up! Up! UP!
text: Schofield is in shock - numb. Caked in the pale white earth.
text: His heaves and retches fill the tiny space. His body shaking
text: and contorting with shock.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: STAND UP!
text: The timber is groaning all around them now. Blake looks up at
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (5)

text: towards the tunnel entrance, sucked out by the backdraft.
text: Their way out.

speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: You keep hold of me!
scene_heading: INT. GERMAN TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
text: Carved through the chalk bedrock. Seven feet high and

text: The earth around them groans, silt and dust piss from the
dialog: ceiling.
text: Schofield coughs and convulses, grasping on to Blake, towed

speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: We need to keep moving. Come on!
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: I can’t see - I can’t see!

speaker_heading: BLAKE

speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: You're going to have to jump! Just
dialog: jump.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: I can’t- I can’t see!
text: Blake wheels around and shines his light on Schofield.
text: Schofield’s eyes stream with tears and debris, he’s
text: paralyzed, blinded.
text: Between them is nothing but a gaping hole in the floor,
text: fathomless blackness.
text: The walls around them groan under the strain. The place is
text: coming down.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: You need to trust me. Jump!
text: Schofield tears in a breath then leaps forwards towards
dialog: Blake.
text: Schofield takes off, jumps across the hole and lands hard.
text: His back foot slips down the side of the mineshaft, but Blake
text: grabs him, and heaves him up.
text: Blake pushes forward, Schofield clings to him.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t let go of me! Don’t let go!
text: The sound of earth collapsing suddenly fills the tunnel. The
text: dugout behind them has collapsed in.
text: Ahead there is a fork in the tunnel. Blake spots something to
text: his right - a blue haze.
text: Daylight.
text: He pulls Schofield towards it.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Light! There’s light!
text: They scramble forwards. Light begins to flood the passage
text: way. They reach the end of the tunnel and stumble out into
dialog: the light.
dialog: 37.
scene_heading: EXT. REAR GERMAN TRENCHES - CONTINUOUS
text: Blake scrambles down a small incline, scanning for enemy.
text: They are in a large sunken ditch.
text: Schofield stands, bent double, at the mouth of the tunnel,
text: trying to catch his breath. Both of them are covered with
text: chalk dust. They look like pale ghosts.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Stop... stop. Just...just let me
dialog: stand.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Dirty bastards.
text: Schofield gathers himself and drops down beside Blake.
text: Blake pushes on, climbing up a small rise, rifle ready.
text: Schofield goes after him, shakily.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Careful, they may have left other
dialog: traps.
text: Blake crests the small berm and looks.
text: Curving away from him - a quarry. A huge desolate
text: amphitheatre.
text: The quarry is several storeys high. Holes and entrances are
text: carved all over it, like rabbit warrens.
text: Scattered around is the detritus of war. Several huge German
text: guns and some small artillery lie damaged and abandoned.
text: Small mountains of brass - thousands of spent shell casings.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus.
text: Blake sweeps his rifle around, searching for any threat. This
text: place is abandoned.
text: Schofield makes it to the top of the berm, and drops down to
text: the ground, trying to clean out his eyes.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Dust... so much dust in my eyes.
text: He empties the remaining water from his canteen onto his
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Blake approaches Schofield, hands him his canteen. Schofield
text: washes the chalk off of his face.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Here. Have some of mine.
text: Blake crouches beside him. He watches him, concerned.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: I wish I’d shot that rat now.
text: Schofield turns on him, sharp.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: And I wish you'd picked some other
dialog: bloody idiot.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Why in God’s name did you have to
dialog: choose me?
text: Schofield checks his pockets - takes out small tobacco tin.
text: Checks inside it. His hands are shaking badly.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: I didn’t know what I was picking
dialog: you for.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: No, you didn’t. You never know.
dialog: That’s your problem.
text: Blake is stung.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Alright then, go back. Nothing’s
dialog: stopping you. You can go all the
dialog: way bloody home if you want.
text: At the mention of home Schofield turns on him sharply.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Don’t.
text: A beat. Schofield puts the tobacco tin back in his pocket.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: (calmer now)
dialog: Look, I didn’t know what I was
dialog: picking you for. I thought they
dialog: were going to send us back up the
dialog: line, or for food, or something. I
dialog: thought it was going to be
dialog: something easy, alright? I never
dialog: thought it would be this.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: So do you want to go back?
text: Schofield looks at him, softening.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Just fire the fucking flare.
text: He loads and lifts the flare, and looks back towards the
dialog: British lines.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Up yours, Lieutenant...
text: He fires it straight up. The light streaks through the sky.
text: He watches it drop.
text: Blake tosses the flare gun, lowers his hand to Schofield and
text: helps him up.
text: Schofield stands unsteadily. Blake studies his compass,
text: getting his bearing.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Do you know where we are?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Ecoust is directly south east. If
dialog: we keep that bearing, we should
dialog: make it.
text: He looks in the direction Blake is facing - the land rolls
text: gently down, a trampled road leads out of the quarry, a
text: shattered copse of trees juts out of the earth. Charred and
dialog: black.
text: Schofield nods. Blake stows the compass. Raises his rifle.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on then.
text: They begin to walk.
text: Blankets, ammunition, guns, bayonets, shells. All have been
text: abandoned in this place. They pass the remains of artillery -
text: the gun barrels have been blown out.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at that. They destroyed their
dialog: own guns...
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: They destroyed their own trenches
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: I think they wanted us to go that
dialog: way. They wanted to bury us.
dialog: They walk.
text: A noise startles them both. They turn to the source, ready to
dialog: fire -
text: A large rat scuttles over A DEAD GERMAN. Blake kicks a rock
text: at it. It scatters.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Bastard rats.
text: Blake looks across at Schofield. He is still shaking
dialog: slightly.
text: They walk, watchful. Eventually:
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey - did you hear that story about
dialog: Wilko? How he lost his ear?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: I’m not in the mood. Keep your eyes
text: on the trees, top of the ridge.
text: Blake watches the top of the slope. They walk.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Bet he told you it was shrapnel.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: Beat.
dialog: 41.
dialog: (4)
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: What was it then?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Well, you know his girl’s a
dialog: hairdresser, right? And he was
dialog: moaning about the lack of bathing
dialog: facilities when he wrote to her -
dialog: remember those rancid jakes at
dialog: Arras?
dialog: Schofield nods - they were disgusting.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyway, she sends him over this
text: ‘hair oil’. Smells sweet, like
dialog: Golden Syrup. Wilko loves the
dialog: smell, but he doesn’t want to cart
dialog: it around in his pack, so-
dialog: They continue into the-
scene_heading: EXT. SHATTERED COPSE - CONTINUOUS
dialog: They tread
text: carefully over the battered earth. It’s littered
text: with casings and flecks of metal.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
text: He slathers it all over his barnet,
text: goes to sleep and in the middle of
text: the night he wakes up, and a rat is
text: sitting on his shoulder licking the
dialog: oil off of his head!
text: Schofield begins to laugh, despite himself.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
text: Wilko panics and he jumps up and
text: when he does - the rat bites clean
text: through his fucking ear and runs
dialog: off with it!
text: They are both laughing quietly.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, he made a hell of a fuss,
text: yelling, screaming.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The ground sweeps gently downward out of the burnt copse.
text: Living things return to the world in small patches.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Best of it was he put so much
dialog: bloody oil on himself that he
dialog: couldn’t wash it off! He was like a
dialog: Magnet. Rats left us alone, but
dialog: they couldn’t get enough of him.
dialog: Poor bastard.
text: They emerge from the copse, scanning the surroundings. They
text: appear to be alone.
text: Above, far in the distance, the same two British planes seem
text: to hover in the sky, arcing back towards British lines.
text: Schofield looks up at them.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
text: Heading back home.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I wonder what they saw...
text: Schofield pulls his eyes away from the planes. The two men
text: briefly scan the land around them.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Watch the ridge lines.
text: They move off again. Blake’s eyes stick to the left,
text: Schofield’s scan the right. After a beat.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Well that’s your medal sorted then.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: What do you mean?
text: They continue walking.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: “Lance Corporal Blake showed
dialog: unusual valour in rescuing a
dialog: comrade from certain death” blah,

speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: You reckon?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)

speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Well, that’d be nice. Since you
dialog: lost yours.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: I didn’t lose mine.
text: Schofield keeps walking.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: What happened to it, then?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Why do you care?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Why do you not?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: I swapped it with a French captain.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Swapped it? For what?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Bottle of wine.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: What did you do that for?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: I was thirsty.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: What a waste.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You should have taken it home with
dialog: you, you should have given it to

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: If I got a medal, I'd take it back
dialog: home, why didn’t you just take it
dialog: home-
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Look it’s just a bit of bloody tin!
dialog: It doesn’t make you special, it
dialog: doesn’t make any difference to
dialog: anyone.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Yes it does.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: And it’s not just a bit of tin.
dialog: (then)
dialog: It’s got a ribbon on it.
text: Schofield laughs, exasperated.
text: Then he turns to Blake, looks at him.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: I hated going home. I hated it.
dialog: When I knew I couldn’t stay. When I
dialog: knew I had to leave them, and they
dialog: might never see me-
text: He chokes up. Fights with himself for a moment. Then he turns
text: and walks ahead.
text: Blake watches him, feeling guilty. Then he follows.
text: Up ahead, Schofield is approaching the remains of a walled
text: orchard. He stops at the gate.
scene_heading: EXT. WALLED ORCHARD - CONTINUOUS
text: The near wall has partially collapsed in a mound of rubble.
text: Beyond it cherry trees litter the ground. All have been cut
text: down, felled in the wanton destruction of the German retreat.
text: Pale blossoms swim all around, ruffled by the wind.
text: Schofield looks at it all.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Jesus. They chopped them all down.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Blake has followed him, a little guiltily. Wanting to
text: apologise, but unsure how. He takes in the orchard.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Cherries.
text: Blake looks at one of the trees. He reaches down, picks a
text: blossom, holds it up.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Lamberts.
text: They begin to walk through the felled trees.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: They might be Dukes, hard to tell
dialog: when they aren’t in fruit.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: What’s the difference?
text: Blake is a little wry, sensing Schofield softening.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Well people think there’s one type,
dialog: but there’s lots of them -
dialog: Cuthberts, Queen Annes,
dialog: Montmorencys. Sweet ones, sour
dialog: ones...
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Why on earth would you know this?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Mum’s got an orchard, back home.
text: Only a few trees. This time of year
text: it looks like it’s been snowing,
text: blossom everywhere. And then in
dialog: May, we have to pick them. Me and
dialog: Joe. Takes the whole day.
text: A pang of homesickness creeps into Blake as he and Schofield
text: clamber over a downed tree. They are now alongside each
dialog: other.
text: Schofield registers this.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: So, these ones all gonners?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Oh no, they’1l grow again when the
dialog: stones rot. You’1ll end up with more
dialog: trees than before.
text: A large wall borders the lower end of the orchard, still
text: intact. Schofield arrives at the gate.
text: Ahead of them, visible through the gate is a small valley. In
text: the valley lie the remains of a French farmhouse, abandoned.
text: It is utterly derelict now - the roof is just a skeleton of
text: beams. Next to it is a clapboard barn, ragged with shell
dialog: holes.
text: Schofield and Blake peer through the gate at the small
text: collection of buildings below. Everything is still.
text: Schofield looks anxiously at the farmhouse.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
text: It looks abandoned.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Let’s hope so.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: We have to make sure.
text: Schofield leads the way, he moves through the gate
text: cautiously, rifle raised. Blake follows.
text: They slip down the hill. They are in an old pigsty,
text: surrounded by a broken fence, which runs down to the murky
text: water of a pond.
text: Carefully, as he walks, Schofield scans the buildings ahead.
text: The wind rustles the long grass. An ominous atmosphere
text: pervades this place.
text: They approach the farmhouse.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: I’ll take front, you take back.
text: They split. Blake disappears round the back, Schofield moves
text: towards the front door.
text: A DEAD DOG lies by the path.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: Schofield looks at it for a beat. His hands tighten on his
text: rifle, as he braces himself for what might be inside.
text: Schofield quickly walks up the small front path, through the
text: open door.
scene_heading: INT. FRENCH FARMHOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: He is still for a moment on the threshold, breath held,
text: listening for any sounds of life in the house.
text: The silence burns.
text: Schofield enters. The only sounds now are the floor boards
text: creaking under his boots.
text: This place has been trashed by the soldiers who were here.
text: Schofield turns right into -
scene_heading: INT. FRENCH FARMHOUSE, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Schofield moves through the bedroom. Empty. He moves back
dialog: into-
scene_heading: INT. FRENCH FARMHOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Schofield crosses the hallway. He spots Blake through the
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Anything?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Nothing.
text: Schofield moves forward towards the kitchen. Something
text: catches his eye.
text: A child’s doll sits on the floor. Cigarette burns on its
dialog: eyes.
text: Schofield looks at it for a beat. Then moves into the
dialog: kitchen.
dialog: 48.
scene_heading: INT. FRENCH FARMHOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Low, dusty light streaks in from the smashed windows.
text: Schofield takes in the room. Blake enters through the back
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Did you find any food?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: No.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don’t like this place.
text: He moves out through the back door-
scene_heading: EXT. REAR FRENCH FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Schofield moves across the barren yard to a dilapidated barn.
scene_heading: INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS
text: Remnants and debris are scattered around.
text: The low sounds of a cow echo from the fields beyond.
text: Schofield looks - a single COW stands in the field. Two or
text: three other dead cows lie near it.
text: Schofield turns, scanning the barn floor. He peers into a
text: milk urn, it’s empty.
text: Close by there is a bucket, lid half on.
text: He tips the lid off with his foot -
dialog: Milk.
text: He kneels and smells it, then lowers in a hand and lifts some
text: to his mouth. It’s been months since he tasted anything as
dialog: good.
text: Behind him, Blake exits the farmhouse.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Map says we get over that ridge and
text: it’s a straight shot to Ecoust.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 49,
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He takes out his empty canteen and pours milk into it, fills
text: it to the brim.
text: The huge door at back of the barn is open to the fields.
text: The drone of plane engines through the doorway catches
text: Schofield’s attention.
text: Schofield spots planes through the barn door. He moves
text: towards them to get a better look. Entranced.
text: He moves outside to watch.
scene_heading: EXT. REAR FRENCH FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Schofield wanders out away from the barn. He looks up into
text: the grey sky.
text: Three planes - a dogfight. Tiny at this distance, insect-
dialog: like.
text: Schofield’s eyes follow them keenly: Two British fighters
dialog: against one German.
text: The violence is so far removed from him that it looks
text: balletic. Beautiful even. He moves towards them to get a
dialog: better look.
text: The planes twist and circle in the air, engines droning and
text: whining as the planes dip and rise.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (0.S.)
dialog: Is that our friends again?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
text: Looks like it. Dogfight.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Who's winning?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Us, I think. Two on one.
text: The two of them stand looking up at the majesty of it.
text: Then, in the distance, the German plane begins to trail black
dialog: smoke.
text: The hum of the German engine fails. The two British planes
text: follow it, hammering away on their guns until it is clear
dialog: that there is no hope for the German.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: They got him...
text: The German plane coasts silently towards the earth.
text: Blake and Schofield watch as it gets closer and closer.
text: Hypnotised.
text: From the bend of wings you can tell the PILOT is trying to
text: glide. Trying and failing.
text: The plane drops like a leaf, catching updrafts only to
text: suddenly dip again - aiming for the fields some distance
text: ahead of them.
text: The plane dips. Wobbles. Fighting to stay up. It banks left,
text: and drops below the horizon.
text: Schofield walks forwards to have a better look. Then
text: suddenly, the plane reappears over the horizon, flying very
text: low. It is heading straight at them.
text: Schofield realises they are in the path of the plane. He
text: begins backing away, retreating towards the house.
text: The plane is much closer now, behind them as they run. They
text: can’t make it back to the house.
text: Schofield and Blake throw themselves down on the ground,
text: pressing themselves into the earth as the plane screams in
text: their direction, smashing into the barn directly behind them.
text: Black smoke pours from the plane and the shattered skeleton
text: of the barn.
text: The fire is quick, licking along the old wood.
scene_heading: INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS
text: Smoke billows from the plane. Inside it someone is screaming.
text: Blake moves first, he runs into the barn, Schofield tailing
dialog: him.
text: Tongues of fire whip out from the engine, the pilot is
text: inside. Burning.
text: Flames lick at his mangled legs and torso, his gloved hands
text: cover his face.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Blake grabs at the man, the back of his hand touches the yoke
text: as he tries to free the pilot - he cries out as the metal
text: sears his skin.

text: The Pilot’s legs are on fire.
speaker_heading: PILOT PILOT

text: true extent of his injuries laid bare in the daylight.
text: The flames have done bad damage. His trousers have been

text: The Pilot’s blue eyes dart at them, in agony. He shivers

speaker_heading: BLAKE

dialog: Creak- creak-

speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Stop...Stop!

text: A bloody knife in the pilot’s hand, pulled out of Blake’s
dialog: abdomen.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: No, no, no!

speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, God no. Oh, God no.

speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus. Jesus, no.

speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD

text: Blake is suddenly wild, he screams like an animal, flailing
text: savagely, clawing at Schofield’s chest and neck, spitting
text: blood, struggling against him.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Put me down! Put me down, you
dialog: bastard, please! Put me down!
text: They fall backwards.
text: Schofield moves to face Blake.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
text: Blake’s whole face is colourless now.
text: Schofield looks down. His eyes land on Blake’s dressing. It
text: is scarlet now, sopping wet with blood. He swaps it for a
text: fresh dressing. Panic swarms him.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: You have to try to keep moving.
text: Blake is weakening.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Let’s just sit... let me sit.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: We can’t. We have to find the 2nd.
dialog: Remember? Your brother. We have to
dialog: go now...
text: Schofield stares down at Blake, he’s not lucid anymore. His
text: eyes are already glazing.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: You can start on without me. I’1l1
dialog: catch up.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: You can’t stay here. We have to
dialog: move, alright? We have to move.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on. Come on. That’s it. Come
dialog: on, come on...
text: Schofield wraps one arm around Blake’s back, the other round
text: his legs, he gets to his feet and with all his might he
text: heaves Blake upward. Blake howls in pain.
text: Schofield screams with the effort, giving it all he’s got.
text: But Blake is a dead weight. He can’t lift him.
text: They drop. Schofield looks at him, desperate.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: Your brother. We have to find your
dialog: brother.
text: Blake’s breathing is coming in short bursts.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (5)
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: You'll recognise him. Looks like
dialog: me...a bit older.
text: Schofield holds Blake’s head up. He looks impotently around
dialog: for help.
text: Behind them the barn is crumbling in on itself, scarlet
text: embers drift across the sky, carried on the breeze. Blake
text: stares up at them, confused.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: What are they? Are we being
dialog: shelled?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
text: They're embers, the barn is on
dialog: fire.
text: Blake looks bewildered. Then some pain creeps into his eyes,
dialog: some awful knowledge.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: I've been hit... What was it?
text: Schofield looks down at him, unsure how to answer.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: You were stabbed.
text: Blake looks surprised. His hand feels dumbly for his wound.
text: It lands on Schofield’s - he’s holding down the tunic,
text: stemming what blood he can.
text: There is blood on Blake’s lips. His breathing is becoming
dialog: laboured.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Am I dying?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Yes, I think you are.
text: An “Oh” forms on Blake’s lips. Profound sadness follows the
dialog: shock.
text: Blake reaches up slowly, and taps his tunic pocket, Schofield
text: guesses his meaning - goes to the pocket, pulls out a wallet.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (6)
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: This?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Inside...
text: Schofield opens the cover, inside are a bunch of letters, and
text: a photograph - Blake, his mother, and his brother Joe.
text: Schofield holds it up for Blake to see: yes, that's what I
dialog: want.
text: Schofield puts the photograph in Blake’s hand, he presses it
text: to his breast.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Will you write to my mum for me?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: I will.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Tell her I wasn’t scared.
text: Schofield nods.
text: A long beat. Schofield lets go of the pressure on Blake’s
text: wound. He holds his hand.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Anything else?
text: Blake is slipping away, tears well and roll down his cheeks.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: I love them...I wish that...
dialog: I wish...
text: It’s half strangled by sadness. A long beat. Schofield holds
text: him. Death is close, stiffening Blake’s body, it’s already in
text: his eyes.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Talk to me.
text: Schofield looks at Blake, he has no idea what to say.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell me you know the way.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: I know the way. I’m going to head
dialog: south east until I hit Ecoust.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (7)
text: Blake listens.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ll pass through the town and out
dialog: to the east, all the way to
dialog: Croisilles Wood.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: (faint)
dialog: It‘ll be dark by then.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: That won’t bother me... I'll find
dialog: the 2nd, I'll give them the
dialog: message, and then I’1ll find your
dialog: brother. Just like you, a little
dialog: older...
text: He stops. Blake is no longer breathing.
text: Without the lines of worry or agony on his face Blake looks
text: very young.
text: Schofield is still for a moment, cradling the head of Blake.
text: A long beat. Behind Schofield the barn is collapsing in on
dialog: itself.
text: The smoke has risen several stories into the sky.
text: Schofield looks at Blake. Desperate.
text: Then, he snaps out of it. With sudden determination, he
text: rummages through the pockets of Blake’s tunic - takes the
text: message for the 2nd, blood from his hands smudges on the
dialog: envelope.
text: He stows it safely in his top pocket. He pulls out the map
text: from Blake’s tunic. It is saturated in blood. Illegible.
text: Schofield throws it away.
text: He takes Blake’s rings from his lifeless hands, then opens
text: his tunic and goes for Blake’s identity disc, tearing it off
dialog: of the twine.
text: He pries the photograph from Blake’s dead hand, looks at it,
text: then leaves it face down over his heart, inside his tunic.
text: Schofield looks around them, beside the pond is a patch of
dialog: long grass.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (8)
text: Schofield heaves Blake’s torso up - the endeavour entirely
text: different now Blake is dead.
dialog: Nothing is heavier than the dead body of someone you loved.
speaker_heading: PRIVATE PARRY (0.S.)
dialog: You alright, mate?
text: Schofield looks up, shocked to see TWO BRITISH PRIVATES —
scene_heading: PARRY and ATKINS.
speaker_heading: PRIVATE ATKINS
dialog: It’s alright, it’s okay.
speaker_heading: PRIVATE PARRY
dialog: Come on, help him.
text: Parry and Atkins move forward and take Blake’s legs. Together
text: the three of them move Blake to the long grass. As they move
dialog: him:
speaker_heading: PRIVATE ATKINS
dialog: Jesus, what happened to him?
text: Schofield doesn’t answer.
speaker_heading: PRIVATE PARRY
dialog: Was it the plane? We saw the smoke.
text: Schofield nods.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Yes.
text: They lower Blake down. Schofield kneels by his head. Lost.
text: A gentle voice, off camera.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SMITH (0.S.)
dialog: Go fetch his things.
scene_heading: PRIVATE PARRY PRIVATE ATKINS
dialog: Sir. Yes, Sir.
text: Parry and Atkins go to collect Schofield’s helmet and rifle.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SMITH
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: A friend?
text: Schofield nods. He kneels beside Blake’s body. Impotent.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (9)
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: I have an urgent message for the
dialog: 2nd Devons. Orders to stop tomorrow
text: morning’s attack.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SMITH
dialog: Where are they stationed?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
text: Just beyond Ecoust.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SMITH
dialog: Come with me.
text: Smith heads back towards the farmhouse. Schofield doesn’t
text: move. He can’t look away from Blake.
text: Smith stops, turns back.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: Come with me, Corporal. That’s an
dialog: order.
text: Schofield looks up at him.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: We're passing through Ecoust. We
dialog: can take you some of the way.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Sir.
text: Using the grass, he wipes Blake’s blood from off his hands.
text: He stands, drags his eyes away from Blake’s body and then
text: moves after Smith.
text: He collects his rifle and helmet from Parry then follows
text: Smith through the farmhouse and back out into-
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - CONTINUOUS
text: A small convoy of four trucks idle on the road, all caked in
text: mud and battered from their journey. Soldiers mill, smoking,
text: pissing, stretching their legs.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: At the head of the small convoy is an Officer’s car. Exhaust

speaker_heading: COLONEL COLLINS (0.S.)
dialog: Oh, come on Sergeant. Put more men
dialog: at the base. At the trunk! It’1l be
dialog: heavier there...
text: The trucks are filled to the brim with SOLDIERS - a mixture
text: of seasoned fighters and fresh recruits. All are covered in
text: the mud of No Man’s Land.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SMITH
dialog: Might be a tight squeeze.
text: They move towards the Officer’s car. Mud hardens on the
text: undercarriage and the wheel arches.
speaker_heading: COLONEL COLLINS
dialog: No. You’re not going to be able to
dialog: just lift it. Pivot the front end
dialog: to the left-
text: At the front of the convoy a large tree trunk blocks the
text: road, like the cherry blossoms, felled on purpose, trunk
text: neatly chopped. Several PRIVATES and an NCO are gathered
text: around trying to lift it.
text: A Colonel, COLLINS (corpulent, sweating) barks orders from
text: the front seat of the car.
text: Smith and Schofield approach the car.
speaker_heading: COLONEL COLLINS (CONT'D)
dialog: (to the driver)
dialog: Jesus. They don’t make things easy
dialog: do they. They could at least have
text: retreated with a bit of grace.
dialog: Bastards.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SMITH
dialog: Sir-
text: Collins turns and looks down on Smith and Schofield, his face
text: registering confusion.
speaker_heading: COLONEL COLLINS
dialog: (registering Schofield)
dialog: You're not one of mine.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: No, Sir.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: Collins looks at Smith for explanation.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SMITH
dialog: He’s got an urgent message to
dialog: deliver to the 2nd Devons, Sir.
text: Collins’ attention is drawn back to the tree, the men have
text: managed to shift it a few feet to the left.
speaker_heading: COLONEL COLLINS
dialog: (To the driver)
dialog: Can you get past it?
speaker_heading: SERGEANT HARROP (0.S.)
dialog: No, Sir.
speaker_heading: COLONEL COLLINS
dialog: Oh, for God’s sake.
dialog: (Loudly, to the men)
dialog: Just move it!
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SMITH
dialog: There’s room in the casuals truck,
dialog: sir. He has orders-
speaker_heading: COLONEL COLLINS
dialog: Yes, yes, alright.
dialog: (to Harrop)
dialog: Come on now. You can get through
dialog: there sideways.
text: The car begins to roll forward.
text: Smith moves off, as the Colonel’s car begins to manoeuvre its
text: way around the felled tree.
text: Smith and Schofield walk past the row of trucks, all packed
text: with soldiers. Schofield takes it in.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: How did you get here, Sir?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SMITH
dialog: Crossed No Man’s Land just outside
dialog: Bapaume. Took us the whole night.
text: Bumped into a couple of Hun

dialog: nuisance of themselves.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SMITH

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry about your friend.
text: Schofield nods.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: May I tell you something that you
dialog: probably already know?
text: They stop. Schofield looks to him.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: It doesn’t do to dwell on it.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: No, Sir.
text: They have reached the rear of the fourth and final truck. TWO

text: to attention when the see the Captain.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SMITH
dialog: (to Schofield)
dialog: Hop on.
text: Smith speaks to the soldiers.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: Make some space there... Come on,
dialog: in you get!
text: A bit of grumbling as the soldiers try to make space for him.
text: A couple of the men help him up and into-
scene_heading: INT. ARMY TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
text: Twenty men, an amalgamation of companies - some SCOTS, some
text: SIKHS, are crammed in here. Schofield makes space for himself
text: on the fringe. The men don’t look at Schofield, don’t much
dialog: care about the hitch-hiker.
text: They are quiet for a beat, until Smith’s footsteps die away
text: and the sound of the engine rumbles.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: PRIVATE COOKE

speaker_heading: PRIVATE ROSSI
dialog: Welcome aboard the night bus to

speaker_heading: PRIVATE COOKE
dialog: Is that a dead dog?

speaker_heading: PRIVATE BUTLER
dialog: (To Rossi)
dialog: You got a fag?
text: Rossi hands one over.
speaker_heading: PRIVATE ROSSI
dialog: Yeah, there you go.

speaker_heading: PRIVATE COOKE

speaker_heading: PRIVATE BUTLER
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Oh yeah, Right. So. When we get off
dialog: the train, Beaufoy comes up to us
dialog: and he’s having a right go -
dialog: (He attempts a posh
dialog: accent, complete with
dialog: lisp)
dialog: “Lance Corporal! Whatever one does,
dialog: one never lets standards slip!”
text: Then Scott comes out of the

speaker_heading: PRIVATE BUTLER
dialog: Oh, piss off you. You can’t do any
dialog: better.
text: Schofield pulls his bloody tunic tight around himself,
text: watches. He almost disappears into the noise of the men.
speaker_heading: PRIVATE COOKE
dialog: (Impersonating the lisp)
dialog: “MEN! Your rifle stocks are an
dialog: embarrassment to the entire
dialog: expeditionary force.”
speaker_heading: SEPOY JONDALAR
dialog: You're both bloody awful.
speaker_heading: PRIVATE COOKE
dialog: You don’t know, you barely even

speaker_heading: PRIVATE MALKY

dialog: you, Cooke.
speaker_heading: PRIVATE COOKE
dialog: Go on then Jondalar, give it a go,
dialog: let’s see it!
text: The men are getting rowdier. We watch Schofield as they grate

speaker_heading: PRIVATE ROSSI
dialog: Let’s hear it then Jonny!
text: The men noisily encourage him.
speaker_heading: SEPOY JONDALAR
dialog: (Much the best
dialog: impersonation - perfect
dialog: lisp, gestures)
dialog: “Rossi! Never in my two hundred
dialog: years as a soldier have I seen such

speaker_heading: PRIVATE COOKE
dialog: Shite. That is total shit!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )

speaker_heading: PRIVATE COOKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oy! You could have taken my teeth
dialog: out with that.
speaker_heading: PRIVATE ROSSI
dialog: You could do with a new set.
text: Schofield is still. The laughter settles.
text: After a beat Schofield checks his wristwatch. BUTLER sees it.
speaker_heading: PRIVATE BUTLER
dialog: You got somewhere you need to be?
text: The men all look at him.
text: Suddenly, the truck lurches violently. Schofield bumps into a
text: man near him. The engine groans under them. The sounds of
text: tyres spinning.
speaker_heading: PRIVATE ROSSI
dialog: Oh, no...
text: A spatter of mud is thrown up. The engine revs, but the truck
text: sinks deeper.
text: Schofield stands, leans out of the canvas.
speaker_heading: PRIVATE COOKE
dialog: Arsehole needs driving lessons.
text: A few men groan in agreement.
text: Schofield jumps out into-
scene_heading: EXT. ROADSIDE DITCH - CONTINUOUS
text: Schofield looks at the stuck wheel. The truck has driven off
text: the road trying to get round another fallen tree. Its rear
text: wheel is sinking into a muddy ditch.
text: Ahead, the convoy is stopped, waiting on them.
text: Schofield speaks to one of the Privates, Cooke, as he stares

speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: He should reverse.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PRIVATE COOKE
dialog: Yeah.
text: Cooke does nothing. Schofield moves to the Driver’s side of
dialog: the truck.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: (Loudly, to the driver)
text: Try it in reverse. REVERSE.
text: A crunch of gears as the driver puts it in reverse. The
text: engine revs again. Schofield bends down to look. The wheel is
text: still spinning. The truck is slipping deeper.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: No. Stop. STOP!
text: After a beat the sound of revving dies out and the engine
dialog: idles.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: Everyone needs to get out.
text: Some of the men climb to their feet and drop out. Others
dialog: don’t move.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: PRIVATE BUTLER
dialog: Alright, alright. Keep your bloody
dialog: hair on.
text: Begrudgingly a few fall in behind and beside the truck and
dialog: ready themselves.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Right. One. Two. Three.
text: The tyre spins on the spot, mud flies up. Schofield and the
dialog: men push. Heaving together-

speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Back in. Get back in. Go.

text: The truck is sweeping past a small hamlet, or at least the
text: remains of one, houses have been reduced to skeletons, the
text: destruction is fresh, embers still smoulder. Anything of
dialog: value built on this land has been systematically destroyed.
text: Dead cattle lie in the fields.
speaker_heading: PRIVATE ROSSI
dialog: Look at it. Fucking look at it...

text: Captain Smith calls out to the driver at the head of the
dialog: convoy.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SMITH
dialog: Driver! Move off!
text: Schofield watches as the small convoy drives away. Fumes
text: swirl in its wake.
text: He turns his attention to the new obstacle - the remains of a
text: bridge, shattered and half blown - now little more than
text: twisted metal dropping into the water.
text: The town of Ecoust is a jagged silhouette, visible about two
text: hundred yards the other side of the canal. Smoke drifts. The
text: town is still on fire.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: The canal is large and industrial - about 90 feet wide, stone
text: sides, once deep, wood and detritus float on the surface of
dialog: the water.
text: On the opposite bank are the remains of a lock house. Two
text: storeys. Windows blown in, roof half collapsed. Beyond that,
text: the remains of some small buildings, all abandoned, and then
text: the jagged remains of Ecoust.
text: Schofield surveys it. Looks around. All seems quiet. Eerie.
text: Schofield looks around for a way across. The blown bridge is
text: his best bet. Both sides of the metal bridge have collapsed,
text: and slant down into the dark water.
text: Schofield starts along the broken bridge, then climbs up onto
text: the slim metal balustrade and starts inching downwards
text: towards the waterline. It takes all his effort not to lose
text: his balance and fall into the water below.
text: Finally he reaches the base of the slope, and looks across at
text: the remaining half of the bridge. About eight feet of water
text: between him and the other side...
text: He prepares himself to jump across and-
speaker_heading: CRACK-—
text: A gunshot slaps the water just in front of him. Birds fly up.
text: Instinctively, he leaps-
text: He lands heavily on the other side of the bridge. His foot
text: slips into the water, and he hauls himself up with his hands.
text: He clings to the metal latticework, scrambling forward.
text: CRACK- another shot rings out, hitting the water behind.
text: CRACK- a bullet hits the metal near his hand. He quickly
text: climbs across the torn carcass of the bridge towards the far
dialog: bank.
text: Another bullet rings out, as he drops down, throwing himself
dialog: into-
scene_heading: EXT. CANAL - CONTINUOUS
text: The cover of the far bank wall. He rips in breaths as he
text: presses his body into the stone bank. He stays low, inching
text: along the side until he can get a sense of where the shots
dialog: are coming from.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He looks. Now he can register the direction of the shots. A
text: SHOOTER, in the lock house. On the upper floor. A single high
dialog: window.
text: Schofield slides along the bank until he hits a small
text: stairwell set into the wall of the canal bank. Barely enough
dialog: cover, but his only option.
text: CRACK. Another bullet sings against the stone as he darts to
text: the other side of the stairs.
text: Schofield readies his rifle, his hands are ice, and injured,
text: and slow to work. They shake violently as he tries to check
dialog: and load the weapon.
text: Panting, he tries to still his trembling body as he creeps up
text: to the top of the stairs, he peers over the top step to line
text: up his shot.
text: CRACK- a bullet sings off the stone next to his head.
text: He sucks in a deep breath and holds it. He exhales as he
text: leans into the shadow of the wall, and readies his rifle...
text: Schofield lifts his body above the wall, and fires once.
speaker_heading: CRACK.
text: Quickly, the shooter fires back.
text: Schofield aims again, CRACK.
text: The shooting stops.
dialog: Silence.
text: Schofield is still for a moment. Breathing heavy. Shaking
text: from the cold and from adrenalin.
text: He spins and fires another two shots through the window of
dialog: the lock house.
text: CRACK. CRACK. Wood splinters. He waits.
text: Again, silence.
text: He steadies himself and stands carefully, rifle ready, and
text: quickly advances to the lock house. He pushes open the doors
text: and moves inside.
dialog: 77.
scene_heading: INT. LOCK HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: No movement on the ground floor.
text: The staircase is ahead of him. His ears burn listening for
text: any sounds, any hint of movement.
text: He holds his breath, the wood creaks under him as he backs
text: against the wall, rifle pointing to the top of the staircase.
text: Staying low and against the wall he moves upwards. Parts of
text: the upstairs come into view -
text: He can now see the door to the upper room.
text: Slowly, he moves along the short corridor. With his foot,
text: Schofield pushes at the door. It swings open, agonisingly
text: slowly, creaking on its hinges.
dialog: Revealing-
text: A GERMAN SOLDIER, slumped against the far wall, wounded - but
text: with his gun raised.
text: A split second to react, Schofield raises his rifle and
scene_heading: BOOM-BOOM!
text: Both guns go off at the same time.
text: The German's bullet hits Schofield on the helmet, ripping his
text: neck and upper body backwards, almost lifting him off his
dialog: feet.
text: Schofield stumbles backwards and falls-
text: Down the stairs.
text: BAM - he hits the stone at the foot of the stairs and...
dialog: Black.
scene_heading: INT. LOCK HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Still black.
text: In the darkness the sound of a single drip.
text: Out of the darkness, Schofield'’s face.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The drip comes from a hole in the ceiling, and falls on
text: Schofield’s forehead. He opens his eyes.
text: Schofield starts to move, gingerly. He lifts his hand with
text: difficulty, runs it along the back of his head. Looks at it -
text: slick with black blood.
text: He sits up, begins to focus. His face and hair are wet. His
text: legs are sprawled on the stairs above him. He looks around
text: dumbly. Unsure of what is up and what is down.
text: He looks at his watch - smashed in the fall. No idea what
dialog: time it is.
text: Panic begins to claw at him. He has somewhere to be. If only
dialog: he could remember it.
text: He looks around for his rifle. He spots it above him, at the
text: top of the stairs. He crawls towards it.
text: Reaches it.
text: Suddenly, the room fills with light. Outside, a flare streaks
text: across the sky. As the light swings across the room,
text: Schofield now sees the German soldier lying dead, slumped
text: against the wall.
text: Schofield stands and gradually descends the staircase.
scene_heading: EXT. ECOUST, CANAL SIDE - CONTINUOUS
dialog: Darkness.
text: Then, another flare hisses across the black sky, light bursts
dialog: from it.
text: It falls slowly to earth, the magnesium light blinding.
text: As the light falls the whole world undulates before him. Not
text: clear to him if he is awake or dreaming.
text: The falling flare is playing with reality; shapes and shadows
text: warp across the land.
text: There has been a rainstorm. The outlines of destroyed
text: buildings contract and expands ahead of him.
text: He begins to stagger forwards through Ecoust. Struggling to
text: pick his way through shifting spots of darkness, unable to
text: tell what is shadow and what is a ditch. The puddles reflect
text: the Verey light, glowing as it falls, stinging his eyes.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: CRACK - A gunshot. Somewhere in the darkness there is another
dialog: sniper.
text: A brief moment of confusion, as he looks around for the
text: source of the gunshot.
text: CRACK. Another gunshot. Distant shouts. Schofield begins to
dialog: run.
text: He runs at full pelt. As he does, the flare light dies. Now
text: he is careening through shapeless darkness.
text: We are running blind, with Schofield. The sound of his
text: footfalls, his breathing.
text: He crashes through a puddle, the noise draws shots. The
text: bullets buzz around him in the darkness. Then -
text: HISS - another flare bursts above him.
text: He flings himself down in the rubble.
text: Shots clip the ground around him. Schofield lies motionless,
text: breathing heavily, trying to disappear into the rubble around
text: him, waiting for the light to die.
text: He looks up, trying to memorize his next path as the light
text: moves the ground ahead of him. The light dies.
text: Schofield is up and clattering in darkness across cobbles.
text: Another flare goes up into the night sky, but this time
text: Schofield doesn’t stop. He keeps running.
text: It sweeps directly over him, he darts into the bombed out
text: remains of a shop. As the light from the flare dies above
text: him, he turns the corner into -
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY WAY, ECOUST - CONTINUOUS
text: Narrow, dark.
text: He starts to move along the alley. Feeling safe in the
text: blackness, heading towards the flickering light at the end of
dialog: the alley -
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET, ECOUST - CONTINUOUS
text: Schofield looks both ways. A broad main market street
text: stretches away in both directions.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: All windows are smashed, buildings have been shelled and
text: collapsed in on themselves. Some have vanished altogether.
text: Schofield cautiously peers out along the wide street. To his
text: left, at the far end of the street, is a Main Square, framed
text: by a colonnade.
text: Beyond, just out of sight, something large is burning.
text: Schofield checks both ways, then begins to walk down the
text: ruins of the empty street, towards the square. Wary.
text: Large medieval colonnades flank the entrance to the square,
text: some have crumbled. Schofield slips through them and into -
scene_heading: EXT. ECOUST MAIN SQUARE - CONTINUOUS
text: Schofield stops under the columns. The destruction here is
dialog: staggering -
text: Colonnades run around most of the square, massive sections of
text: it are pitted with gaps. Whole buildings are gone, like
text: missing teeth - blackness yawns in them. Entire storeys have
text: fallen away, revealing empty rooms.
text: At the centre of the square, the remains of a fountain.
text: In the far corner of the square the Church is on fire. The
text: firelight reflects off the wet cobblestones and puddles.
text: Schofield stares at it. Awed.
text: Then he spots something-
text: In front of the bright flames: A MAN’S SILHOUETTE.
text: Schofield sees him. The Man stops, lowers his weapon. Starts
text: to walk towards him.
text: Schofield cannot make out if he is a German or British
text: soldier and begins to move towards him.
text: Suddenly the Man lifts his gun and starts to run, heading
text: straight towards Schofield. It’s A GERMAN SOLDIER.
text: Schofield responds quickly. He takes off running, heading
text: through the colonnade. The Soldier raises hie rifles and
text: fires after him.
text: Schofield doesn’t stop, heading out of the square and into -
dialog: 81.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE STREET, ECOUST - CONTINUOUS
text: He can hear the shouts of the Soldier coming after him.
text: Schofield runs full tilt. He turns a corner. Ahead, to his
text: left, at about knee height, is a low cellar window.
text: He heads towards it, grabs at it. It’s locked.
text: He can hear the footsteps of the soldier getting closer.
text: Beside the window is a coal chute. In a flash, Schofield is
text: on his hands and knees through the dark opening, scrambling
dialog: into -
scene_heading: INT. COAL CELLAR - CONTINUOUS
text: Pitch black while his eyes adjust.
text: He clutches his rifle, steps back into the shadows. His
text: breath saws in and out, he listens to the slap of running
text: footsteps getting closer.
text: Schofield slides down into the darkness as a pair of German
text: boots run by the low window.
text: He stays crouched in the darkness for a time, listening to
text: the footsteps receding. His eyes finally leave the window and
text: look around him.
text: He is in a low-ceilinged coal cellar. Sections of the roof
text: above have collapsed, letting in drips of rain and some faint
text: light. The room is empty. Then something catches his eye.
text: At the far end of the room, a small doorway. Heavy fabric has
text: been hung across it. His eyes catch the flicker of flame
text: escaping through material.
text: Schofield readies his rifle. He points it at the curtain,
text: ready to fire, gun cocked-
text: Carefully he advances into the small room. Pushes the fabric
text: aside with his rifle.
text: In the centre of the room a furnace, presumably used to heat
text: the house. A small makeshift fire has been lit in it. Around
text: the fire a couple of blankets, some firewood, empty cans,
text: crusts of stale bread.
text: As Schofield’s eyes adjust to the light, he sees movement in
text: the shadows. Instinctively, he lifts his rifle.

speaker_heading: LAURI (CONT'D)
dialog: Shhh. Shhh.
text: Her kindness translates.
text: She inspects the wound. She carefully parts his damp hair,

dialog: the wound.

speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Thank you.
text: Then, from behind her comes a sound. Something soft, small. A
text: BABY stirring. Schofield starts.
text: Lauri moves to the corner of the room. An old mattress lies

text: But Schofield can see him, and his focus briefly shifts.
text: In that moment, Baumer fights back - Kicking, clawing,
text: punching. But he is weaker now. Schofield redoubles his

text: Schofield is desperate. His eyes flick between Muller and

scene_heading: ENGLANDER! ENGLANDER! ENGLISH! ENGLISH!

dialog: giving chase then-
speaker_heading: CRACK-—
text: A bullet sings off the wall opposite.
scene_heading: EXT. SMALL STREET, ECOUST - CONTINUOUS
text: Schofield sprints, looking over his shoulder.
text: He turns... and fifty yards in front him -
text: Another German Soldier. The same man who chased him across

text: The soldier shoots, but Schofield breaks left across the

scene_heading: EXT. TINY STREET, ECOUST - CONTINUOUS
text: A narrow alley.

scene_heading: EXT. CURVED STAIRS STREET, ECOUST - CONTINUOUS
text: Ahead of Schofield is a flight of stone steps.
text: He leaps down. Taking them three or four at a time.
text: He slams against the wall, leaps down another flight.
text: His breath burns in his lungs. At the bottom of the stairs,
text: is a long straight street, about 100 yards. Leading to a
dialog: Bridge.
text: Schofield runs towards it.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE STREET, ECOUST - CONTINUOUS
text: His heartbeat thunders as he sprints flat out.
text: The street slopes downhill. Yards fall under him. We can now

text: The sound of the Two Germans battering down the stairs echoes
text: after him.
text: They hit the flat street. 30 yards behind him.
text: They open fire.
text: Bullets crack off the cobbles just in front of him.
text: He is 50 yards from the bridge, running full tilt.
text: Shots ring out.
text: Schofield reaches the bridge. Bullets ring off the rubble.
text: He keeps sprinting.
text: And suddenly, with no warning, Schofield veers across the

dialog: -..and vaults clean over it -
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER, ECOUST - CONTINUOUS
text: Schofield drops forty feet and smashes into the water.
text: We are under the dark water.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Schofield resurfaces, gasping for air. Numb, panicking, he
text: thrashes and kicks, fighting the weight, the cold, the fear.
text: He struggles to slip off his webbing. It tangles up in his
text: arms, pulling him down.
text: Finally he gets it off, it is swallowed up in the white water
text: which churns all around him.
text: Losing the weight of the webbing, he manages to stay above
dialog: the water.
text: The bridge and the German soldiers are long gone. The water
text: is fast flowing after the rain, rapids sweep him along.
text: A felled tree lies across the river. Schofield grabs hold of
text: its branches, tries to pull himself up. But the torrent is
text: too strong to fight. It rips his hands away, and pulls him
dialog: under again.
text: He surfaces. Coughs and splutters on the water line.
text: The rapids continue to pull him through the water at speed.
text: Schofield goes with it. Letting the water carry him.
text: He scans the river banks ahead. They tower up steeply. He
text: looks for a way out. Around him, rocks jut out from the water
text: dangerously. They churn the river into a whirlpool, spinning
dialog: him around.
text: He is now traveling backwards downstream.
text: Behind him, a large rock rises up out of the water. He is
text: approaching it fast. He doesn’t see it.
text: The water drives him hard into the rock. His back and head
text: are slammed against it.
text: Schofield is winded, disorientated, barely staying afloat.
text: Ahead there is a sound.
text: A deep rumbling.
text: He fights to keep his ears above the water, to hear it.
text: The rapids are getting faster, more turbulent.
text: Schofield realizes what the sound is - the roar of water.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 94,
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: Panic flashes on his face. He thrashes, tries to swim to a
dialog: bank.
text: But it’s too late.
text: A waterfall lies ahead.
text: He braces himself, and then the waterfall is on him ina
dialog: flash.
text: Schofield goes over it.
text: He is pulled down into the plunge pool.
text: We lose sight of him. And then, nothing. He is gone.
text: For a few moments, just the roar of the falls.
text: Then, suddenly Schofield resurfaces, gasping for air.
text: The churning water pushes him free of the falls. He manages
text: to turn onto his back.
text: The river has got wider, deeper. He grabs hold of a branch.
text: The current carries him. The world around him has turned blue
text: in the pre-dawn light.
text: The river sweeps him forward. He is still gasping for breath.
text: Now the tumbling river gradually begins to smooth out into a
text: cool apron of water.
text: Schofield is almost unconscious. He is slipping down, his
text: mouth just above the waterline.
text: His eyes flutter and open, he spits out water.
text: Grey mistrals roll through a pale world. Unearthly. They
text: hover above the river ahead.
text: The river slowly pulls him. Occasional trees line the bank.
text: This place is untouched by war. Spared. Clean and cool and
text: filled with some life.
text: Schofield is fighting it, but ready to accept that this is
dialog: the end. He knows too well there are worse places, worse
dialog: ways...
text: Inch by inch he starts to slip down.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: His ears fall under the waterline. The sound is sucked from
text: the world. His eyes stare upwards. Lips just above the water.
text: Schofield seems so peaceful, just floating on the water. The
text: sound of the falls recedes.
text: We are aware of birds, the wind in the leaves.
text: Then the water around him turns flat. The current begins to
dialog: slow.
text: White. Petals float on it, a patchwork blanket.
dialog: Cherry Blossom.
text: Schofield is swept through the white petals.
text: Schofield raises an arm from the water and sees the petals
text: clinging to him.
dialog: Blake.
text: A long beat.
text: Life seeps back into him, breaks through the icy numbness.
text: Schofield’s limbs struggle to work in the cold.
text: He fights, willing movement.
text: He swims towards the bank.
text: Ahead there are the sounds of a dam: a gentle fountain of
dialog: water.
text: The sun is rising somewhere - the pre-dawn light is beginning
text: to illuminate the world around him.
text: He has reached the dam - a fallen tree. He begins to haul
text: himself out. He looks down.
speaker_heading: BODIES.
text: Twelve bodies, give or take.
text: SOLDIERS - British, German. And CIVILIANS. Men and women.
text: They have caught and gathered, blocked by the tree from
text: floating downstream. They have formed a kind of dam.
text: He takes the only option. He pulls himself up, and climbs
text: across the bodies. His way out.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)

scene_heading: EXT. RIVER BANK - CONTINUOUS
text: He drags himself across the grass, and collapses to his
dialog: knees.
text: He cries.
text: Big racking sobs - for the river, for life, for Blake, for
dialog: the baby.
text: The morning is forming.
text: Far off in the distance, something foreign, or long
dialog: forgotten.
text: Music. Singing.
text: Schofield listens. Then slowly gets up, walks, shaking,
text: towards the sound. He stumbles but doesn’t fall. His frozen
text: limbs are forced, dragged, back to life.
text: Schofield moves up the steep rise. He stops and looks at the
text: woods that now lie ahead of him.
scene_heading: EXT. PINE WOOD - CONTINUOUS
text: Shafts of morning light stream through the pine trees.
text: Schofield walks towards the music. Uncertain if it is real.
text: The music is in the air, a canopy, almost directionless. He
text: can now make out a voice. And words.
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: ...there is no sickness, toil, nor
dialog: danger/In that bright land to which

text: A British COMPANY - about two hundred men - are gathered

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 97.

speaker_heading: YOUNG SOLDIER (0.S.)
dialog: I’m going there to see my Father,
dialog: And all my loved ones who’ve gone
dialog: on.
text: Schofield stops on the edge of the clearing. Unsettled by the

dialog: If he is one of these ghosts.
text: He leans against a tree and slumps down on the outskirts of
text: the group. The music washes over him.
text: Dawn is breaking.
text: He closes his eyes. Done.
speaker_heading: YOUNG SOLDIER (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m only going over Jordan

speaker_heading: PRIVATE SEYMOUR (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Oy! Steady on mate! Where you

speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: No!
text: With the last of his strength, Schofield throws his elbow
text: into the stomach of one of the orderlies. He breaks away from
dialog: them and into-
scene_heading: INT. MACKENZIE'S DUGOUT - CONTINUOUS
text: Schofield careens into the room. A huddle of OFFICERS are
text: inside, their backs to him. A commanding voice emanates from
dialog: among them.
speaker_heading: COLONEL MACKENZIE (0.S.)
dialog: Tell Ivins and Murphy to direct
text: their men to the left flank.
dialog: Concentrate everything there.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
scene_heading: COLONEL MACKENZIE!
text: The officers turn on Schofield, parting as they do. In the
text: centre, staring straight at him, is COLONEL MACKENZIE, 40s.
text: Mackenzie stands ramrod straight, and is immaculately turned
text: out, despite the chaos surrounding him. He has a small scar
text: across his left eye.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: (in a rush)
dialog: Sir, this attack is not to go
dialog: ahead! You’ve been ordered to stop.
dialog: You have to stop.
scene_heading: COLONEL MACKENZIE
dialog: Who the hell are you?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Lance Corporal Schofield, Sir. 8th.
dialog: I have orders from General Erinmore
dialog: to call off this attack.
text: Schofield offers up the letter. The other Officers all react.
text: But Mackenzie doesn’t take it.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
scene_heading: COLONEL MACKENZIE
dialog: You’re too late, Lance Corporal.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Sir, these orders are from Army
dialog: Command. You have to read them.
text: He holds out the letter to Mackenzie. A damp scrap of paper.
text: A Major, HEPBURN, is listening closely.
speaker_heading: MAJOR HEPBURN
dialog: Shall we hold back the second wave,
dialog: Sir?
scene_heading: COLONEL MACKENZIE
dialog: No, Major. Hesitate now and we
dialog: lose. Victory is five hundred yards
dialog: away.
text: Mackenzie is resolute.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Sir...Sir! Please read the letter.
scene_heading: COLONEL MACKENZIE
dialog: I have heard it all before.
dialog: I’m not going to wait until dusk,
dialog: or for fog. I’m not calling back my
dialog: men, only to send them out there
dialog: again tomorrow. Not when we've got
dialog: the bastards on the run. This is
dialog: their last stand.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: The German's planned this, Sir.
dialog: They've been planning it for
dialog: months. They want you to attack.
dialog: Read the letter.
text: This catches MacKenzie’s attention. He nods to Major Hepburn:
dialog: get the letter.
text: Hepburn takes the letter from Schofield, hands it to Colonel
dialog: MacKenzie.
text: MacKenzie opens it. Reads.
text: His face utterly impassive. Inscrutable.
text: Schofield waits.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
scene_heading: COLONEL MACKENZIE
dialog: Major.
speaker_heading: MAJOR HEPBURN
dialog: Yes, Sir.
text: A horrible moment of silence. Everything hangs on this.
scene_heading: COLONEL MACKENZIE
dialog: Stand them down.
speaker_heading: MAJOR HEPBURN
dialog: Yes, Sir.
text: Schofield closes his eyes. Relief floods his body.
text: The Major runs from the dugout, a blast of whistles from the
text: outside - a signal to stop.
text: Mackenzie addresses his other officers.
scene_heading: COLONEL MACKENZIE
dialog: Call up the orderlies. Tend the
dialog: wounded. Hold the line in case they
dialog: counter.
speaker_heading: OFFICERS
dialog: Yes, Sir.
text: The Officers empty out of the dugout. Noises of orders being
text: shouted and whistles being blown seep in from outside.
text: A long beat. Schofield senses Mackenzie moving closer to him.
text: They are now alone.
text: Mackenzie speaks quietly.
scene_heading: COLONEL MACKENZIE
dialog: I hoped today might be a good day.
dialog: Hope is a dangerous thing.
text: Schofield stands stock still.
speaker_heading: COLONEL MACKENZIE (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s it for now. Then next week,
dialog: Command will send a different
dialog: message. Attack at dawn.
text: Mackenzie looks him in the eye.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: COLONEL MACKENZIE (CONT'D)
dialog: There is only one way this war
text: ends. Last man standing.
text: Mackenzie looks him up and down.
speaker_heading: COLONEL MACKENZIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Have someone see to your wounds.
text: Schofield is frozen.
speaker_heading: COLONEL MACKENZIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Now fuck off, Lance Corporal.
text: Schofield leaves the main dugout. Major Hepburn stands just
text: outside the door. He grabs Schofield’s arm as he passes.
text: Schofield turns.
speaker_heading: MAJOR HEPBURN
dialog: (heartfelt)
dialog: Well done, lad.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Thank you, Sir.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you know where Lieutenant Blake
dialog: is, Sir?
speaker_heading: MAJOR HEPBURN
dialog: Blake?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: There were two of us. I was sent
dialog: here with his brother.
text: He looks at him. The Major understands.
speaker_heading: MAJOR HEPBURN
dialog: Ah.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MAJOR HEPBURN (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, knowing Lieutenant Blake he
dialog: would have gone over with his men.
dialog: He was in the first wave.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: How could I find him, Sir?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
speaker_heading: MAJOR HEPBURN
dialog: You can try the casualty clearing
text: station, behind the line.
dialog: Otherwise...
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Thank you, Sir.
speaker_heading: CORPORAL CAIRNS (0.S.)
dialog: Major Hepburn, Sir!
text: He leaves. A beat while Schofield orientates himself. Then he
text: turns and walks out into -
scene_heading: EXT. 2ND TRENCH - CONTINUOUS
text: The sounds of the wounded and the dying as they pass. The
text: German guns have stopped for now. A brief pause.
text: Schofield walks along the line.
text: The B, C and D Companies are gathered, pulling in the
text: survivors, carrying dying and wounded men along the trench.
text: Lifting them by hand where they have no stretchers.
text: Schofield continues along. Searching for officers, for
text: Lieutenant Blake. No one looks at him. No one sees him. He
text: slips past them, a ghost.
scene_heading: EXT. SHATTERED COMMS TRENCH - CONTINUOUS
text: Schofield turns the corner, and pushes his way along the zig-
text: zag length of the trench.
text: STRETCHER BEARERS push past him, pressing him against the
text: back wall as they pass with the wounded.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Sergeant, I have to find Lieutenant
dialog: Blake. Do you know where he is?
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: No.
text: Schofield follows them, up a slope, and emerging out into-
dialog: 114.
scene_heading: EXT. MEADOW - CONTINUOUS
text: An impromptu field station, where several overwhelmed MEDICAL
text: OFFICERS, CHAPLAINS and ORDERLIES from the RAMC tend to the
dialog: wounded.
text: Schofield moves to the tent.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Sir, is Lieutenant Blake here?
speaker_heading: MEDICAL OFFICER
dialog: No idea.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Move along Corporal.
text: Schofield walks through the tent, scanning the wounded.
text: Looking at the faces, the bodies.
speaker_heading: MEDICAL OFFCIER
dialog: If you can walk, move to the triage
dialog: area.
text: None of the men are officers, none could be Blake’s brother.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Lieutenant Blake! Blake?! Has
dialog: anyone seen Lieutenant Blake?
text: He moves through a tent of gravely wounded men. The terrible
text: sounds of the dying. None are Blake’s brother.
text: Schofield moves outside. He finally stands still, hopeless.
text: Sick with his failure.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT (0.S)
dialog: Now come on boys. He’s taken one in
text: the leg. He’s lost a lot of blood.
text: Schofield turns to see an Officer. He is following a
text: stretcher bearer into the field station from the opposite
dialog: direction.
text: Schofield stares at the man’s back. The sound of his voice.
dialog: Just an instinct...
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Lieutenant Blake?
text: The Officer stops and turns to him. His similarity to his
text: brother takes Schofield’s breath away.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT BLAKE
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 115.
text: Schofield is shaky on his feet. He sways a bit, staring at
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you need medical assistance?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: No, Sir. I’m from the 8th.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT BLAKE
dialog: What the hell are you doing here?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: I was sent here to deliver a
dialog: message-—
text: Recognition plays on Blake’s face, he smiles at the mention
text: of his brother’s brigade, moves towards Schofield.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT BLAKE
dialog: The 8th? You must know my brother.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: I was sent here with him.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT BLAKE
dialog: Tom’s here? Where is he?
text: Schofield looks at him. Blake’s smile slowly drops. A pause.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: It was very quick.
text: Blake takes it in.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry.
text: Blake nods, wordless. Schofield goes into his tunic pocket,
text: pulls out Blake’s possessions. There is blood on them. The
text: elder Blake’s face is ashen as he takes them. His eyes fill
dialog: with tears
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT BLAKE
dialog: What’s your name?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: Schofield, Sir.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: Blake nods. He looks down at his brother’s possessions in his
dialog: hands.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT BLAKE
dialog: I’m sorry... what?
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: It’s Schofield, Sir. William
dialog: Schofield. Will.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT BLAKE
dialog: Well, you need some food. Get
dialog: yourself to the mess tent.
text: Beat. Schofield turns to leave. Then -
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: If I may, I’d like to write to your
dialog: mother. Tell her that Tom wasn’t
dialog: alone.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT BLAKE
dialog: Of course.
text: Schofield searches for something to say.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD
dialog: He was...he was a good man. Always
dialog: telling funny stories.
text: Blake nods. It doesn’t seem enough.
text: Then Schofield finds the right words.
speaker_heading: SCHOFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: He saved my life.
text: Schofield reaches out to shake his hand. Blake takes it. They
dialog: are still for a second.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT BLAKE
dialog: I am glad you were with him.
dialog: (Then)
dialog: Thank you, Will.
text: Schofield nods. He turns and walks away.
text: He is like a sleepwalker. Unsure of where to go.
text: He moves away from the makeshift Aid Post and into the meadow
dialog: beyond.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: The grass sways in the breeze. This place is beginning
text: turn gold in the morning sun. Schofield drifts through
text: The noise of the horror behind him gradually fades.
text: Ahead, on the plain, an oak tree towers. Untouched. On
text: high branches, leaves dance in the wind.
text: Schofield walks towards it. He sits on the far side of
text: his back to the trunk. The land stretches out ahead of
text: the early light.
text: He listens to the wind in the leaves. Birdsong.
dialog: 117.
dialog: to
dialog: it.
dialog: the
dialog: it,
dialog: him in
text: He undoes his breast pocket. He pulls out the small tobacco
text: tin. He stares at it.
text: He takes a deep breath and opens it. Two photographs.
text: Schofield lifts them out, looks at them:
text: TWO YOUNG GIRLS, his daughters. They smile at the camera.
text: He looks at the other - his WIFE.
text: He turns the photo over.
text: On the back, her handwriting:
dialog: “Come back to us.”
text: He stares at it for a long beat.
text: The pain on his face ebbs into longing. Love.
text: He closes his eyes and feels the sun on his face.
text: THE END.
