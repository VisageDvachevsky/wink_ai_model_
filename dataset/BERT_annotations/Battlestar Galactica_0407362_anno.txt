text: Suddenly, a full-throated burst of a single chord played by a symphony
text: orchestra as we see superimposed over the starfield, the words:
speaker_heading: GALACTICA
dialog: Saga of a Star World
text: Then as the lettering drifts off into space, the chord begins to
text: diminish until it is only sustained by the ethereal high pitched
text: strains of a muted string section and a voice speaks to us against
dialog: the ever present stars...
speaker_heading: ADAMA'S VOICE
dialog: Thousands of years ago, colonies were established throughout the
dialog: universe by a mother race from the far reaches of space...This race
dialog: of people was known as humanoid...human beings...An unsubjugatable,
dialog: resourceful people who loved freedom, adventure... even conflict...
text: Now, in the seventh millennium of time, a solemn and dramatic event
text: is taking place...A peace envoy, representing the twelve known
text: colonies of man, moves through space in hopes of bringing to a close
text: a thousand year war tat has seen the humans embattled by an alliance

dialog: fleet would bring the star world a new beginning...or...
scene_heading: AGAINST THE STARFIELD

speaker_heading: THE END
text: A SLEEK FIGHTER PLANE
text: blasts onto the screen
text: ON THE SMILING FACE OF ZAC
text: A bright, enthusiastic , young (23) fighter pilot closeted in the
text: super modern, form-fitting cockpit of his sleek ship...the finest
text: fighting craft in the Colonial Fleet...
speaker_heading: ZAC
text: Two targets on my scanner...just above the old moon, Cimtar.
text: INSIDE A SECOND SHIP ON ANOTHER FACE
text: older (30)... a hint of cynicism as he glances at his scanner.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Probably a Cylon patrol...
speaker_heading: ZAC
dialog: Awful long way from home...Where's their base ship...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: No base ship...Long range reconnaissance craft... Strange, I'm not
text: picking up anything but static beyond those guys...
speaker_heading: INSERT
text: Two blips on the front side of a steady field of static
dialog: interference...
speaker_heading: ZAC
dialog: Me too...I thought it was my scanner...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Could be a storm...The fleet will be coming right through it... We'd
dialog: better go have a look...Kick in the turbos...
speaker_heading: INSIDE ZAC'S SHIP
speaker_heading: ZAC
dialog: Skyler...the standing orders on conserving fuel specifically forbid
dialog: use of turbos, except under battle conditions...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Kid...You're on the front lines now...anything goes...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: pushes three buttons and shoves his foot to the floor. The resulting
text: blast drives him back against the seat.
scene_heading: SKYLER'S FIGHTER

scene_heading: INSIDE A DINING CHAMBER
text: one half of which looks out on the most spectacular sight ever
text: witnessed by man...the universe...a giant starfield in all its
text: majesty...In the center of the room is a long table at which the
text: center of attention is a bearded man whose face glows with the
text: warmth and wisdom of the ages. He raises a silver chalice and the
text: twelve gentlemen around him, clad in Roman-like toga and tunic tops
text: over tighter fitting pants and boots, come to rapt attention...
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Gentlemen...I know you are all anxious to return to your ships before
dialog: our rendezvous with the Cylons, but I think it appropriate to toast
dialog: the most significant event in the history of man...I'd like to raise
dialog: my chalice to you...
text: We study the study, dignified faces of twelve men, flanking the old
text: man...six to a side...their features betraying substantive
text: differences...They are red, black, yellow, white...indeed, every
dialog: variation...
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
text: Not merely the quorum of the twelve, representing the twelve colonies
dialog: of man, but my friends...and the greatest leaders ever assembled...As
dialog: we approach the seventh millennium of time, the human race will at
dialog: last know peace...Thanks to you...
text: As the are about to salute, each with his own chalice, another voice
dialog: is heard...
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: Inappropriate...
text: Faces swing Baltar's way...startled by his impudence...
speaker_heading: BALTAR
text: I say we lift our cups to he, who has for the first time, brought the

dialog: Alliance...To President Adar and to peace...
text: Even the humble attempt at quelling the voices cannot deny these men

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT

scene_heading: POINT OF VIEW FROM A COLONIAL FIGHTER PLANE COCKPIT

dialog: clouds...
speaker_heading: SKYLER'S VOICE
dialog: What is it...
speaker_heading: ZAC
text: pulling back on the throttle, slowing...He puts the vehicle on the
text: scanner and punches up a combination...
speaker_heading: ZAC
dialog: Tell ya' in a flash...
speaker_heading: ON ZAC'S SCANNER
text: On one side of the screen, we see the Cylon space vehicle. On the
text: other side of the screen, we see a series of airship profile
text: silhouettes racing by. Finally, an image stops. It is a match. A
text: great deal of printing appears below the silhouettes in an
text: unfamiliar text.
speaker_heading: ZAC
text: Warbook says a Cylon tanker. Scanner reads it empty.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: What's an empty tanker doing out here?
speaker_heading: ZAC
dialog: And where's the other ship?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: Screened off by this one. Wonder what they're hiding?
speaker_heading: ZAC
dialog: I don't know, but it's awfully close to that storm.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: We came to look...
speaker_heading: ZAC
dialog: Be careful, Skyler. I have a funny feeling about this...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: You're not old enough to have funny feelings! Besides while we're
dialog: stuck out on patrol, Starbuck's pulled a couple of those Geminis'
text: into a card game. I want to get back before he cleans them out.
speaker_heading: SKYLER'S SHIP
text: begins to peel off to sweep around the freighter...
text: ON ANOTHER BATTLESTAR IN THE FLEET
dialog: its name... "Galactica"
scene_heading: INSIDE A PILOTS' READY ROOM
text: A Spartan, standby area for fighter pilots. Camera moves past a young
text: man in flight clothes, sleeping...another reading...and as we come to
text: the end of the room, a group stand behind one side of a circular card
text: table, forming a gallery for a handsome young man called Starbuck,
text: who eyes his round playing cards with wily skill.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: (with feigned ease)
dialog: Just to keep the game instructive, and because you're new to it, I'll
dialog: only wager...
text: Starbuck pushes half of his square cubits of gold in front of him.
text: The two men look, then whisper. A confident smile passes amongst the
dialog: gallery.
speaker_heading: GEMON
dialog: Despite the humbleness of this hand...for the honor of our home
dialog: colony, Gemini, we must challenge you.
text: The young man pushes forth a measure of golden cubits, equal to the
text: pot. The gallery tenses.
speaker_heading: GEMON
dialog: And for the glory of our colony, another equal measure.
text: Gemon pushes out another pile, in effect, doubling the stakes. The
text: gallery holds its collective breath. Starbuck feigns continued ease.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Well, in the name of our home planet, Caprica, and for her
dialog: everlasting glory, I'll measure your increase and double it.
text: The gallery gulps as Starbuck pushes in his remaining cubits and
text: turns to them.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: (sotto voice)
dialog: Come on, come on, guys, up with the rest of it...
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: Could we speak with you for a moment. In private?
dialog: (To the Geminis)
dialog: Only be a flash, fellas...
text: Boomer, a trim-looking black man; Jolly, a hefty hunk of a guy, and
text: Greenbean, a stringbean of a flyer next to him, face the now-standing
text: Starbuck and speak to him through clenched teeth and heated whispers.
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: Are you crazy...?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: (sotto voice)
dialog: Weren't you listening? This is for the glory of Caprica. Doesn't that
dialog: mean anything to you?
text: The gallery stares at Starbuck blankly.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Look, have I ever steered you guys wrong?
text: The gallery continues to stare blankly.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: (sotto voice)
dialog: All right...look at it this way. We'll double our money! They're
text: trying to buy the pot.
speaker_heading: JOLLY
dialog: (sotto voice)
dialog: You told us these Geminis didn't understand the game.
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: They caught on fast. Now, come on, or we lose everything we've got in
dialog: that game.
text: Reluctantly, the gallery comes up with an additional measure of gold
text: cubits. Starbuck pushes them out onto the table and turns his cards
dialog: over.
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: Beat that.
text: The Gemmon smiles and places his cards on the table. Boomer and the
text: gallery stare at the cards, stricken as the Gemon rakes in the golden
dialog: cubits.
scene_heading: IN THE PRESIDENTIAL DINING ROOM
text: The men have adjourned their meeting and now cluster in twos and
text: threes, chatting amicably.
speaker_heading: THE PRESIDENT
text: grips the arm and hand of Baltar.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: This armistice conference would not have been possible without your
dialog: tireless work, Baltar. You have secured for yourself a place in the
dialog: history books.
text: Baltar smiles humbly.
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: That the Cylons chose me as their liaison to the quorum of the twelve
dialog: was an act of providence, not skill.
text: The old man notices Commander Adama standing alone at the huge window
text: to space. The Commander is a strong man with sharp features and
text: penetrating eyes...still a softness in his bearing.
scene_heading: ON THE COMMANDER
text: looking out, a troubled look on his face, as the President moves up
dialog: behind him
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: I see the party isn't a huge success with all my children.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: It's what awaits us out there that troubles me.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Surely, you don't cling to your suspicions about the Cylons. They
dialog: asked for this armistice. They want peace.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Forgive me, Mr. President, but they hate humans with every fiber of
dialog: their existence. We love freedom. We love independence. To feel, to
dialog: question. To rebel against oppression. It's an alien way of existing
dialog: they will never accept.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
text: But they have. Through Baltar, they have sued for peace.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
text: swings a sober look back to the President
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Yes. Of course, you're right.
speaker_heading: POINT OF VIEW
text: A tanker in space. Moving around it, we see a second tanker appear
text: just above the cloud layer.
scene_heading: SKYLER'S FIGHTER
text: sweeps around and slows
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: There's the other ship tucked in nice and neat. Now what is she, and
dialog: what's she doing?
text: Skyler punches the buttons.
speaker_heading: HIS SCANNER
text: refusing to read the ship. Figures and symbols appear in a hopeless
dialog: jumble.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: I can't read anything inside. She's jamming us.
speaker_heading: ZAC
dialog: Warbook says she's a freighter.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: My foot. If she's jamming us, she's hiding something. I'm going around
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: ZAC
dialog: (alarmed)
dialog: That'll put you smack in the storm. If it's asteroids, it'll rip us
dialog: apart.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Not us, kid. You stay put. I don't want it said that I taught my kid
text: brother bad habits on his first patrol.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: swings his ship over and head directly into the cloud cover.
speaker_heading: ZAC'S VOICE
dialog: The jamming is knocking out my scanner. Where are you, Skyler?
scene_heading: SKYLER SCANS THE HORIZON
text: obscured by clouds racing past him.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: Nothing but a harmless cloud cover. Not heavy at all. I don't see why
dialog: they'd send up all that electronic...
text: Skyler looks down. His face freezes. His eyes widen in disbelief...
speaker_heading: ZAC'S VOICE
dialog: Skyler? What's going on?
scene_heading: SKYLER'S POINT OF VIEW
text: He has flown into the middle of a Cylon staging area. Wall to wall
text: warships as far as the eye can see. We push in close to one of the
dialog: ships...
scene_heading: INSIDE THE CYLON ATTACK FIGHTER
text: a triad of Cylon Centurians. Two helmeted pilots sit side-by-side, a
text: third between them, slightly higher and back. Their helmets are
text: tubular shaped with a narrow aperture where one might have expected
text: eyes. In their stead, a fine beam of light sweeps back and forth, an
text: ominous, ever-aware presence. The Cylon swings a look o.s. He
dialog: points...
speaker_heading: ZAC'S SHIP
text: with the Cylon ships in pursuit.
scene_heading: ON THE LEAD CYLON FIGHTER
text: racing ahead, firing
speaker_heading: ON SKYLER
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: They're jamming our transmission, kid. We've got to get back. It's an

text: ON THE FLEET
text: as a small shuttlecraft approaches the Galactica from the rear.
speaker_heading: POINT OF VIEW
text: of the Galactica from the shuttlecraft to establish two large carrier

speaker_heading: ATHENA

speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: I don't know. They just put the ship on alert.

speaker_heading: ON ZAC
text: frightened as he takes a hit
speaker_heading: ZAC
dialog: Skyler...they knocked out my port engine.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: We're not going to make it giving them our backs. How many of 'em can
dialog: you make out?
speaker_heading: ZAC
dialog: Four...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: They only sent four after us? That's insulting.
speaker_heading: ZAC
dialog: I don't know, Skyler. I think they're doing awfully well...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Only because they're behind us. When I count three, hit your reverse
dialog: thrusters and maximum breaking flaps. We'll give them a little
dialog: surprise. One...two...three...
text: They hit their reverse thrusters. A roar goes off...
scene_heading: ON THE CYLON FIGHTERS

speaker_heading: ON SKYLER

speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Right here, you creepy, crawly creature...

scene_heading: POINT OF VIEW - AHEAD

speaker_heading: ON SKYLER
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Yaa Hoooo....
speaker_heading: ON ZAC
text: swinging back and forth, lining up his target. He fires.
speaker_heading: THE CYLON SHIP
text: disintegrates. Ahead of it, the remaining two Cylon fighters divide
text: and veer off.
speaker_heading: ON SKYLER
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Not bad for a little brother. You go after the guys on the right.
text: The two fighters split, swinging off after the two Cylon fighters.
speaker_heading: ON THE BRIDGE
text: Commander Adama enters. Colonel Tigh is watching the scanners
text: intently.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: Our patrol ran into trouble. We picked up some signals, but they're
dialog: being jammed.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: What kind of trouble?
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: Can't tell yet. Could be pirates, smugglers, or...
text: Their eyes meet. The Commander walks to the large observation point
text: looking out on the starfield.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Get me the President.
scene_heading: IN A READY ROOM - CLOSE ON A CARD HAND
text: Starbuck sits down at the card table, a small grin appearing on his
text: face. He pushes a large stack of cubits out into the center of the
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Ok, guys, one hand. Sudden death.
dialog: The gentlemen from Gemini consider the odds and push an equal amount
text: of cubits to the center of the table.
speaker_heading: GEMON
dialog: Sudden death!!
text: Starbuck flashes a fiendish, child-like grin and begins to deal the
dialog: cards.
text: ON THE FLIGHT BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Our patrol is under attack, Mr. President. We're not sure by whom.
text: The President appears on a monitor. Baltar is beside him.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: As a precautionary measure, I'd like to launch intercept fighters...
text: Baltar leans into the President, whispering to him. The President
dialog: nods.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Quite right, Baltar. Commander, as a precautionary measure, I insist
text: upon restraint. If this turns out to be an encounter with some outlaw
dialog: traffic, we could jeopardize the entire cause of peace by displaying
dialog: fighters when we are so close to our rendezvous.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Mister President, two of my aircraft are under armed attack.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: By forces unknown. You are not to launch until the situation is more
text: clear.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Sir, may I at least urge you to bring the fleet to a state of alert?
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: I will consider it. Thank you, Commander.
text: The screen goes black.
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: He'll consider it? Has he lost his mind?
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Colonel...
text: The Colonel looks quickly around at the hushed bridge, quite
text: embarrassed at his own outburst.
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: I'm sorry, Commander, it's just that...well...
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Yes, Colonel? What is it?
speaker_heading: TIGH
text: The patrol is under the command of Captain Skyler.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Well, if I can't have confidence in my eldest son, who can I depend
dialog: on?
speaker_heading: TIGH
text: Zac is with him. His first patrol.
text: This news weighs heavy on the Commander.
speaker_heading: ON ZAC
text: as he fires and misses a Cylon fighter veering off and falling behind
text: him. Suddenly, he is the target.
speaker_heading: ZAC
dialog: Skyler...
speaker_heading: ON SKYLER
text: as he looks off, sees the confrontation off to one side of him
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Keep them interested just a little longer...
speaker_heading: ON ZAC
text: as the sky is exploding all around him
speaker_heading: ZAC
dialog: Believe me, they're interested.
text: An explosion rocks Zac's plane.
speaker_heading: ZAC
dialog: There goes another engine...
speaker_heading: ON SKYLER
text: He zeros in on the Cylon plane from the side, swinging his ship to
text: come at the Cylon's plane on a perpendicular intersecting course.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Steady...steady...just don't look this way, guys...
scene_heading: IN THE CYLON PLANE
text: as they continue to focus on Zac. Suddenly, the pilot closest to
text: Skyler's side chances to swing his look out to the right.
scene_heading: POINT OF VIEW - THE CYLON'S
text: A colony fighter plane is coming right for him
speaker_heading: THE CYLON
text: chatters frantically. The other two pilots turn to look.
scene_heading: ON SKYLER'S PLANE

speaker_heading: THE CYLON PLANE
dialog: disintegrates
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: sighs with relief
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: The day those guys can outfight us without a ten-to-one margin...
speaker_heading: ON ZAC
text: He is looking across the sky
speaker_heading: ZAC
dialog: Skyler...better look at your scanner.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: looks...
speaker_heading: THE SCANNER
text: shows a solid wave of targets coming from somewhere in the distance.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: But a thousand-to-one is hardly fair...
speaker_heading: ZAC
dialog: What does it mean, Skyler?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: It means there isn't going to be any peace. There may not be anything
dialog: if we don't warn the fleet.
speaker_heading: ZAC
dialog: You go, Skyler. I'm short two engines. I won't be able to keep up
dialog: with you.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: I can't leave you, Zac.
speaker_heading: ZAC
dialog: You have to...and I'll be all right. If I put my foot in that turbo,
dialog: I'll make it back ahead of them. Now go on. You've got to warn the
dialog: fleet.
text: A sober mood descends across Skyler's face.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: You can fly with me any time, kid. Good luck.
text: Skyler punches the buttons and the roar of the turbo thruster
dialog: responds.
speaker_heading: ZAC
dialog: Come on, baby, give me all you can.
text: He pushes the stick forward and moves off at a much slower speed.
text: ON THE FLIGHT BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: Still nothing from the fighters, sir. Their transmission is being
dialog: deliberately jammed. If we don't launch...
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: We cannot launch when it has been expressly forbidden...
dialog: (on everyone's tense look)
dialog: This might, however, be an appropriate time to order a test of our
dialog: battle stations drill...
text: The bridge command smiles...
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Sound the alert, Colonel!!!
scene_heading: IN THE READY ROOM
text: On a hand as it is turned over. All one color, all one symbol. A
dialog: pyramid.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: You may never see another one, fellas... A perfect pyramid.
speaker_heading: ON GEMON
text: as he turns to his associate in sullen disbelief. Suddenly A CLAXON
text: blares loudly through the room. A book reader jumps up...a sleeper
text: wakes up...He slaps it to the top of the remaining deck, scattering
dialog: the cards.
speaker_heading: GEMON
dialog: Unfortunate. We'll have to replay hand at later date. Duty calls.
text: Gemon whips a battle helmet from the floor and scoops half the pot on
text: the table into it, takes off, his compadre right behind him.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Come back here, you little...Somebody stop him...!
text: But all hands charge for the doors, grabbing helmets and flight kits.
text: ON THE CATAPULT DECK
text: A vacuum tube races along the ceiling of a long, narrow chamber in
text: which countless fighter ships sit side by side in powerful launching
text: cribs. As the vehicle within the overhead vacuum tube progresses down
text: the flight line, pilots emerge from chutes leading from the overhead
text: tube, then race on foot for their individual fighter craft. Ground
text: teams are already on hand preparing the lethal-looking planes for
text: immediate launch.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
text: emerges from his drop and runs to the cockpit of his plane. A member
text: of the ground crew looks up from where he is hurriedly preparing the
dialog: cockpit.
speaker_heading: CREWMAN
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
text: Nothing to worry about. Probably some kind of aerial salute for the
text: President as they sign the armistice.
text: The crewman kicks a switch and Starbuck's plane beings to whine, the
text: pitch getting higher and higher.
speaker_heading: ON ZAC
text: racing against time as his ship limps back toward safety
text: A WALL OF CYLON FIGHTERS

speaker_heading: OPERATIVE
text: Sir, long range scanner picks up large number of craft moving this

speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Get that pilot up here as soon as he lands. Get the President back on

text: ON THE PRESIDENT ON THE BRIDGE OF THE ATLANTIA
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Yes, Commander?
speaker_heading: ADAMA
text: Mister President, a wall of unidentified craft are closing towards
dialog: the fleet.
text: Baltar leans towards the President
speaker_heading: BALTAR
text: Possibly a Cylon welcoming committee.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: May I suggest that at the very least, we launch a welcoming committee
dialog: of our own?
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: Mister President, there remain many hostile feelings amongst our
dialog: Warriors. The likelihood of an unfortunate incident with all those
text: pilots in the sky at once...
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: A good point, Baltar. Did you hear that, Commander?
text: Adama is beside himself.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: No, Mister President, I can't possibly have heard correctly. Did
dialog: Count Baltar suggest we allow our forces to sit here totally
dialog: defenseless?
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Commander, we are on a peace mission. The first peace man has known
dialog: in a thousand years.
speaker_heading: ON ZAC

speaker_heading: ZAC
dialog: Come on, baby, not much further...
text: ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Mister President...
text: He is interrupted by Colonel Tigh with a report.
speaker_heading: TIGH
text: A lone ship is coming under attack from the main force approaching
dialog: the fleet.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Did you hear that, Mister President. Your welcoming committee is
dialog: firing at our patrol.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Firing at our patrol? How do you explain that, Baltar?
text: He looks around.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Baltar! Baltar!

speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: That was my son, Mister President.
scene_heading: ON THE CYLONS
text: as they streak towards the fleet, opening fire
text: ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
text: as countless Cylon fighters streak by, firing salvo after salvo.
text: Commander Adama looks out at the starfield suddenly alive with fires
text: and destruction, as a large battle wagon explodes beyond the

speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Launch fighters.
text: INSIDE THE BOWELS OF THE GALACTICA ON THE LAUNCHING DECK
text: as claxon blares
speaker_heading: ON STARBUCK
text: as a red light goes on on his dash. He lowers the canopy. The ground
text: crewman steps back, signaling a control tower high above. As he runs
text: for cover, there is a hiss of steam and a blast as the ship roars out
dialog: of its crib.
text: ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE GALACTICA
text: as fighter after fighter begins to launch from the side of the huge
text: ship, angling diagonally off into space and into the attack.
text: ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
speaker_heading: TIGH
text: Fighters launched, Commander.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Have any of the other ships gotten planes off?
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Lord help us.
text: ON THE LANDING DECK OF THE GALACTICA
text: Skyler is climbing hurriedly out of his ship.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
text: moves to him on the dead run
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Skyler, thank heavens you're all right.
text: She tried to crush into his arms. He is sympathetic, but stoic, and
text: in a hurry to report.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: I've got to go back for Zac. It's an ambush. They jammed our
dialog: communicators. You tell Commander Adama there were no base ships.
dialog: He'll understand what I'm saying.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Skyler...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Athena, just listen and tell Adama that it's more than just an attack.
text: The Cylon base ships are missing. That means they're up to something
dialog: diabolical. Now I've got to go back for Zac.
text: As he turns to charge away
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: You don't have to go back.
text: Skyler spins around. His tone is positive, but his expression is
dialog: uncertain.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: You mean he's all right! One of the other ships picked him up!
text: Tears begin to roll down Athena's cheek.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: No...
text: Skyler sucks in his breath and stares at Athena emotionlessly, then
text: turns away as she cries.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: I guess I can give my report to Adama himself
text: He turns to move off
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Your report? Is that all you can say? Zac's dead.
text: Skyler looks back
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: We'll probably all be dead soon.
text: Skyler steels himself against the pain, turns and exits up the metal
dialog: staircase.
text: ON THE LANDING DECK
text: On Skyler as he enters the bridge of the Galactica. Adama is quick to
text: move to him and embrace him. Skyler tenses up.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: You didn't have any choice.
text: Skyler pulls away
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: There were no base ships, only attack craft. Maybe a thousand,
text: hovering over Cimtar.
text: The Colonel moves up
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: A thousand? You must be mistaken, Captain. Fighters couldn't function
text: this far from Cylon without base ships. They don't carry enough fuel.
text: The Captain looks off thoughtfully
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: We picked up an empty tanker on our scanner. It's my guess the Cylons
text: used it to refuel for the attack after flying to that point from
dialog: wherever their base ships are.
text: The Commander ponders that as the Colonel shakes his head skeptically
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: Why operate that far from base ships when it isn't necessary. They
dialog: would have been well out of our range at the old moon.
text: A grim revelations descends across Adama's face
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Unless it was more important that the base ships be someplace else.
dialog: Get me the President.
text: We read an ominous, foreboding look in Commander Adama's eyes
text: ON THE CYLON BASE SHIPS
text: Three large, circular aircraft hover in the sky above the planet
dialog: Caprica
scene_heading: IN THE LARGE CIRCULAR CHAMBER
text: lighted by very subdued, indirect sources. A door opens on a side and
text: two large, armored men move in wearing Cylon scanning helmets. They
text: cross until they come to a pedestal in the center of the chamber.
text: There, a creature sits with its back to us. The two men stop.
speaker_heading: CENTURIAN
dialog: By your command.
speaker_heading: IMPERIOUS LEADER
dialog: Speak.
speaker_heading: CENTURIAN
text: All base ships are now in range to attack the Colonies.
scene_heading: ON THE IMPERIOUS LEADER
text: A truly inhuman form sitting amidst robes and peering at the two
text: figures standing at attention through a multiplicity of eyes
speaker_heading: IMPERIOUS LEADER
text: The final annihilation of the life form known as man. Let the attack
dialog: begin.
text: ON A CYLON BASE SHIP
text: as large doors begin to open along the circular ship's entire
dialog: perimeter
scene_heading: ON A CYLON WARSHIP
text: as it launches from the aperture, and next to it, another and another
text: A WIDER ANGLE ON THE STARFIELD
text: to include three of the base ships, each launching her attack ships
text: ON THE BRIDGE OF THE ATLANTIA
text: fires raging all around. The President looks on, horrified as Adama
text: comes on a monitor
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Mister President, I request permission to leave the fleet. I've
dialog: reason to suspect our home planets may face imminent attack.
text: The President takes these words like a death blow. He suddenly leans
text: against a bridge wall.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: No. Pray you're mistaken. How could I have been so completely wrong.
dialog: I've led the entire human race to ruin.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: You didn't lead us to this disaster, Mister President. But we were
dialog: led.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Baltar? No, Commander. I don't believe it. I won't...
text: With that, an explosion rips the command bridge open, engulfing it in
dialog: flame
speaker_heading: ON ADAMA
text: as the monitor reflects the inferno, then goes blank
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Mister President! Mister President!
text: All eyes swing from the monitor to the starfield, where the flagship
text: can be seen cruising a thousand yards away, its bridge aflame, its
text: flight deck alive with fires. Suddenly, the entire ship bursts apart,
text: disintegrating into a thousand torches hurdling through space. For an
text: instant, there is stunned silence on the bridge of the Galactica,
text: then as other Cylon ships roar by, firing at the Galactica, Colonel
text: Tigh moves up.
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: Our long-range scanners have picked up Cylon base ships here, here
text: and here, putting them well within range of the planets Virgon,
dialog: Sagitara, and
text: Commander Adama, Athena, and Colonel Tigh look on as technicians plot
text: the course of the Galactica and enemy base ships on a large
dialog: translucent starfield map
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Yes, Caprica.
dialog: The impact hits Athena
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Helm, bring us around. We're withdrawing. Colonel, flank speed for
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Father, what are you doing?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: You can't leave our Warriors!
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: (reluctantly)
dialog: We have to leave them to defend the fleet. Those with enough fuel
dialog: left will catch up.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: And what about the others?
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: At the very least, let us transmit our intentions. Give them a chance
dialog: to conserve what fuel they can.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: No. If we have any advantage left, it's surprise.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Father, you're killing them!
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Skyler!
text: Skyler moves to Athena to quell her mounting emotion.
speaker_heading: ON STARBUCK

speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Boomer...
speaker_heading: ON BOOMER
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: I see it.
speaker_heading: JOLLY
dialog: Where's she going?
speaker_heading: GREENBEAN
dialog: Hey, you guys, what's going on? The Galactica's pulling out!
speaker_heading: ON STARBUCK
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: There's got to be a good reason.
speaker_heading: GREENBEAN
dialog: Sure, it's dangerous around here. Heads up, Boomer, you've got a pair
dialog: on your tail.
speaker_heading: JOLLY
dialog: Pull up, Boomer. I'll try to get him off.
text: Starbuck looks back at the departing battle wagon, Galactica
speaker_heading: STARBUCK

speaker_heading: ON THE GALACTICA

dialog: ships in flames
scene_heading: THE BRIDGE OFFICER
text: calls out from the communications board
speaker_heading: BRIDGE OFFICER
text: Electronic jamming has stopped
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: They're clearing the air for their electronic guidance systems.
speaker_heading: TIGH
text: That means the attack is under way.
speaker_heading: BRIDGE OFFICER
dialog: No, sir, we're picking up long-range video satellite signals.
text: Everything looks perfectly normal at home.
text: All eyes swing to multiple monitors above the communications board.
scene_heading: ON THE MONITORS
text: An aerial view of Caprica with its pyramid-oriented architecture...
text: modern, strong. A beautiful day, as seen from various heights; from a
text: single downtown area, to a city, to an entire sector of the planet...
speaker_heading: BRIDGE OFFICER
dialog: We have ordinary broadcast transmission coming up on four
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: Commander, perhaps...perhaps we're in time. Perhaps the Cylon attack
dialog: on our fleet was a dissident faction, a small, anti-peace movement
scene_heading: ON MONITOR FOUR
text: a handsome young woman speaks to a camera from a garden spot, just in
text: front of an all-glass building set within a shopping mall
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Just ordinary people going to and from work, behaving not as if this
dialog: were the most significant day in all history, but rather as they would
dialog: on any other day. So far, details of the armistice meetings going on
text: at this very moment on the Star Kobol are not coming in as hoped for
text: because of an unusual electrical storm blocking out all interstellar
dialog: communication. However, as soon as available, you will see the first
text: pictures of what has been described as the most significant event...
text: A loud explosion from far away thumps through in the background.
text: People all around Orin suddenly turn and look, pointing, staring,
text: some beginning to shout.
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Excuse me, something happened. Perhaps some of you heard it...an
text: explosion of some kind... People are staring off in that direction.
dialog: Let's see if we can...
text: Lyra begins to move out across the garden, camera going with her...
text: getting jostled by a growing crowd.
scene_heading: CAMERA POINT OF VIEW
text: sees a fireball rising from the horizon beyond the city. Suddenly,
dialog: there is another...
speaker_heading: LYRA
text: Oh, my God...a tremendous explosion...two of them... Are we getting
text: it on camera? People are beginning to run in all directions...
scene_heading: ON THE STREET WITH LYRA - LIVE
text: Suddenly, a Cylon warship streaks across the sky, firing laser
text: torpedoes. The buildings just beyond Lyra suddenly explode into
text: fireballs, rocking the street and sending Lyra falling, crashing
text: into the greenery.
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen...it's terrible...someone is bombing the city...
text: BACK ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
text: Everyone on the bridge stares in shock at the visual and emotional
text: impact of watching their homeland being destroyed. A bridge officer
dialog: moves up with a report
speaker_heading: BRIDGE OFFICER
text: Commander, the long-range scanners are picking up wave after wave of
text: small ships heading towards all of the inner planets.
text: Everyone on the bridge stares helplessly.
text: BACK IN THE MALL
text: on the surface of Caprice. Lyra reacts to a fighter swinging low over
text: the city, firing in her direction. She looks all around for cover, is
text: bumped and pushed, as people scramble in all directions.
speaker_heading: LYRA
text: It's hopeless... People are dying all around me.. I see a small
dialog: child...running for his...Look out!
text: Lyra suddenly throws down her microphone...the camera being hand-held
text: by an engineer, swings around on her as she streaks towards a small
text: boy running with his dog from the path of a streaking attack fighter.
text: Lyra dives, pushing the child out of the path of the laser blast which
text: continues on up the street, devastating her camera crew. A second wave
text: of fighters screams by, completing the destruction, sending columns
text: and pillars of concrete crashing all around...
scene_heading: ON THE RUBBLE
text: as Lyra attempts to dig her way out, rising up with immediate concern
text: for the small form concealed beneath her
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Don't try to move...
text: The small boy pokes his head up, crying. Lyra comforts him, pulling
dialog: him to her
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Everything's going to be all right...
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: Muffit. Where's Muffit?
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: My daggit. My daggit. Where is he?
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Your daggit? Oh, I'm sure he's fine...
text: Lyra swings her head around, looking. Suddenly, her eyes fix on
dialog: something o.s.
scene_heading: LYRA'S POINT OF VIEW
text: A pillar lies broken amidst other fallen building material and,
text: protruding from beneath the debris, a small dog lying motionless, not
dialog: breathing.
scene_heading: ON LYRA AND BOXEY
text: Lyra turns Boxey around, screening him from seeing the animal.
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: I think I saw him run this way. Let's go look.
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: I want Muffit! Is he all right?
text: Lyra holds the boy close to her
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Sure...he's all right...everything is all right...everything is going
dialog: to be just fine...
text: She rocks the young lad in her arms, pondering the hollow lie that
text: leaves her lips as she looks around the city which was proud and
text: stately only minutes ago.
text: BACK ON THE GALACTICA BRIDGE As the high level satellite pictures
text: display the fire and aftermath of total and utter destruction of a
text: planet. Commander Adama turns from the monitor in defeat. Athena
text: appears almost comatose, in a dream state
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: First Zac, now this. They trusted us to protect them...
text: Adama attempts to draw her to him. She pulls away.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: How could you have let it happen...
text: As she runs from the bridge, Adama looks to Skyler. He returns a
text: stoic, emotionless gaze.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: You had no choice.
text: The two men momentarily share a common emotion, void of any
dialog: satisfaction.
scene_heading: ON ADAMA AND SKYLER
text: Suddenly, both men are spared further agony by the excited intrusion
text: of a voice.
speaker_heading: BRIDGE OFFICER
text: Cylon base ships on long-range scanner...launching to all outer
dialog: planets
text: All eyes swing to the scanners, as pictures burst forth on all
text: screens, each one displaying fighters sweeping in on bombing runs
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: No hope, Commander...
text: The Commander sinks with each devastating image from the colonies and
text: turns to communications, a hint of desperation in his voice.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: What about Sagitarias? Perhaps there's still time to save...
speaker_heading: BRIDGE OFFICER
dialog: Sorry, Commander...the planet is in flames.
text: The Commander pales, seems almost on the verge of collapse
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Prepare my shuttle craft.
text: The Colonel looks at the Commander, startled
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: Shuttle craft?
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: I'm going down to the surface of Caprica.
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: Commander, that's out of the question! If the Cylon scanners should
dialog: pick you up...
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: You proceed to rendezvous with the survivors of the fleet.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: I'll take you, Father, in my fighter. You're the last surviving member
dialog: of the Council. If we run into a Cylon attack ship, at least you'll
dialog: have a chance...
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: As the man who'd have to fill your shoes, I insist on that, Commander.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Very well. Make preparations...and should I not return...
text: The Commander and Colonel extend hands, clasping each others' wrists
text: as they shake hands.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: You will.
speaker_heading: ON THE GALACTICA
text: as a single fighter roars from its launching crib and off across the
text: starfield. On its departure, the Galactica banks and heads off to
dialog: pursue its mission.
text: ON THE GALACTICA BRIDGE
speaker_heading: STARBUCK'S VOICE
dialog: (over intercom)
dialog: Red leader one...in trouble...in trouble
dialog: Colonel Tigh responds
speaker_heading: TIGH
text: Surviving fighter ships rendezvousing, Commander!
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: We read you, Red leader. How can we assist you?
text: ON STARBUCK IN HIS SHIP
text: Sparks are flying all over the cockpit as a piece of instrument panel
text: dangles from its mooring. Starbuck struggles to keep the wires apart
text: and halt the dangerous electrical shorting, while at the same time
text: maintaining his flight attitude. He looks out the window
scene_heading: POINT OF VIEW - HIS PORTSIDE WING
text: The short, stubby extension that sweeps out after blast-off and
text: maintains this attitude through landing, is sweeping out and then back
text: into the aircraft, intermittently.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Battle damage. Power control circuits shot away.. Give me a systems
dialog: analyst on the line
speaker_heading: ON ATHENA
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: I am on the line, Starbuck. What's your condition?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: This is no time from trainees, Athena. I'm in real trouble
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: You will be if you keep talking like that. What's your fuel?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Dry.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: All right...run the check with me. Alpha circuit, close and
dialog: alternating to left servo circuit
text: Starbuck reaches into the sparking circuit board dangling from beneath
text: his instrument panel. He closes off a circuit switch.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
text: Alpha circuit closed and alternating to left servo circuit. No
text: response. My throttles are still full open.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
text: Omega "C" circuit, closed and alternating to Servo support circuit.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
text: Alternating to Servo support circuit...
text: Starbuck is perspiring now. The throttle does not respond.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Does not respond...
speaker_heading: ATHENA
text: too, is now beginning to perspire
speaker_heading: TIGH
text: Bring him in full throttle. There's no choice.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: I heard him. Get everyone out of the way. I'm coming in hot...ready
dialog: or not...
speaker_heading: BRIDGE OFFICER
dialog: You're cleared to land...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Roger. I hope you guys aren't counting off for neatness...
text: BACK ON THE BRIDGE
speaker_heading: BRIDGE OFFICER
text: He'll be coming in like a missile.
speaker_heading: TIGH
text: Clear the flight deck for an emergency landing.
text: ON STARBUCK IN HIS SHIP
text: He starts sweating profusely
scene_heading: POINT OF VIEW -STARBUCK'S
text: The rapidly approaching flight deck, racing up closer, closer
speaker_heading: ON ATHENA
text: as she charges out of the elevator in time to see a plane coming in.
text: Suddenly, she is held back.
speaker_heading: DECK HAND
dialog: Stay back...He could lose it.
speaker_heading: ON THE SHIP
text: as it careens down the flight deck, turning sideways and crabbing
dialog: towards the superstructure
speaker_heading: ATHENA
text: breaks from the deck hand's grip and charges off as we hear a long
text: screech, followed by a resounding crash from o.s.
scene_heading: ON STARBUCK'S SHIP
text: impaled on the side of a wall as steam and smoke flood the area.
text: Across the hangar beyond the ship, small emergency vehicles race out
text: of pockets in the walls and towards the ship.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
text: is first to reach the ship as Starbuck flips back the canopy and
text: jumps down the side of the ship. Athena reaches him, throwing her arms around him.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Starbuck, are you all right?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: For a guy who just had a whole fleet shot out from under him, I'm
dialog: fine...
text: The support team comes pulling up.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Give her a good wash, fellas...
text: Starbuck streaks towards the elevators
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: It's been horrible.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Yeah? You should have seen how we spent our day. We managed to single-
dialog: handedly keep the Cylons off your necks while you took off on a little
dialog: cruise...
text: They reach steps and begin to climb
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Starbuck, don't you know what's happened?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Sure, I know what happened. You should see this baby from the air
text: when she slips off across the sky. Beautiful sight, unless she
dialog: happens to be your base ship.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
text: The colonies are gone, Starbuck...all of them.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: What are you talking about? Gone...what'd they do, pack up and sneak
dialog: away like the Galactica?
speaker_heading: ON THE BRIDGE
text: as Starbuck storms into the chamber where the mood is subdued and his
dialog: entrance goes unnoticed
speaker_heading: BRIDGE OFFICER
dialog: Ships are coming in on both decks, sir.
text: The Colonel leaves the map area.
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: What's the count?
speaker_heading: BRIDGE OFFICER
dialog: Sixty-seven fighters in all, sir. Twenty-five of our own.
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: How many battlestars?
text: There is a pregnant pause.
speaker_heading: BRIDGE OFFICER
dialog: None.
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: What???
speaker_heading: BRIDGE OFFICER
dialog: We're the only surviving battlestar...
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: My God... Make the pilots from the other ships as welcome as you
dialog: can...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Little late for that, Colonel...
text: All eyes swing to Starbuck moving in with Athena a few steps behind
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: It was a toss-up whether those guys would land or send in a belly full
text: of torpedoes. Unfortunately, no one had any left.
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: What's the meaning of this insubordination?
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: He doesn't know what happened, Colonel. I don't think any of them
dialog: know.
text: Suddenly, two more pilots are on the flight bridge
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Know what? That the old man turned and ran, leaving a dozen of our
dialog: ships to run out of fuel?
text: Boomer and Jolly come to a stop beside Starbuck.
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: Put the transmissions we monitored back on the scanners, for our young
dialog: patriots...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: If this is going to be a lecture on military protocol...
text: SUDDENLY THE SCANNERS COME TO LIFE
text: Four at a time, each displaying the attack bombing, the confusion, the
dialog: devastation of the colonies
text: SLOWLY PUSHING IN ON THE PILOTS' FACES
text: as they are sobered and horrified by what they see
scene_heading: CLOSE ON SKYLER
text: as he stands on a hill. His fighter ship, a silent sentinel to his
text: back. The glow of a myriad fires dance on his ashen face.
speaker_heading: POINT OF VIEW
text: The flames from thousands of buildings burn far off in the distance.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: turns as he hears what sounds like a mob approaching in the distance
text: ON A DOZEN TORCHES FAR OFF DOWN THE HILL
text: heading in the direction of the aircraft...voices shouting excitedly,
dialog: desperately
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: turns and heads off, taking camera towards a family dwelling. Once a
text: handsome structure laid out in half circles, now carved down the
text: middle by some unseen evil. One half of the dwelling is charred
dialog: remnants
text: INSIDE THE DWELLING ON ADAMA
text: He is illuminated across the darkened room by a rectangular candle
text: with twelve wicks. He stands by a wall covered with photographs of
text: himself, his two sons and a daughter. We recognize Athena, Skyler and
text: a second son, Zac. A handsome woman is also pictured with the family
text: and alone in several beautiful portraits taking her from a girl of
text: seventeen to fifty years. Tears well up in Adama's eyes as he takes
text: the oldest photo of his wife in hand
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: I'm sorry, Ila. I was never there when it mattered. Never.
text: The tears begin to stream down his cheeks as the memories of a
text: thousand lost moments and lost opportunities race through his mind.
text: Suddenly, he turns to see Skyler standing across the room.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: I didn't hear you come in. I was just gathering a few remembrances.
dialog: You want this likeness of you and Zac?
text: Skyler snaps back, his mood hardening against the hurt
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: No...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Look, there are crowds coming. They probably saw our ship land...
text: Adama stiffens
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: I'll be a few more minutes
text: Skyler turns to leave, then seems to soften, turning back.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Maybe she wasn't here. Maybe...
text: The Commander looks at Skyler with finality.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: She was here...
text: Skyler nods and slowly withdraws.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE DWELLING - THE CITIZENS WITH TORCHES
text: have approached to within fifty yards of the sleek fighter ship. Their
text: voices are pitched and angular as they stride down the gentle incline
text: towards Skyler, who moves out to meet them, warily gauging their
text: hostile cries.
speaker_heading: SANDELL
dialog: Where are they? Where're the rest of your fancy fliers?
speaker_heading: LOBE
dialog: Where were you, lad, when they were killing everyone in sight? What
dialog: were you doing, boy?
text: As they close the gap to within a few feet of Skyler and seem bent on
text: taking him apart, a woman's voice calls out
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Wait!
text: For a moment, there is hesitation. The mob parts as Lyra steps
text: forward, holding a small boy by the hand.
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Let him talk.
text: She continues on out until she is face-to-face with Skyler.
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Before they do what they will with you, I'd like to know where you
dialog: were. Where were all of you? We waited...we watched and prayed...but
dialog: you never came...
text: Skyler looks down at the small, innocent face looking up from beside
text: Lyra, a child with dirt and confusion in his innocent eyes.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Most of us are dead.
text: The crowd breaks into an undertone of awe...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: The fleet is all but destroyed.
text: The crowd breaks into cries of despair and anguish
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: But you are here...where did you come from?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: The battlestar Galactica
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Survived...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: And what of the President and the Council of the Twelve...and the
dialog: other colonies. Surely we can fight back. We have the will and at
dialog: long last, after hundreds of years, we are united...all twelve
dialog: colonies. They cannot possibly defeat our combined strength...
text: A voice from offstage commands their attention
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: We became as one too late.
text: The group is stunned to find so imperious a figure as one of the
dialog: Council of the Twelve amongst them.
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Commander Adama...
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Miss Lyra.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
text: Then it's true. We are defeated...doomed.
text: Skyler and the Commander exchange looks. The little boy, Boxey, stares
text: up at Skyler admiringly

dialog: Can I ride in your ship, Mister?
text: Skyler bends down and picks him up. Skyler looks at the lad, then at
text: Adama pointedly.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Fighter ships are no place for boys...
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: They're going to have to be if our people are going to survive...
text: Adama turns and walks off to the edge of the bluff overlooking the
text: burning cities beyond. Lyra moves up behind him, beside Skyler who
text: is carrying the young child.
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: We are going to fight back...we can't simply give up.
text: The Commander seems deep in thought as he looks out over the ruins.
text: Then he turns and looks past Lyra and Skyler...past the boy
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Yes, we are going to fight back.
text: A cry of bravado goes up from the torch-bearing mob...cries of
dialog: satisfaction, of frustration, of vented anger
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: But not here...not now...not in the colonies...not even in this star
dialog: system. Let the word go forth to every man, woman and child who has
dialog: survived this infamy. Tell them to set sail at once in every assorted
dialog: vehicle that will carry them...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: There isn't time to arrange provision, Father. The Cylons will be
dialog: sending landing parties to eradicate the survivors. If we could send
dialog: in our remaining fighters...
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: No. There are too many of them and too few of us. There is a time to
dialog: fight, and a time to withdraw...to fight another day.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: But there is no way to board the entire population on the Galactica.
dialog: And we have no troop carriers, nothing that can make light speed.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: We'll use what we do have. Every inner-galactic passenger liner,
dialog: freighter, taxi...even inner colony buses...air taxis...anything
dialog: that will carry our people into the stars...
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: And when they have gathered in the stars...?
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: We will lead them...and protect them...until they are strong again...
text: The group facing the Commander turn, exchanging curious looks. Either

text: ON THE RAG TAG FLEET
text: assembling among the stars. As they move by camera, we see lettering
text: of every description, color and text. A bulbous vessel, bearing the
text: signet, "TRANS-STELLAR SPACE SERVICE"...an immense vehicle with the
text: lettering "GEMINI FREIGHT"...a small space tram, "TAURON BUS LINES"...
text: a long-range passenger liner with lettering and initials in a
text: non-descript, unfamiliar text, dominated by three large symbols on its
text: tail structure...as far as the eye could perceive, a fleet of vehicles
dialog: of every assortment, size and shape...
scene_heading: BACK TO ADAMA'S VOICE
speaker_heading: ADAMA'S VOICE
dialog: In all, two hundred and twenty ships representing every colony, color
dialog: and creed in the star system. The human race might have one more
dialog: chance, but it would first have to survive the Alliance...the elements
text: and the unknown dark and sinister threats that would lie ahead
text: ON A CYLON BASE SHIP
text: hovering over Caprica
scene_heading: TWO CYLON WARSHIPS
text: approach the Cylon mother ship
scene_heading: INSIDE THE INNER CHAMBER
text: a side door opens and two Cylon warriors cross towards the center
text: pedestal with a human between them. He is Baltar. One of the two
text: sentries beside Baltar speaks.
speaker_heading: SENTRY
dialog: At your command.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: Welcome, Baltar. You have done well.
text: Baltar looks as if he is about to attack the Leader...obviously an
dialog: unwise move
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: I have done well...What have you done? What of our bargain? My colony
dialog: was to be spared!
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: The bargain was altered.
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: How can you change one side of a bargain?
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: But there is no other side. You have missed the entire point of the
dialog: war.
text: Baltar's resolve, his anger, is replaced by a creeping concern that
text: he has erred in his evaluation of the man before him.
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: I don't know what you mean.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: I mean, there could be no dominion over the species so long as man
dialog: remained a power within the Universe. It was man or the Alliance.
dialog: There could be no compromise.
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: But you have what you want...the threat no longer exists...I delivered
dialog: my end of the bargain. My dominion was to be spared.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: There can be only one dominion...one power... one authority...there
dialog: must be no exceptions.
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: But I have no ambitions against you!
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: Could you think me so foolish as to trust a man who would see his own
dialog: race destroyed?
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: Not destroyed, subjugated...under me.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: There can be no survivors. So long as one human remains alive, the
text: Alliance is threatened.
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: Surely you don't mean me?
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: We thank you for your help, Baltar. Your time is at an end...
text: The Leader nods and the two ominous sentries on either side of Baltar
text: lift him from the floor, one on each arm, and begin to take him away.
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: No...you can't...you still need me...
scene_heading: ON THE LEADER
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: Send the flight leader in.
speaker_heading: ON THE DOOR
text: A sentry enters and stands aside as the flight leader enters. He moves
text: directly to the center of the room.
speaker_heading: FLIGHT LEADER
dialog: At your command...
speaker_heading: LEADER
text: Report on the final assault on the human colonies.
speaker_heading: FLIGHT LEADER
text: The ships all report similar circumstances. The initial attack was so
dialog: effective, there were no survivors.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: (incredulously)
dialog: No survivors!!! On any of the twelve colonies?
speaker_heading: FLIGHT LEADER
dialog: That is correct, Imperious Leader.
text: Slowly push into the Imperious Leader's knowing gaze...
text: ON THE RAG TAG FLEET
text: Countless ships of every description scattered across the sky behind

dialog: lead vehicle and see its name
speaker_heading: "GALACTICA"
scene_heading: IN A LARGE COUNCIL CHAMBER
text: Commander Adama stands before a large, seated gathering, the starfield
dialog: to his back
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Long, long ago...whether thousand or millions of year is
dialog: unimportant...our recorded history tells us that we descended from a
text: mother civilization, a race that set out into the universe to
dialog: establish colonies. Those of us here now represent every known
text: surviving colony, save one. A sister world far out in the universe,
dialog: only remembered to us through ancient writings. It is my intention to
text: seek out that remaining colony, that last outpost of humanity in the
dialog: universe. A civilization like our own, to ask their help in
dialog: rebuilding...and perhaps, to warn them of an evil Alliance and their
dialog: intention to eradicate all mankind.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT STARBUCK
text: rises to his feet. All around him are other fighter pilots.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Lieutenant Starbuck, you have a question?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Yes, sir. If we're talking about the same colony, I remember reading
dialog: about it in ancient mythology. I don't think anybody even knows where
dialog: it is, and if our own ship is any indication, we barely have enough
dialog: fuel to get out of this galaxy.
text: Starbuck sits as a surge of agreement sweeps through the room.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: A very good point. It will be our plan to find a fuel source and
dialog: extended provisions before we leave the star system.
text: Colonel Tigh rises to his feet.
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: Commander, I feel I speak for the vast majority when I say this is
text: hardly a fleet of sturdy, well-equipped soldiers up to battling the
dialog: universe. Most of these people barely got away with their lives.
text: They're emotionally and physically unprepared for the kind of journey
dialog: you propose.
text: The crowd seems to agree as Skyler is now on his feet, as well.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: And less than a third of the ships we're escorting can make light
dialog: speed. It could take us generations to find this colony.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: And we'll find it because we have no choice. If we stay in this star
dialog: system, the Alliance will find us. We'll travel only as fast as our
dialog: slowest ship. We'll be only as strong as our weakest brother. We are
text: the only surviving battlestar, but the combined pilots that survived
dialog: ours and the other ships are the best in all the universe. They are
dialog: up to the task of protecting each and every one of you.
speaker_heading: LYRA
text: rises to her feet. We recognize her as the newswoman from Caprica.
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Commander Adama...forgive the void in my education, but star
dialog: mythology was never my best subject. This thirteenth colony...
dialog: this other world...where is it? What is it called?
text: Adama takes a long pause as he scans the audience, then turns to the
text: starfield and gazes at it like a man searching the horizon for a
text: glimpse of a sail beyond a sea.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: I cannot tell you that I know precisely where it is...but it lies
dialog: beyond this star system in a galaxy like our own. As for the planet's
dialog: name...
text: Adama looks back to the expectant throng...
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: It is called Earth.
text: A long beat as excitement builds through the congregation.
speaker_heading: END OF HOUR ONE
speaker_heading: HOUR TWO
speaker_heading: FADE IN
speaker_heading: ON THE GALACTICA

scene_heading: IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM
text: Adama stands before a translucent starmap, addressing a council of
dialog: elders
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Our course, while indirect and arduous, has successfully brought us
text: to the outermost reaches of the star system without encountering
dialog: Cylon patrols. If we can hold out for another eight or nine centons,
dialog: we can reach the planet Carillon.
text: Adama turns and moves back to face the main body
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: There, hopefully we can find fuel, water, and prepare fresh stores
dialog: of food...
speaker_heading: ON ANTON
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: Hopefully? My dear Commander, there is not one amongst us who is not
dialog: grateful beyond words for your vision and resourcefulness in saving
dialog: us all from certain death. Are we now to throw it all away...
dialog: Anton rises
speaker_heading: ANTON
text: As of this moment, we face a crisis no less lethal than the Cylon war
dialog: machine. I would rather see my loved ones extinguished in the micron
text: flash of a Cylon cannon than drift in fuelless vehicles while
text: starvation, dehydration, and suffocation agonize us one by one.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Anton, it was hardly possible to adequately prepare ourselves for the
dialog: journey we've had to undertake. We had to leave. We had no choice.
text: Anton moves to the map.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: But we have a choice now. We can stop here on Borallus. We know that
dialog: everything we need is here...food, water, fuel...
text: There are waves of approval throughout the room
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: And undoubtedly a Cylon task force.
text: A murmur races through the room
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: It is the most logical place for us to stop. Precisely why I believe
dialog: it would be fatal to do so.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: Possibly fatal. Is it not surely fatal to continue towards Carillon...
dialog: Colonel Tigh rises
speaker_heading: TIGH
text: Commander...the situation has reached crisis levels. Rations have
dialog: already been cut by two-thirds. How much more can we conserve?
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: As much as we have to, to reach Carillon. It is our only hope.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: The Cylons will be looking even unto those far reaches.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
text: There is a path here, through the Nova of Madagon. Not patrolled, and
text: a savings of some two centons in reaching Carillon.
text: A gasp is heard throughout the council as Adama points to a course
text: through the starfield.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: Commander, while I may not be a military expert, even I know that the
text: Cylons avoid patrolling that area by mining it to make passage
dialog: impossible.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Not impossible. We will do it. We have no other choice.
text: ON THE BODY OF ELDERS
text: Their faces are grim
text: ON A CYLON BASE SHIP
text: hanging ominously in the sky
scene_heading: INSIDE THE INNER CHAMBER
text: two Cylon Centurians enter with Baltar between them. Baltar is a
text: different man than the one who strode arrogantly before the Imperious
dialog: one.
scene_heading: ON THE IMPERIOUS LEADER
speaker_heading: CENTURIAN
dialog: By your command...
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: The people of Cylon wish to offer you an opportunity to serve, Baltar.
text: Baltar searches for deception in the Leader's words, but he is too
text: resigned to death to challenge the unexpected words.
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: To serve...?
speaker_heading: LEADER
text: It appears that a small band of refugee humans eluded the Alliance...
text: Baltar seems to stand a little taller
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: I tried to forewarn you...
text: The Centurians hurl Baltar to the flood and hold staffs against the
text: back of his head.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: I offer you life, and you question my judgment? Dangerous....
speaker_heading: BALTAR
text: raises his head slightly
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: Kill me...
text: The Imperious Leader stares at Baltar. The Centurians waiting for a
text: sign to kill him.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: Let him rise
text: The Centurians remove their staffs. Baltar climbs to his feet.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: I sense a bargain...
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: We bargained before and it left me a dead man. This time I will have
dialog: my reward before I serve you.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: The entire Alliance serves me. Why do I need you?
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: Why do you spare me? Because you fear man. You do not understand him.
dialog: When your forces had taken and put the entire nation of Tucana into
dialog: slavery, man was there to break the chains. When you chose to dominate
dialog: the people of Gaelon, man was there to make the Galics strong, to help
text: them seek their own destiny. The Cylon is content to serve. Man is
dialog: born to lead. But I can succeed where you have failed.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: What is your bargain?
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: When I find the survivors of the colonies...they are mine.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: And how to you propose to protect this bargain?
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: There are those who will follow me...away from your influence...away
dialog: from your interests...
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: All the stars interest me...
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: You can have no reign on tyranny. There is room for all...
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: You appear as a man, but you think like a Cylon.
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: The better to serve you, while serving myself.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: You will need Centurians.
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: Two will be adequate.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: Only two...??
text: Baltar looks from the Centurian on his left to the Centurian on his
dialog: right
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: These two...
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: Your arrogance will destroy you.
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: I would rather die by my own hand, than yours.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: So be it...they are yours...
text: Baltar smiles, nods and turns...
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: Come along, boys...
text: As Baltar moves off, the Centurians stand stoically awaiting
dialog: instructions from the Imperious Leader
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: Go with him...Serve me!!
speaker_heading: CENTURIAN
dialog: By your order...
text: They turn and move off as we close into a very troubled Imperious

speaker_heading: COLONIAL MOVERS

scene_heading: INSIDE AN ENGINE AREA
text: Skyler crawls out from an access area beneath some mechanical gear...
text: is hands and face soiled as his Captain markings on his shoulders are
text: the only indications of military rank. He turns to a tool kit to put
text: away some instruments, taking us to an older man...
speaker_heading: JENSING
dialog: I understand two other ships have already broken down...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: And twenty-two have run out of fuel.
text: Skyler closes his tool his and rises...looking grim
speaker_heading: JENSING
dialog: It's serious?
text: Skyler looks at the man whose face bears the emotional scars of too
dialog: many recent disasters
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Until we stop for materials or find minerals to make our own, I just
dialog: can't repair it...and you'll never be able to keep up with the fleet
dialog: like it is.
speaker_heading: JENSING
dialog: But what will we do...?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: We'll have to transfer everyone off of this ship to one of the others.
dialog: How many people on board?
text: A beautiful young lady enters
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Twenty-nine...
text: Skyler turns and smiles
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Well, a celebrity. I would have thought you could have pulled a little
text: space on one of the plush passenger liners.
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: I have no interest in pulling space. This ship was assigned to me.
speaker_heading: JENSING
dialog: She's being charitable. We asked her if she'd come with us to see if
dialog: she could help us with the little boy.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Little boy?
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: You remember the child found in the bombing? The Jensings lived in the
text: same module as Boxey's parents who were killed in the first wave...
speaker_heading: JENSING
text: He doesn't sleep and he doesn't eat...even emergency rations. In fact,
text: Lyra is the only one he'll even talk to.
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: That's about all I can get him to do. He lost a little daggit which
dialog: apparently meant everything to him. I thought you might help.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: If he won't eat for you, I don't know what I can do.
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: He seemed to spark a little when you picked him up on Caprica. I got
dialog: the feeling you were good with children.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: (introspectively)
dialog: I grew up with a kid brother...
text: IN A NARROW COMPANIONWAY
text: off of which countless cubicles have been formed as living quarters in
text: the hold of this cargo vessel. Skyler looks into the faces and lives
text: of the refugees occupying the rooms which are open, partially open,
text: and in a few cases, entirely curtained off with makeshift draperies.
text: They arrive at a room which is draped shut. There is only a night
text: light on inside. Skyler looks at Lyra. She gestures inside. Skyler
text: reaches into his back pocket and withdraws his military cap with its
text: scrambled eggs and insignia of the Colonial Warriors. He enters...
scene_heading: INSIDE A TINY CUBICLE
text: Spartan in its furnishings, the night light illuminates the face of a
text: young boy, who lies staring at the ceiling...wide awake
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Excuse me...I hope I'm not interrupting anything...
text: Boxey's eyes widen
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: I'm in charge of finding young men to try out as future fighter
dialog: pilots. Your name is Boxey, correct?
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: Uh-huh...
text: Skyler nods and moves to the bed and crouches beside it
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Good. I've been looking all over for you. You should have made contact
dialog: with the Commander. You know we're very short on pilots...
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: I'm too little to be a pilot...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Oh sure, right now, but how long do you think it takes to become a
dialog: full Colonial Warrior?
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: You have to start when you're very small, or you won't get these until
dialog: you have gray hair.
text: Boxey lifts his head to see what Skyler is pointing to on his
text: shoulders. The young lad's eyes show their first glimmer of interest
text: as they see Captain's emblems.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: You like them?
text: Then as quickly as the interest appeared, it vanishes and the youth
text: withdraws to his pillow
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: I want Muffit...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Well, I don't know. There isn't much room for a daggit in a fighter
dialog: plane.
speaker_heading: BOXEY
text: He's gone. He ran away.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Oh? Well, maybe we can find one of Muffit's friends?
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: There are no daggits...I asked...
text: Skyler steals a helpless look at Lyra, who looks back, both
text: appreciatively and sympathetically.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Well, I'll tell you what...
text: Skyler removes an emblem from his shoulder and places it on Boxey's
dialog: night clothes
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: As Colonial Warrior First Level, you are entitled to the first daggit
dialog: that comes along
text: Skyler rises and starts out of the room, then hesitates at the door
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: But only on the condition that you get your rest, eat all of your
dialog: primaries, and stop chasing girls. Good night, Officer...
text: Skyler salutes and exits with Lyra. Behind them, Boxey steals a peek
text: at the emblem on his pajamas. He clutches it in his hand and stares
text: at the darkened ceiling as we move to see the far off look which
text: windows the confused world of a six year old boy.
scene_heading: IN THE CORRIDOR
text: Skyler waits as Lyra moves up to him
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Thank you. I was right; you are good with kids. You and your brother
dialog: must be very close.
text: Skyler steps away
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: We were.
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: I'm sorry! The war?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: I suppose...
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Look, if you'd rather not involve yourself...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Don't be silly. What's a Warrior to do after he's lost the big one...
dialog: win a few of the little ones...
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: That's not a little one in their, Captain. You win that one, you've
dialog: accomplished something.
text: ON A LARGE SHIP WITH THREE GIANT PODS
text: The livery ship. Three large circular compartments, connected by long,
text: narrow metal corridors. Skyler walks with Starbuck down a corridor.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: I don't think I can help you, Skyler. Other than fixing the landing
dialog: servos on this livery machine, the only thing I know about livestock,
text: which includes daggits, is that they've run out of food to feed them.
dialog: Let me show you...
text: They have entered one of the large circular pods, taking us to a ring
text: of animals all facing into a central feeding device. The animals are
text: in pairs, each pair representing a different species. Starbuck leads
text: Skyler to one of the stalls where we find two unicorns, one lying on
dialog: its side.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: How long has he been like that?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: He collapsed last night just after I was brought on board. You know
text: unicorns are very monogamous. His lady's in foal. They think he's
dialog: been letting her have his share of the food ration. If we could have
dialog: stopped at Borallus...
text: Skyler storms away
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: We couldn't stop. The Cylons would have been there...waiting...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Well, when these animals are gone, they're gone. We'll just have to
dialog: accept the fact that generations will grow up without ever having
dialog: seen a unicorn... or a tagon...or a...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: There wouldn't have been any generations of anything if we'd stopped.
dialog: I would have made the same decision as my father.
text: Starbuck moves after Skyler
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Okay...okay...it's just rough to have to watch them slip away, one at
dialog: a time...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: I'll tell you what's rough...We've got a little boy in the same
dialog: condition. Are you sure no one brought any daggits along someplace in
dialog: this whole fleet?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: No. We're both out of luck...I already checked.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Both out of luck! You checked for daggits? Why?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Daggit racing...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: What's one of the most awful things that can happen to people on a
dialog: long voyage?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: They die...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Not that awful. I'm talking about things to do for excitement.
text: Skyler's interest plunges into disgust
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: Fifty million Cylons chasing us all over the stars...our ships are
dialog: falling apart...there's nothing to eat...and you're worried about
dialog: excitement.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Well, when you put it like that...Anyway, I got the idea before it
dialog: began to look like we weren't going to make it at all...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: We're going to make it...the animals, too.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Tell him...
text: Starbuck and Skyler have arrived at a droid whose front is open,
text: exposing its workings. There are tools in front of the machine,
text: suggesting that Starbuck has been working on it.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: How's it going this morning, Zeus?
text: A slightly effete but benevolent voice responds
speaker_heading: ZEUS
dialog: Not well... All species receiving inadequate food supplements to
dialog: survive the voyage to the planet Carillon...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: You're wrong, Zeus. Commander Adama has just decided to take a chance
dialog: through the Nova of Madagon. That'll cut two centons off of the
dialog: journey...
speaker_heading: ZEUS
text: The Nova of Madegon is mined by the Alliance. The percentile risk of
text: successfully traversing the strait makes it statistically impossible.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Is that right?
speaker_heading: ZEUS
dialog: Yes, that's right.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: ZEUS
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: ZEUS
dialog: Thank you
text: Starbuck shakes his head
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Idiot...
speaker_heading: ZEUS
dialog: I beg your pardon...
text: Now it's Skyler's turn to react. His face lights up. He, too, has seen
dialog: the light.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Starbuck...that's the answer...You've saved a life...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Never mind...Thanks...I owe you one...
text: Skyler turns and hustles out. Starbuck looks after him
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Malnutrition...it's getting to everyone. All right, Zeus, now we have
dialog: to reprogram some of your circuits for landing on a planet. Do you
dialog: understand?
speaker_heading: ZEUS
dialog: Why did you call me an idiot?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Oh, for crying out loud...

text: Starbuck and Skyler viewing a monitor
speaker_heading: ADAMA
text: The Nova of Madegon is not a Nova at all, but a starfield so bright
dialog: your cockpits will be sealed to prevent blindness. You will navigate
dialog: by scanner and sweep everything out of your path with turbolasers.
dialog: Any questions?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Yes, sir. Would this be an appropriate time for me to take my sick
dialog: leave?
text: A small, nervous laugh. Adama smiles the longest and seems to take his
text: time answering the quip.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: It would, but request denied. I didn't arrive at you two to lead us
dialog: through without a great deal of anguish. If it will do any good, let
dialog: me assure you that should you fail...no one will survive. Therefore,
dialog: you have the advantage of controlling your own fate. The rest of us
dialog: must sit in anticipation of your skill...
dialog: Skyler rises
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Or lack thereof...
scene_heading: IN AN OUTER CORRIDOR
text: Adama exits a room and is accosted by Athena. Adama does not stop
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Father...I can't believe you're doing this! Why couldn't you have
dialog: listened to the others. We should have stopped at Borallus. We
dialog: wouldn't have to be taking this awful chance with their lives...
text: Adama stops and looks at Athena.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Whose lives?
speaker_heading: ATHENA
text: Starbuck's and Skyler's.
text: A knowing look crosses Adama's face
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: You place Lieutenant Starbuck's name ahead of your brother's.
dialog: Curious...
text: She turns away
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: And here I'm supposed to be all-knowing
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: I didn't know myself until I heard he was going. It's all so
dialog: hopeless...If they survive this... if any of us survive...What next...
dialog: How long before we find Earth?
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Perhaps never.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: That's what I was thinking, Father. We could grow old waiting. I
dialog: mean, we may never have the chance...to...
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: To get married and have children and a home...
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Well, I think it's premature for you to be worrying about old age. I,
dialog: on the other hand, ought to give a great deal of thought to this
dialog: voyage...If it should go on and on...
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: But you have to lead them. You're all that's left.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: No, you're left...and Skyler and Lieutenant Starbuck and Colonel Tigh
dialog: and...well, so many more good people. That's why the journey is worth
dialog: any sacrifice. There are so many people worth saving... and beginning
dialog: again...
text: Athena hugs her father
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: I'm sorry if I spoke out of turn before...I've never faced death
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: You faced senseless killing as you should have... with horror. That's
dialog: the difference between humans and the Alliance. We don't waste life,
dialog: we only risk it when there is no other choice...as in this case, where
dialog: the very survival of the human race may ride on three young men...
speaker_heading: ON SKYLER

speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: I may not be able to see anything, but it's sure getting hot. You
dialog: picking up the field on your scanner?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Negative...my scanner's burning up...
speaker_heading: SKYLER'S VOICE
dialog: I was afraid of that. It's too bright for the scanner...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: And a little too late to turn back, I'd say. What do we do?
speaker_heading: SKYLER'S VOICE
dialog: Only one thing I can think of...hold positions and blast away...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: What if we miss a mine?
speaker_heading: SKYLER'S VOICE
dialog: One of us will be the first to know it. Let's go.

speaker_heading: TIGH

speaker_heading: ATHENA
text: Now that's precision flying! Starbuck really knows what he's doing.
speaker_heading: ON STARBUCK
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Are we hitting anything? I can't see a blessed thing.
speaker_heading: SKYLER

speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Landing operations will begin at once.
text: Adama turns to address the gathering of military officers
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Our mineral scanners have located what we believe is the approximate
text: site of the old mining expedition. Captain Skyler will lead a military
text: sortie to the surface.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Will any civilian personnel be allowed to land?
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Only those responsible for the farming operation. We will make
dialog: exceptions only for extreme cases, medical or otherwise.
text: IN A CORRIDOR ABOARD THE MOVING VAN
text: Lyra moves along with Skyler
speaker_heading: LYRA
text: Still won't eat...doesn't sleep. Commander Adama even granted
dialog: permission for him to go down onto Carillon and help care for the
dialog: livestock. It would do him a world of good.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: I think I have something that'll interest him.
scene_heading: IN A MAINTENANCE LABORATORY
text: in which we find a row of droids staring at us. WIDEN to see Doctor
text: Wilker leaving a bench at which a scope is connected to a droid and
text: sending out pulses which make a hand function up and down. The o.s.
text: sound of a door opening automatically brings the Doctor around.
scene_heading: SKYLER, LYRA AND BOXEY
text: enter. Doctor Wilker leaves his bench and walks up to greet them
speaker_heading: WILKER
dialog: Ah, Captain Skyler. Right on time. We've been expecting you. Is this
dialog: the young officer who's been put in charge of the new project?
text: Skyler swings a look down to Boxey, who is now half-hiding behind him
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Well, I haven't had time to fully discuss the project with him. It's
dialog: our hope that he'll accept.
text: Boxey pulls on Skyler's leg. Skyler looks down
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: (whispered)
dialog: I want to go back to my cubicle.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Boxey, this is a military order. We have to at least hear the Doctor
dialog: out. Tell us more about the project, Doctor.
speaker_heading: WILKER
dialog: Well, as you know, we will soon be landing on various alien planets.
dialog: It's important that we be safe. Ordinarily, we'd have trained daggits
dialog: to stand watch at night when our Warriors are asleep in their
dialog: encampments, but we don't have any daggits. So, we had to see what
dialog: we could come up with. We'll call the first one, Muffit Two.
text: Boxey looks up at Skyler
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: What'd he say?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: I didn't really get it all, Doctor. Maybe you'd better show us.
speaker_heading: WILKER
dialog: Right. Oh, Lanzer...
text: A young man moves from the back of the lab holding something in his
text: arms. It is large and friendly-looking. It has curly hair implanted
text: all over it and as Lanzer puts it down on the ground, it begins to
text: bark in a high-pitched, friendly tone and move towards Boxey. When it
text: gets there, it stops. Its tongue comes out; it begins to pant, and
text: its tail wags frantically from where it protrudes through a hole at
text: the back of the droid's silver skin.
speaker_heading: WILKER
dialog: Naturally, the first one will have to be looked after very carefully.
text: Boxey stares at the small droid incredulously
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: That's not Muffit. It's not even a real daggit.
speaker_heading: WILKER
dialog: No, but it can learn to be like a real one. It's very smart. If you
dialog: would help us, he'll be even smarter.
text: Boxey continues to stare at the daggit. The daggit, in turn, continues
dialog: to pant
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: Stop that.
text: The daggit stops panting and cocks its head quizzically
speaker_heading: BOXEY
text: begins to show the hint of a smile. He turns and takes a step away
text: from the small droid. The droid stares. Boxey moves a few more feet,
text: then moves off down the corridor. The daggit rises and follows after
dialog: him
speaker_heading: DOCTOR WILKER
text: turns to Lyra and Skyler
speaker_heading: WILKER
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: We used the image of Boxey you gave us to train the droid to respond
dialog: to him
speaker_heading: ON BOXEY
text: as he stops at the end of the corridor and turns to look at the
text: daggit. He opens his arms. The small droid moves forward, sits up on
text: his hind legs and puts his paws on Boxey's small chest. Boxey turns
text: his cheek against the small companion and smiles back up the corridor
text: at Lyra and Skyler and the Doctor. It is love at first sight.
scene_heading: ON SKYLER, LYRA AND WILKER
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: That's one I owe you, Doc...
dialog: He smiles
speaker_heading: WILKER
dialog: Any time...
text: As he leaves, Lyra turns to Skyler with a warmth she hasn't felt
dialog: since before the holocaust...when the world turned dark.
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: That's one I owe you, Skyler.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Any time...

speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: It has been seven centons, and not one word of the humans. What have
dialog: you to say, Baltar?
text: Baltar stands before the Leader, confident and illusive
speaker_heading: BALTAR
text: Their doom is imminent.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: You know where they are...
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: I know where they will be.
text: Baltar smiles confidently and turns to leave
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: I have not dismissed you.
text: Baltar stops...looks back
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: You want them...Then I must go
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: You know that when you have found them, you will yet have to deal
dialog: with me for your arrogance.
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: Yes...but this time, I will be prepared.
text: As Baltar turns and exits, we push in on the Imperious Leader, his
text: hatred for Baltar growing with every centon.
scene_heading: ON STARBUCK, BOOMER, SKYLER AND JOLLY
text: standing on the surface of Carillon, their fighter ships in the
text: background. It is not day; it is not night. An odd illumination from
text: two moons gives the planet a midnight sun effect
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: I wonder what it's like in the daytime.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: This is the daytime...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Lovely. I can't imagine why it isn't overpopulated.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: My scanner reads life forms beyond that hill. Either it's some high-
dialog: energy-yielding substance or they left some kind of caretaker
text: operation behind when they abandoned this place. Starbuck and Boomer,
dialog: you take the shuttle and check it out. Jolly, you go to work on the
dialog: livery detail with your squadron. I'll use mine to start checking out
dialog: this area for signs of the old mine. Everybody sync your chronometers.
dialog: I want a check in every four millicentons on the security frequency.
dialog: Understood?
text: Everyone nods and pressed their wrist chronometers which emit random,
text: out-of-sync tones at odd intervals at first, then come into sync, so
text: that in effect we hear a pattern of steady, rhythmic pulses.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Let's go.
text: The men all turn and head off in varying directions. As they do, we
text: pan and move into one of many formations in the area that look like
text: the edge of a crater or giant ant hill or...
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: To Starbuck and Boomer moving off, we are looking down the sights of
text: a strange-looking weapon. Suddenly, a hand moves in and pushes the
dialog: barrel down
scene_heading: CLOSE ON TWO SMALL CREATURES
text: They are insect-like, approximately five feet tall, large, bulbous
text: eyes and four arms. Seetol turns and nods, taking camera to a third
text: creature who also carries a weapon with two hands and turns to work
text: a machine device with a third and fourth hand. A faint whine can be
text: heard and the three creatures slowly begin to submerge down into the
dialog: crater
scene_heading: ON A SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGEWAY
text: the pod appears in a cell-like opening. The three creatures step off.
text: One remains at the elevator-like structure; the other two move off
text: down the passage, which is alive with a pulsating golden light coming
text: from the cell-like panels
scene_heading: ON ANOTHER CELL-LIKE OPENING
text: As the two creatures move up a passageway towards it. They arrive and
text: we pan with them, taking camera to an immense chamber deep beneath the
dialog: earth
speaker_heading: THE MINE
text: is a giant, beehive-like structure with countless levels and
text: honeycomb-like compartments. We ca see workers busily poking at walls
text: and withdrawing ore, which is, in turn, placed in small vehicles which
text: other workers are maneuvering throughout the multicorridored structure
scene_heading: INSIDE A CHOSEN CHAMBER
text: Very plush. A creature sits on a cushioned floor, surrounded by slaves
dialog: serving all manners of personal needs, from playing a sitar and a
text: bee's hum, pruning or manicuring two of the chosen creature's limbs,
text: and providing some kind of smoking device for occasional puffs...
speaker_heading: SEETOL
dialog: enters
speaker_heading: SEETOL
dialog: They have come.
text: The voice is that of a girl...soft and pleasant. The next voice is
text: that of the Queen of the hive...deeper, just as soft, but infinitely
dialog: more refined
speaker_heading: LOTAY
dialog: Don't disturb them. It will only stir them up. They'll be perfectly
dialog: harmless unless angered or frightened.
text: Seetol nods, bows, and withdraws as Lotay draws on the strange pipe
text: ON THE LIVERY SHIP
text: sitting far in the background as animals are being led into the
dialog: foreground
speaker_heading: ON SKYLER
text: as he points out a meadow area bordered on all sides by short, rocky
text: hills. Jensing looks on with several other farmer.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: We'll use nitrogen injection in that area. It looks level enough that
dialog: we won't have to bring down soil movers
text: The ranchers nod and move off as Boomer and Jolly come running up
speaker_heading: JOLLY
dialog: Captain, we aren't alone on this planet. You'd better come right away.
text: Skyler gives Jolly a worried look and follows after him
speaker_heading: ON GREENBEAN
text: with his sidearm in hand, his shaking hand extended in front of him
text: with the weight and fate of his people dispersed on his nervous face.
dialog: Skyler and Jolly charge up
speaker_heading: GREENBEAN
dialog: No doubt about it, Captain. Someone's here besides up. Look at that...
text: Skyler swings his look over to some rocks. He sees nothing at first,
text: then looks down and sees a snarling face. It is Muffit Two
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: All right, Ensign, I'll handle it. Put up your weapon.
text: Skyler moves forward as Greenbean and Jolly watch warily
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Come on, Muffy...here boy.
text: The robot dog prances out from behind the rocks, his tail wagging.
text: Skyler bends down and pats the droid on the head
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Where's Boxey? Go find Boxey.
text: The droid takes off towards the livery ships
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: It's obvious you guys haven't boned up in your manual on dealing with
text: natives on friendly planets.
text: Skyler turns and moves off, leaving Greenbean and Jolly in confusion
text: SOMEPLACE ELSE ON THE SURFACE OF CARILLON
text: The shuttle can be seen resting far in the b.g. as Starbuck climbs
text: over the rocky crest of a hill and looks down. His face suddenly
dialog: reflects an awesome find
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Boomer...
speaker_heading: ON BOOMER
text: climbing up to the crest over jagged rocks
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: Yeah...yeah...what is it now...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: You aren't going to believe this, Boomer...
text: Boomer nears the top
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: Feeling is believing...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: (dazzled)
dialog: No, I mean really...
text: Boomer reaches the crest and looks. His mouth falls open
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: I don't believe it...
scene_heading: POINT OF VIEW - PARADEESE de FESTIVE'
text: Far down a steep, rocky incline within the walls of a canyon, a
text: carnival of color and lights and spherical glass set amidst greenery
text: and pools of water, in a narrow valley of cliffs. People and creatures
text: come and go amidst laughter and song.
scene_heading: BOOMER AND STARBUCK
dialog: exchange blank stares
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: What is it?
text: Starbuck shakes his head dumbfounded
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: I don't know.
text: Starbuck rises up, drawing his sidearm, and carefully starts down the
dialog: steep incline
text: ACROSS A CLEARING AMIDST THE POOLS OF WATER AND GARDENS
text: creatures and people move up and down the paths, laughing gaily.
text: Beyond them, Starbuck and Boomer appear, still completely disoriented
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: It sure is pretty...and it sure sounds friendly...
text: A scream from o.s. They wheel around
text: A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN
text: is staring at Starbuck and Boomer
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Don't shoot!! What do you want?
text: Starbuck embarrassingly looks at the weapon in his hand and quickly
text: puts it away, smiling
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: I mean no harm. You're from Taura...
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Yes, I'm a Taurus. How'd you know that?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: The dialect...What is this...What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: What am I doing here??? What are you doing here??? Why are Colonial
dialog: Warriors sneaking around a resort with their weapons drawn? Everything
dialog: is perfectly legal.
text: Starbuck and Boomer exchange looks
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Isn't it...?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Would you mind telling us how you got here?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
text: On the bus.
text: Another exchange of looks between Starbuck and Boomer
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: Must've been sniffing plant vapors...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Would you tell us about this bus?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: It was all handled through my travel agent. This place is fabulous...
dialog: I just can't believe they can give you all this for so little
dialog: money...
text: (she hurriedly starts to open her purse)
dialog: Look, I won over a thousand cubits...
text: Her purse burgeons with gold
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: You won those cubits...here????
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: In there, sure...Look, they said it was all legal, so if it isn't,
dialog: you'd better take on the whole star system because everyone is doing
dialog: it. Look, I'm late. Talk about meeting people, they weren't kidding.
dialog: We're going on a moonlight cruise. Two moons. How can you go wrong?
text: She giggles and hurries off. Boomer looks after her
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: I don't get it. How cut off can they be. She didn't act like she'd
dialog: even heard about the war.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: There's something even more peculiar. Why haven't we heard about this
dialog: place?
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: I suppose you know every gambling den in our star system...
text: Starbuck slowly turns to look at Boomer. Boomer nods.
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: You're right. If there's a game going on, you know about it.
text: Starbuck turns and starts moving towards the lavish sphere.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: But this isn't back room cards! This is the biggest splash I've seen
text: outside of Orion.
text: Starbuck stops in his tracks and looks at Boomer as if seeing a light
dialog: flashing
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Which colony did the mining exploration on this planet?
text: The light begins to glow for Boomer
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: Orion...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Count Baltar's private little empire. It was his engineers that
dialog: reported back to the Colonies that mining on this planet was
dialog: financially unfeasible
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: So he sets up a gambling resort. Why? Why put something like this
dialog: together and keep it a secret?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: To avoid paying Colonial taxes...his share of the war...
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: Yeah, but if you don't tell anyone about a place like this, you don't
dialog: do any business.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Does this place look empty?
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: It just doesn't make any sense...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: It'll make sense when we ask the right questions...
scene_heading: INSIDE THE GIANT SPHERE
text: a circus of gambling games, attractive females, humanoid and extra-
text: terrestrial. A lovely, feline-looking cocktail waitress moves up to
text: Starbuck just inside the entrance. She is dressed very modestly,
text: revealing little but the shape of four handsome breasts and a furry
text: tail which removes a soiled glass from a chrome railing as she
text: extends a tray to Starbuck.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: No...thank you.
text: She moves off as Boomer moves up, his eyes on the waitress
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Did you see that tail...
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: Sure did...
text: A scream goes up from a gaming table nearby. Starbuck and Boomer take
text: a look. As they do, a cry of joy goes up a few feet away...and another
text: further across the room...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: The odds must be incredible here. People are winning a fortune...
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: And they are obviously well fed. Let's get a hold of whoever's in
dialog: charge and see about getting some food back to the fleet.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Hold it...slow down...The last thing these people may want to find is
text: a Battlestar sitting on their front door...
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: Then you think this set-up is illegal?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: It wasn't exactly listed in the Colonial Concordance of places to
dialog: go...things to do...
text: Boomer starts looking around a little more nervously
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: Then they may not be too happy to see us, either.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: I've never been in a crooked gambling den that didn't depend on
text: military pay vouchers to keep their doors open.
text: Suddenly, a pit boss is on them
speaker_heading: PIT BOSS
dialog: Welcome, gentlemen. Is that an emblem of the Colonial Fleet that I
dialog: see?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Yes...it is...
speaker_heading: PIT BOSS
dialog: I didn't realize they were in the area.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: As a matter of fact, we're kind of here on our own.
speaker_heading: PIT BOSS
dialog: Little out of the way, aren't you?
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: Secret mission.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: He likes to be dramatic. Just a reconnaissance flight...see that the
dialog: armistice is being observed...
text: The ensuing moment seems like an eternity to Boomer and Starbuck. Does
text: the pit boss seem to be grinning at their naive lie, or is he being
dialog: genuinely hospitable?
speaker_heading: PIT BOSS
dialog: How worthy...and how fortunate to have you with us. Consider
dialog: yourselves guests of the establishment. Food and drink are on the
dialog: house.
text: The pit boss smiles once again and moves off
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: Well, how do you feel now, sport? We have the run of the place while
dialog: our people are starving to death, and it'll be at least two centons
dialog: before we can raise crops.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: What did you expect me to do, ask the guy for twenty thousand quantums
text: of food for a couple of straggler pilots on a reconnaissance flight?
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: Maybe we could kinda' confide in him...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Boomer, until we know who these people are, just keep in mind it'll
text: only take one informer to have the whole Cylon war machine on its way.
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: So what do we do? We've got to get fuel and food back to the ships.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: First thing we do is check in with the fleet and tell 'em what we've
dialog: found. Meanwhile, I'll try to find out who's behind this place. How
dialog: many cubits do you have with you?
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: Cubits!!! There are people back in our fleet half-starved and you're
dialog: going to gamble?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Boomer, this time it's in the line of duty. We've got to start asking
dialog: some questions, but carefully, very carefully. Now go...check in...
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: All right, but you'd better make this last...that's all there is...
text: Boomer drops three cubits into Starbuck's hand
scene_heading: ON A HI-LO TABLE
text: Three people are seated at what might be a space-age blackjack game.
text: Starbuck heads for an open chair beside a woman, who, but for a few
text: pounds, might be extremely attractive. The other two at the table are
dialog: male, both approaching obesity
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: This chair taken...?
text: The girl eyes Starbuck appraisingly. She likes what she sees.
speaker_heading: LORNA
dialog: Well!!! The fleet's in...Sit down...
text: (She checks his shoulders for an insignia; looks impressed)
dialog: Lieutenant...you've come to a lucky table.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: That right...?
speaker_heading: ON THE GAME
dialog: Hi-Lo or 7/11 as it is known throughout the star system, is a game
dialog: played with cards or electronic extensions of cards between any number
text: of players and a dealer.
text: The object of the game is to draw a hand as close as possible to
dialog: either 7 or 11. It is the players' choice, a judgment the player makes
dialog: after viewing his first card, or 'up' card...
text: ON THE SHUTTLE CRAFT

scene_heading: IN FRONT OF THE PARADEESE de FESTIVE'
text: Boomer ambles to a position of seclusion near some lush landscaping.
text: He withdraws a pocket communicator and talks into it in hushed tones
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: Land probe to Galactica...land probe to Galactica... Come in...
dialog: There is no response

scene_heading: THREE OVION FACES

speaker_heading: POINT OF VIEW
text: Boxey moving along with Muffit Two behind him. Suddenly, Muffit Two
text: stops and looks towards camera and growls
scene_heading: THE OVION CREATURES
text: lower back beneath the ground
speaker_heading: BOXEY
text: moves off towards Skyler. Muffit continues to start at the mound
speaker_heading: ON BOXEY
text: as he moves up to Skyler who is scanning the area with an electronic
dialog: probe
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: How soon before things begin to grow?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Morning. By the end of the day tomorrow, we'll have a whole crop of
dialog: fresh food instead of comrations. Won't that taste better?
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: I'd rather go home. Why'd we have to leave? Why'd those people want
dialog: to hurt us?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Oh, because there are and have always been living beings who cannot
dialog: accept anything they don't understand...anything different
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: What do you mean, different?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Just about anything at all...the shape of your eyes, the number of
dialog: limbs, the color of the outer layer of your skin...even thoughts and
dialog: ideas. They just aren't equipped to deal with difference.
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: You mean they're stupid.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: I guess by our standards. How can it be anything but stupid to kill
dialog: what you don't understand?
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: Why don't we kill them back?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Then we'd be changing what we are...to be like them. It's better for
dialog: us to go someplace else.
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: What if they come after us?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: We might have to defend ourselves.
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: You mean kill them.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Possibly.
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: Then we'd be like them.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Boxey, you're beginning to see how complicated life is. We don't
dialog: believe in war, but the opposite of war isn't necessarily peace. What
dialog: we want is freedom...the right to be left alone, but there's always
dialog: the chance someone will come along and spoil everything.
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: So you kill them.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: No...you try to establish penalties. Something that makes spoiling
text: someone else's way of life unrewarding.
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: You kill them.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Boxey, you have a way of reducing everything to very simple terms. I
dialog: don't know...maybe you're right...in the end we're talking about life
dialog: and death. Life is precious. No one has the right to tamper with
dialog: another's, without the risk of forfeiting their own. I think maybe
dialog: we're getting a little deep for a boy your age.
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: Why? You can die at any age, can't you?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Yes, Boxey, you can...Where's Muffit?
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: Right here...
text: Boxey turns to look. Muffit is not to be seen. Then from beyond the
dialog: mound, we hear barking
speaker_heading: BOXEY
text: There he is.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Better get him. If he wanders off, he could fall into an old mining
dialog: probe and we'd never find him. And be careful...stay in plain view of
dialog: the livery ships.
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: I will.
text: As Boxey turns and moves off, Greenbean hurries up
speaker_heading: ON GREENBEAN
speaker_heading: GREENBEAN
dialog: Captain, I think we've got problems.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: You've found another droid...
speaker_heading: GREENBEAN
dialog: No...we lost Jolly...
text: Skyler gives Greenbean an impatient look
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: How could anybody lose Lieutenant Jolly...there's so much of him, he
dialog: almost qualifies as a planet. Let's check it out.
text: Skyler moves off with Greenbean
speaker_heading: ON BOXEY
text: walking along amidst the mounds, scanning in all directions
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: Muffy...Muffy...Darn you daggit...Where are you...
text: Suddenly, a hand appears on Boxey's shoulder. He spins around. He
text: starts to scream.
speaker_heading: ON AN OVION
text: As one hand reaches out to cove Boxey's mouth while two more hold his
text: arms to his side.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE OVION CHAMBERS
text: Boxey is being led down a corridor by two Ovion creatures. He is both
text: dismayed and frightened by the strange new world he has entered.
text: Suddenly, he hears barking. He takes off on a dead run.
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: Muffy!!!
scene_heading: AN OVION SOLDIER
text: raises his weapon. The other stops him from using it. They start after
dialog: Boxey.
text: ON THE ENTRANCE TO THE CHOSEN CHAMBER
text: Boxey charges up and through the legs of the Ovion guard as she
text: attempts to stop him. The guard begins to pursue him.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE CHOSEN CHAMBER
text: Boxey charges in, sees Muffy standing beside Jolly, barking at the
text: Chosen Leader. Her name is Lotay. As the Ovion guard is about to grab
text: Boxey, Lotay raises a hand.
speaker_heading: LOTAY
dialog: Leave him.
text: Boxey crouches beside Muffy, holding him close. Muffy licks his face.
text: Lotay scans the odd assemblage before her -- an obese flyer, a small
text: child, and a peculiar-looking droid.
speaker_heading: LOTAY
dialog: A curious group...
dialog: (after a thought, a pleasant smile)
dialog: But they will do nicely. Take them to a cell and prepare for the
text: others as quickly as possible.
text: Jolly edges over, grimly putting an arm around Boxey
scene_heading: IN THE PARADEESE de FESTIVE' CASINO

speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Let 'em ride again.
speaker_heading: LORNA
dialog: Hey, you're fine. Where've you been all week? Where're you from? No,
dialog: let me guess, you're a Capricorn...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: What gave me away?
speaker_heading: LORNA
dialog: Your tenacity...I mean you get what you want and you're aloof...All
dialog: you people from Caprica are alike
dialog: (she giggles)
dialog: And also your insignia says your unit is from Caprica.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: How'd you find out about this place?
speaker_heading: LORNA
dialog: A girlfriend at the office told me about three of her roomates coming
dialog: here. They had such a good time, they stayed over...wrote us to come.
dialog: It was too good a deal to pass up.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: What's a good deal?
speaker_heading: LORNA
dialog: Five cubits round trip, all meals included for one centon. I don't
dialog: know how they do it. The food is so good, I've gained ten pounds, and
dialog: my girlfriend...if she doesn't stop eating, they'll never get her
text: back off the planet.
text: Starbuck looks around at the capacity crowd
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: I guess they make it up on the gambling...
speaker_heading: LORNA
dialog: Except that I'm ahead fifty cubits.
text: Starbuck watches as the dealer punches up a card...A cheer from the
text: table...Lorna giggles.
speaker_heading: LORNA
dialog: You win again.
text: Boomer returns with a serious look on his face
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: We'd better talk.
text: Starbuck reads Boomer's expression...rises
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Thanks for the company.
speaker_heading: LORNA
dialog: (invitingly)
dialog: Any time...hurry back.
text: Boomer and Starbuck cross the casino into a lounge area from which
text: music is pulsating
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Where are we going? I'm finding out all sorts of things, like the fact
dialog: that these people are completely cut off rom ews of the outside world.
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: I'm not surprised. Be careful what you say, we're being watched.
text: As Starbuck starts to look around
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Who by?
text: Boomer slaps a hand on Sarbuck's back and grins broadly for effect
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: Right...Let's have a drink and listen to some music...loud music.
speaker_heading: IN THE LOUNGE
text: A trio of female Tucanas are performing in what can best be described
text: as a spaced-out Supremes style of music. Tucanas are unusual beings,
text: in that while they are not totally unattractive in a feline sort of
dialog: way, they do have two mouths, which in a woman can be devastating,
dialog: unless they happen to be singers...
scene_heading: STARBUCK AND BOOMER
text: sit into a table combination for two and Starbuck is immediately taken
dialog: by the group
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: They can't try to read our lips in here.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: The place is full of lips. Look, are you sure you aren't imagining
dialog: things? This place is all right.
text: Starbuck places a cubit in a slot on a small pedestal in the middle of
text: the table. A cup drops down and amber begins to stream into it. He
text: then places a large stack of cubits in front of him, to Boomer's
dialog: amazement.
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: Where'd you get all those?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Hi-lo. One thing this place isn't, is crooked. Would you listen to
dialog: those girls? They're great.
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: Forget the girls. Talk to me. What else did you pick up at that table!
text: Starbuck continues to stare at the girls
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: Like why they might need to watch us.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Who?
text: He follows Boomer's gaze
speaker_heading: TWO OVIONS
text: standing by a dapery partition are looking towards Boomer and
text: Starbuck. One turns and moves off
scene_heading: STARBUCK AND BOOMER
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: Ovions.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: Ovions. They're all over the place. My section got a briefing on them
dialog: from Intelligence.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Where do they come from?
speaker_heading: BOOMER
text: No one seems to kow much about them. They just started showing up on a
text: few outposts, mostly as migratory workers
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Looks like they're well-equipped for that...
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: It's their politics that are in doubt.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: I don't see how that's too important any more.
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: How can we worry about subversion when we don't have a planet left
dialog: to subvert? Hey, would you listen to those girls? They're incredible.
speaker_heading: ON THE GROUP
text: The middle lady belts out a song in a fashion not dissimilar to Bette
text: Midler. The two ladies flanking her belt out 'oo's' and 'ah's,'
text: singing four-part harmony, with both mouths cranking out decibles of
text: music while the lead singer only seems to be using one of her two
text: orifices. The upper mouth is definitely doing all the work, but
dialog: effectively...very effectively.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: is mesmerized
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: We could make a fortune if we could put those girls on the star
dialog: circuit. I mean big money, Boomer.
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: I don't believe you. Every creature in the universe is out to
dialog: exterminate us, and you want to hire a vocal group.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Have a little vision, will 'ya. The war can't last forever. Someday,
dialog: it'll be over and what'll we be...antiquated, burned out fighter
dialog: pilots.
speaker_heading: THE GIRLS
text: go for their big finish. The two outside ladies hitting a sustaining
text: chord only missing one element. We somehow feel it's forthcoming.
speaker_heading: THE MIDDLE LADY
text: soars for a high note with her upper mouth and just as we reach the
text: final few beats in the melodious piece, we see the lower mouth, silent
text: for the entire song, open. We know it's coming...and it does...a low
text: resounding bass note on the final beat of the song that breaks the
text: glass in Starbuck's hand. The room breaks into tumultuous applause
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
text: is flabbergasted. He rises
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: I gotta' talk to them...
text: Boomer pulls him back down
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: You aren't going to talk to anybody. We're here on a mission.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: And I'm doing everything I can to find out what's going on. What did
dialog: the Commander tell you to do?
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: I couldn't reach the fleet.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: BOOMER
text: We're in some kind of communication void. Probably the canyon walls.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Well, hike up to the shuttle and call in
dialog: (rising with some consternation)
dialog: I'm telling you, we're sitting on top of a gold mine with these girls,
dialog: and all you can see is danger behind every rock.
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: It's a Tylium mine we're suppose to find and... where're you
dialog: going...?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: It doesn't matter where I'm going. You're going up to the shuttle to
dialog: heck in. And the sooner you do, the sooner we'll be getting food and
dialog: suppliess back to our ships. I'm telling you, these are nice people.
dialog: You can tell Commander Adama I said so.
text: As Starbuck moves off towards the casino, Boomer shakes his head
text: worriedly, then moves off.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE CASINO
text: Boomer exits and starts away. Suddenly, he finds he isn't alone.
text: Moving to one side of him through the shrubbery is an Ovion. To the
text: other side, another Ovion. He stops, looks back. Guarding the door
text: behind him, another Ovion. Boomer suddenly runs towards the rocks, a
text: laser blast streaks out. Boomer dives for cover. His hand reaches down
text: to his belt. He pushes an armature. As the Ovions slowly move up to
text: him and level their weapons on him
speaker_heading: BOOMER
dialog: Easy fellas...nice bugs...

speaker_heading: SKYLER

speaker_heading: SKYLER

speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: nods, concedint the weight of evidence
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: All right, Captain Skyler. Dispatch an immediate rescue mission beyond
dialog: the ridge.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: I'd like to command it myself.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: No, you've vital where you are.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Commander, Starbuck and Boomer are the best we have. If they're in
dialog: trouble...
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Very well. Report in as soon as possible. Galacica out.
text: Adama signs off and turns to Tigh
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: I don't like the feel of it. I think it's time for an on-site
dialog: inspection. Prepare my shuttle and a squad of your best Warriors.
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: Right away
scene_heading: TWO COLONIAL WARRIORS

scene_heading: IN SKYLER'S SHIP

speaker_heading: SKYLER

speaker_heading: ON JOLLY

speaker_heading: ON SKYLER
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Let's go down on the deck...
scene_heading: ON SKYLER'S SHIP
text: as he peels off and rakes down closer to the surface, followed
text: immediately by the other ships, in flights of three.
text: AT THE LIVERY SHIPS
text: A cluster of Colonial Warriors are lined up in military formation
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: We'll divide into teams of two and criss-cross the area from the point
dialog: Flight Sergeant Jolly disappeared. We don't have much time, so cover
dialog: your quadrants as quickly as possible. All right... disperse...
text: Suddenly, a woman's frantic voice calls out
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Commander...
text: The men step out of formation to depart. Lyra rushes up to Adama
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Commander, the boy...Boxey...I just heard he's missing. May I join
dialog: the search? I've grown very attached to that little waif.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: This isn't easy terrain.
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: I've been to places in the star system that make this look like a
dialog: stellar lounge.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: I'd be honored to have you aboard.
text: She returns Adama's ingratiating smile
text: ON SKYLER IN HIS FIGHTING SHIP
text: as he soars along at tree-top level, scanning the ground
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: I don't know where Starbuck's shuttle is, but it's sure not on these
dialog: coordinates
speaker_heading: GREEBEAN
dialog: He must've decided to...
text: Suddenly, Greenbean's mouth flies open
speaker_heading: GREENBEAN
dialog: Captain!!!
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: already aware ofwhat Greenbean sees
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: I see it...
speaker_heading: GREENBEAN
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: I haven't got the slightest idea, but that's where Boomer's distress
text: signal is coming from.
speaker_heading: GREENBEAN
dialog: What do we do about it?
speaker_heading: SKLER
dialog: Find a place to land and have a look.
scene_heading: THE TWO FIGHTERS
text: peel off in search of a landing spot
text: ON THE SURFACE OF CARILLON
text: Colonial Warrior criss-cross a segment of land which appears as a
text: slightly angled plane of black, volcanic rock
scene_heading: ON TWO WARRIORS
text: as they move past camera, we pan back to see the ground open up to
text: reveal to Ovion warriors moving up out of the ground
scene_heading: IN ANOTHER AREA
text: Greenbean and another Warrior move past camera. Once again, they are
text: no more than a few feet away when two more Ovions appear behind them.
speaker_heading: ON ADAMA
text: He stops with Lyra at his side to allow her to catch her breath. A
dialog: cold wind chills them
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Getting very cold...
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: We won't be able to continue the search much longer. The
dialog: temperature's dropping too fast
text: Lyra looks off to one side
speaker_heading: LYRA
text: That's odd. We seem to be the only ones on the summit.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Must've been moving a little faster than everyone else. I'll admit I'm
dialog: worried.
text: Lyra turns and moves back past a rock formation on this high plateau
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Commander, you'd better have a look.
text: Adama turns and moves back around the rock formation
speaker_heading: POINT OF VIEW
text: A long sweeping vista of black volcanic rock anglingdown to a small
text: meadow where the livery ships stand ominously alone and still
speaker_heading: ADAMA
text: turns back to Lyra
speaker_heading: LYRA
text: They're all gone...we're alone.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: quickly drwas his weapon
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: It's impossible.
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Commander, I'm frightened. What's going on?
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: I don't know, but let's...
text: Adama half turs...his look freezes. Lyra turns and screams
speaker_heading: ON TWO OVIONS
text: their weapons extended towards the two humans
scene_heading: ON SKYLER AND GREENBEAN
text: as they approach the burned-out remains of two Viper War ships. Both
text: men have their weapons drawn as they move up cautiously
speaker_heading: GREENBEAN
dialog: If Boomer and Starbuck were in those birds, sir...
text: Skyler...looks down at his communicator. It continues to flash.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: It would have been destroyed their distress beacon. No...Boomer's
text: signal is still loud and clear.
speaker_heading: GREENBEAN
dialog: What do we do?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: You stand guard on the ships. We can't afford to lose two more. I'm
text: going to follow Boomer's beacon. It seems to be coming from down
dialog: there. Whatever it is...
text: Skyler moves with Boomer to look down on the Casino de Festive'
scene_heading: INSIDE THE OVION CHAMBERS
text: Adama and Lyra are being escorted by guards. As they reach the main
text: chamber, Adama and Lyra look around in amazement.
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: What is it?
scene_heading: MOVING POIINT OF VIEW
text: The large main chamber where countless Ovion workers mine Tylium
dialog: around the clock
speaker_heading: ADAMA
text: It may be the largest underground Tylium mine in the star system
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: To run our ships...
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: (ominously)
dialog: To run somebody's ships
text: They arrive at the Chosen Chamber. The guards stand aside. Adama and
dialog: Lyra enter
scene_heading: INSIDE THE CHOSEN CHAMBER
text: Lotay looks up from her perch.
speaker_heading: LOTAY
dialog: You are Commander Adama?
scene_heading: ON ADAMA AND LYRA
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: I am...
speaker_heading: LOTAY
dialog: Welcome to Carillon. You are impressed?
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Outraged is more like it. Where are my men and the boy?
text: As easy smile crosses Lotay's face
speaker_heading: LOTAY
dialog: Would you care to join them?
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: You bet I would...and if anything's happened to any one of them,
dialog: you'll answer to the Colonies.
text: The Chosen Leader smiles non-committally and rises. We find that she
text: is taller than the worker Ovions. She leads the way as the Ovion guard
text: move in behind Adama and Lyra.
speaker_heading: IN A CORRIDOR
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Did that smile mean she knows the Colonies don't exist?
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: I don't know...
text: They arrive at another entry. The Leader stands aside.
speaker_heading: LOTAY
dialog: Enter...
text: Adama and Lyra exchange wary looks and pass through the door.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE GUEST CHAMBER
text: Adama and Lyra stop in their tracks and stare incredulously
scene_heading: POINT OF VIEW -- THE CHAMBER
text: alive with music and entertainment...four-armed jugglers, dancing
text: Ovions...and a banquet befitting kings with succulent victuals of
dialog: every dimension, proportion and manner
speaker_heading: JOLLY
speaker_heading: JOLLY
dialog: Commander!!!
text: Everyone turns to look. Boxey jumps down from the knee of an Ovion
text: workers and runs to Lyra. Jolly moves hurriedly, food in hand...a
text: drumstick and an odd-looking piece of fruit
speaker_heading: JOLLY
dialog: It's like nothing we could have dreamed of. They've got plenty of
dialog: everything we need, and they want to share it.
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Sounds like paradise...
text: Adama gazes around the room warily...a troubled look on his face.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Yes, it does...
speaker_heading: LOTAY
dialog: We are a communal order from birth. We all work...We all share...
dialog: There is no competition, no jealousy, no conflict...only peace and
dialog: order.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Perpetual happiness.
speaker_heading: LOTAY
text: Happiness is the goal of an immature order. All pursue it. Few have
text: it. None can sustain it. The Ovion is content. It is better.
text: Adama and Lyra exchange cautious looks
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: It seems to work for you.
speaker_heading: LOTAY
dialog: For millenniums it has been so. Now, join us... Be our guests...be
dialog: well fed, well entertained... Be content.
text: The Ovion Leader smiles that strange, bewildering look that suggests
text: a private meaning. Adama can't help feeling it's more than a benign
dialog: suggestion.
scene_heading: IN THE CASINO ON TWO OVION SECURITY GUARDS
text: watching Starbuck and looking anything but benign
scene_heading: ON STARBUCK AT THE HI-LO TABLE
text: A cheer arises from the gallery which by this time is substantial.
text: They watch with vicarious fear as Starbuck presses his entire

speaker_heading: ON LORNA
speaker_heading: LORNA
dialog: What're you going to do with all that money?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Let it all ride...
text: A small cheer from Lorna and the two obese gentlemen. As we pan off to
text: the main door as a figure enters.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: looks around incredulously. He hears a resounding cheer...looks...
speaker_heading: POINT OF VIEW
text: A narrow aperture through the gallery reveals the image of a Colonial
text: Warrior as the center of attention.
speaker_heading: THE DEALER
text: seems to be looking for help. He is perspiring.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: I will have to see if they will remove the limit.
text: The dealer signals o.s. as Skyler moves up and stares in utter
text: disbelief at the pile of golden cubits in front of a cigar-smoking
text: Starbuck.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Lieutenant, do you mind telling me what you're doing?
text: Starbuck turns, somewhat startled and embarrassed
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Winning...I mean
text: (he struggles to his feet, rising awkwardly from his stool)
dialog: Sir...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: What is this place? What's going on here...
text: Starbuck turns to Lorna
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Uh, excuse me, dear...Watch my cubits?
text: Starbuck hustles Skyler a few feet away to talk conspiratorially as
text: a few yards away, the pit boss gestures in pantomime to the dealer.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Oh, sir...as near as we can figure, this is a resort. These people
dialog: are here from all over the star system.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: That doesn't make any sense. This place is a desolate rock.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Maybe...but everyone's having a great time.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Not everyone.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Everyone that I've seen.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: How long since you talked to Boomer?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Boomer???
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Somebody blew up his ship...yours, too.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Blew up our ships? Boomer went there to use the long-range
dialog: communicator. If someone did something to Boomer...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: He never reached the ship. His distress beacon is still working...
dialog: that's what bothers me.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: It can't be working. I didn't pick it up.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: I'm not picking it up now, either...but my flyover pointed right to
dialog: where you're standing.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Captain...Boomer isn't here...he left.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: If he isn't in this building, he's under it.
text: Skyler and Boomer exchange ominous looks as the pit boss moves up.
speaker_heading: PIT BOSS
dialog: Sir, as a special courtesy to our Colonial Warrior guests, the limit
text: has been removed.
text: Starbuck looks at Skyler questioningly as a cheer of anticipation
text: rises from the gallery. Skyler nods.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Go ahead, Lucky. Break the bank. I'd like to see what happens when
dialog: you try to walk out of here with their money.
text: Starbuck pales.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Look...maybe we've learned all we can here...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: No...no...you go right ahead. I'll just look around for a bit...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: I'd feel better if you were watching my flank.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: You were doing fine before I got here. Good luck.
text: Skyler moves off, leaving Starbuck alone as Lorna moves to him and
text: takes his arm and pulls him to the table.
speaker_heading: LORNA
dialog: Come on, sport. You're going to bring the house down.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: That's what's worrying me.
text: MOVING THROUGH THE CASINO WITH SKYLER
text: as he edges past more games of chance as cheers rise from each table.
text: Finally, Skyler reaches a bank of elevators. He notices a large group
text: of rather obese people being escorted by Ovions into an elevator.
text: Skyler moves up to join the group. An Ovion's hand bars the way.
speaker_heading: OVION
dialog: You have a voucher?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: I just wanted to browse. Where does this go?
speaker_heading: OVION
dialog: It is the chamber of the Living End. You must have a voucher.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: I hope it's a reducing salon. Looks like some of these boys have been
dialog: having too good a time. Can I look around?
speaker_heading: OVION
dialog: When you have a voucher. It comes at the end of your two week stay.
text: The people have all entered the elevator car, and the Ovion who has
text: been speaking with Skyler now steps back into the car himself.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Two week stay...Look, I don't plan on sticking...
text: The door whisks closed in Skyler's face and whisks downward, out of
text: sight. He finishes the statement to himself..."self"... and turns to
text: head back through more cheering guests taking curious and troubled
text: note of what he is seeing. Suddenly, he turns and heads towards the
text: front doors at an easy gait. As he closes to them, he is aware that
text: Ovion Guards are following his progress.
text: AT THE FRONT DOORS
text: Skyler pauses as he is about to start outside. Quickly, he looks back
text: into the room.
speaker_heading: POINT OF VIEW
text: One of the Ovions who has been tracking him has a transceiver in his
text: hand and is talking into it. Finding himself caught by Skyler's gaze,
text: he lowers the transceiver.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: swings his look back out the door.
text: POINT OF VIEW TO THE VEGETATION OUTSIDE
text: Two shadows ducking back behind some shrubbery.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: turns and moves back across the casino towards Starbuck.
scene_heading: AT STARBUCK'S TABLE
text: a cheer from the gallery as Starbuck's winnings mount. The game now
text: watched closely by a pit boss and several guards, who begin to press
text: in more closely. Skyler eyes them behind Starbuck warily. Lorna leans
text: in, pawing Starbuck admiringly.
speaker_heading: LORNA
dialog: You are the luckiest man I've ever...
text: Suddenly, she stops in mid-sentence, her jaw hanging open as she sees
text: Skyler slowly raising his sidearm from its holster to bring it
text: directly to bear on the dealer's chest. A gasp from the crowd.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: I'm going to see if I can put a hole through him.
text: The dealer's eyes flare wide with alarm. In an instant, the head
text: security guard is at Starbuck's side.
scene_heading: HEAD SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Sir...you'll have to...
text: As he starts to draw his weapon, he finds Starbuck's sidearm quickly
text: in his side. Starbuck quickly moves an arm around the Ovion's head,
text: turning him towards the other security guards moving up, transforming
text: him into a shield.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Let's keep our hands out where we can see 'em, fellas. All of them.
dialog: Now, you mind telling me what we're doing, sir!
scene_heading: THE APPROACHING SECURITY GUARDS
dialog: stop in place and refrain from any movement towards their weapons
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: unflinching...his weapon leveled at the dealer
scene_heading: HEAD SECURITY GUARD
dialog: If I may ask...what seems to be your complaint?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: This man is cheating my friend.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: What???
text: An incredulous remble moves through the gallery. Skyler is beginning
text: to lose their support. Obviously, he's a military psychopath.
scene_heading: HEAD SECURITY GUARD
text: But he is winning.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: No. He appears to be winning. The dealer is cheating.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Ah, look, Skyler...Captain...I'm pretty good, you know...
scene_heading: HEAD SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Sir, if you doubt his good fortune, I suggest he pick up his cubits
dialog: and leave.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Sounds like a real good idea, Skyler! Why don't we just be on our
dialog: way...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: Not until somebody explains why he was letting him win.
scene_heading: HEAD SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Nothing could be more absurd...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Does sound a bit odd. Look, maybe these fellas'd be willing to help
dialog: us get to our ship if we just give back the winnings and forget the
dialog: whole thing!
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: They don't mind winners, Starbuck. There isn't a loser in the house.
dialog: They see to that.
scene_heading: HEAD SECURITY GUARD
text: A human weakness...momentous judgements on miniscule perspectives...
text: As the people begin to grumble at Skyler's destroying heir party
speaker_heading: OBESE MAN #1
dialog: Look, fella, why don't you tell your friend to go back to his ship
dialog: and sleep it off, huh?
speaker_heading: LORNA
dialog: Right. You have something against people having a litle fun...winning
dialog: a little money?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Captain, come on. You're going to have everyone at our throats.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Just ask yourselves, have you seen a loser here? Doesn't that strike
dialog: all of you as odd?
speaker_heading: OBESE MAN #2
dialog: What is it, boy? You worried about the taxes on our winnings? That
dialog: why you're here, boy? You a tax collector?
speaker_heading: OBESE MAN #1
dialog: You come to close this place down, fella?
text: The room is turning angry. Skyler raises his weapon.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: He was letting you win.
speaker_heading: LORNA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Maybe to keep you here, or content. I don't know.
speaker_heading: OBESE MAN #1
dialog: Put your weapon away, son, or I'm going to take it away from you.
text: The man moves off his chair towards Skyler
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Captain, with all due respect...
text: Skyler realizes the contrantation's quickly going to get out of hand.
text: He starts to back away, his weapon in front of him.
speaker_heading: OBESE MAN #1
dialog: Maybe you can explain what you're doing here, boy. You come for a
dialog: vacation, or for trouble?
text: The people continue to move towards Starbuck and Skyler, the security
text: guards amongst them, waiting for an opportuity. Starbuck and Skyler
text: find themselves with the front doors cut off from them by the guards.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: There's trouble, all right. The war with the Alliance is over. We
dialog: lost.
speaker_heading: OBESE MAN #2
dialog: Lost! You poor fool. You've been on patrol too long. There's been an
dialog: armistice. Didn't you hear?
text: The crowd begins to laugh at Skyler
speaker_heading: OBESE MAN #1
dialog: Course they didn't tell 'im. Have to keep morale up. If they don't
dialog: have a war, they don't have jobs.
text: The laugh turns to jeers. The noise becomes deafening. Skyler edges
text: towards the elevator.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: The front doors are that way...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: So is their reception party. We've got to make a run for it,
text: Starbuck.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: The minute we do, the Ovions'll start shooting.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: The old duck and roll...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Right...
text: Starbuck quickly scans the area. He looks up...
speaker_heading: POINT OF VIEW
text: an ornate chandelier high in the ceiling in front of the elevators.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
text: shifts the barrel of his sidearm upward and in one deft movement,
text: sends a laser blast streaming from the ceiling and turns and ducks
text: for an open elevator with Skyler right behind him.
text: ON THE CEILING
text: as the ornate chandelier is blasted out of its moorings and starts
dialog: for the floor
speaker_heading: THE CROWD
text: starts forward, then jumps back as the fixture crashes in front of
text: the doorway, sending a pillar of debris and electrical shorting...
scene_heading: END OF HOUR TWO
speaker_heading: HOUR THREE
speaker_heading: FADE IN
scene_heading: ON ELEVATOR DOORS IN A SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE
text: They open, emitting a covey of Ovions who run from the car and stand
text: looking off down two intersecting corridors which range off into
text: complete blackness. The Ovions raise their sidearms and fire
text: resounding laser blasts off into the black abyss. Quickly, aother team
text: of Ovions move up in two land vehicles. Two Ovions climb on one
text: vehicle, two more on the other, and the machines whine off in opposite
dialog: directions.
text: Momentarily, all is still. We pan back to the elevator car and find
text: two pairs of legs descending from the top of the car.
scene_heading: SKYLER AND STARBUCK
text: drop to the floor and ease cautiously out into the passageway.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: On reconsidering...I believe there may be something to your suspicions
dialog: about this place. Let's move. One of these tunnels must lead out of
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: They also lead to those fellas who were firing full charges at what
dialog: they hoped was us. That isn't nice, Starbuck.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: I don't see how we have any choice, unless you're suggesting we go
dialog: back the way we came in. You wouldn't suggest that, would you?
text: O.S. a whine can be heard. Both men turn and look.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: I'm not real crazy about the sound of that...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: I'm not, either.
speaker_heading: POINT OF VIEW
text: an eerie light approaching from down the dark passageway
scene_heading: SKYLER AND STARBUCK
text: reach in unison...turn and scamper for the elevator car...raise their
text: hands over their heads, jump, and pull themselves up out of sight.
text: Panning back, we find a tram pullung up to a stop beside the elevator.
text: From the front of the tram, three Ovions exit and move into the
text: elevator car.
text: FROM UP ABOVE THE CAR
text: we find Skyler and Starbuck watching helplessly as the Ovions,
text: conversing in high-pitched chatter. The car stops. They exit and move
text: into the Casino, leaving Starbuck and Skyler trapped.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: This isn't turning out to be as much fun as I'd hoped. Now what?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Now we wait.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: For someone to take us back down
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: I'm not too crazy about that idea, either. At least up here there are
dialog: people we could talk to.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: These people are no better off than we are. You saw that shuttle down
dialog: there. I figure it just came back from taking a load of these people
dialog: someplace.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: That's a good question. I've got a hunch the answer is the reason for
dialog: this place's existence.
speaker_heading: ON THE GALACTICA
text: hovering amongst the fleet above the planet Carillon. A space shuttle
text: approaches from the rear.
text: ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
text: Colonel Tigh receives a courier, reads the information, and looks up,
dialog: troubled.
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: I'm leaving the bridge. I'll be with Commander Adama if I'm needed.
scene_heading: ON COMMANDER ADAMA IN HIS QUARTERS
text: He sits at a desk dictating into a device
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: The Ovion people have extended to the survivors of the colonies every
dialog: measure of goodness and support we might have hoped for. It is now
dialog: possible to foresee the entire fleet able to resume our voage within
dialog: a centon.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON AN AUTOMATIC WRITING DEVICE
text: A small, tube-like extension which focuses a small measure of light
text: on a roll of paper. As the light moves by, lettering is placed
text: silently and nearly on the paper. There is a knock at the door.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Come in.
text: Colonel Tigh enters. Adama glances at him,
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Nothing can be that bad. We've found supplies, adequate to carry our
dialog: people far out of this star system. We couldn't have fallen on
dialog: better fortune.
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: No, sir. In fact, things are too good.
text: Adama gives Tigh a curious look.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Too good?
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: Most of our people are still on comrations. As tasty as I'd like to
dialog: say they are, they just don't measure up to thestories coming back
text: from the surface of Carillon. There's a lot of talk going around...
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: What kind of talk?
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: That you're exceedig your authority by keeping people in the ships
dialog: instead of allowing them some time on the planet.
text: Adama rises in a state of shock.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Exceeding my authority! This is a voyage of survival. We could be
text: under attack at any time. The crews on Carillon are down there
dialog: to work, not party.
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: Sir, all of our people have been through a debilitating shock. I'm
dialog: sure some of them are getting a little of it our of their systems.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Just what is it you're telling me? I dispatched two of our elite
dialog: squadrons to harvest food and obtain fuel for our survival. Now what's
dialog: going on down there?
text: Tigh says nothing, but his expression sends the Commander toward the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Prepare my shuttle
text: ON THE FLIGHT DECK
text: Adama exits an elevator and heads towards his shuttle. As he does, he
text: sees a group of twelve men disembarking a second craft. They form a
text: grim barrier as he moves up to them, sensing an uneasy confrontation.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Anton...Seth...and Seppy. So good to see you all.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: You appear to be leaving.
text: Adama will need more than a smile. He knows this is not going to go
dialog: well.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: I have to go down to the surface of Carillon.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: (caustically)
dialog: Of course! We understand!
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: I'm not sure that you do.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: Adama, we want to discuss an orderly
dialog: rotation of all our people down to Carillon.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: I don't think that's wise.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: The Quorum does.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: Adama, we took the liberty of holding a council to elect new
dialog: leadership.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: I see. And what was the outcome?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Each of us here has been elected to represent out respective colonies.
dialog: We are the new Quorum of the Twelve.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: And have we a new President?
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: Why, of course, Adama. You.
text: The men applaud and backslap Adama with nervous affection.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Thank you. It will be my pleasure to serve you. However, I cannot
dialog: permit...
speaker_heading: LOBE
dialog: Adama, you have run a ship as big as a sun center. Some of our people
text: are cramped up in cubicles no bigger than a cubit.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: And it may be a long time between stops.
speaker_heading: LOBE
dialog: It's only fair our people share in the fruits of Carillon.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Anton, surely you understand that we are still at war. An Alliance
dialog: has dedicated itself to our extinction. You must recognize a need for
dialog: extraordinary measures. I cannot allow our people down on Carillon
text: before inspecting the conditions and its possible risks.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: Of course. We all understand that, so why don't we accompany you and
dialog: see for ourselves, shall we?
text: Enthusiastically, they all start for the shuttle ship as Adama's
text: expression turns grim.
text: IN A DARK TUNNEL
text: Ovions approach on a surface craft and enter the elevator pod
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: We could have been far away from here by now.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: They've got scanners and vehicles. They didn't expect us to stay
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Because they were under the impression we were intelligent beings.
dialog: No offense...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: As always, I'll involve your youth to save your aresford. This is the
dialog: last place they'll be looking for us.
text: Starbuck gestures to a long, tram-like vehicle parked in the tunnel
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Why not take that vehicle?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: Because it looks like it moves slowly and makes a lot of noise.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: I'd still feel better than sitting here, waiting... for what!
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: For that vehicle to move?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Where I think we want to go!
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Skyler, sir...would you mind sharing a few pieces of the magic puzzle.
dialog: I mean, I've seen...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Well, I think I know how someone can run a casino that gives away
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: I'm not sure you want to hear it.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Try me.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Suppose there's a very rich mine on this planet.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: I mean, it's rich if you have somebody to mine it.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Which they don't.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: What if they do? What if those Ovions are bringing in people from all
dialog: over the star system to visit this wonderful casino resort where you
dialog: can't lose... except in the end.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Ahhh, Skyler, that's ugly.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: Yes, it is...if they wind up as slave labor down in a Tylium mine.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: That's a long shot. Some of those people were so fat, they couldn't
dialog: touch their shoes, let alone mine Tylium. That's hard work.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: Doesn't take long to work off weight in a Tylium mine.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: You know something?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: I felt better about those Ovions when I didn't understand them.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: The next load of people they move out in that thing, probably in the
dialog: morning...we're going to climb on and find out if I'm right.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Uh...uh...on the chance that you are right, whichever way that thing
dialog: goes, I go the other way.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: I could order you to go with me.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Are you ordering me?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: No. It's liable to be a one-way trip.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Helping to save humanity is going to have to be a personal decision,
text: Starbuck. Goodnight.
text: Skyler tucks his head down on top of the elevator and closes his eyes.
text: Starbuck watches him for a long beat, then looks off with a totally
text: disgusted look on his face.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Ahhhhhh Feljurcreb!!!
scene_heading: IN THE OVION BANQUET ROOMS
text: continued merriment, laughter, food and drink. Only Boxey is moving
text: about, looking worried.
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: Muffy...Muffy
text: He can't seem to find the droid. He wanders towards the door where an
text: Ovion guard stands watch. The guard is talking to a second guard in
text: the corridor. He doesn't notice Boxey move off down the corridor.
scene_heading: ON THE LARGE MINE
text: The cavernous room from which the mining operation can be observed.
speaker_heading: LOTAY
dialog: ...the largest Tylium mine in all the star system...
text: Panning off, we find the Quorum of the Twelve being guided on a tour
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: It's a testimony to communal order...
speaker_heading: LOTAY
dialog: Thank you
scene_heading: IN THE OVION LEADER'S PRIVATE CHAMBER
text: They enter to find a large feast prepared for them on floor mats and
text: pillows in the center of the room. On one side, gentle music is
text: emitted from two stringed instruments in contrast to the rousing
text: melodies indigenous to the more public dining area.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: This is too much to expect.
speaker_heading: LOTAY
dialog: We have plenty. As many of your people who desire it are invited to
dialog: be our guests.
text: Anton turns to Adama
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: Can you in good conscience deny our people such an invitation?
speaker_heading: ADAMA
text: Well, perhaps a very carefully organized small rotation.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: But I thought time was our greatest consideration. The more we bring
dialog: here at once, the sooner we can be on our way.
text: Adama turns to the Leader
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: May I ask how our request for Tylium is being received?
speaker_heading: LOTAY
dialog: We have already prepared the first shipment for you, have we not?
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Yes, we boarded it. However, I understand there is to be a delay in
dialog: obtaining any more.
speaker_heading: LOTAY
dialog: Unfortunately, we were not prepared for your request. Only two
dialog: centons ago, we dispatched almost all that was on hand. What we gave
dialog: you this day was what we were able to mine yesterday. We are
dialog: industrious, Commander, but we are also small.
text: Lotay smiles ingratiatingly.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: I think we press our luck, Commander. Let us not be rude in the face
dialog: of such hospitality.
speaker_heading: LOTAY
dialog: Please begin. Be our guests. Be well fed, well entertained. Be
dialog: content.
text: As the Ovion leader is about to step away, Adama brings her to a stop.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: You aren't joining us?
speaker_heading: LOTAY
text: (a vague smile crosses her face)
dialog: No...I am afraid not.
text: She simlply moves off. On her exit...
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: Well, I don't think there can be any doubt as to our decision. It
dialog: will take time to obtain the Tylium. We will give every person an
dialog: opportunity to share in our bounty down here on Carillon.
speaker_heading: IN A CORRIDOR
text: Lotay moves briskly along, escorted by four Ovion guards. They reach
text: a chamber. Lotay stops, looks up and down the corridor, and enters
dialog: alone.
text: ON THE BACK OF AN EMPEROR'S CHAIR
text: Lotay moves forward until she has come to a point just in front of
text: the chair. She bows her head.
speaker_heading: LOTAY
dialog: By your command...
speaker_heading: ON THE THRONE
text: Baltar sits draped across the chair, a smug smile on his face. On
text: either side of him are the two Cylon Centurians.
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: I see you're entertaining these days.
speaker_heading: LOTAY
text: The Colonials have only allowed a few of their Warriors to land.
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: I knew your hospitality would be impossible to refuse. After all the
dialog: experience you've had dining with humans...
text: Baltar cannon resist laughing at his private joke.
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: And what of Commander Adama
speaker_heading: LOTAY
text: A brief visit. He is with the fleet now.
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: I want him here! When he is in our grasp, we have won!
text: ON BOXEY EXITING A DARK STAIRCASE INTO A FORBIDDEN CHAMBER
text: filled with Ovion workers slaving in a mine shaft, lighted by eerie,
text: subdued, pulsating light. Here the mood is not one of showcase
text: industry, but rather of endless, mindless obedience to a cruel
text: taskmaster. The Ovions dig at the walls with small utensils, some of
text: them turning to steal glances at the small waif of a lad walking up
text: their forbidden ocrridor. A high-pitched, insect-like chanting
text: reverberates throughout the sub chambers. Suddenly, a high-pitched
text: whine.
speaker_heading: AN OVION WORKER
text: falls from a pinnacle, crashing to the ground not far from Boxey. Two
text: sentry Ovions move efficiently up and remove the fallen worker,
text: dragging the hapless form of to a pit where it is hurled out of sight.
text: Having completed their task, one of the two sentries turns its
text: attention to Boxey. The first sentry exchanges high-frequency
text: communication with the second and the pair start towards Boxey.
speaker_heading: BOXEY
text: isn't so young that he cannon sense imminent danger. He turns and
text: runs. The Ovions continue towards him as Boxzey turns off ito another
dialog: corridor.
scene_heading: SOMEPLACE ELSE IN THE DEPTHS OF THE CHAMBERS -- ON MUFFY
text: prancing along a deep, foreboding, dark corridor. Suddenly, a moaning
text: sound brings him to a stop. He cocks his head to listen. The moaning
text: continues. An anthem to human suffering. Muffy prances up a corridor
text: darker than the one he was in.
text: ON MUFFY AS HE STOPS AND LOOKS
text: his ears and hairs suddenly stand on end
text: A YELLOWISH WINDOW
text: octangular in shape as it seals off an insect-like cell. Pressed
text: against the plastic-like window, countless humans, intermingled with
text: other interstellar beings, crammed, jammed, wedged together into a
text: butcher's shop display case of living flesh. An obese human sees Muffy
text: and claws at the window with desperation...tracking sweeps of blood
text: where his fingers have cruelly yielded to the abrasive sealing glass.
speaker_heading: BOXEY'S VOICE
dialog: Muffy...Muffy...Where are you?
text: Muffy turns and barks, taking us to Boxey standing at the end of the
text: corridor. He sees Muffy and runs to him, bending down to cuddle him
text: close. Suddenly, he is aware of the strange moaning. His little face
text: looks up from the furry droid in his arms and freezes in disbelief.
text: He lets out an involuntary cry and jumps up and turns to run. He
text: moves no more than a few feet when he collides into
scene_heading: TWO OVION SENTRIES
text: who look down on Boxey and Muffy with cruel, cold, programmed intent
text: ON COLONEL TIGH AND ATHENA ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: But we can't shuttle everyone to the surface of Carillon...the fuel
dialog: and the pilots...
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: (adding her voice)
dialog: There'll be no one left to stand alert.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER ADAMA
text: paces away from Athena and Tigh. He looks out the vast window to space
text: with the ships of the fleet scattered across the sky above Carillon.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Have we heard from Captain Skyler yet?
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: No, sir. He's been out of contact a full centon.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Does something feel very wrong to you, Colonel, of am I just
dialog: hopelessly paranoid?
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: I once read a book on tactical survival in an alien world. It said a
dialog: little paranoia was good for you.
text: Adama nods, heading out.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: I'm familiar with that book. I wrote it. Prepare my shuttle. I'm
text: returning to the surface.
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: Commander, about your book.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Yes. I've prepared a set of orders to cover that contingency. In
dialog: them, you will find my instructions for what to do to save the
text: Galactica and her fold, should the unhappy need arise.
text: Adama withdraws an envelope from his tunic and passes it to Tigh, who
text: examines it carefully.
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: You can't be serious.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
text: Deadly serious.
text: The two men exchange grim looks born of years of service together in
text: the face of a ruthless enemy.
text: ON TOP OF THE ELEVATOR WITHIN THE CASINO CORRIDOR
text: Starbuck lies facing up into the darkness, his eyes open
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Skyler...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Mmmm...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: You awake?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: You hear something?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
text: Sounded like a door opening above.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Must be almost morning by now. Could be another one of their health
dialog: tours.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: You really intend to see where they go?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Just like your father...
text: Skyler seems to care about the conversation for the first time. His
text: eyes shift over to the form sharing the claustrophobic space beside
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: No offense meant. I guess I have a reputation for taking things kind
dialog: of loose and easy. Doesn't mean I don't appreciate it whem someone
dialog: sticks his neck out for me. You, I mean...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: I thought we were talking about my father.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: I was...in a way...I mean...we wouldn't have survived if he hadn't
dialog: done what he did...and what you did...what you had to do. That took
dialog: a lot of courage, too.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: This isn't courage, Starbuck; it's reflex. You know you're a complete
dialog: Warrior when you find you can leave your own brother behind to die...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: To save how many more brothers? You can't feel responsible.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Starbuck, you're a naive young boy. Let me tell you what I feel...
dialog: what's really bothering me. It's how long it's taking me to feel
text: anything at all. Only now, two centons after he's gone, do I begin
dialog: to ache..to start to hurt...to want to cry. That's how programmed
dialog: I've become. So which one of us is the lesser living creature? The
text: one that's gone on or the one who is left behind and feels nothing?
text: Starbuck finds he's opened up a floodgate he isn't equipped to handle
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: I don't know...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Now you sound like a leader. I don't know, either.
text: Suddenly, the elevator begins to move downwards. Both men freeze with
text: cautious anxiety as the car stops.
speaker_heading: POINT OF VIEW
text: The shuttle vehicle begins loading passengers in front of the
text: elevator. They are all large, almost obeses creatures, some human,
text: some not, but all in a condition to necessitate waddling aboard the
dialog: bus.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Maybe it's going home time!
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Uh-uh. I'm willing to bet it's the great big payoff to the free trip
dialog: to Carillon. Oh, I forgot. You won't be around to see who wins.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Well, now, if you want to make a wager out of it...I mean, a real
dialog: man's wager...
text: Starbuck looks at Skyler with growing significance
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: It could be the most important bet you've made, Starbuck. It could
dialog: save a lot of people or it could cost you big...
text: Starbuck looks at Skyler with affection
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: It won't be the first time I rode everything I had on a long shot.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Thanks...
scene_heading: ON THE TOUR TRAM
text: as it moves out
scene_heading: ON STARBUCK AND SKYLER
text: as they drop off he top of the elevator onto the tram
scene_heading: INSIDE THE OVION CHAMBERS
text: The largest chamber. A tour is in progress, festive in mood, Seetol,
text: the Ovion guard, pointing out the wonderful ways of their world.
text: Amongst the gallery, Lyra and Athena.
speaker_heading: SEETOL
dialog: ...star system's largest Tylium mine, with a per annum capacity equal
dialog: to the needs of the entire galaxy.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: I wonder why it is, then, thay they've only managed to ship us one
dialog: token load?
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: I've noticed another curious thing...
dialog: (louder)
dialog: May I ask a question?
text: The group stops and turns to Lyra, as Seetol displays a public
text: relations smile.
speaker_heading: SEETOL
dialog: You are our guests. Of course.
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: I am fasciated by the order of your society and I cannot help but be
dialog: impressed by your industry...your complete dedication...I mean, one
dialog: gets the feeling that these people work until they simply drop...
speaker_heading: SEETOL
dialog: We know no other way...
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Well, what of family institutions? I somehow sense that something is
dialog: missing.
speaker_heading: SEETOL
dialog: We are very complete.
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: What about males?
speaker_heading: SEETOL
dialog: Males?
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Well, I don't mean to pry, but this is a female culture. Surely, there
dialog: must be males someplace. Perhaps you keep them at home, where they
dialog: belong...
text: A laugh from a group dominated by males.
speaker_heading: SEETOL
dialog: We don't keep them at all.
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: SEETOL
dialog: You are correct. Males have their place until they have served their
dialog: purpose, and then they have no place in our society.
text: As the implications become clearer, Lyra is torn between lividity and
dialog: a gulp
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Well, there certainly are value systems in your order worth looking
dialog: into...
text: Another small, nervous laugh and Seetol leads the group on. Lyra and
text: Athena quickly lean their heads together as they move on.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: She didn't mean what it sounded like...
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Remind me not to ask any more questions until we're out of here.
text: Suddenly, there is a commotion coming towards the tour group.
speaker_heading: FOUR OVION GUARDS
text: are running up the corridon in pursuit. What they are pursuing is not
text: clear at first, as the countless Ovion workers begin chattering their
text: high-pitched network of communications which drowns out an equally
text: high-pitched series of cries. Suddenly, it is clear
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: to reveal a small, barking droid racing along the corridor,
text: desperately trying to avoid its pursuers
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: is the first to recognize the situation
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Muffy...
text: Muffy quickly stops in its tracks...looks...runs to Lyra and begins a
dialog: frantic barking
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Muffy...it's me. Now what are you doing? Stop that.
text: The Ovion guards rush up and begin to reach for Muffy, but he quickly
text: takes asylum between Lyra's legs and the wall.
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: It's all right...he's just a droid...I'll take care of him
text: The Ovion begins to push Lyra out of the way
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Now stop that. I told you to leave him alone. What are you doing?
text: Seetol quickly moves up and communicates to the lead guard in high-
text: pitched chatterig. Seetol turns a frozen smile to Lyra
speaker_heading: SEETOL
dialog: You will have to allow them to take the droid.
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: I will not. He belongs to a little boy.
text: The significance of this strike her. She turns to Seetol.
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: The little boy...have they seen him?
speaker_heading: SEETOL
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: How do you know? You haven't asked them.
dialog: (She turns to the guard)
dialog: A small child...he's always with the droid. Did you see him?
text: The guard turns quickly to Seetol...says nothing
speaker_heading: SEETOL
dialog: They did see a child. It might be better if you went with them,
dialog: rather than delay the tour.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: I'll go with her.
speaker_heading: SEETOL
dialog: If you wish. The rest of the group must follow me.
text: Seetol leads them off. As they depart, a sense of emptiness befalls
dialog: Athena and Lyra
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Maybe you should stay with them. I don't like the feel of this.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: At least I'm a trained Warrior.
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: A little outnumbered, don't you think?
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Well, we're only goig to look for a small child. Let's not let our
text: imaginations run wild.
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Exactly. Well, gentlemen, after you...
text: The Ovion guards gesture for them to lead off in another direction,
text: exchanging quick personal looks. They start to lead, Muffy running
text: along beside them.
scene_heading: ON THE TOUR TRAM
text: racing along its course
speaker_heading: ON ITS ROOF
text: Starbuck and Skyler hanging on
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: You all right?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Beat walking back...maybe.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: One thing's bothering me.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Now you tell me. What is it?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: You notice those people getting on this thing...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: How could I help it? They must average three hundred pounds.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: Something that girl said. They're all putting on inordinate weight.
dialog: If you're importing people for slave labor, why bother letting them
dialog: get fat? It's a waste of food.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: And why let 'em win money? It's a waste of time.
text: A heave look crosses Starbuck's face
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Starbuck...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Yeah...?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Skip it...it's too ugly...
text: On Starbuck's worried face as the vehicle rolls off through the canyon
dialog: towards its curious destination
speaker_heading: AN OVION CORRIDOR
text: Athena and Lyra are being escorted up to a cell block. They begin to
text: hear the eerie, dsiquieting moaning
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: What's that awful sound?
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: I wouldn't ask, if I were you.
text: Suddenly, Lyra turns and stops dead in her tracks, startled beyond
text: belief. Athena screams...
speaker_heading: POINT OF VIEW
text: The cell containing a crush of living beings packed together. Muffy
text: beings to bark. The Ovions shove the two ladies ahead and past the
text: cell window as we hear a small voice barely discernable
speaker_heading: BOXEY
dialog: Muffy...
text: They have reached another cell. Boxey stands at the window. The room
text: is obviously identical to the one adjacent to it, save for Boxey. An
text: aperture in the wall beside the window is opened. Muffy charges in
text: and jumps up on Boxey.
speaker_heading: SEETOL
dialog: Inside...
speaker_heading: LYRA
dialog: Look...I have no intention...
text: She does not finish the sentence. She is hurled into the aperture and
text: catapulted into the glass room through some kind of vacuum device in
text: the aperture. Athena begins to scream. It is lost in a hiss of steam
text: as she is pushed into the aperture.
speaker_heading: SEETOL
text: nods for the Ovion guards to close the aperture. As the nearest guard
text: is about to do so, Muffy turns his head, looks, and streaks through
text: the opening, out of the cell, between the legs of the guard, and up
dialog: the corridor
speaker_heading: SEETOL
dialog: (a high-pitched, frantic demand)
text: The guards streak up the corridor in pursuit of Muffy
scene_heading: IN ANOTHER OVION CHAMBER
text: the tram has come to a stop inside a large, dark area. A row of Ovion
text: guards, well-armed and moving in a most businesslike fashion, move up
text: to form a rank just ooutside of the tram. A device is attached to the
text: door of the tram, opening it with a hiss. The first of several hefty
text: passengers step out into the room, gazing around in wonder and some
text: consternation.
speaker_heading: SEETOL
dialog: Please move quickly.
text: Seetol gestures towards a moving ramp which disappears into a cell-
dialog: like entrance.
speaker_heading: OBESE MAN #1
dialog: Look, fella, up 'til now, this has been a pretty nice trip, but that
dialog: bus was as hot as anything I've ever been in...
speaker_heading: SEETOL
dialog: Please move along...
speaker_heading: OBESE MAN #2
dialog: No, now you just hold on. We don't intend...
text: Suddenly, two Ovion guards shove the two men onto the ramp, sending
text: them flying unceremoniously into a heap. Behind them, the other Ovions
text: pick up the signal and abandon all decorum and pretense, shoving the
text: next people along with the barrels of their weapons. The women
text: immediately begin to scream, as they find themselves hurled into the
text: loading mechanism which carries the frightened, scrambling visitors
text: through the wall towards the unknown...
text: ON THE TOP OF THE TRAM
text: Skyler and Starbuck stare in amazement at the spectacle
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: The party's over...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: We gotta' do something...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: There's an army of them...we've gotta' keep from getting caught...
text: Skyler begins to edge back away from the side of the bus used for
text: unloading. He peers over the edge...
speaker_heading: POINT OF VIEW
dialog: Two Ovion guards...preoccupied
scene_heading: CLOSER ON THE GUARDS
text: chuckling in high-pitched frequencies over the way the living cargo
text: is being unloaded. To their backs, Starbuck and Skyler slide off of
text: the roof, down the side of the tram, and slip stealthily vack into
text: the darkened recesses of the chamber.
speaker_heading: ON MUFFY
text: racing through the corridor with Ovio guards chasing him
scene_heading: ON THE MAIN MINING CHAMBER
text: as Starbuck and Skyler step out of the shadows of a tributary corridor
text: and gaze around the immense digging in amazement
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: It's huge...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: And this is just one level. You notice something else...?
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
text: Ovions are doing the mining.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Right...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Which means...?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: It's awful, Starbuck. That casino is a feedlot.
text: Starbuck contemplates what Skyler is saying
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Come on...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: They're a race of cannibals. They're drawing in creatures from all
text: over the star system, fattening them up with indulgences, then...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: I thought I'd run into just about everything... Now what do we do?
dialog: We've got to tell the fleet about this place.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: (onimously)
dialog: They know about it. Look.
scene_heading: ACROSS THE MINE
text: a group of tourists from the fleet are being escorted
speaker_heading: GUIDE
dialog: ...largest Tylium mine in the star system...
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: What are they doing here?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Whatever it is, it look voluntary. Come on...
text: Skyler steps out ito the light of the corridor and starts towards the
dialog: tour
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Where are you going now? They're going to see...
text: Seetol and two Ovion guards round the corner, almost colliding with
text: Skyler and Starbuck. The guards raise their weapons.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Excuse us...we just got separated from our group.
text: Skyler gracefully oushes the muzzle of the closest guard's weapon out
text: of the way as he points after the tour just about to move out of the
dialog: main room
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: (to Seetol)
dialog: We'd better hurry along or there's no telling where we'll end up...
text: Skyler and Starbuck nerve their way past the Ovions who stare after
text: them, not quite sure what to make of the situation. As Skyler and
text: Starbuck rapidly approach the distant tour, their story beings to make
text: visibile sense, and Seetol turns from the tour and continues on her
text: way with the guards on either side of her.
speaker_heading: ON THE TOUR
text: As Skyler and Starbuck catch up, stealing a look back over their
text: shoulders. As the tour moves into an elevator...
speaker_heading: JENSING
dialog: Where'd you boys come from? You've missed most of the tour.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: We've seen quite a lot, actually.
scene_heading: IN THE ELEVATOR
speaker_heading: JENSING
dialog: You're lucky you didn't miss the next stop. We're guests of honor at
dialog: a banquet
text: Skyler and Starbuck exchange knowing looks
scene_heading: INSIDE THE EMPEROR'S ROOM
text: Lotay kneels before Baltar, who is flanked by the two Centurians
speaker_heading: LOTAY
text: A mere token force remains in the fleet of ships above Carillon, and
dialog: Commander Adama is now our guest.
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: LOTAY
dialog: Where he will not be disturbed.
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: Excellent, Lotay. As to the Warriors, until we've disarmed them, I
dialog: want as many of them relegated to a single chamber as possible.
text: A Centurian steps forward.
speaker_heading: CENTURIAN
dialog: By your command, Baltar. It is time to call in the Cylon war machine.
dialog: Baltar thinks about it
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: Yes, you are right...but only on my terms.
speaker_heading: CENTURIAN
dialog: And what are your terms?
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: An arangement I have worked out very carefully
text: ON A CYLON HOME BASE
dialog: somewhere in deep space
scene_heading: INSIDE THE IMPERIOUS LEADER'S INNER CHAMBER
text: a Centurian enters the large oom and crosses to the throne
speaker_heading: CENTURIAN
dialog: By your command...
speaker_heading: IMPERIOUS LEADER
dialog: Speak...
speaker_heading: CENTURIAN
text: Baltar sends a demand for the Base Star stationed at Quasar 47 for
text: immediate assault on the Human Fleet.
speaker_heading: IMPERIOUS LEADER
dialog: I will send him ten Base Stars.
speaker_heading: CENTURIAN
dialog: He will accept only one.
speaker_heading: IMPERIOUS LEADER
dialog: Indeed...and what is this bargain that I must accept...?
scene_heading: IN THE BANQUET ROOM
text: The tour arrives with Starbuck and Skyler. Music and a general air of
dialog: decadence, dissipation, the order of the day
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Would you look at this...they're having a party...
text: Skyler moves to Anton, who appears to be slightly drunk. He laughs
text: robustly, a golden goblet in one hand, a large fowl leg in the other
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Count Anton...what's happened? Why are all these people here? Carillon
dialog: was supposed to be a work stop.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: Ah, Commander Adama's elite corps. Of course you boys wanted all this
dialog: to yourselves. Well, I'm afraid this is a democracy...
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: It's going to be a debacle if you don't get these people out of here.
text: An Ovion servant seems to be taking an inordinate amount of time
text: refilling the wine glasses around Anton. Skyler turns from him,
text: placing an arm around Aton to lead him off.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: Lieutenant, in case you hadn't heard, you are draping yourself all
dialog: over a member of the Quorum of the Twelve
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Unless you want the shortest term in history, we'd better talk.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: I don't like your tone.
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: You aren't going to like what we're going to tell you, either...
text: Anton studies Starbuck's deliberate and penetrating gaze. He cannot
dialog: dismiss this most celebrated young Warrior.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: Lieutenant Starbuck, I've never been particularly fond of your bravado
dialog: escapades. This had better be important.
text: They move off together. In their wake, the Ovion servant moves quickly
text: off to speak to a guard at the door. The guard immediately departs.
text: IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: Now, then...what's this all about?
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Starbuck and I just returned from a patrol. What we've seen convinces
dialog: us that the Ovions will never allow a single human to leave here
dialog: alive.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: You're not serious. What possible motive could they have for wanting
dialog: us all dead? I suppose you're going to tell me they're part of the
dialog: Cylon Alliance.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Worse...
text: ON SKYLER AND STARBUCK FROM ACROSS THE ROOM
text: As Skyler's lips blurt out the rest of the story, we can see Anton
text: pale as the details are revealed
scene_heading: IN THE EMPEROR'S ROOM
dialog: Seetol confronts Baltar
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: Who are these two Warriors who are causing the disturbance? Describe
dialog: them to me.
text: ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
speaker_heading: BRIDGE OFFICER
dialog: The livery ships have returned to the fleet, sir, and we've all but
dialog: completed boarding the food stores.
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: Very good. What about Tylium?
speaker_heading: BRIDGE OFFICER
dialog: Nothing. The Ovions are definitely stalling us on that.
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: It's as if they wanted to keep us here as long as possible. Did you
dialog: see Commander Adama?
speaker_heading: BRIDGE OFFICER
dialog: No, sir. I didn't realize he'd gone down to the surface.
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: That's odd...
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: Sir, long-range scanners are picking up a large number of ships
dialog: entering our vectors.
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: How long will it take them to reach our coordinates?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: They're traveling very fast...no more than a milliton.
speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: Recall all personnel from the surface. Connect me with Commander
dialog: Adama.
scene_heading: IN AN OVION CORRIDOR
text: Skyler moves hurriedly along with a large party from the banquet. As
text: they appraoch another chamber, another group exits with Starbuck, and
text: from across the corridor, a thrid group exits. The entire cluster
text: moves increasingly faster up the corridor
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Don't panic, people. Starbuck, hold them back. They're going to get
dialog: hurt.
text: But there is no containing them as they begin to hurry towards the
text: elevators, pushing and shoving.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: Please, please, ladies and gentlemen. If we just keep together and
dialog: don't push...
text: But Anton is pushed down, submerged into a gaggle of humanity
text: crushing towards the elevator.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
text: to Starbuck caught up in the traffic
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: It's no use, Starbuck. Let 'em go. Let's round up all our pilots.
text: CLOSE ON LOTAY IN THE EMPEROR'S ROOM
speaker_heading: LOTAY
dialog: We have monitored the Colonial frequencies. The Warriors are being
dialog: recalled.
speaker_heading: BALTAR
text: Then they know. Seal the chambers at once. No one is to leave.
speaker_heading: LOTAY
text: turns and exits hurriedly
text: ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA

speaker_heading: BRIDGE OFFICER

speaker_heading: TIGH
dialog: Why haven't we heard anything from Adama?
text: Tigh looks troubled
scene_heading: IN THE OVION CHAMBERS

speaker_heading: ON STARBUCK

speaker_heading: ON THE GUARDS

dialog: of the large room
speaker_heading: STARBUCK

speaker_heading: STARBUCK

speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: It's no use...the elevators aren't working.
text: A fighter pilot runs up beside Starbuck
speaker_heading: PILOT #2
dialog: Starbuck, I found most of the guys from Red Squadron
speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Well, where are they?
speaker_heading: PILOT #2
text: Sealed in a chamber and they've cut off the power to the doors
text: Suddenly, a single cell, high up in a corridor comes to life,
text: revealing an image of Baltar. The image is repeated in countless
text: cells down the corridor and the voice seems to reverberate from
dialog: throughout the entire complex
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: People of the Colonies...throw down your weapons...
speaker_heading: BALTAR
text: in his Emperor's room, addressing a scanner
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: I offer you salvation. Surrender or perish. Your Commander has made
dialog: his choice...
text: Adama strains against the shackles that imprison him.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Baltar...you dare to live...to walk amongst men...
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: My dear Adama, provincial to the end. I offer your people life. You
dialog: have but a few microns to decide. Even I couldn't call off the Cylon
dialog: destroyers -- once they reach your people huddled in those helpless,
dialog: miserable ships.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: What trahery have you in store for your race this time?
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: My dear man, treachery is a matter of perspective. It is the Cylons
dialog: who wish us dead, not I.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: How long have you been supporting their war machine by selling them
dialog: Tylium?
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: If not from me, then some other source. They would not be denied.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: Are you so much a fool that you believe you can trust them?
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: I am prepared to continue to offer them Tylium from the planet
dialog: Carillon in return for your lives. If they reject my offer, I will
dialog: destroy the planet. Not difficult, considering it's largely composed
dialog: of the most combustable material known to man.
speaker_heading: ADAMA
dialog: You expect me to accept slavery for our people...
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: You are not alone amongst my prisoners. Your daughter...
text: Baltar looks off as Athena and Boxey are escorted by two Cylon
text: guards. Athena runs from them into his arms
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Father...
text: Adama's hopes sink in response to the omnipoent threat
speaker_heading: BALTAR
dialog: You must make the choice. Life...or death for her and the boy...and
dialog: for your people. You haven't much time. If you have ot chosen to live
dialog: by the time the Cylons reach you, I will let you die. All of you.
scene_heading: ON THE CYLON WARRIORS

scene_heading: ON STARBUCK AND SKYLER

speaker_heading: STARBUCK
dialog: Stay back...

speaker_heading: SKYLER
