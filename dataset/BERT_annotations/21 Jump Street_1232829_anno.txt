dialog: El-Sayed-Schmidt. I triple-

text: Shots are fired as The Ghost and Scarface race into the cab
text: and start the truck, Schmidt and Jenko still in the back.
text: The truck takes off down the block as Josh heads back to his
text: patrol car and radios in for back up.
text: The 18-Wheeler SCREAMS down narrow streets, crushing cars as

text: Jenko stands rock solid, somehow unaffected.
speaker_heading: JENKO
dialog: Okay. Follow my lead.

text: Schmidt gathers himself and copies Jenko’s move exactly.
text: Except he flubs it, missing the second box and snagging

speaker_heading: HARDY

dialog: blaming me for allowing you to be

dialog: She’s convinced the reason this
dialog: debacle happened is you weren't
dialog: doing the exact same thing you did
dialog: the first time. She thinks doing
dialog: the same thing will make you
text: recapture the old chemistry and
dialog: somehow stop your egos from ruining
