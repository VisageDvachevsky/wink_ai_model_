speaker_heading: SOFTLY
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - DAY
text: Paraphernalia strewn around a sink - tweezers, glue, makeup,

scene_heading: INT. SPENCER'S PARENTS’ HOME, INTERVIEW SETUP - DAY

speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER (O.S)
dialog: Can you explain what it is that you feel

scene_heading: REAL SPENCER'S DAD
dialog: My concern is that you will
dialog: sensationalize this story - that you will
dialog: make light of it - you will fictionalize
dialog: it for entertainment purposes. It will
dialog: bring the whole thing back up again. You

speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER
dialog: If you asked me would I do it all over

scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM MIRROR - DAY
dialog: Close on one of the men we caught snatches of previously - he

speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER (V.O.)
dialog: ...the pain we all caused everyone.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY/LIVING ROOM - DAY

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
text: Kubrick’s The Killing plays on an old TV. The man with the

scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - DAY
text: Actor Spencer and Actor Warren both unconvincingly disguised
text: as old men assess themselves one last time and then each

dialog: You have got to be fucking kidding me.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ACTOR CHAS
dialog: I thought you said the parking lot was
dialog: going to be vacant!
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: This time last week it was empty - maybe
dialog: it’s because of exams. Calm down - park

speaker_heading: ACTOR CHAS
dialog: Are you fucking retarded? Do you want to

speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: You can move the van while we’re inside

speaker_heading: ACTOR CHAS
dialog: And what if one doesn’t?
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Then fucking circle - Come on! We're

speaker_heading: ACTOR ERIC

speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER
dialog: Do you think his home environment was a
dialog: factor at all in what happened?
scene_heading: REAL WARREN’S MOM
dialog: Listen, it wasn’t ideal for anyone but
dialog: Warren wasn’t a child. If you're

dialog: You got the thing?
speaker_heading: ACTOR ERIC
dialog: Yes I’ve got the thing.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Just stick to the plan. OK? Let’s do
dialog: this.
text: As they turn to go we follow them around the side of the van
text: and track behind them to reveal that they are heading toward
text: an imposing mock-colonial building on the other side of an
text: open quad which is clearly part of a school campus. We follow
text: them across the quad toward the steps - it’s a strange moment
text: - we feel the rush of blood pumping in our ears, off-speed,
text: noises are distorted, everything a little off - a feeling of
text: dissociation. Students look straight at them/us aware that
text: they are out of place. We track up the steps to the doors of
text: the library - flashes of the opening images - sunlight
text: through trees, passing through suburban Lexington - snippets
text: of home videos of kids blowing out birthday candles, a
text: child's painting being painted, etc.
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER (V.O.)
dialog: I feel like we’re all sold a picture of
dialog: what our lives are supposed to look like -

text: Pushing v close in now on the CLOCK - The minute hand hits

text: noisily onto a smash of bright sunlight from where Warren,
text: Spencer and Eric enter and stop still.
text: Their POV - a large well appointed library sparsely-filled
text: with students and some staff - some turn or raise their heads

speaker_heading: REAL ERIC’S MUM

speaker_heading: REAL ERIC’S DAD

speaker_heading: ACTOR ERIC
dialog: I’m not entirely sure why we felt the

scene_heading: INT. REAL ERIC INTERVIEW SETUP - DAY
speaker_heading: REAL ERIC

speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL
dialog: Warren Lipka
dialog: 11
text: A big cheer as Warren, a tall, handsome and clearly popular
text: character bounds up the steps and instead of taking the

dialog: two parents.
speaker_heading: REAL ERIC (V.O.)
dialog: That’s Warren - he really did do that.
dialog: That's just what he was like, he was one
dialog: of those guys who was just fun to be

dialog: seriously.

speaker_heading: REAL ERIC (V.O.)
dialog: Why did I volunteer for ritual

speaker_heading: HOT GIRL

speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: No, I think the last one is like tomorrow

scene_heading: INT. TRANSY UNIVERSITY LIBRARY - DAY

dialog: Through these doors lives what we call
dialog: the Special Collection Museum - you will
dialog: all be allowed inside today but if you
dialog: wish to view works from the collection in

scene_heading: INT. TRANSY UNIVERSITY LIBRARY - SPECIAL COLLECTIONS MUSEUM
speaker_heading: ROOM —DAY

dialog: Bo
dialog: (putting on a pair of white gloves)
dialog: Many of the books have been in this
dialog: library for over a century, many have
dialog: been loaned or donated and we are proud
dialog: to be home to some of the rarest editions
dialog: in the United States. (To Spencer,
dialog: handing him a pair of gloves) would you
dialog: care to pop these on and assist me with
dialog: the pages?
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: So long as we’re not doing any cavity
dialog: searches.
text: BJ ignores this, she escorts them to a table where a huge
text: book is open under a low watt tungsten lamp.
speaker_heading: BJ
dialog: What you see here is a second edition of
dialog: John James Audubon’s Birds of America. In
dialog: around 1820 at the age of 35, Audubon set
dialog: out to illustrate every single bird in
dialog: America...
text: BJ is in her element, there’s a sparkle in her eye and we
dialog: also begin to see the beauty of what the book contains - this
text: is not lost on Spencer.
speaker_heading: BJ (TO SPENCER) (CONT'D)
dialog: It may surprise you to learn that despite
dialog: the exceptional quality of the work,
dialog: Audubon was unable to find a single
dialog: interested publisher in the United States
dialog: and was forced to travel to England to
dialog: find financial backing to finish the
dialog: project.
text: The pictures are genuinely astonishing - vibrant and powerful
text: - they fill the frame one after another.
speaker_heading: BJ (CONT'D)
dialog: You may not consider it art in the
dialog: conventional sense but I think it’s hard
dialog: to argue that this is not a work of art
dialog: of the highest form.
text: She seems to be directing this at Spencer or so he feels.
speaker_heading: BJ (CONT'D)
text: This is in fact one of two copies the
dialog: library has held, the other copy was sold
dialog: last month at auction for six million
dialog: dollars and I can tell you that was a
dialog: less fine example than the one in front
dialog: of you now. And this isn’t even the most
dialog: valuable book in our collection.

speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: Did you say light or life?
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
text: Light, like points of light. But it’s
dialog: made up of diamonds.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: No, but check this out - I held something

text: conversation held in different locations - shot to match cut.
scene_heading: INT. SPENCER'S ACURA LEGEND - NIGHT
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: That’s not even the most valuable thing

scene_heading: EXT. RICH’S GARDEN - HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Fuck, if I had six million dollars pretty
dialog: sure I wouldn’t spend it on a book.

dialog: Actually it’s more like a work of art

dialog: beautiful.
text: They sit in silence in the car for a while - out of the front
text: window snow has begun to fall - a country road stretching
text: into darkness - the sound of the WINDSHIELD WIPERS. It’s hard
text: to see far ahead. After a while Warren blurts:
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: It’s in the Library? When you say it’s in
dialog: the library, it’s not on a shelf
dialog: obviously?
text: We keep cutting to the view out of the front window which
text: puts us increasingly on edge - as if something’s about to
text: come flying out of the snowy darkness - this is made
text: considerably worse when Warren takes his eye of the road,
text: repeatedly turning to talk to Spencer.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: Of course it’s not on a shelf - it’s in
dialog: the special collections museum.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN (FASCINATED)
dialog: Is that like a vault?
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: Not really, it’s kind of like a separate
dialog: section with cases and stuff.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: And it’s got guards on the doors and
dialog: shit?
text: A gas station appears ahead - they pull in.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER

speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Because there’s security everywhere?

speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: No, because you have to make an

text: He shuts the door. Inside the car we find REAL WARREN now sat
text: in the drivers seat - as he talks to camera the background
text: slowly disappears.
speaker_heading: REAL WARREN
dialog: If this is how Spencer remembers it I’m
dialog: not going to argue. I just remember it
dialog: seemed incredible to me. All that money
dialog: sitting their in the form of a book! In
dialog: the form of an adventure - and almost
dialog: nothing standing in the way of someone
text: just up and taking it.
scene_heading: INT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - DAY

scene_heading: INT. REAL SPENCER INTERVIEW SET UP
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER
dialog: It didn’t surprise me that he didn’t let

dialog: You will if you stand there long enough.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Spores man. Amazing.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: You ever wonder if we have a say in
dialog: anything that happens? You ever wonder
dialog: how come you ended up being born you and
dialog: not someone else? I mean how does any of
dialog: that get decided? You think it’s just a
dialog: lottery? Like why are we us and not like

dialog: ever think about that?

speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Sometimes.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER

speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: I think if you don’t make it happen, it
dialog: probably never will.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: And you think committing a crime would be
dialog: one way of achieving that?
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: I’m not saying it’s the only way but
dialog: yeah, it probably is one way. At least
dialog: you'd be remembered.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: Well ending up in prison would certainly
dialog: be different - not sure that’s what I had
dialog: in mind.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: What about ending up on a fucking boat in
dialog: the Caribbean like at the end of
dialog: Shawshank Redemption?
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: That’s the movies dude. I’m not sure

speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN

speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: Do what properly? Spot us doing what?

dialog: So we know the layout like the back of

text: out from any given point in the building.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: It would be easier just to draw the
dialog: layout from scratch.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Now you’re talking my artistic little

dialog: of every fucker who works here.
scene_heading: WARREN INTERVIEW SET UP
speaker_heading: REAL WARREN

scene_heading: SPENCER INTERVIEW SET UP
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER
dialog: Neither of us were serious but we were
dialog: enjoying the fantasy of it. Talking about

text: cuttaways of Warren and Spencer watching - as if they too are
text: in the same room - all part of the same gang. As Clooney
text: describes the high-tech layout, instead of images of the

scene_heading: INT. WARREN INTERVIEW SETUP
speaker_heading: REAL WARREN

scene_heading: INT. TRANSY UNIVERSITY LIBRARY - DAY
text: Spencer is sat in the library - pretending to study but is

scene_heading: INT. WARREN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Warren watches as Spencer lays out about 18 A4 sheets of

scene_heading: REAL SPENCER'S DAD

scene_heading: REAL SPENCER'S MOM
dialog: I think perhaps he felt he didn’t really
dialog: fit in - or people didn’t understand that

scene_heading: REAL SPENCER'S DAD

speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER (SCREAMS)
dialog: SHUT THE FUCK UP!
text: The cicadas stop instantly. The silence is just as deafening.
text: Spencer is surprised.
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER (V.O.)
dialog: For me it was a secret that set me apart

speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: I didn’t say anything.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Why are you being such a jerk?
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: What do you want from me Megan - my folks

dialog: five days a week and if I don’t get my

speaker_heading: MEGAN

speaker_heading: REAL WARREN (V.0O.

speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: And when we are together you seem

scene_heading: INT. REAL WARREN INTERVIEW SET UP - DAY
speaker_heading: REAL WARREN
dialog: There was a lot about my future, or

speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: What do you think we’re going to do with

speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: What’s do you imagine’s gonna happen?
dialog: That's why he wants to meet in a public

speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: I know you think this is a game Spencer,
dialog: but this is not a world or a dude we are

scene_heading: REAL WARREN (BACK IN VISION)
dialog: He didn’t say a whole lot and it was

text: We are tracking behind Warren - he looks over and we follow

scene_heading: INT. AMSTERDAM CAFE - DAY
text: His POV - a decidedly low key interior of faux pine walls and
text: formica tables where the staff and clientele are as dusty as
text: the furniture - a pair of old codgers at the bar, an elderly
text: couple at a table eating soup in silence and the two middle
text: aged men at a booth in the window - both staring up at
text: Warren. One is thick set wearing a cable-knit jumper with a
text: beard and glasses. The other is smaller and older with
text: nicotine grey thinning hair, he looks like a university
text: professor. He wears a shirt, cardigan and a sports jacket
text: that was new in the 70s. A full ashtray and half-full coffee
text: cups sit between them on the table.
dialog: Warren approaches
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Hi, I’m David, I work with Mr Beckman.
text: He holds out his hand - the men clearly can’t be bothered to

speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN (CONT’D)
dialog: No, no - I have come from the United

dialog: Beckman? He sent me here to meet with
dialog: you? To discuss - wait (suddenly unsure) -
dialog: you are the people we've been e-mailing,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: BEARDED MAN
dialog: Ya, we receive e-mails from Beckman. You
dialog: have some books and some paintings.
dialog: 52
text: Awkward silence as Warren pulls out and unfolds the piece of

text: pocket of his sports jacket.
speaker_heading: BEARDED MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You have these works with you in
dialog: Amsterdam?
text: Warren looks confused.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: No, no I don’t have the works with me.
dialog: How could... The idea was to discuss with
dialog: you...
text: The two Dutchmen exchange looks - this is a waste of their
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: BEARDED MAN
dialog: (cutting him off)
dialog: Where is your Beckman? He is also in
dialog: Amsterdam?
dialog: This isn’t going how Warren had hoped.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: No, no, Mr Beckman is in the US - you see
text: he is quite elderly and it isn’t easy for
text: him to travel. (Composing himself) He is
text: quite a wealthy man with a large
dialog: collection of art and antiquities which
dialog: he understood could be of interest to
dialog: you. He has sent me all this way to talk
dialog: to you about which of the items in his
dialog: possession might be of interest and what
dialog: value you would place upon them...
text: The older man says something unintelligible to the Bearded
text: Man in Dutch and hands over the printout of the various
text: books. The Bearded man looks at the list for a while. The
text: older man makes to get out of the booth forcing Warren to
text: stand up to let him out - it’s unclear if he is leaving or
text: going to the bathroom.
speaker_heading: BEARDED MAN
dialog: Mr Beckman is your father?
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: No, no he is my employer. (beat) Well,
dialog: actually we are kind of related. He is
dialog: married to my mother’s sister - kind of
dialog: an uncle.
text: The bearded man seems to take this in with an almost
text: imperceptible degree of approval. He takes out a pen and
text: circles three or four items from the list and hands it back
dialog: to Warren.
dialog: 53
speaker_heading: BEARDED MAN
dialog: Naturally the Audubon books and the
dialog: Darwin will be of interest to us with the
dialog: correct authentications.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: OK, when you say authentications?
speaker_heading: BEARDED MAN
dialog: Ya, naturally. The correct appraisals
dialog: from a famous auction house in United
dialog: States. You have heard of the Christie's
dialog: or the Sothebys perhaps?
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: OK, so with the correct appraisals from
dialog: the famous auction house these books
dialog: would be of interest to you?
speaker_heading: BEARDED MAN
dialog: Naturally, yes. We will buy these books.
dialog: This is more like it.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: And can I ask roughly what value you
dialog: would place on the individual items?
speaker_heading: BEARDED MAN
dialog: Naturally thirty to forty percent of the

speaker_heading: ACTOR ERIC
text: They have Electronic keypads on the doors
dialog: - that means the doors have electronic

text: out how to kill the bell on the alarm
dialog: itself, it’s probably connected into a

speaker_heading: ACTOR ERIC
dialog: (still looking through the binos)
dialog: It can’t be done at night. It’s the one

dialog: say were in the special collections room?
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: Two that I could see.
speaker_heading: ACTOR ERIC
dialog: So we need to find out who’s watching,
dialog: when and for how long.

text: A bank of grainy security monitors. Angle on Spencer looking
text: at them transfixed.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD (0.C.)
dialog: Son...? Son? - You said you think it was
dialog: stolen? From your person?
text: A security guard sat behind a messy desk tries to regain
text: Spencer's attention.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D)
dialog: Son?
text: Two other security guards are sat in front of the screens
text: absorbed in anything but monitoring them. The security guard
text: at the desk pours coffee from a thermos flask. Spencer moves
text: further into the room.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: Well I fell asleep in the library and
dialog: when I woke up my wallet was missing.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Have you checked lost and found? Library
dialog: isn’t exactly a hotbed of crime.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: Um, no. I’m pretty sure it was stolen and
dialog: I thought you might have security footage
dialog: from when it happened?
text: He feels this gives him an excuse to look back in the
text: direction of the monitors. He picks out the parking lot and
text: the front of the library but nothing of the interior or the
text: rear of the building.
speaker_heading: SECURTITY GUARD
dialog: Well you'd need to file a police report
dialog: and they would have to request the tapes
dialog: from us - not something we can help you
dialog: with directly.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: But you have cameras inside the library?
speaker_heading: SECURTITY GUARD
dialog: We're not at liberty to discuss where the
dialog: cameras are or ain’t and strictly
dialog: speaking you’re not supposed to be in
dialog: here either.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: OK, I’11 check with lost and found in
dialog: case it got handed in.
dialog: 63
text: Spencer backs out of the office watching the screens as he
text: goes. His POV - pushing in - one of the screens shows a
text: bird's eye view of the campus parking lot - virtually empty -
text: and in the bottom left corner we see a familiar car - a
text: pedestrian approaches and opens a rear door and gets in.
scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SPENCER'S ACURA LEGEND - CAMPUS PARKING LOT - EVENING
text: Spencer slides into the back seat. Warren and Eric are in the
dialog: front.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Well? Did you get in the room?
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: Yeah - nothing of the inside so far as I
text: could see. The only interiors I could see
dialog: were of like the main building,
dialog: reception, the trophy cabinet, the gym,
dialog: the pool, shit like that.
speaker_heading: ACTOR ERIC
dialog: And were the screens changing - like
text: rotating through a bunch of different
dialog: cameras?
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: Nope - they were all just fixed on the
dialog: same thing. They can see us sat right
dialog: here though.
text: Warren starts up the engine.
speaker_heading: ACTOR ERIC
dialog: Man, how can they have millions of
dialog: dollars worth of shit stashed right in
dialog: there and no cameras on it?
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: Yeah, someone should probably write a
dialog: letter.
text: Warren puts the car in gear and screeches out of the parking
dialog: lot.
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER (V.O.)
text: Warren moved into the basement of the
dialog: bungalow where Eric lived.
scene_heading: EXT. BUNGALOW - DAY

dialog: Eric was living with Chas at the time who
dialog: he and Warren had gone to Lexington
dialog: Catholic High with...

speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL
dialog: Charles Allen!
text: Modest applause as a straight-laced looking boy makes his way
text: to the podium.
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER (V.O.)
dialog: Chas’ dad was a bigshot real estate guy,
dialog: he owned the bungalow and Chas lived
dialog: upstairs.
scene_heading: INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM/WARREN'S DEN - DAY
text: Chas, conventionally good looking and preppy is cycling on an
text: exercise bike in the middle of the living room whilst doing
text: weights, looking at himself in the mirror and watching
text: Bloomberg TV on a big plasma screen.
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER (V.O.)
dialog: I never cared much for Chas if I’m honest
dialog: - we had zero in common. He was all about
dialog: money, that was his thing.
text: WE SINK down through the floor until we are in:
scene_heading: INT. WARREN’S BASEMENT
text: Warren is standing in front of what looks to be a window
text: covered by a large set of floral curtains - he pulls a cord
text: and the curtains separate to reveal not a window but the
text: Heist Planning Wall now in it’s new home - yet more detailed
text: and seemingly more ordered. Spencer and Eric nod approvingly
text: from the sofa.
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER (V.O.)
dialog: Sometimes I think the planning could have
text: gone on forever. But then something
dialog: happened.
speaker_heading: A TELEVISION
text: The local morning news plays - a squeaky smiley blonde female
text: anchor and a jock-like co-hoast with a punchable face:
dialog: 65
speaker_heading: BLONDE NEWSREADER
dialog: Good news if you woke up wondering if you
dialog: were living in the right town today folks
dialog: as Forbes Magazine names Lexington ‘9th
dialog: best place to launch a business or career
dialog: in the United States’. Bob, how about
dialog: that? Do you agree? - You don’t seem to
dialog: be doing too badly yourself.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Ha, that’s right Loraine. According to
dialog: Forbes, the best metro areas to launch a
dialog: business or a career revolve around
dialog: universities that offer a diverse,
text: educated work force. Lexington comes in
text: just behind Huntsville, Alabama and just
dialog: ahead of Richmond, Virginia....
text: We reveal that the TV is playing in the waiting room outside
text: the Dean of the University of Kentucky’s office. The room is
text: empty except for Warren who stares blankly at the TV anda
text: plump over-adorned secretary (70s) with a thirty year old
text: hairdo sits doing sudoku until her intercom buzzes and she
dialog: picks it up:
speaker_heading: SECRETARY (ON PHONE)
dialog: No, you have a student waiting and then
text: nothing until Mrs Palmer’s leaving lunch
dialog: at Pomodoro... well Bruce generally has
text: the Linguine and doesn’t seem to suffer
dialog: too much after... I’1l send him through.
text: She puts down the phone and addresses Warren.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY (CONT’D)
dialog: You can go through...
text: Warren is lost in the morning show.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY (CONT’D)
dialog: Mr Lipka? - You can go through.
text: Warren comes round from wherever he’s been and walks toward
text: the dean’s office. He looks tired.
scene_heading: INT. DEANS OFFICE, UNIVERSTIY OF KENTUCKY - DAY
text: The dean (late 50s) is a man at one with his place in the
text: world - confident, Christian and untroubled by life’s bigger
dialog: questions.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Take a seat Warren.
text: Warren sits in front of the dean’s desk and takes in the
text: walls adorned with photos depicting the glittering successes
text: of former students. A photo of the Dean himself with George W
text: beams from the mantelpiece.
dialog: 66
speaker_heading: DEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Well this is unexpected wouldn’t you say?
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: I guess it is sir.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Son, you came here on a soccer
dialog: scholarship. Perhaps you don’t quite
dialog: appreciate what that means-
text: Warren opens his mouth to speak -
speaker_heading: DEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: What it means is that you are one of a
dialog: tiny handful of athletes who have beaten
dialog: off thousands of others to be given free
dialog: tuition at one of America’s top tier
dialog: academic institutions. Does that not
dialog: sound like something to you? Cos it sure
dialog: as heck does to me.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Yes sir it does.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Well son you have an interesting way of
dialog: showing it because you've just pissed it
dialog: away. Coach Morris says here you have
dialog: consistently failed to show up on time if
dialog: at all for training, your commitment is
dialog: next to non-existent. Your father aware
dialog: of this?
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: No sir.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: What do you imagine he’ll have to say
dialog: about it?
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Actually, things aren’t going so well at
dialog: home at the moment sir.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: That's as maybe but it’s no excuse. A man
dialog: has to be responsible for his actions
dialog: Warren and those actions have
dialog: consequences.
text: Warren ‘s POV past the Dean to the faces grinning down at him
text: - so content in their shit-eating picture-perfect lives.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: (inaudibly)
dialog: The sack
dialog: 67
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Come again son?...
text: Warren is elsewhere.
speaker_heading: DEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: It pains me to see you lose this
dialog: scholarship and I know it’s gonna pain
dialog: your pop a whole lot more. You might want
dialog: to think about what that kind of
dialog: disappointment will be not just for you
dialog: but for your family.
text: Warren nods thoughtfully, then speaks without anger.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Well sir. I’ve worked my ass off to get
dialog: on that team since I was about five, and
dialog: you know what? I have zero idea why. To
dialog: be honest sir, I think you and this whole
dialog: place are the real disappointment.
text: The Dean cocks his head - fairly sure he’s misheard this.
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER (V.O.)
dialog: After that the robbery was pretty much
dialog: all Warren had to think about.
scene_heading: INT. UNKNOWN LOCATION
text: The same top shot of the hands, the paper and the dots of

dialog: of an eye.
scene_heading: INT. BUNGALOW - WARREN’S BASEMENT - DAY
text: We find Warren sitting alone - the Heist Wall behind him -
text: the debris of a man with no better place to be. He sits
text: smoking and drinking whisky from a crystal tumbler, on the TV
text: is the scene from the Thomas Crown affair in which Steve
text: McQueen is sat in a palatial Manhattan office telephoning
text: members of his criminal gang and telling them: “Go”. He seems
text: to come to a snap decision, reaches for the TV remote, hits
text: mute, picks up the phone and dials.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Hello, could you please put me through to
dialog: the library... um, yeah the main library,
dialog: Special Collections Room please....
scene_heading: INT. CAMPUS BAR - UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY - NIGHT
text: Spencer plays pinball whilst Warren stands next to him.
dialog: 68
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: And you know what craziest bit of it is?
dialog: You can actually request them to have the
dialog: books laid out for you when you arrive
dialog: for an appointment - they actually get
dialog: them ready for you.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: How do you know all this?
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: I made an appointment.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: You did what?
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: I made an appointment - I used your name
dialog: and I said we wanted to view the Audubons
dialog: and you wanted to bring a friend.
text: Spencer stops what he’s doing and turns to look at Warren who
text: is more concerned about Spencer taking his eye off the
text: pinball machine - he notices that Spencer is irritated.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s time man. It’s time.
text: CLOCK - the one we saw in the opening sequence - striking 11.
speaker_heading: CAPTION:
scene_heading: TUESDAY, MAY 8 2004
scene_heading: INT. TRANSY UNIVERSITY LIBRARY - DAY
text: Spencer's POV - We are gliding up a wide curving staircase -
text: students passing us on the way down. We are trailing a small
text: male librarian who turns back to address us:
speaker_heading: MALE LIBRARIAN
dialog: You're a little late so she probably
dialog: won't have long.
text: They follow him to the top of the stairs and toward the glass
text: doors of the Special Collection Museum - once there, he taps
text: on the glass to get BJ’s attention. Inside the room BJ walks
text: toward the door and places a keycard over a small electronic
text: panel, a red light turns green on the keypad outside and the
text: male Librarian holds open the door for them. They enter and
text: he shuts the door which locks behind them, the light turns
text: red and he re-descends the stairs leaving the boys inside the
text: room alone with BJ. We see all of the above in detail as
text: Warren observes, making a mental note of each part of the
dialog: process.
dialog: 69
scene_heading: INT. TRANSY LIBRARY, SPECIAL COLLECTIONS SECTION - DAY
speaker_heading: BETTY-JEAN
dialog: Please sign in on your right. I have the
dialog: Audubon laid out over here and the
text: Illuminated Manuscript at the back. Was
dialog: there one you wanted to view first?
text: Warren is taking it all in - the glass cases, motion sensors,
text: the low-lighting, the books, locks on each cabinet - it’s as
text: if he’s been let into Aladdin's cave.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WARREN'S DEN - NIGHT - FLASHFORWARD
text: The three boys are sitting around a table on which Spencer
text: has created a scale model of the Special Collections room.
text: Complete with tiny figurines to represent BJ and each of the
dialog: boys.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: The cameras aren’t cameras - they’re
dialog: motion detectors - they are here and here
dialog: and they aren’t on during the day. And
dialog: back here...
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. TRANSY LIBRARY, SPECIAL COLLECTIONS SECTION - DAY
text: Spencer is pouring over the Audubon Birds of America - first
text: edition. He seems lost in its beauty.
speaker_heading: BETTY-JEAN
dialog: I understand you are a fine-arts major.
dialog: Do the Manuscripts feature in your
dialog: studies? I don’t generally get much
dialog: interest in these from students.
text: Spencer looks up - his mind elsewhere.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: Pardon?
scene_heading: INT. REAL BETTY JEAN GOOCH INTERVIEW SET UP
scene_heading: REAL BETTY-JEAN
dialog: He seemed rather offhand. He wasn’t
text: interested in having a conversation,
dialog: didn’t seem willing to discuss his
dialog: project and my impression was that he
dialog: seemed rather aloof. Having said that, I
dialog: did feel he was respectful of the books.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:

scene_heading: INT. TRANSY LIBRARY, SPECIAL COLLECTIONS SECTION - DAY
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Wow, and so after the Audubon, which are
dialog: the next most valuable in the collection?
dialog: Bet everyone asks that, huh?
scene_heading: INT. WARREN'S DEN - NIGHT - FLASHFORWARD
text: As before, Warren is as focused as we’ve seen him - he points
dialog: to the relevant locations on the model.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: And back here, my furry friends is the
text: staff elevator. (stroking the model
dialog: elevator) Ah, sweet, sweet elevator - let
dialog: me inside you.. What do you fucking know?
text: An elevator which goes directly to the
dialog: basement from where we can gain access to
text: the fire exit at the rear of the
dialog: building.
scene_heading: INT. TRANSY LIBRARY, SPECIAL COLLECTIONS SECTION - DAY
text: BJ is touring Warren around the museum proudly pointing out
dialog: the books of greatest significance:
speaker_heading: BETTY-JEAN
dialog: Well, the Origin of Species is one of
dialog: only two first editions in the United
dialog: States and then there’s The Illuminated
dialog: Manuscripts which are obviously
text: handwritten and illustrated rather than
dialog: printed. So you see they are absolutely
dialog: one of a kind. Priceless really.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WARREN'S DEN - NIGHT - FLASHFORWARD
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: The books will be laid out for us here
dialog: and here. We will ask for the two
dialog: Audubons - the most valuable books in the
dialog: collection - to be on display for us when
dialog: we arrive. The other books we are going
dialog: to take are in the cases here and here.
dialog: They will be locked.

speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. WARREN'S DEN - NIGHT (CONT'D)
text: We are inside the scale model at ground level - Warren is in
text: full flow - as he speaks we see the figurines which represent
text: each of them manipulated by giant fingers - like a puppet
text: show in which the figurines are the ones doing the talking.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN (0.S.)
dialog: BJ needs to be brought down hard and fast
dialog: - she has to become a non-factor as soon
text: as the other member of staff is out of
dialog: sight. She is the single biggest risk to
dialog: us.
text: Angle on Figurine Warren.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN (CONT’D)
dialog: We bring her down here maybe with a tazer
dialog: - we tie her and gag her and put her over
text: here where she can’t be seen from the
dialog: doorway.
text: As Warren describes this we see short steadicam sequences in
text: which we see precisely what he envisages executed with
dialog: military precision.
speaker_heading: FLASH ON:
scene_heading: INT. TRANSY LIBRARY, SPECIAL COLLECTIONS SECTION - FANTASY
text: Warren (dressed in a sharp suit) is let into the room, makes
text: Clooney-esque pleasantries - BJ turns her back on him and in
text: one deft movement Warren grabs her and tazers her, catches
text: her neatly as she falls and then glides with her around the
text: corner laying her down out of sight. He gags her gently with
text: her own neckerchief, zip-ties her hands and feet like a pro
text: and lays a blanket over her.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. WARREN’S DEN - NIGHT
text: The scale model - we see the tiny figurine of BJ laid face-
text: down - hands and feet tied, mouth gagged. Spencer, looking

speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: When that’s done we take her swipe card

speaker_heading: FLASH ON:
scene_heading: INT. TRANSY LIBRARY, SPECIAL COLLECTIONS SECTION - FANTASY
text: One camera movement - Warren removes BJ's electronic key card
text: which is attached to her belt - as he moves toward the glass

text: Warren swipes the keypad and Spencer pirouettes into the room
text: holding the door for Eric - it’s like Seal Team 6 meets the
dialog: Bolshoi.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN (V.O.)
dialog: .»+-once in the room Eric and I will put
text: the books in the sheets, open the cases
dialog: and fill the bags. Spencer you’1ll call

dialog: your backpack.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. WARREN’S DEN - NIGHT.
text: As Warren talks we push in on Spencer who is watching but
text: seems troubled. As we push in further he speaks to camera
dialog: with Real Spencer's voice:
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: I didn’t know whether I wanted off the
dialog: roller-coaster or to stay strapped in. I
dialog: felt like I was in a river rushing faster
text: and faster toward the sea.
text: As he speaks we cut to images of the world outside, Lexington
text: at night in the pouring rain, the bungalow, empty streets,
text: the houses, traffic lights, the library, rain, wind and more
dialog: rain.
scene_heading: INT. WARREN’S DEN - NIGHT
text: As before but now Eric is up and pacing.
speaker_heading: ACTOR ERIC
dialog: It doesn’t work - we need at least two of
dialog: us inside the room, we need another
text: keeping lookout inside the library and a
dialog: getaway driver - three isn’t enough - it
dialog: won’t work.
dialog: 73
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: You bring in one more person and that’s
dialog: almost ten percent less per person -
dialog: that’s a lot - that’s like a million
dialog: dollars less each.
speaker_heading: ACTOR ERIC
dialog: I’d rather have 25 percent less of
dialog: something than 100 percent of nothing cos
dialog: we fucked it up.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: He’s right, we need someone else. Needs
dialog: to be someone with a car or access to
dialog: money to get one that we can ditch after
dialog: the robbery.
text: The camera starts to rise upwards and keeps going through the
text: floor to the room upstairs - we hear the sound of fucking but
dialog: then find

scene_heading: ERIC INTERVIEW SETUP
speaker_heading: REAL ERIC
dialog: Chas was a high achiever but he was less

dialog: since junior high so I figured even if he
dialog: didn’t want in on it, he probably
dialog: wouldn't give us up.
text: CHAS INTERVIEW SET UP.
speaker_heading: REAL CHAS
dialog: Once I realised they were serious, my
dialog: first thought was that they were on drugs

scene_heading: INT. REAL SPENCER INTERVIEW SET UP

speaker_heading: REAL CHAS
dialog: 12 million, that was the number that kept
dialog: coming up - you know, 3 million dollars
dialog: each. It still wasn’t worth it, the risk
dialog: was too big. Those guys were drifting
dialog: y'know - they just didn’t have much
dialog: direction - especially Warren, he seemed
dialog: lost to me. I already had the lawn-care
dialog: business, I had bits of real estate, I
dialog: was doing ok in college, the future was
dialog: peachy. Why throw all that away on a
dialog: prank?
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER

speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: What’s wrong with Mr Pink?
speaker_heading: ACTOR CHAS
dialog: You know exactly what’s wrong with Mr
dialog: Pink and can I just say how fucking dumb
dialog: this is because in the movie the whole
dialog: point of them having those names was
dialog: because none of them knew what the others
dialog: were really called so they couldn’t give
dialog: each other up.
dialog: 75
text: The boys stifle giggles having evidently predicted this.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: (enjoying this) Relax Mr Pink - this is

speaker_heading: ACTOR CHAS
dialog: Wait a minute - I have finals that day.
speaker_heading: ACTOR ERIC

speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER

speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: (smugly)
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: ACTOR ERIC
dialog: What do you mean “exactly”?
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: I mean who’s going to suspect a group of

text: The boys absorb this thought.
scene_heading: INT. REAL SPENCER INTERVIEW SET UP
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER
dialog: There was no insurmountable obstacle.

dialog: just never came up.
scene_heading: EXT. LEXINGTON RESIDENTIAL STREETS - DUSK
text: Spencer is driving alone. Shots like those we saw at the
text: beginning: Sunlight through trees - picturebook houses with
text: manicured lawns.
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER (V.O.)
text: So I found myself at a fork in the road.
text: One way leading to a place where
dialog: everything turns out more or less how
dialog: it’s supposed to. And the other...
text: Spencer parks, gets out of the car and walks up the garden
text: path to his parents house.
scene_heading: INT. REAL SPENCER INTERVIEW SETUP (CONT’D)
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER

scene_heading: INT. REINHARD FAMILY HOME, KITCHEN - EVENING

dialog: Spaghetti Bolognese - the family members except for Spencer
text: bring food, napkins, water glasses, etc. to the table as a
text: typical weeknight conversation ensues.
dialog: 79
text: Spencer is notably at odds; hair disheveled, the beginnings
text: of a beard, filthy fingers - he looks tired.
speaker_heading: SPENCER’S SISTER
dialog: -It’s ridiculous, there’s no sane reason
dialog: for them to make me do it. There’s no job
dialog: I’m ever gonna have that’s gonna need me
dialog: to know any of that stuff. It’s a huge
dialog: waste of time - plus Mrs Donaldson is a
dialog: bitch.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER'S MOM
dialog: Language.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER'S DAD
dialog: It’s not necessarily about knowing the
dialog: stuff - but if you’re never exposed to it
dialog: how will you know what you are or aren't
dialog: drawn to? Right Spence?
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: What difference does it make? It’s all
dialog: basically pointless anyway.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER'S MOM
dialog: Thank goodness Mr Cheery is joining us
dialog: for dinner tonight.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: It’s true - what difference does it make?
dialog: Seriously. It’s not like Ellen not doing
dialog: chemistry is gonna affect the outcome of
dialog: her life in any way. In fact, what will?
dialog: In ten years she will be married to some
text: douche who probably works in a bank,
text: squeezing out his fat little babies and
dialog: wondering what the point of having an
dialog: education or a brain was anyway.
speaker_heading: SPENCER’S SISTER
dialog: Shut up Spencer. At least I’11 still have
text: half a brain.
text: She mimics him taking drugs and looking fucked.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER'S DAD
dialog: (to Spencer)
dialog: Are you not stimulated by what you’re
dialog: doing then?
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: I'm thinking of maybe doing something
dialog: different.
text: This grabs everyone’s attention.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER'S DAD
dialog: Meaning?
dialog: 80
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: You can’t learn to be an artist by
text: sitting with a bunch of prom queens
dialog: listening to a bunch of failures who
dialog: couldn't make a career out of drawing
dialog: Christmas cards.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER'S DAD
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: So what do you have in mind?
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: I dunno, just something... different.
dialog: Something radically fucking different.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER'S DAD
dialog: Hey! There’s no need for that language!
text: A silence then Spencer’s mum puts her hand on his, diffuses
dialog: the tension.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER'S MOM
dialog: Well you know honey, maybe you should
dialog: take some kind of subsidiary course, like
dialog: a language or something and then you
dialog: could supplement your art in other ways.
dialog: You know Dianne told me she had been
dialog: attending the most wonderful life-drawing
dialog: class at the Fitzroy centre.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER'S DAD
dialog: (taking his wife’s lead)
dialog: Yeah, she’s right. Dianne’s getting
dialog: pretty good actually.
text: Spencer realises he’s on a different wavelength and even if
dialog: he knew what it was he wanted from the conversation, he knows
text: he’s not going to get it. What he sees is the love in his
text: mother’s eyes.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: Yeah, maybe I’11 look into that.
text: He produces an appeasing smile for his mother.
scene_heading: EXT. BUNGALOW - NIGHT
text: We are tracking behind Spencer up to the door of the bungalow
text: - he rings the doorbell for longer than necessary. Eventually
text: Chas comes to the door in a dressing gown. Spencer walks past
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: ACTOR CHAS
dialog: Three guesses. Everything ok?
dialog: 81
text: We follow Spencer as he walks down the steps and into the Den
text: where Eric and Warren are watching Blue Collar in a cloud of
text: pot smoke - the scene with Richard Prior getting harried by
dialog: the IRS inspector “Where the hell my gonna get that kind of
text: dough man?" - bursts of upsync from the movie cut into the
text: following dialogue. Spencer turns on the light.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: Hey. What’s the story dude?
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: I can’t do it. I’m not doing it.
text: Warren pauses the film, walks over to Spencer.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: Nothing happened. I just don’t think this
dialog: is going to end well and I don’t even
dialog: know what it ending well is even gonna
dialog: look like.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Ok, relax, sit down.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: I’m good standing.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: First of all you’ve seen how easy this is
dialog: going to be. This is literally taking
dialog: candy -
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: Don’t say that. I’ve told you to stop
dialog: fucking saying that.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: But it is - and so what’s the worst thing
dialog: that’s gonna happen? No one’s getting
dialog: hurt. No one’s getting caught. I mean
dialog: this is in our hands. How it ends is up
dialog: to us - it’s ours to decide-
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: Has anyone stopped to think about what
dialog: this could mean for our parents, for our
dialog: futures?
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Which future are you worrying about? The
text: one which is indistinguishable from
dialog: everyone else’s out there? Or the one
dialog: which isn’t written yet - where anything
dialog: could happen...
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 82
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Isn’t this is the ultimate creative act -
dialog: we are shaping our existences not having
dialog: them shaped for us. Who’s to say this
dialog: isn’t a work of art?
speaker_heading: ACTOR ERIC
dialog: (to Spencer)
dialog: You know, even if you told me right now
dialog: we were going to get busted for this. I
dialog: would still do it. Scout’s honour. These
dialog: have been some of the best months of my
dialog: whole fucking life.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: You really want to come this far and not
dialog: find out what happens next? I can’t
dialog: promise you everything’s going to be
dialog: fine. It will but I can’t promise you
dialog: that. What I can promise you is that one
dialog: way or another, this will change
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: ACTOR ERIC
dialog: You know I bet one day someone’s gonna
dialog: make a movie about this. And people will
dialog: say, those guys were idiots but at least
dialog: they fucking tried something.
text: Spencer is absorbing this. We track in on his face - closer
text: and closer until he begins to speak the words of REAL SPENCER
text: to camera.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: I'd love to tell you it was about
dialog: friendship - it was, partly. I’d love to
dialog: tell you it was about an act of rebellion
dialog: against a society in which no one
dialog: questions anything and there’s no trace
dialog: of a link between effort and reward - It

scene_heading: INT. CHAS’ BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Chas is tossing and turning - he looks over at his watch on

text: Warren is not in bed - he is sat in an arm chair smoking,

speaker_heading: ACTOR CHAS
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER (V.O.)
dialog: The first thing that happened that
text: morning was Chas gets a call from Eric.
speaker_heading: ACTOR CHAS
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: You're fucking kidding me.
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER (V.O.)
text: Eric tells him that the car he had fixed

speaker_heading: ACTOR CHAS
dialog: What the fuck does unavailable mean?
dialog: No... No fucking way. She’s selling the
dialog: caravan like today or tomorrow I can’t

speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS CARPARK - DAY
text: As per the opening. The boys in their ludicrous disguises
text: exit the van and gather beside it.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: Fuck, we're miles away.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN (TO ERIC)
dialog: You got the thing?
dialog: 94
speaker_heading: ACTOR ERIC
dialog: Yes I’ve got the thing.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Just stick to the plan. Let’s do this.
text: As they turn to go we follow them around the side of the van
text: and track behind them toward the steps of the library.
text: The ticking builds and tension grows - they attempt to walk
text: like old men - Eric has a walking stick. We feel the rush of
text: blood pumping in our ears, heartbeats pounding, noises
text: distorted, everything a little off - a feeling of light-
text: headed dissociation. We track up the steps to the doors of
dialog: the library and through them into:
scene_heading: INT. TRANSY UNIVERSITY LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS
text: We are as one of the group - still one shot - the camera
text: moves around them - we are back where the picture froze pre-
text: TITLE but this time we push on - we spin round to see their
text: POV - a silent room full of students and librarians who soon
text: start to become aware of them. Eric is aware that one of his
text: sideburns is peeling off. Spencer goes to take his place as
text: lookout on a bench near the door where he pretends to read a
text: newspaper. He can see people staring at him curiously - one
text: is the HOT GIRL from his History of Art Class who makes a
text: puzzled narrowing of the eyes. Spencer’s heart skips a beat.
text: Warren heads for the stairs - Eric positions himself at the
text: bottom of the stairs facing the front desk, Chas begins to
text: follow Warren up the stairs some distance behind - they move
text: as old men. Warren nears the top of the stairs - as the
text: special collections section comes into view, through the
text: glass doors he can see BJ but she is not alone - there are
text: three other women sat at a table clearly mid-meeting. Warren
text: freezes. His POV - BJ sees him frozen on the stairs. A weird
text: long beat as they look at one another.

speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: (a loud whisper)
dialog: Abort! Abort!
speaker_heading: ACTOR CHAS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Turn around now - abort.
text: Seeing Warren and Chas hurriedly descend, Eric breaks

speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN (CONT’D)
dialog: There’s like four of them up there - we

speaker_heading: ACTOR CHAS

scene_heading: INT. VAN - DAY
text: Noisy and claustrophobic - The boys are back in the van

speaker_heading: ACTOR CHAS
dialog: What the fuck man. This is bullshit - I
dialog: thought you said you made an appointment.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: I did make an appointment - I don’t

dialog: Miss Gooch, it’s Walter Beckman, I do
dialog: apologize, I was supposed to be with you

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. VAN - DAY
text: From darkness the door slides open revealing Warren standing

speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Tomorrow at llam.
text: In the back of the van we see Spencer’s face - a look of
dialog: dread.
scene_heading: INT. REAL SPENCER INTERVIEW SET UP
scene_heading: REAL SPENCER (IN VISION AND V.O)
dialog: I felt like I had been thrown a lifebuoy
dialog: and now it was deflating around me. We
dialog: had got away with it, I mean we had got

dialog: were planning to go back.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM —- WARREN’S BASEMENT - AFTERNOON
text: Top shot - Warren is lying in the bath shampooing his
text: eyebrows, he sinks under the water to rinse his face, comes
text: up opens his eyes and jumps - Spencer is perched on the end
text: of the tub - agitated. Warren discreetly covers his privates
text: with a flannel.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: I can’t go back in there. I’m pretty sure
dialog: someone saw me and if we’re not using
dialog: disguises or even if we are I can’t be in
dialog: there. Can’t do it, it’s suicide, can’t
dialog: do it.
text: Warren takes a minute to absorb this.
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER (CONT'D)
dialog: Well?
text: Warren looks at him.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Fine.
dialog: 98
text: Spencer nods, sits in silence for a moment then leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. BUNGALOW/LEXINGTON RESIDENTIAL STREETS - DUSK

scene_heading: INT. REAL CHAS INTERVIEW SET UP.
speaker_heading: REAL CHAS

speaker_heading: REAL WARREN
dialog: (beat) ...We had failed to even fail.
dialog: What can be worse than that?
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - TWIGHLIGHT
text: Spencer slows and finally stops running, out of breath he
text: holds his knees. He looks around becoming aware of where he
text: is and then he sees something. His POV - in the halflight on
text: the road stands a blue heron, a bird that we recognize from
text: the Audubon book in the library. The two stare at one another
text: before the bird walks away into the darkness.
scene_heading: INT. WARREN’S DEN - NIGHT
text: The boys are attempting to regroup without Spencer. A

text: of the Heist Wall - walking through the stages of a new plan
text: using Spencer’s scale model. Eric and Warren look
text: uncoonvinced. Suddenly, they hear something and stop.

speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER (V.O.)
dialog: ...And only two people would enter the
dialog: library. Warren, Mr Yellow, volunteered
dialog: to be the one to neutralise the librarian
dialog: - once this was done he would call Mr
dialog: Black to come bag up the loot.
scene_heading: EXT. VAN - DAY
text: The sliding door opens and Warren and Eric climb out - it’s a
text: different set up - Warren has died his hair blond. He wears a
text: suit and looks focussed. Eric is dressed normally - not a
text: word is spoken. They wear backpacks and clutch black hold-
text: alls and walk up the steps of the library. Here we make a
text: radical tonal shift to what has gone before - it’s handheld,
text: ungraded, raw as video, there’s no music and no cuts - it’s
dialog: hard to watch.
scene_heading: INT. TRANSY UNIVERSITY LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS
text: Warren signs in and is told to wait - it seems like a long
dialog: time.
dialog: 100
text: BJ appears and escorts him up the stairs making small talk
dialog: which we can barely hear. She seems more kindly than we
text: remember her. She punches the code and opens the door. It’s
text: slow, awkward, claustrophobic. Warren is sweating, he follows
text: her in, he fumbles in his bag for the tazer, he finds it hard
text: to talk. FREEZE PICTURE.
speaker_heading: REAL WARREN (V.O.)

dialog: Would it be alright if a friend of mine
dialog: joined us? He’s just downstairs and I
dialog: know he'd love to see this.
speaker_heading: BJ
dialog: Yes, that would be alright.

speaker_heading: BACK TO:
speaker_heading: BJ
dialog: You could both be doctors with those

text: As BJ turns from the door which she closes behind Eric,
text: Warren is suddenly upon her now wearing gloves - it’s messy
text: and awful - hard to watch - he puts a hand over her mouth and
text: clumsily attempts to tazer her repeatedly on the shoulder.
text: Her glasses fall to the floor and get trampled. Eric grabs
text: her legs and they lay her down face-down with a nasty bump.
text: Her skirt has risen up in an unseemly way and she makes
text: distressing noises. Warren gags her with duct tape and pulls
text: a balaclava over her head back to front as she pees herself.
text: BJ's beaviour is panic-inducing - is she having a seizure?
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Quit struggling BJ, we're not here to
dialog: hurt you, we're here for the books,
dialog: you're going to be O.K. Zip tie her legs.

dialog: fucked. I couldn’t bring myself to look

speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. TRANSY LIBRARY, SPECIAL COLLECTIONS SECTION - CONTINUOUS
text: Eric struggles to put on his gloves - he ties BJ’s legs, his
text: face devoid of colour. He get’s up - pulls two large
text: bedsheets out of his hold-all and goes over to the books and
text: tries to start packing them inside the sheets. He can barely
dialog: lift the first book.
speaker_heading: ACTOR ERIC
dialog: Shit - this is too heavy you need to
dialog: help.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Just get the small ones first and put
text: them in the backpacks.
text: Warren takes the keys from BJ, gets up and begins to look
text: around frenetically for the smaller books - he finds the
dialog: Origin of Species and an Illustrated Manuscript and places
text: them roughly in the backpack along with a couple of others he
text: pulls from one of the cabinets. Eric is frozen, anxiously
text: watching the door.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN (CONT’D)
dialog: Move!
text: They place one of the Audubons on top of a sheet on the floor
text: and begin to wrap it.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN (CONT’D)
dialog: Get the other one.
speaker_heading: ACTOR ERIC
dialog: What? We won't be able to carry it?
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: We have to - just get the other one!
dialog: Quick!
text: Eric places the other huge Audubon on top of the first and
text: wraps them in the sheet - it looks too heavy to carry.
dialog: 103
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN (CONT’D)
dialog: OK call the elevator. Let’s get out of
dialog: here.
text: Eric repeatedly presses the button to call the staff
text: elevator. He runs over to Warren - they put the backpacks and
text: holdalls on their backs and together lift the books wrapped
text: in sheets - each taking one end. It’s very heavy. The
text: elevator arrives - they struggle in holding the books.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Inside the elevator the buttons are numbered 3, 2, 1, B
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Hit B man, hit B, hurry up!
text: Eric pulls free his left hand, supporting the books on his
text: knee - he reaches out and accidentally hits both buttons B
text: and 1 at the same time - oh shit - the doors close. The
text: elevator begins to descend they watch the lights as 2 goes
text: off and 1 illuminates. They exchange a look. They feel the
text: elevator come to a halt at floor 1.
speaker_heading: ACTOR ERIC
dialog: Oh fuck.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Shit! Shit - press the door-close button.
dialog: Press it!
text: Eric presses the button but the door opens anyway onto the
text: first floor of the library exposing the boys to the entire
text: ground floor. A FEMALE LIBRARIAN about 25 yards away
text: stationed behind the front desk looks in their direction - a
text: frown begins to form on her face and as she begins to turn in
text: their direction the doors close. Eric is frantically pressing
text: the button marked ‘B’. Finally the doors open to the
text: basement. It’s dark and hard to make out.
speaker_heading: ACTOR ERIC
dialog: What the fuck?
text: Warren puts his end of the books down - the boys are wide-
text: eyed and sweating.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Wait here. Keep the door open.
text: Warren rushes out into the dark room.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN (CONT’D)
dialog: Fuck - I can’t see shit!
text: In the darkness we follow him around as he bumps into things
text: and desperately searches for an exit or even a light switch.
text: It’s hard to make out anything. Rising panic - a headless
text: chicken. He returns to the elevator.
dialog: 104
speaker_heading: ACTOR ERIC
dialog: We're stuck in a steel box - we can’t
dialog: stay here, this is bad - this is really

speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: We’re gonna have to make a run for it -
dialog: press 1.
text: They get back in the lift - time seems to slow down -
text: eventually the elevator doors open onto the ground floor -
text: the librarian is nowhere to be seen.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN (CONT’D)
dialog: Quick, quick - let’s go. The fire exit!
text: As they shuffle out of the elevator Eric turns around to face
text: forward so they can run whilst still carrying the books -
text: they head for the fire exit like some crazed four legged
text: animal - they start to make their way down the stairs - a
dialog: handful of students have stood up to see what the cause of
text: the commotion is. They descend the stairs at dangerous speed -
text: suddenly the most ghastly inaudible cry from behind them. The
text: FEMALE LIBRARIAN - large, incensed and apparently fearless is
text: chasing them screaming.
speaker_heading: FEMALE LIBRARIAN
dialog: They're robbing us! They’re robbing us!
text: They drop the antique books which slide out of the bedsheets

text: Chas navigates the horseshoe-shaped driveway in front of the

text: the building. They swerve to narrowly avoid hitting an
text: oncoming car, as they do so Warren comes careering out of
text: nowhere on foot - Chas hits the breaks just as he is about to
text: run him over. Warren bounces off the front of the van and is
text: knocked hard onto his back but gets up quickly and jumps in
text: the passenger door. Inside the van Warren is thrown backwards

speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN

speaker_heading: ACTOR ERIC
dialog: (from the back - eyes still closed)
dialog: It means that we have evolved to a point

speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Exactly, it’s not just pets - it’s us.

speaker_heading: ACTOR CHAS
dialog: No way, this is a whole different ball-

speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Well Spencer’s the only one who knows
dialog: about the books so he has to go and if
dialog: you're not gonna man-up for it Chas then
dialog: I'll fucking do it.
speaker_heading: ACTOR CHAS
dialog: If you go in there Warren you better have
dialog: an answer for everything - I’m not
dialog: kidding. You slip up and we’re all

speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: The only thing is Melanie, that the man

dialog: that we meet with Mr Leckey - is he

speaker_heading: MS HALLORAN

dialog: that they were very strangely dressed,

dialog: I asked them...

scene_heading: INT. CHRISTIES APRAISALS ROOM - DAY
speaker_heading: MS HALLORAN
dialog: ..-what else can you tell me about the
dialog: provenance of the books?
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Well, Mr Beckman inherited the books some
dialog: years ago and now wishes to realise their
dialog: value through a private sale. That’s
dialog: really all the information he gave us.
speaker_heading: MS HALLORAN
dialog: Absolutely beautiful aren’t they...
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: The heron.
speaker_heading: MS HALLORAN
dialog: I'm sorry?
speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: Uh, the heron - a couple of pages in, I
dialog: think she’s beautiful.
text: Melanie eyes him as if he is an endearing weirdo. From
text: Warren, a flicker of irritation.
speaker_heading: MS HALLORAN
dialog: They are absolutely exquisite examples.
dialog: So I will discuss all this with Mr Leckey
dialog: and then we can be in touch regarding the
text: estimate and steps toward a private sale.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN
dialog: Well, you see, we were kind of hoping to
dialog: be able to supply Mr Beckman with an
dialog: estimate today.
speaker_heading: MS HALLORAN
dialog: I’m afraid I can’t give you that without
dialog: Mr Lecke’s sign-off and he may wish to
dialog: view the books personally. Is there a
dialog: number we can reach you on while you’re
dialog: in New York?

speaker_heading: REAL WARREN
dialog: Gun?! There was never a gun. I have no

speaker_heading: REAL ERIC
dialog: All I could think was the gun was going

speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER
dialog: Why did you have a gun with you?

speaker_heading: REAL CHAS
dialog: Honestly, I didn’t even stop to think it
dialog: was illegal in New York - cos in Kentucky
dialog: you can legally carry a gun.
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER
dialog: But why did you own one?
speaker_heading: REAL CHAS

speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER (V.O.)
dialog: No one was going back to get the number -
dialog: that would have aroused even more
dialog: suspicion. We drove through the night in
dialog: silence, not much was said on the way
dialog: home. I guess everyone was just alone
dialog: with their thoughts about the future and
dialog: wondering what we were going do next. The
dialog: plan was to sit on the books until the

dialog: camera:
speaker_heading: REAL ERIC
dialog: Nothing had changed - the only difference
dialog: was it was now somehow even more
dialog: intolerable.
dialog: 118
text: The camera tracks back to ACTOR ERIC who turns around and

text: is on the floor being pummeled - he looks strangely serene.
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER (V.O.)

speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER (V.O.)
dialog: The most fucked up thing was when Eric
dialog: got caught drunk driving...

dialog: The e-mails. We’re fucked. We used the

speaker_heading: ACTOR SPENCER
dialog: Walter Beckman. We used the same e-mail

dialog: number. Chas was right - we’re fucked.
text: We see the truth of this settle upon Warren.
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER (V.O.)

text: back grimly.
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER
dialog: The crazy thing was, I was right about
dialog: the undercover cop - I was just wrong
dialog: about who it was.
text: From the reverse on Spencer we pull focus to an older-looking

scene_heading: EXT. BUNGALOW - DAY
text: Warren is leaving the house - he becomes aware of a gardener

dialog: 122
scene_heading: INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
text: Warren pushes his shopping trolley down an empty aisle of the

scene_heading: INT. SPENCER’S ACURA LEGEND - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
text: Warren begins to run. He turns to throw the ready meal at the

dialog: ...this man is not a model youth. He grew

scene_heading: INT. ERIC’S BEDROOM - NIGHT.
text: Eric is propped up in bed attempting to stay awake but slowly
dialog: dropping off.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN (V.O.)
dialog: .--but somewhere along the line he got
text: warped. Now all he wants is Out, Flee...
scene_heading: INT. REAL ERIC INTERVIEW SETUP
text: Eric looks calmly into the camera saying nothing.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN (V.O.)
dialog: .---and he doesn’t give a good shit for
dialog: St. Louis or his friends or his family or
dialog: anything else...
scene_heading: INT. CHAS’ BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Chas lies asleep with a gun in his hand resting on his chest.
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN (V.O.)
dialog: .--he just wants to find some place where
dialog: he can breathe...
scene_heading: INT. WARREN’S DEN - NIGHT
text: Warren is dropping off - his eyes closing slowly...
speaker_heading: ACTOR WARREN (V.O.)
text: (drowsily) some place where he can
dialog: breathe... Is that good enough for you?”
text: Warren falls asleep and as his arm drops to his side and the
text: book falls to the floor - we JUMP OUT OF OUR SKIN at the
text: sound of an almighty crash as we smash cut to:
dialog: 125
scene_heading: INT. BUNGALOW - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
text: The splintering of wood as the front door bursts open
text: followed by torchlight and shouting raking the interior of
text: the house as the FBI flood through doors and windows.
text: The action slows to slo-mo and slower still - sync-sound
text: drops away as Offenbach’s Barcarolle (or the like) swells and
text: we see the boys awaken rudely to the reality of what’s
text: happening around them. Eric attempts to climb out his window
text: onto the roof where he is met with spotlights and threats to
text: lie down with his hands on his head, Chas reaches for his gun
text: and finds himself at the top of the stairs facing a screaming
text: FBI agent pointing a shotgun at him. Another housemate and
text: his girlfriend awake naked, terrified and bewildered. At
text: Transy campus Spencer's dorm is raided - he sits up in bed
text: with a look of mild relief on his face. Warren awakes in the
text: basement where beams of white torch light pierce the
text: floorboards. He sits up in bed and listens to the mayhem
text: above - then lies back down. We are high and wide pushing in
text: on Warren as he stares calmly up at us until he is finally
text: found - lit up by torchlight and then dragged roughly from
dialog: frame.
speaker_heading: BLACK.
text: We see REAL NEWS ARCHIVE from the arrest.
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER (V.O.)
dialog: What is fear? Fear is an emotion designed
dialog: to protect you from harm. It makes you
dialog: avoid danger, prevents you making a silly
dialog: mistake and getting eaten by a bear or
dialog: some shit.
scene_heading: INT. REAL SPENCER INTERVIEW SET UP
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER
dialog: But like Darwin said - it’s an emotion
dialog: most of us don’t run into a whole lot -
dialog: not real fear anyway. The kind a caveman
dialog: might have had to deal with. So we look
dialog: for new ways to experience something like
dialog: it...
text: As per the opening - we are driving through suburban
text: Lexington everything green, genteel and placid. Old men prune
text: hedges, a kid bounces soundlessly on a trampoline... the same
text: images we saw in the opening montage.
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER (CONT’D)
dialog: ...to feel like we’re really alive.
dialog: 126
scene_heading: INT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - DAY
text: We pull back from the shot we have seen repeatedly as the
text: anonymous hands fill a last remaining white space with a
text: small point of coloured pigment transferred from a piece of
text: coloured magazine page. Slowly we pull back and out to reveal
text: that we are hovering above an artist in prison overalls who
text: is at work on the floor of a prison cell where he has created
text: a huge pointillist image made up hundreds of thousands of
text: dots of colour on dozens of sheets of A4 paper and slowly the
text: image becomes clear to us. It’s a vivid, exceptional and very
dialog: different rendering of John James Audubons Heron - the one
text: Spencer met on the highway. Angle on the artist taking in his
text: work - it’s Actor Spencer, older with a long beard and long
dialog: hair - a long long way from the kid we first met.
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER (V.O.)
dialog: There have been many times when I've
dialog: wondered how it’s possible that we went
dialog: through with it. How all the pieces fell
dialog: into place...
text: Angle Spencer’s POV - the painted face of Warren.
scene_heading: INT. REAL SPENCER INTERVIEW SET UP
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER
dialog: I’ve never said this to Warren but I’m
dialog: not sure whether the memory I have of the
dialog: guy I saw in the park that day...
scene_heading: EXT. BRYANT PARK, NEW YORK - FLASHBACK - DAY
text: The scene from Spencer's POV of the man with the scarf and
text: pony tail - reverse on Spencer - his POV - suddenly it’s the
text: man with the white hair that Warren described - reverse on
text: Spencer again frowning slightly - his POV again and there's
text: no one there just Warren waiting by the hot dog stand.
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER (V.O.)
dialog: ..-is a memory of a guy I saw, or a
dialog: memory of a guy Warren told me I saw. And
dialog: I bet if you ask Eric or Chas they’ve
dialog: probably wondered, as I have, if Warren
dialog: ever really did go to Amsterdam?
scene_heading: EXT. LEXINGTON AIRPORT DEPARTURES - FLASHBACK - DAY
text: We see Warren hugging Spencer goodbye as we did before - he
text: walks off into the airport and the camera cranes up to the
text: upper level - arrivals - where Warren emerges and jumps in a
dialog: taxi.
dialog: 127
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER
dialog: Or if he did go to Amsterdam - did he
dialog: ever meet any art-dealers? Did they even
dialog: exist.
scene_heading: INT. AMSTERDAM CAFE - FLASHBACK - DAY
text: Warren enters the cafe where he met the shady dealers - he
text: looks around but this time they’re not there. He sits down,
text: fires up a joint and orders pancakes.
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER (V.O.)
dialog: For all I know Warren sent those e-mails
dialog: to himself.
scene_heading: INT. REAL ERIC INTERVIEW SETUP
speaker_heading: REAL ERIC
dialog: Yeah, I guess I have at times wondered if
dialog: any of that was true. Ha!(laughs) But I
dialog: know Warren, and he will stick to his
text: story until the day he dies.
scene_heading: INT. REAL WARREN INTERVIEW SET UP
text: We see what seems like b-roll from Warren's interview - as
text: lovable, mischievous and unknowable as ever.
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER (V.O.)
dialog: And you know what? It doesn’t even matter
dialog: anyway if there never was a buyer for the
dialog: books.
scene_heading: INT. REAL SPENCER INTERVIEW SET UP
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER
dialog: I probably would do it again. Not because
dialog: I don’t feel terrible about what we did
dialog: to our parents or that poor lady...
text: WE SEE REAL FOOTAGE AND PHOTOS OF THE BOYS PRE-HEIST,
text: Gradually growing up - good, wholesome kids, preppy and
text: conservative, we see shots of their REAL high school
dialog: graduation.
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER (V.O.)
dialog: .»..or that I don’t wish I hadn’t spent 7
dialog: years of my youth in jail and destroyed
dialog: my future. (beat)
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER (IN VISION)
dialog: I didn’t want that future.
dialog: 128
text: WE SEE REAL PHOTOS OF THEM TAKEN IN PRISON —- SHOCKING AND
scene_heading: UNRECOGNIZABLE - THEY ARE IN RAGS, WITH LONG HAIR AND LONG
scene_heading: BEARDS - SURVIVORS OF A SHIPWRECK.
scene_heading: INT. SPENCER'S PARENTS’ HOME —- INTERVIEW SETUP
dialog: Spencer's
text: real parents are sat together on the sofa - holding
dialog: hands - as per the beginnng.
scene_heading: INT. REAL
scene_heading: INT. REAL
scene_heading: INT. REAL
scene_heading: REAL SPENCER'S DAD
dialog: What we went through I can best describe
dialog: as grief. I don’t think the sentencing
dialog: was fair at all. They were children.
dialog: Girls mature faster. Boys are still
dialog: children at that age. What more proof do
dialog: you need than this?
scene_heading: ERIC INTERVIEW SETUP
speaker_heading: REAL ERIC
dialog: You'll probably consider this bullshit -
dialog: it doesn’t matter to me either way. But
dialog: jail was the best thing that could have
dialog: happened to me - not cos I needed to be
dialog: punished, although I did, but because
dialog: whatever was expected of me on the
dialog: outside, I was free of all of it in
dialog: there. Materialism, vanity, ego, all that
dialog: - there’s no place for it there. I was
dialog: set free. Quite the paradox huh?
scene_heading: SPENCER INTERVIEW SETUP
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER
dialog: Aprendi hablar Espanol... (Spencer
dialog: delivers some of the following speech in
dialog: Spanish) I shared a cell with a black
dialog: guy. I met people I would never have met
dialog: in my life and they taught me more than
dialog: college ever would have. I felt true
dialog: fear. I laughed a lot and I cried a lot.
dialog: I had a seven year sabbatical from the
dialog: world. It was like a second childhood
dialog: almost.
scene_heading: WARREN INTERVIEW SET UP
speaker_heading: REAL WARREN
dialog: We were the one percent. One percent
text: white in a black and Latino jail. One
dialog: percent rich and one percent educated.
dialog: But in there it didn’t count for shit.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 129
speaker_heading: REAL WARREN (CONT'D)
dialog: I feel like it’s not until you lose
dialog: everything that maybe you begin to find
dialog: something. I opened a portal and I walked
dialog: through it.
scene_heading: INT. REAL BETTY JEAN GOOCH INTERVIEW SETUP
speaker_heading: REAL BJ
dialog: You can dress it up however you want. The
dialog: idea that this was about something other
text: than a group of ruthless, reckless,
text: selfish vandals trying to make a fast
dialog: buck is just garbage. These people are
dialog: the lowest of the low - they didn’t even
dialog: steal out of necessity. They’re animals
dialog: and they represent all that is wrong with
dialog: our society.
dialog: Cut to black.
speaker_heading: CAPTION:

dialog: I’m not sure what the future holds.
text: We see present day footage of Real Chas working as a personal
text: trainer in an upmarket health club in Santa Monica...
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER (V.O.)
dialog: But what I do know is that good or bad,
dialog: it’s ours, mine - and no one else's...
text: We see present day footage of Warren - sitting in a lecture
text: theatre - back at University of some sort.
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER (V.O.)
dialog: ...We stole it...
text: We see present day doc footage of Real Spencer at what
text: appears to be an exhibition of his artwork. We see his
dialog: brother, sister and parents - loving and supportive as
text: always. We cut outside to see that the exhibition is taking
text: place in a twee little art gallery in a nice boring part of
dialog: Lexington.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: REAL SPENCER (IN VISION)
dialog: -.-and I can live with that.
