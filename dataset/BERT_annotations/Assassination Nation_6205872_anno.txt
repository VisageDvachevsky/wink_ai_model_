text: WE FOLLOW FOUR KIDS on bikes riding through the suburban
text: streets of Salem. One of the kids holds a roman candle,
text: shooting it off into the sky as he rides.
text: One of the KIDS veers off from the rest, pedaling through the
text: neighborhood, AS THE CAMERA FLOATS UP to a BIRDS EYE VIEW of
text: the SUBURB. Passing a sea of identical looking homes,
text: FAMILIES loading grills and coolers into their cars, GIRLS in
text: BIKINIS, GUYS in TANK TOPS.
text: WE HEAR A VOICE Gwhe we will come to know as EROSTR4TUS)
text: disguised by a VOICE CHANGE APP - it’s disembodied, low, and

dialog: out like a crime scene. I don’t
dialog: care what you say you believe. What

dialog: about actions.
text: The BOY on the bike heads down to the FOOTBALL FIELD, where

dialog: And that is how I will judge you.
text: From above. Without emotion.

speaker_heading: ELEGANT CURSIVE:

speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL TURRELL
dialog: Well, she mentioned something about

speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Define explicit.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL TURRELL
dialog: - she said they were drawings of

dialog: situations.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Then by that definition Botticelli
text: is explicit.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL TURRELL
dialog: Do you have your portfolio with
dialog: you? May I see?
text: She opens_her bag and hands it to him. Turrell starts to flip
text: through. It’s a Series of stylized ink and watercolor

dialog: I just don’t know how it’s
dialog: explicit. Like I don’t know what
dialog: world you guys live in, but it’s
dialog: not explicit.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL TURRELL
dialog: Lily, these are drawings of young
text: women in pornographic poses. It’s
dialog: not just explicit, it’s very
dialog: extreme.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: What is? The drawing? Or the fact
dialog: that there’s 5.8 billion naked
dialog: selfies online? People always sa
dialog: draw from life. well this cf like.

speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL TURRELL
dialog: Well, it’s an aspect of life, sure.

speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I disagree. But you’re a man. I
dialog: don’t expect you to understand.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL TURRELL
dialog: Try me.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: All you're looking at is the
dialog: nudity. But it’s not about that...
dialog: It’s not about sex or porn or even
dialog: being naked. It’s about everything
text: that goes into it. The pressure.
dialog: The endless mindfuck. The ten
dialog: thousand nudes you took before this
text: one. Trying to get it just right.
dialog: Making sure your tits are perfect.
dialog: That_the light hides your left

dialog: THEN... You'll be beautiful.

dialog: ou’re back to square one. Cause
dialog: it’s a rigged game. We just didn’t

speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL TURRELL
dialog: To be honest, Lily... You kind of

dialog: But it’s obvious you’re
dialog: extraordinarily gifted and when you

text: Under the harsh bathroom lights - Marty lays on the floor, in
text: his boxers. Ankles duct- taped: Hands duct-taped. Arms duct-
text: taped to his body. A makeshift straight jacket.
text: Marty is lifted and placed into a bathtub. His face directly
text: under the faucet.
text: THE LEADER, still in his red skeleton ski mask, climbs on top

speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: I’m sorry, I’m just nervous.
speaker_heading: THE LEADER (0.C.)
dialog: It’s okay to be nervous. Even

speaker_heading: MARTY

text: REVERSE: The darkness reveals the street outside at night,
text: and the Lacey house lit up in the distance...
text: And in Em’s window, LILY is laughing.
dialog: And we realize where we are, and who this man is.
text: NICK picks up one of the handguns, points it straight at Lil

speaker_heading: EM
dialog: It’s super fucked up. Google needs
text: like a delete button.
text: Bex is flipping through Lily’s mentions on Twitter.
speaker_heading: BEX
dialog: Chrissy Teigen kind of tweeted her

dialog: said “when a man cheats, why does

dialog: woman? Especially when she’s 18 and

speaker_heading: EM

speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I don’t know, 40,000 or something.
dialog: But straight up, 80% of them are

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: That’d be so dope.
speaker_heading: EM
dialog: But I’m glad this isn’t a movie

text: talking to CAMERA.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: My name is Marty Kolker and I can
dialog: no longer hold back the truth. I am
dialog: not Erostratus, and this wasn’t my
dialog: idea. But after Mayor Bartlett’s
dialog: information was leaked, I started
dialog: to monitor the amount of data being
dialog: uploaded and downloaded from each
dialog: IP in and around Salem. There was
text: one that stood out. Lily Colson’s.
dialog: I then confronted her about it at

dialog: look at her...
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: He’s lying. I swear to god that’s

dialog: behind the hacks, but she also said
dialog: that if I didn’t help her, she’d
dialog: release all of my private
dialog: information as well my father’s.
dialog: (he breaks down crying)
dialog: I’m so sorry. I was so scared. I
dialog: didn’t know what to do and so I
dialog: agreed to help her. I’m so sorry
dialog: for all the pain I’ve caused. I’m
dialog: so sorry. Please forgive me.

text: He looks back towards the doorway and motions to the others
dialog: to wait.
text: As he turns the corner into the living room --
text: The deafening sound of a GUN SHOT, as we see Nance in her

dialog: 99.
text: THE MASKED MAN goes down. Nance walks over to him and tries
text: to peel his fingers off of the gun, as she looks up at the
text: front door, still open.
text: His grip is still tight, and in a moment_of panic, she gets
text: up and goes to shut he’ front door. She locks it, leaving the

text: She returns to his side and peels the gun from his hand.
speaker_heading: NANCE

speaker_heading: EM
text: It’s still ringing, it’s just

speaker_heading: SARAH

dialog: You have one minute to decide.
text: Click - he hangs up. A long beat as pure terror overcomes
dialog: them.
text: Suddenly, from outside, a board covers the window. Then a
text: strange sound: POP. POP. POP-POP. Then another board over
scene_heading: another window. POP. POP. POP-POP.
speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: Get down, get down.

speaker_heading: EM
dialog: What the fuck are they doing?
speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: Em, Sarah. Girls, she has to. We
dialog: don’t have a choice.
text: WE HOLD ON, LILY as she looks at them. It’s an impossible

speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Nance, give me the gun.
text: Em clings to Lily, crying.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You're not going -
speaker_heading: EM
dialog: Mom, she can’t go out there.

speaker_heading: LILY

speaker_heading: NANCE
dialog: No. You just pull the trigger.

speaker_heading: LILY

speaker_heading: EM

speaker_heading: LILY
