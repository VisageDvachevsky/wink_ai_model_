text: the real Craigs brow. His fingers move like lightning. The
text: puppet moves faster and faster. Sweat appears on the puppet's
text: brow. We see that the sweat is being piped from a special
text: device that the real Craig controls. The Craig puppet
text: collapses on the floor of the stage. It puts its hands up to

speaker_heading: CRAIG

speaker_heading: LESTER

dialog: Schwartz.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I'll keep that in mind, sir.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what
dialog: I do is get older, wrinkled like a

dialog: wrinkled prune you see before you.
dialog: Oh, to be a young man again, maybe
dialog: then Floris would care for me.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: The elderly have so much to offer,
dialog: sir. They are our link with history.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: I don't want to be your godamn link,
dialog: damn you. I want to feel Floris'
dialog: naked thighs against my own. I want
dialog: to know passion. I want my body to
dialog: inspire lust in that beautiful,
dialog: complex woman. I want her to shiver
dialog: in a spasm of ecstasy when I
dialog: penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony
dialog: of the flesh, Schwartz.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that

speaker_heading: MAXINE

speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: That's the usual?
speaker_heading: MAXINE
dialog: Dont let the girly shit fool you.

speaker_heading: LOTTE
dialog: Oh, Elijah, you are magnificent!
text: Elijah beams and screams for ecstatic joy. Lotte unlocks
text: the cage, and dials the phone.
speaker_heading: LOTTE
dialog: Maxine! Listen: It hasn't been me
dialog: in John the last three times. Craig's
dialog: had me locked up in the apartment. He
dialog: made me call you at gunpoint. It's
dialog: been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
speaker_heading: MAXINE (O.S.)
dialog: (beat, calmly)
dialog: Really? Well, you know, he's quite
dialog: good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have
dialog: a session with Malkovich I have to
dialog: attend. I'll speak with you soon.
speaker_heading: LOTTE
dialog: But Maxine, I thought it was me you

speaker_heading: MAXINE (O.S.)

speaker_heading: MALKOVICH
dialog: Come on in.
speaker_heading: MAXINE
dialog: I can explain about the portal,
dialog: darling.
speaker_heading: MALKOVICH
dialog: Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I
dialog: just let you up here to tell you
dialog: that, and to tell you that I'm taking
dialog: you and Schwartz to court.
speaker_heading: MAXINE
dialog: Oh shut up.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Craig, darling are you in there?
text: Malkovich tenses up, then shakes his head in an awkward,

dialog: against him will.
speaker_heading: MALKOVICH
dialog: Yes. How did you know it was me?
speaker_heading: MAXINE
dialog: Lotte called me.
speaker_heading: MALKOVICH
dialog: Oh, so the bitch escaped.
speaker_heading: MAXINE
dialog: Apparently you can control this
dialog: Malkovich fellow now.
speaker_heading: MALKOVICH
dialog: I'm getting better all the time.
speaker_heading: MAXINE
dialog: I'll say you are. Let's do it on his

speaker_heading: MALKOVICH
dialog: (as Malkovich)
dialog: No... damn... you...
dialog: (as Craig)
dialog: Oh shut up, you overrated sack of

speaker_heading: LOTTE
dialog: Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr.
dialog: Lester.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must
dialog: inform you that I find that highly
text: arousing.
speaker_heading: LOTTE
dialog: No, you don't understand. I've been
dialog: inside Malkovich when I'm with
dialog: Maxine...
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: (slaps Lotte furiously)
dialog: What?! That is not allowed. My God,
dialog: you are supposed to be one of us.
dialog: You know you must never partake of
dialog: Malkovich by yourself!
speaker_heading: LOTTE
dialog: No, I didn't know that.
speaker_heading: LESTER

speaker_heading: LESTER ON FILM

dialog: As you may already know, today a

text: We see a shot of a newborn.
speaker_heading: LESTER ON FILM (CONT'D)
dialog: His name is John Horatio Hannibal
dialog: Malkovich. And we are the keepers
text: of the door to his soul. One day,
dialog: when his brain is big enough, we
dialog: will all journey into his head and
dialog: live there for all eternity. Following
dialog: the teachings of our leader Karl Marx,
dialog: we will build the ultimate communist
dialog: community, one body and hundreds,
dialog: maybe thousands, of brains inside
dialog: working together to form a super
text: human intellect capable of curing
dialog: disease, stopping all war, and
text: ruling the world with a benevolent
dialog: fist. We will take a wife, a woman
dialog: of uncommon beauty and intellect, who
text: is, as yet, still an infant herself.
text: We see a photo of another infant, this one with a ribbon in
dialog: her hair.
speaker_heading: LESTER ON FILM (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MAXINE
dialog: You still there, sweets?
speaker_heading: MALKOVICH
dialog: Yeah. I've figured out how to hold

text: it's all in the wrists.
speaker_heading: MAXINE
dialog: Wow.
dialog: (little girl pout)
dialog: Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
speaker_heading: MALKOVICH
dialog: You mean with Malkovich?
speaker_heading: MAXINE
dialog: I'd love to see your work.
speaker_heading: MALKOVICH
dialog: (pleased)
dialog: Really? Yeah. Okay.
text: Malkovich leans over and kisses her, then gets up.
speaker_heading: MALKOVICH (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll do something I call "Craig's
text: Dance of Despair and Disillusionment."
text: Malkovich performs the same dance that the Craig pupper
text: did at the beginning of the film. It is exactly the same,
text: complete with impossible somersaults and perspiring brow.
text: He finishes by falling to his knees and weeping.
speaker_heading: MAXINE
dialog: (moved)
dialog: That was incredible. You're brilliant!
speaker_heading: MALKOVICH
dialog: You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing
dialog: with dolls.
speaker_heading: MAXINE
dialog: You're right, my darling, it's
dialog: so much more. It's playing with
dialog: people!
text: Malkovich kisses Maxine. She snuggles close to him.
speaker_heading: MAXINE
dialog: Stay in him forever?
speaker_heading: MALKOVICH
dialog: (as Malkovich, screaming)
dialog: No!
dialog: (as Craig, calmly)
dialog: But how will we make a living,
dialog: my love, if our clientele doesn't
dialog: have access to our product?
speaker_heading: MAXINE
dialog: Well, we'll have all the money in
dialog: Malkovich's bank account, plus he
dialog: still gets acting work occasionally.
speaker_heading: MALKOVICH
dialog: (as Malkovich, breaking through)
dialog: No! Please!
dialog: (as Craig, to Malkovich)
dialog: Shut up, will you? We're trying to
dialog: think here.
dialog: (to Maxine)
dialog: It is sort of like being a puppeteer.
dialog: I like that about it.
speaker_heading: MAXINE
dialog: No one would ever have to know its
dialog: not him.
speaker_heading: MALKOVICH
dialog: (an idea)
dialog: Wait a minute! What if everybody knew?
dialog: What if we presented Malkovich as the
dialog: world's most complicated puppet and
dialog: me as the only puppeteer sophisticated
dialog: enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor

speaker_heading: MALKOVICH
dialog: (Craig to Malkovich)
dialog: Shut up!

dialog: Sorry, dear, I lost control for
dialog: a minute.
speaker_heading: MAXINE

speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Aaaahhhh, the portal!
speaker_heading: LOTTE
dialog: (to Malkovich)

speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: No! Don't harm the vessel!
speaker_heading: LOTTE
dialog: It's Craig in there, I can tell.
speaker_heading: LESTER

speaker_heading: LESTER

speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, let's see what we can do to

speaker_heading: LESTER

dialog: here?
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Surprise.
text: The cultists get tense, start to leave en masse.
speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait! It's not that bad! When we get

dialog: only difference is that we rule in the

speaker_heading: MALKOVICH
dialog: How do we do that?
speaker_heading: MANTINI
dialog: A friendly competition, if you will.
dialog: Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S.
text: Truman puppet appear opposite each
dialog: other in a play. Not some Vegas
text: Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play
dialog: that requires actual acting. The
dialog: audience decides who is more deserving

text: bows out graciously. Goes back to
text: obscurity as a file clerk.
speaker_heading: MALKOVICH
dialog: What's the play?
speaker_heading: MANTINI
dialog: Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
speaker_heading: MALKOVICH
dialog: Never heard of it.
speaker_heading: MANTINI
dialog: Broadway's finest three hours. It's

speaker_heading: MALKOVICH
dialog: Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
speaker_heading: MANTINI
dialog: Nothing but acting to hide behind,

speaker_heading: MALKOVICH
