scene_heading: 1	 GRAINY BLACK AND WHITE - CLOSE-UP - A MAN'S DESPERATE FACE	 1
text: This is Ash, mid twenties, square jaw firmly set and a pair of
text: haunted eyes which dart about quickly in fear. Ash speaks to
dialog: the CAMERA with urgency:
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: Why would you say that I am
dialog: insane? I wouldn't say that I've
dialog: lost my mind simply because I've
dialog: heard the voices and seen the
dialog: godless things moving in the
dialog: woods. If anything, I think more
dialog: clearly now than ever before. I
dialog: know now that there is such a
dialog: thing as a living Evil. A dark
dialog: and shapeless thing that lives
dialog: not in the spaces we know, but
dialog: between them. In the Dark. In the
dialog: night. And it wants the exact same
dialog: thing as you and I: a chance at
dialog: warm life on this Earth. It
dialog: doesn't care that is already had
dialog: that chance ...once. Now listen
dialog: closely because there isn't much
dialog: time. Listen and believe, because
dialog: it's all true.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 2	 EXT. A LOG CABIN - NIGHT								2
text: nestled in a dark forest. Through the window, we see the tiny
text: figure of Ash picking up a book from a desk.
speaker_heading: ASH (V.O.)
dialog: I first saw the damn thing at that
dialog: blasted cabin. The Necronomicon.
dialog: An ancient Sumarrian text, bound
dialog: in human flesh and inked in human
dialog: blood. It contained bizarre burial
dialog: rites, prophesies...and
dialog: instruction for demon
dialog: resurrection. It was never meant
dialog: for the world of the living.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 3	 INT. CABIN - NIGHT									 3
text: Ash flips through the pages from the BOOK OF THE DEAD.
speaker_heading: ASH (V.O.)
dialog: The book awoke something dark in

speaker_heading: SUPERIMPOSE:
scene_heading: 4	 BOOK OF THE DEAD - CAMERA PANNING STRANGE SCRIPT			 4
text: inscribed on the pages. Illustrations of demonic faces with
dialog: white eyes.
scene_heading: 5	 EXT. WOODS - NIGHT									 5
text: We take the point of view of a wind-like demon, swooping low
text: through the woods toward the cabin. CAMERA rips through the
text: cabin door and comes upon a SCREAMING Ash.
speaker_heading: ASH (V.O.)
dialog: It got into my hand and it went
dialog: bad.
scene_heading: 6	 CLOSE ON ASH'S POSSESSED HAND							6
text: twisting into a claw, before the flashing thunder clouds.
speaker_heading: ASH (V.O.)
dialog: So I lopped it off at the wrist.
scene_heading: 7	 INT. CABIN - NIGHT									 7
text: ASH severs his hand from his wrist with the chainsaw.
speaker_heading: 8	 BLOOD RED CLOUDS									 8
dialog: sweep past the moon.
speaker_heading: ASH (V.O.)
dialog: In order to rid myself of the foul
dialog: thing, I read from a passage in
dialog: the book that was supposed to open
text: a hole. A hole in Time that would
dialog: send the Evil back. And it worked.
scene_heading: 9	 A BANDAGED, ONE HANDED ASH							 9
text: recites the incantation from the Necronomicon.
scene_heading: 10	 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT									 10
text: The Time vortex is created. Trees and a 1973 Delta 88
text: Oldsmobile are sucked up into the funnel cloud.
speaker_heading: ASH (V.O.)
dialog: ...I just didn't plan on coming
dialog: along.
scene_heading: 11	 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT									 11
text: Ash, now armed with shotgun and chainsaw, is swallowed by the
dialog: funnel-cloud of the Time vortex.
scene_heading: 12	 INT. TIME VORTEX									 12
text: Ash is rocketing through a funnel of swirling clouds. He is
text: swept away from us, hand over foot, through the dark void of
dialog: Time.
scene_heading: 13	 ANIMATION - A TENDRIL OF SMOKE						 13
text: swirls through blackness as a chorus of women's voices build
text: to eerie crescendo, from a musical note to a SCREAM. The smoke
text: swirls, pulls in upon itself, like a thing alive, and forms the
dialog: words:
speaker_heading: "BRUCE CAMPBELL"
dialog: "Vs"
text: The smoke is wisked away, then reforms as...
dialog: "THE ARMY OF DARKNESS"
text: The title billows past CAMERA REVEALING...
scene_heading: 14	 INT. TIME VORTEX									 14
speaker_heading: A GRANDFATHER CLOCK
text: its hands winding backwards at an insane rate, spins angrily
text: past, revealing other debris that has been swept up into this
text: funnel cloud. Tumbling weightless through this void we find...
speaker_heading: 15	 ASH												 15
text: He SCREAMS but there is no sound. No scream. Only the steady
dialog: BEATING of his heart.
scene_heading: 16	 ANGLE ON ASH FRONT SCREEN PROJECTION					 16
text: He shields his eyes from a sudden bright light. The funnel

speaker_heading: 17	 ASH'S BODY										 17
text: RIPS at the fabric of Time.
scene_heading: 18	 EXT. CLOUDY SKY - DAY								 18
text: All is quiet. Then, an electrical disturbance in the shape of
text: a human body flashes briefly and is gone. A moment latter, Ash
text: appears and tumbles from the sky, falling past CAMERA.
scene_heading: 19	 EXT. BARREN WASTELAND - DAY							 19
text: ASH falls to the dust. His double barrelled shotgun lands
text: beside him. The '73 Oldsmobile comes CRASHING to the ground
dialog: a moment later.
speaker_heading: 20	 ASH												 20
text: looks up from the dust to behold...
scene_heading: 21	 TWENTY-FIVE MOUNTED HORSEMEN							 21
text: in 12th century armor ride up over a hill. They halt before

speaker_heading: WARRIOR #1
dialog: Hail to him who has come from the

dialog: of the Deadites! Hail!
speaker_heading: 23	 ASH												 23

scene_heading: 24	 TWENTY-FIVE WARRIOR									24
text: join in the chant and hail Ash, but suddenly stop as...
speaker_heading: 25	 ARTHUR											 25
text: the muscular commander of the group, gallops his horse into

speaker_heading: WISEMAN JOHN
dialog: My Lord Arthur, I believe he is
dialog: the promised one, written of in
dialog: the Necronomicon.
speaker_heading: 29	 ARTHUR											 29
text: Brings his sword down across Ash's chest. Ash cries out in pain
dialog: as...
speaker_heading: 30	 ASH'S CHEST										 30
text: is cut. A thin red gash.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
text: He bleeds. As a man bleeds. The
dialog: one written of in the Book would
dialog: not bleed.
speaker_heading: 31	 ARTHUR GESTURES									 31
text: and CAMERA PANS to four prisoners bound in iron shackles.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Likely, he is one of Henry's men.

speaker_heading: WARRIOR #2 AND #3
dialog: Aye! The pit's a fair test!
speaker_heading: GOLD TOOTHED WARRIOR
dialog: To the pit with the blackard!
speaker_heading: 32	 GOLD TOOTH										 32

dialog: jaw.
scene_heading: 33	 WIDE SHOT - GOLD TOOTH - STUNTMAN						 33
text: He tumbles from the horse.
speaker_heading: 34	 ASH												 34

speaker_heading: 51	 ASH												 51

speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Eye. And fought valiantly. But
dialog: last night fell in battle to Duke
dialog: Henry's men.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
text: Her face does not immediately register the grief. She attempts

speaker_heading: A FEMALE EVIL DEAD
text: It's rotted corpse rockets up from the water inches from Ash's

speaker_heading: ASH

scene_heading: 288	THE SHATTERED MIRROR PIECES							 288

speaker_heading: 311	ASH												 311

speaker_heading: 312	ASH												 312

speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: Nasty little thing's inside me.
text: He stands indignant but double over in sudden pain.
dialog: Well let's see how you like a
dialog: little hot water!
text: He grabs the hot kettle from the stove and pours the scalding

text: and waits for a moment. A tiny SCREAM emits from Ash's stomach
speaker_heading: ASH
text: emits a bark of LAUGHTER. He clutches as his chest. Then his

speaker_heading: 319	ASH												 319
dialog: watches in horror as...
speaker_heading: 320	THE TINY FIGURE									 320

speaker_heading: 321	THE IRON HAND										 321

speaker_heading: 322	ASH												 322

speaker_heading: 323	THE EVIL IRON HAND									 323

speaker_heading: 325	THE EVIL HAND										 325
text: rummaging through a wooden toolbox. It comes upon a crude wooden

speaker_heading: YANK!
speaker_heading: 329	THE EVIL HAND										 329

speaker_heading: ASH

speaker_heading: SSSSsssssssss!
speaker_heading: 332	ASH												 332

speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: Okay then.
