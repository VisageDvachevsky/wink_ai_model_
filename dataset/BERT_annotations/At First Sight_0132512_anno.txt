scene_heading: AT FIRST SIGHT
scene_heading: EXT. VALLEY - DUSK
text: Gold light dappling across a valley that seems to reach on forever.
text: We ease back, revealing more - taking in the visual feast - finally
text: discovering a seated figure facing out over the valley - a DOG at
text: his feet.
text: VIRGIL ANDERSON, life ahead of him - someone seemingly at ease with
text: himself. As we watch. him a moment - SOUNDS become prominent -
text: whistle of the wind through the grass - a bird's wings as it takes
text: flight - a tree branch creaking under its own weight. And as he sits
text: there, listening, we see the last rays of sunlight slip from the
dialog: day.
text: BLACK - and our TITLES come up.
text: Then out of the darkness come a pair of HEADLIGHTS. - and we're:
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK TURNPIKE - INTO PINECREST - DUSK
text: An old BMW 2002 making its way up the Taconic Parkway.
scene_heading: INT. BMW - DUSK
text: On the radio: Whitney Houston's "I'll Always Love You". AMY TREMONT,
text: 30's, driving, on the phone.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'm lost Betsy, and you know me -
dialog: I don't wear lost well - wait, wait I'm losing you...
dialog: (the cell phone glitches)
dialog: I'm pulling over before you disappear forever.
text: Amy pulls off the side of the road. Wrestles with a map and the
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Sign? I was looking for a sign? There's no...
text: Her attention is caught by something off camera. She stares out into
dialog: the night..
text: HER POV - A small iced over pond - and in the middle - moving about
text: is Virgil, ICE SKATING - hockey stick in hand - moving about the
text: rink with an imaginary puck.
speaker_heading: AMY (O.S.)
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: Yes... I took the first ..... no, no, I'm listening...
text: Virgil winds up and takes a slap at the ice with his stick - throws
text: his hands up in the air like he just scored.
text: Amy smiles, peers off down the road. A sign: BEAR MTN. SPA AND
text: RESORT 1.4 miles.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Wait, I got it - yeah. No don't call me.. right,
dialog: unless you hear from Atlanta. And fax me the
dialog: designs - I want to tinker with them a bit more
dialog: ... I'm going to rest - bye - I'll see you in a week.
text: Beep she hangs up. Looks back out to the pond. It's empty. Shrugs -
text: about to pull out - that love song still blaring.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Oh p-lease, Whitney.
text: CLICK - she shuts off the radio - and pulls back out onto the road.
scene_heading: EXT. BEAR MTN. HEALTH SPA - NIGHT
text: Amy pulling luggage out of her car. She takes a breath - clearly
text: she's exhausted - and starts towards the entrance.
scene_heading: INT. BEAR MTN. HEALTH SPA - RECEPTION DESK - NIGHT
text: Amy at the front desk with the Night Manager CAROLINE, 30'S,
text: annoyingly fit.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: we have a full weight room, lifecycles,
text: stairmasters, a spa, yoga, aerobics, spin classes...
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'm really just looking for a quick fix, here.
dialog: Do you have anything that just involves lying down?
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: A massage.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Great. I'll have one a day. Not too early.
scene_heading: INT. BEAR MTN. - MASSAGE WAITING AREA - NEXT DAY
text: Amy enters, wearing sweats, she checks her watch - looks toward a
text: closed door - about to grab a magazine when she hears from behind
dialog: the door:
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Virgil, Oh God..., right there. Yes.
text: Amy's interest piques - the woman's murmur continuing - deep
dialog: ecstasy.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Yes there - a bit more...
dialog: (a small bell DINGS)
dialog: --wait - wait, you can't stop - one more minute - noo!
speaker_heading: VIRGIL'S VOICE
dialog: Sorry, Susan - time's up.
dialog: I've got someone waiting.
text: And the door opens - and we see a woman, 60's,
text: SUSAN, Bette Midler type, backing out of the room.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Virgil, you have to come live with me.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL'S VOICE
dialog: And what would your husband say?
dialog: Amy, you out there? - c'mon in.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: That's it - I'm getting a divorce.
text: Amy smiles as she passes Susan and enters.
scene_heading: INT. VIRGIL'S MASSAGE ROOM - DAY
text: Virgil has his back to us as he prepares the table. The room is very
dialog: ordered - every vial, bottle, towel has its exact spot.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Hey, Amy, I'm Virgil - why don't you
dialog: get ready - hop up on the table.
text: Amy sees Virgil - his head turned slightly away - she drops her
text: sweats and lies on the table, face down - pulling the sheet to cover
dialog: herself.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Sounds like you're a genius at this.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: That's right.. Mozart, Einstein, Virgil Anderson, massage therapist.
dialog: Now I'm going to start working somewhat deep -
dialog: you let me know if you want anything deeper.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Deeper is good - where I come from,
dialog: all you get is shallow.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I like that - deep it is.
text: CLICK - he hits a button on a CD player and as we hear the soulful
dialog: aria "Mira, 0 Norma" from Bellini's Norma.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: First time in Pinecrest?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Came in late last night..
dialog: missed the town completely.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: If you came in broad daylight,
dialog: you could still miss the town completely.
dialog: Dissolve to:
text: Slow moving cuts of Virgil, working long strokes over Amy's body - -
text: his hands gracefully LENGTHENING and STRETCHING her muscles.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Too much compute? work.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Bad chair - you should think about a change.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: Absolutely.
text: Virgil reaches his hands all the way down her spine and makes a move
text: that causes Amy to release a very deep guttural sound.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Too deep?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No.. ..... just right.
text: Amy is now lost in another world - as Virgil shifts - working gently
text: - not caressing - but molding - like a sculptor.
text: A moment and Amy, surprisingly, begins to cry - softly. Virgil stops
text: - takes a step back.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I - I'm sorry - it was too deep...
text: She cries for another few beats - then takes a breath.
dialog: AMY No - it.. it's not you..
dialog: It's just things have kinda built up,
dialog: I don't know why I'm crying.. look,
dialog: this is embarrassing...
dialog: VIRGIL Don't be embarrassed -
dialog: you obviously needed it.
dialog: We should stop for today.
dialog: AMY Yeah, thanks.
dialog: You always make the girls cry.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Not since grade school.
dialog: I'm going to go now - unless you'd like me to stay.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Could you - just for a minute?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Of course, whatever you need.
text: Virgil sits next to her - then reaches out - takes her hand and
text: starts a slow comforting massage - we see Amy visibly relax.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You ever feel like a Martian's
dialog: invaded your entire body?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Every day.
text: Amy, closes her eyes - smiling slightly in thanks.
scene_heading: INT. VIRGIL'S MASSAGE ROOM - LATER
text: CAMERA pans slowly over to Amy asleep - and on the click of the door
text: - her eyes dreamily open.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Virgil?
scene_heading: INT. BEAR MTN. HEALTH SPA - LATE DAY
text: Hallway outside the massage area. Amy exits the change room, now
text: wearing her sweats - pulling on her sneakers.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL (O.S.)
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Hey Caroline, you look incredible today.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE (O.S.)
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Quite a compliment, Virgil. See ya tomorrow.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL (O.S.)
dialog: See ya.
text: Amy looks down the hall - sees a glimpse of Virgil rounding the
text: corner. She chases after hi~n into the reception area where she sees
text: him exiting the door and moving of f down the driveway.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Virgil - wait...
text: He's gone. Hopping along, tugging on her last sandal - she decides
text: to go after him - fighting her way through a large tour group just
dialog: checking in.
scene_heading: EXT. BEAR MTN. SPA - LATE DAY
text: Virgil in the distance, moving his way towards the main street. Amy
text: exiting the building - trying not to slip on the ice as she, hurries
text: after him - trying to get close enough to call out.
text: Virgil stops at a main roadway as Amy comes up behind him.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Virgil, hey.
text: Virgil turns - sunglasses on - looks directly at Amy.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: It's Amy - Amy Tremont.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Of course - you were sleeping,
dialog: didn't want to wake you.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Yes thanks - you're the skater, right -
dialog: I saw you last night, coming in.
dialog: Pretty mean slapshot.
dialog: You play on some team or something?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Yeah, something. You a hockey fan?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Always liked it - never get around to
dialog: seeing a game. But I loved to skate
dialog: as a kid - unfortunately I have two left feet.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (playing with her)
dialog: They look perfectly OK with me.
text: Amy laughs, starts relaxing - unconsciously starts to flirt. Head
text: cocked, shifts her weight on one foot, moving slightly closer.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I love the view you get here.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Same here - I never get used to it.
text: Just then a YELLOW SCHOOL BUS pulls up in front of him and WHOOSH
text: the doors pop open revealing CARL KIPLING, black, a hundred years
text: old. Virgil turns as a few kids pile off the bus..
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Well, this is my ride.
dialog: Hey Tommy, my man.
text: And with his hand extended a kid high fives it. Amy looks up - a BUS
text: full of young school kids. Seems odd.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Virge.
text: As the kid moves off.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Well, I just wanted to apologize for back there -
dialog: blubbering like that - I was just in a weird place.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: And now...
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Now, I'm fine - so I wanted to
dialog: thank- you. For what you did.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: For making you cry.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No, I made me cry - and you handled
dialog: it great - didn't freak or anything.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Is my mascara smeared or something?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: No. Why?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You're just looking at me funny.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Virgil - lets move it.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: As I said earlier - I just never get used to the view.
text: Virgil starts towards the bus, reaching behind to his pack. Pulls
dialog: something out.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: See you tomorrow.
text: And CLICK, CLICK, CLICK - a WHITE CANE unfolds in his hand. And he
text: taps his way to the bus.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: See you... oh my God.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You're, you're -- I'm so sorry.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (smile)
dialog: Hey, you already apologized once
dialog: - no need to overdo it. Bye now.
text: Amy doesn't know how to respond. And he moves into the front seat of
text: the bus - amongst "Hey Virgil's" from the school kids and Ca-chunk
text: the doors close - the Yellow Bus steaming off - past Amy, as she
text: stares at Virgil in the front seat - about to wave to him - then
text: realizing he wouldn't see.
text: As she turns and watches the bus move off down the street - a hand
text: comes out - Virgil's - and waves good-bye.
scene_heading: EXT. VIRGIL'S HOME.- DUSK
text: The BUS stopping in front of Virgil's home - a side-by-side DUPLEX
text: at the edge of surrounding woods.
text: Virgil steps into the street and with a HONK the bus pulls away. He
text: turns, grazes his hand across a tree out front - and starts towards
dialog: his home.
text: AT THE PORCH - he hesitates at the first door. Finds it with his
text: hand - then raps on it.
text: No answer. He moves over to his own door - and goes inside.
scene_heading: INT. VIRGIL'S HOME - EVENING
text: As he enters, Sophie, an aging LAB, lays on the couch.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Get of f the couch, Sophie.
text: As the dog slides guiltily off the couch.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Some seeing eye dog -
text: more like sleeping eye dog.
text: Virgil bends down as he passes the coffee table to pick up the
text: REMOTE CONTROL placed just so. Click - a Game Show pops on.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Met a girl today - nice voice -
dialog: followed me out of the building.
text: Sophie barks.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: No she wasn't a stalker.
text: CLOSE ON Virgil's hand flipping open a large book marked "TV HOCKEY
text: SCHEDULE" - it's completely WHITE - all in BRAILLE.
speaker_heading: JENNIE (O.S.)
dialog: Sophie's just worried about you -
text: she watches too many horror movies.
text: In the kitchen, JENNIE ANDERSON, older than Virgil, simply dressed,
text: putting a just made dinner carefully onto a plate.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Hey, you're here - so how
dialog: are the kids today?
text: Running his hand down the pure white page - he finds what he wants:
text: BAP - he hits the channel changer and the game comes on.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: The usual - need a lot of attention. So who's the girl?
text: Moving into the kitchen, Virgil puts the remote to the side of the
text: refrigerator where it VELCRO sticks to an exact spot.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
text: From the spa. I made her cry.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: You haven't done that since--
speaker_heading: VIRGIL/JENNIE
dialog: -- grade school.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (smile)
dialog: That's what I told her. Coke?
text: Virgil moves past Jennie as she goes into the living room - hand up,
text: door open and he's got a glass. Back to the fridge, he grabs a coke.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: I'm fine. Your dinner's ready - chicken's
dialog: at 3 o'clock - rice is at...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
text: 6 o'clock, peas at 9 o'clock
dialog: and news at 11.
text: Jennie places Virgil's dinner down in an exact spot on a coffee
text: table (facing away from the TV).
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: One day I'm going to switch them on you.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: And one day I'll play forward
dialog: for the New York Rangers.
text: Four precise steps into the room and Virgil plops down on the sofa -
text: finds his fork. Jennie moves to a counter where a pile of school
dialog: books sit.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: Ha - ha. You need new jokes.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Or a new sister.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: I'd work on the jokes.
text: Picking up the books she moves past Virgil - pecks him on the head
text: and moves to the door.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: You want to watch some hockey?
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: (at the door)
dialog: You want to grade some spelling tests?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'll be next door you need me.
text: She leaves and Virgil pats the couch and Sophie hops up next to him.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: You know this girl - for one moment -
dialog: she actually thought I could
text: (Sophie grumbles as she settles in)
dialog: I'm not kidding.
dialog: (beat) And she had this great voice - relaxing -
text: soft like a breeze through
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Wonder what she thinks about "blind dates."
scene_heading: INT. AMY'S ROOM - EVENING
text: Amy in bed - just out of the shower - the only light in the room
text: comes from the TV. She has the remote, mindlessly switching channels
text: - not staying on one for more than a second or two.
text: Click - an Odd Couple rerun - click - ESPN bowling - click - Three
text: Stooges - Moe poking Curly in the eye - click - click - click.
text: Bored, she stops - notices a small scarf on a chair next to the bed.
text: She picks it up, holds it against her eyes and ties it tight around
text: her head.
text: She stands - hands out in front of her - starts to walk across the
text: room - not so bad - WHAM - right into a side table. Shit that hurts!
text: Grabbing her leg, she hops - hits a lamp.
speaker_heading: AMY
speaker_heading: DAMMIT!
text: Ripping the towel of f her head - hopping around on one foot - she
dialog: hears:
speaker_heading: KNOCK KNOCK
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Coming!
text: Rubbing her leg - she limps/half walks to the door - opens it to:
dialog: Virgil: dark glasses, cane, smile
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Virgil..?
text: She pulls a towel in closer - then realizes it doesn't matter
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: My turn to apologize. I should have told
dialog: you I was blind it wasn't fair.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: That's OK. You want to come in -
dialog: I just got out of the shower - give me
dialog: a minute to get changed?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (as he moves in)
dialog: Sure, I promise I won't look.
text: As Amy starts to get changed in the bathroom.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Anyways, I was in the neighborhood --
dialog: actually the whole town's my neighborhood
dialog: -- and since you've never been to our
dialog: illustrious village, I thought maybe we could
dialog: go into town - see what we see.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: See what we see?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Figure of speech
dialog: .
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You mean right now, tonight?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Great - I'm blind and you're deaf - what a pair.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET - EVENING
text: A few store windows lit up. Some people eating dinner at a
text: streetside cafe. Virgil, holding Amy's arm as they walk down the
dialog: street.
text: WITH AMY AND VIRGIL WALKING:
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
text: ... the Mechanic at the top of the street is Doug - smokes too
text: much - but a good guy. Three steps down is Carlson's hardware
dialog: - he's got a laugh like a donkey - we sometimes listen to games
dialog: together - he's a Devil's fan. And just up ahead should be Grady's
dialog: junk shop - he calls it "antiques"...
text: Smells like junk. I'd hate to see what it looks like
dialog: .
text: A woman bustles past, NANCY BENDER, weighed down with groceries.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (intuitively)
dialog: Hey Nancy.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Hey Virgil - got that book in for you.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Nancy's our librarian, brings in
dialog: any braille book I want.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (to Amy)
dialog: The guy's nuts about the pyramids -
dialog: anything he can get his hands on...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Thank-you Nancy - you should get your
dialog: groceries home - your ice cream's melting.
text: Nancy laughs - as she moves off.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Nice place - you seem to know everyone here.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Moved here when I was eight.
dialog: My family figured it would be a
dialog: good place for me to grow up.
dialog: Tell me what you see.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Well, there's a good structure to the
dialog: town - genuine lines, good use of space.
dialog: To be honest I'd find a better balance
dialog: to a lot of these buildings. But that's me.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: What's you?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: The architect in me - can't leave well
dialog: enough alone. Art school in college -
dialog: I made the arms for the Venus DeMilo.
dialog: (realizing he probably doesn' t understand)
dialog: see, the Venus De Milo has no arms and...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I know the Venus De Milo has no arms, and
text: the Mona Lisa has this captivating smile
text: and David doesn't wear a fig leaf.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: How do you...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I may not have been a lot of places -
dialog: but I read about things, then make an
dialog: image up here -- (points to his head)
dialog: --that works for me.
text: Grazing his hand across a telephone pole - Virgil stops - turns to
dialog: Amy.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
text: This is the end of the street.
dialog: We should turn back.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What about past the end of the street?
dialog: What's out there?
text: He turns around.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No - there's an old run down
text: building off to the side...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
text: Must be the old firehouse.
text: It had a fire so they shut it down. (Amy laughs)
dialog: Honest to God.
dialog: (intrigued)
dialog: What else do you see?
speaker_heading: AMY
text: A wall of shrubs -
text: a field with an interesting configuration of trees.
text: The wind has picked up a bit.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Tell me how you see it.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (enjoying the game)
dialog: OK, sure. Let's see - long and elegant. Like --
text: like a woman dancing with two lovers, trying
dialog: to decide which one she loves.
text: Virgil stops a moment - takes in the image.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: It's just - the image you just
dialog: gave me - "Dancing trees. - I like that.
text: Virgil stops - his head cocks slightly.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: We should go - it's starting to rain.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: There's a bit of a breeze but--
text: KABOOM - thunder - and the rain just drops.
scene_heading: INT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: They run in laughing - Amy closing the door behind them as Virgil
text: moves his way into the center of the room - stands where the
text: moonlight from a high window hits the floor. Water runs down the
text: outside glass, causing the light to ripple across him. The room is
text: empty - almost surreal.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I can't believe how fast it happens...
text: (she sees Virgil - his head cocked towards the ceiling)
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Virgil?
text: Virgil's head turns toward her.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: You like rain - I love the rain.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (moving to him)
dialog: What were you just doing there?
text: Virgil slowly moves his head about, sensing the room.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
text: Listening - the rain - it brings out the
dialog: contours of everything, gives life to
dialog: a room I can't see.
text: WE SEE SLOW MOVING CUTS of the building as Virgil describes what he
dialog: hears.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: You hear it?...on the roof dripping down the
text: walls on every side. On the right, on the
text: drainpipe, it's drumming with a deeper,
text: steadier sound - - like a timpani - echoing
text: across the room - tells me the room is large
dialog: - open. You feel it - in your chest? On the left,
dialog: the rain says... (he listens)
text: ...a fire escape, with it's own rhythm
dialog: - ping - ping. Then listen - there...
dialog: (he points)
dialog: --what's that - over there...?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Looks like it's...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: No, listen for it - not what it
text: looks like - what it becomes.
dialog: Come here.
text: Amy moves closer - Virgil puts his hands out on her shoulders -
text: turns her to the sound.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Now just listen to it - shut out
dialog: everything but that sound -
dialog: do you hear it?
text: Amy strains to listen - closes her eyes - her head instinctively
text: turning - no in unison with Virgil's
speaker_heading: AMY
text: Yes - there - it's soft - like a shimmer
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
text: The wind blowing the rain against a window.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (smile)
dialog: Like a cymbal. It's like our own
dialog: percussive symphony, isn't it?
text: Amy opens her eyes - looks about the room - listening.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: The world is invisible to me - with my touch it comes
text: alive. But only one thing at a time. But when it's raining,
dialog: I feel everything at once. Sometimes, I wish it could
text: rain inside rain all around us.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (musing)
dialog: "Einfuehlung."
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Einfuehlung - it's an architectural term.
dialog: It means to share an empathy.
dialog: Been a long time since I felt that.
text: And as they stand listening to the rain, playing its music - Amy
text: watches him - fascinated by him - then shivers slightly.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: You're cold, we should go.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No, I'm fine, really. It was just something passing
dialog: through me - can't explain it - a good thing.
text: Amy smiles at him - then quietly realizes
text: he can't see it. She moves close, her
text: hand reaching out and taking his.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What you just showed me  how
dialog: I feel - makes me smile.
text: She takes his hand - hesitates - then puts it on the side of her
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I see it now. Thank-you.
text: We hold a beat - enjoying the symphony of rain - then cut to:
scene_heading: EXT. BEAR MTN. LODGE - MORNING
text: The sun warming the cool morning air. The school bus pulling away to
text: reveal Virgil making his way into work.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL (V.O.)
dialog: I thought after yesterday,
dialog: you'd never get up on my table again.
scene_heading: INT. MASSAGE ROOM - NEXT DAY
text: Amy on the table. Virgil squirting oil in his hand - preparing.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You kidding? today, I'm looking
text: for a complete nervous breakdown.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I love a challenge.
text: And as he places his palms carefully on her back - working her back
text: slowly we hear opera play quietly in the background.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: Virgil's hands on the small of her back - something amazingly
text: sensual about how he works her muscles. Amy speaks to him in low
text: tones - in a state of complete relaxation.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Can I ask how long you've been blind?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Of course, most people avoid the subject. You tell them
dialog: you're blind and they act surprised. "You're blind? Reallv?
dialog: I didn't know - you hide it so well." And then they wave their
dialog: hand in front of your face just to make sure. (beat)
dialog: It started when I was a little over a year old.
text: Virgil's hands move down Amy's sides - slow - feeling each contour -
text: the oil making her skin glisten. Amy moves her head slightly with
text: his touch. She lets out a small breath of air.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: You see shadows?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: No. Congenital cataracts. And a case of retinitis
text: pigmentosa thrown in for good measure.
dialog: This area needs to loosen up.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I think you're doing it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: No bright lights, nothing?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I'm blind as a bat. Actually, blinder 'cause they
dialog: emit sonar all the time. I don't have a sixth sense,
dialog: I just don't have the fifth one. I can't hear things in
dialog: Vermont, can't smell if you're mad at me, and, no
dialog: - I don't know Helen Keller, Ray Charles or Stevie Wonder.
text: Amy murmurs in response to Virgil's touch.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: You say something?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No, I just - this feels nice - too nice.
text: Virgil moves his hands down her back - sensually kneading each
text: muscle. It's clear he's enjoying this as much as she is.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You're very good.. at what you do.
text: Another breath exhales from her involuntarily as Virgil hits a
dialog: sensitive spot.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Thank-you.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You enjoy it.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: At times. Some clients make it
dialog: more enjoyable than others.
text: Virgil now works down her thighs - Amy's back arching slightly with
text: the movement - both of them heating to the moment. Both their
text: breaths quickening.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: And this client...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Is very, very...
text: DING - and the spell is broken.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Sorry - it's time. I've got Mr. Ketchum coming in next -
dialog: all two hundred pounds. Sorry - I felt like we
dialog: were just getting started.
text: Amy sits up on the table - the sheet pulling away slightly revealing
text: her. For a moment she watches him - his head turned towards her -
text: but not seeing. Then she slowly pulls the sheet up covering herself.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Thank-you. For last night as
dialog: well - love to do it again.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: How about I cook dinner then, tonight.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'd like that.
scene_heading: INT. BEAR MIN. - NEXT DAY
text: Aerobics step class. Amy working out. In front of her two rather
text: large women in neon stretch workout clothes - Amy tries to avoid the
text: view - a thought - and she shuts her eyes as she continues her
dialog: exercise.
scene_heading: INT. BEAR MTN. - NEXT DAY
text: Amy, towel around her neck - coming in from the workout.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Amy
scene_heading: INT. VIRGIL'S HOME - NIGHT
text: Onions frying. Tilt up to Virgil - cutting the last of it and
text: putting it in the pan - sizzling as it hits. Vegetables and a box of
text: pasta are arranged on the countertop. Sophie watches the
dialog: proceedings.
text: RRRRINNNG - the phone.
text: Virgil stops cutting - his hand easily finds the phone.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH
text: Amy: on the phone in her car on the Taconic Parkway.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Virgil - it's Amy. I - I can't make dinner -
dialog: I'm really sorry - an emergency came up -
dialog: they're dragging me back to New York.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Oh. Yeah. Anything serious?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: The project we were working on was rejected -
dialog: could go down the drain. I'll deal with it quick -
dialog: I'd like to come back.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Yeah. Good. Well. I'll be here.
text: Virgil hangs up the phone - frustrated, he reaches for the frying
text: pan - and promptly burns his hand.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: -DAMN IT!!!
text: Dropping the pan - Sophie goes scurrying, as he kicks at it -
text: sending it across the room. He turns - thrusts his hand under the
text: sink - turning on the cold water.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Shit - that was stupid.
scene_heading: EXT. FLATIRON DISTRICT - LATE DAY
text: Evening rush hour traffic surrounding the Flatiron building.
speaker_heading: VOICE (ON SPEAKERPHONE)
dialog: I'm just saying there seems to be something missing.
scene_heading: INT. ROSWELL-TREMONT DESIGN - DAY
text: A small cardboard model of what looks like a small mini-mall. Amy
text: sits in front of it - drawing on a sketch pad. The office is sparse,
text: functional. A few DRAFTSMEN can be seen in the background through a
text: glass partition.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Absolutely Mr. Falk - something lj missing - we realize that now. We
dialog: just need some time to figure out what.
text: DUNCAN ROSWELL, 30's, leaning a little too ardently into a speaker
text: phone. The voice on the other end is JACK FALK - their would be
text: employer. Their assistant BETSY ERNST, early 20's, sits in the
text: corner, taking notes.
speaker_heading: FALK
dialog: Fine - but you all know what kind of schedule we're on here?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (watching Amy)
dialog: And budget. Yes sir. Don't worry, we won't let you down.
text: She takes a piece of paper, has an idea, starts sketching - Duncan
text: hangs up.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Don't say it, I know. You were never happy with the design.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I wasn't going to say that.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: But you'd have tinkered with it till the job went away. So now we've
dialog: got him hooked, you've got your second chance.
text: And Amy shoves her rough sketch across the table.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Look at these site photos - see those
dialog: trees - we were going to get rid of them
dialog: - let's incorporate them into the design
dialog: use what's natural about the location.
dialog: (Duncan stares at her)
text: And by the way - the 53rd St. lobby - coming
dialog: back from Pinecrest, I came up with a new
dialog: addition - add some life to that place.
text: Duncan stares at the sketch - then looks up at Amy
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: OK -- what's going on here? We sent Hydra
dialog: the three headed monster off a few days ago
dialog: and got back Mary Poppins in return.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What? I can't have a couple of ideas.
dialog: (even Betsy stares at her)
dialog: Fine, you want to know - I met a guy.
text: Betsy stands.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Too modern for me.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Sit down.Betsy. We're all friends here.
dialog: So - spill the beans.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Nothing to spill - he's a good guy -
dialog: smart, funny, blind...
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Whoa, whoa - wait a minute - Blind!?
dialog: Like tap-tap, white cane blind? Come on
dialog: Amy - I mean, I know you like
dialog: challenges, hell you married me - but...
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I knew you'd be understanding.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (standing)
dialog: No, no I am. You're right, this is none
dialog: of my business anymore - but a blind
dialog: guy? If you're lonely - in my. opinion
dialog: -- get a puppy.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Duncan, don't be a jerk.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: You still work here.
text: He's gone.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: He's just jealous.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: So much for the "we're all friends here" idea.
scene_heading: INT. ROSWELL-TREMONT OFFICES - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON - Computer screen. A cursor blinks - then the words
scene_heading: CONGENITAL BLINDNESS - a CLICK and a web page for the AMERICAN
text: BRAILLE INSTITUTE comes up.
text: WIDE - we see Amy hovering over her computer - various sketches of
text: the proposed building next to her - two giant Magnolia trees have
text: been incorporated into the design. As we watch her search on the
text: computer we move over her shoulder to see in the corner of her plans
text: - a sketch of the intertwined "dancing trees" and the Firehouse.
text: Betsy enters carrying her jacket.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Everybody's gone for the day.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Thanks. You go ahead - I'm just finishing
dialog: up something here.
text: She turns to look at Betsy who now peers over her shoulder - sees
text: what she's doing. Amy looks up at her - sees Betsy's look.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What? I just want to know a little more
dialog: about what's wrong with him.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Amy? Friend to friend?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Shoot
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: I hate to admit it but I agree
dialog: with Duncan on this one.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (back to the computer)
dialog: Don't shoot.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: He makes sense sometimes. My father had
dialog: a problem a few years back with severe
dialog: cataracts. Do you have any idea what
dialog: you're getting into?
text: Amy spins in her chair - looks to Betsy.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You ever listened to rain -
dialog: I mean really listened?
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: This like that smell the roses thing?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (turns to her)
dialog: I've spent the last five years of my adult
dialog: life with a man who has the emotional
dialog: content of a soap dish. The only time I
dialog: saw him cry was doing our tax return three
dialog: years ago.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I need more than that, Betsy. For once in a
text: long, long time I feel like I can breathe again.
dialog: Just the way he touches me I know I found
dialog: someone I can connect with.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Ah, here we go.
speaker_heading: AMY
text: No, no. I can tell he's sensing everything about
text: me with a simple touch. He listens to my every
text: word as if it's the only sound on the planet -
text: I feel like even though he can't see me, he knows
dialog: everything about me. He just moves me - does that
dialog: sound crazy.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Does he have a brother?
scene_heading: EXT: PINE CREST MOUNTAINS - LATE DAY
text: The FROZEN POND, nestled against a strand of pine. Virgil skates
text: fast across the ice enjoying the speed - the wind using his hockey
text: stick as a guide - he nears the edge of pond - feels it with the
text: stick and slams to a stop.
text: He shuffles his body around to face in the other direction - then
text: starts skating again - passing AMY standing on the snow covered
dialog: bank.
text: ON AMY - smiling, watching Virgil - enjoying his release of energy.
text: HER POV - VIRGIL - skating well, a look of relaxation we've never
text: seen on his face. He skates in an arc coming back past Amy.
text: Finally she speaks.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Wayne Gretzky, look out.
text: Virgil slams to a halt in surprise - nearly toppling over.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Sorry -- sorry.
dialog: Didn't mean to scare you.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Amy?!
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I said I'd come back.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: How long ... how long have you been...?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Watching you? Just got here -
dialog: couldn't find you at the spa - took
dialog: a chance you'd be here. You're very good.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Skated since I was a kid. My dad taught me
dialog: - wanted me to play pro one day.
dialog: How do you like my pond?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: It's beautiful.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Describe it for me.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: OK. Let's see. Like cool
dialog: blue silk - you know blue?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I think so - keep going.
speaker_heading: AMY
text: Blue silk stretched tight across
text: a bowl - surrounded by white
text: jacketed sentries of trees on
text: the horizon, protecting it from
dialog: the outside world.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Horizon's a tough one.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Never understood horizon - if touch it -
dialog: don't know what it that's OK I liked
text: the rest of picture.
text: (he starts moving towards her)
dialog: You want to skate?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Sorry, I didn't bring my skates.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Don't need them. Come on step hold of my stick.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (smile)
dialog: Hockey stick. Here.
text: He holds the stick out like a cross bar. Amy moves cautiously
text: forward and takes hold of it.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: OK. Now hold on for balance.
dialog: I used to do this with Jennie when we were kids.
text: And Virgil starts skating backwards pulling Amy with him. Amy is
text: apprehensive at first then starts to enjoy the movement - the
text: sensation - both of them laughing out loud.
text: WIDE as we see them move about the rink - Amy sliding and being
text: pulled by Virgil. As he picks up speed we hear Amy scream in
dialog: delight.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Look out - we're running out of ice.
text: Virgil turns expertly, arcing around the edge of the ice but Amy
text: loses her nerve - and balance - and lets go of the stick and goes
text: flying into an embankment. The momentum carries Virgil off down the
text: ice - both of them laughing hysterically.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: You OK?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Fine. Never been dumped so fast in my life.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Me, dump you? No way. Stay where you are
dialog: - I'll come to you - just keep talking.
text: Amy sits up on her elbows in the embankment.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What do I say?
text: Virgil starts gliding across the ice searching for Amy.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
text: (hearing her voice, veering in her direction)
dialog: Anything - how'd you become an architect?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: God - let's see - I was in college -
dialog: art school - a little aimless - and I met
dialog: this guy -. an architect - opened up a new
dialog: world to me. I liked the structure the
dialog: control - finding problems, coming up with
dialog: solutions - when I graduated - we started
dialog: a company together - on impulse got married
dialog: - which was crazy - divorced a year ago -
dialog: but we're still partners.. which must seem
dialog: even crazier.
text: And Virgil's suddenly there - going a little too far - tumbling off
text: the pond and into her.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: You'd think I meant to do that.
dialog: A patented move.
text: They're close - in the snow together - face to face.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (Amy smiles, realizes)
dialog: This is tough.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: AMY
text: I bat my eyelashes, toss my head just
dialog: right, and there's this very sexy thing
text: I do with my eyes - then realize none of
dialog: it matters to you.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: It doesn't matter.
dialog: Tell me what you look like.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I.. .1 don't know I'm...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Wait. Let me.
text: He puts his hand out, over her face -- hesitates, then slowly feels
text: down the contours of her cheek, her eyelids, the shape of her lips -
text: Amy moving with the touch, the sensuality of it - and as he
text: continues - Amy's hand reaches up - touching his face - Virgil
text: smiles.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
text: Eyes, mouth, chin, cheek..
dialog: you are very beautiful.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Thank-you. So are you - more than
dialog: I could describe.
text: Virgil's hands move down her face - closing her eyes - letting her
dialog: just experience his touch - his exploring.
text: And as both their hands continue, enjoying the sensation of
text: discovering each other - Amy leans forward, her eyes still closed,
text: finding his mouth - grazing his lips with her own - softly, gently,
text: then they fold into each other's arms locked into a warm, deep kiss.
scene_heading: INT. VIRGIL'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: It's dark - a pale moonglow highlights the two intertwined naked
text: bodies. A fire burns in the background. In flowing CUTS we see them
dialog: make love:
text: Virgil - his head tilted down - Amy - puts her hand to his chin -
text: lifts his head - then kisses each of his closed eyelids in rhythm
text: with Virgil's movements.
text: Amy - now astride Virgil - she closes her eyes - feels it the way
text: Virgil would - moving faster now - in total rhythm - shuddering in
text: mutual release -- and she collapses on top of him - a deep breath
text: and she rolls over - cuddles into his arm.
text: A long beat - out of breath:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: So -- that's what a blind date is.
text: They breathe - then both start laughing - quietly - then
text: hysterically together as Virgil wraps her up in his arms - holding
text: her tightly.
scene_heading: EXT. PINECREST - DAWN
text: The horizon. The sun cresting it - bringing a new light to the day.
text: INT. VIRGIL'S HOME - EARLY MORNING Sounds of a shower in the
text: background. Amy in Virgil's robe, pulls a juice container out of the
text: fridge - pours herself a glass, putting the juice on the counter as
text: she walks into the living room - taking in the sparseness of his
dialog: surroundings.
text: CLOSE ON - an open Braille Book. The completely white pages with
text: minute bumps. Amy pulls up a chair, sits - and flips through the
text: book, running her hand across the pages - trying to understand his
dialog: world.
text: She then turns to the front cover to see what it is. Playboy.
text: We hear the shower stop as Amy smiles, puts the book down - pushes
text: the chair aside then moves to a series of pictures on the wall:
text: Virgil as a young boy - his sister Jennie a few years older - and
text: his mother and father. Then another picture next to it - Virgil in
text: his skates and Jennie older - no father - Sophie at their feet.
text: And a final picture - Virgil as an adult - he and Jennie on the
text: front porch - his arms wrapped around his sister like he's never
text: going to let go.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Hello?
text: Amy turns to see - Jennie, carrying a bag under her arm.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Hello.
text: Jennie moves towards the kitchen.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: I'm Jennie, Virgil's sister.
dialog: And you are..?
text: Virgil steps out - bathrobe - drying his hair.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Jen, this is Amy Tremont.
text: Jennie now at the kitchen - stares at the juice container - places
text: it back in the fridge - just so.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: I was just at the market Virgil,
dialog: picking up a few things before
dialog: school - and I thought you might like some...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (smells)
text: Apples and bananas.
text: Amy sees the fruit on the counter - impressed.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: He's being a show-off, Amy - I always bring him these.
dialog: (putting them in the fridge)
text: The apples are on the bottom shelf...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
text: At two o'clock. Oranges at 10.
dialog: I know, thanks.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: Amy -- you in town long...
text: And WHAM - Virgil moving into the room, collides right into the
text: chair Amy moved - knocking into a lamp sending it to the ground.
text: Jennie immediately rushes over.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Virgil?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: No you're not - you're bleeding.
dialog: (turning to Amy, sudden)
dialog: First lesson with a blind man,
dialog: Amy - don't change anything -
dialog: it's too dangerous
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (moving to Virgil)
dialog: I'm sorry - I didn't know...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: It was my fault. I'm OK.
text: Jennie still dabbing at his leg.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (embarassed, snaps)
dialog: Goddamit, Jennie - I said I was OK
dialog: - leave me alone!
text: Jennie hesitates, then stands to go - sees the hockey book out of
text: place. A glance to Amy and she picks it up - quietly moves it back
dialog: to it's rightful spot.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: I've got parent meetings tonight -
text: there's dinner in the freezer - left corner.
dialog: (turns to Amy) Nice to have met you, Amy.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Me too - and again - I'm sorry.
text: And she's gone - leaving Amy and Virgil together - a moment of
dialog: awkwardness.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: She seemed ... nice.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: She seemed jealous.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Your leg is still bleeding.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: It'll stop - happens all the time.
dialog: Welcome to my world.
dialog: We hold on Amy - taking this in:
scene_heading: INT. BEAR MTN. - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Japanese lanterns criss-cross across an open area. Guests of the spa
text: mingle about - drinks in hand - some dance on a floor set up over
text: the aerobics area. Music plays in the background.
text: Amy, carrying two trays of food, finds her way to where Virgil sits
text: at a table off to the side - putting his food in front of him.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Let's see if I can get this right.
dialog: Chicken's at three - salad at seven -
dialog: vegetables at ten.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (picking up his fork)
dialog: Very good - thank-you.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: This is nice.
dialog: They do this every weekend?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Every Friday - for the guests leaving. Supposed to make them want to
dialog: come back.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (sits, uneasy)
dialog: Love the music -
dialog: Gershwin - makes you want to...
text: She stops. Virgil, fork poised over his food, senses her
dialog: uncomfortableness.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: You like dancing?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Hmmm? Yeah - don't do it much.
dialog: (changing subject)
dialog: Chicken's good.
text: Amy resumes eating - Virgil's fork spears something on his plate -
text: raising it to his mouth - both we and Amy now see it's a large pat
text: of butter. Too late - it's in his mouth.
text: Amy watches him - the reaction on his face as he tastes it - then
text: surreptitiously swallows it. Then realizes Amy saw him.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Nothing like a good pat of fat.
dialog: What do you say we dance?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No, really, I'm fine...
text: Virgil is up - pulling her hand.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Come on
text: She stands and Virgil puts his hands on the back of her shoulders.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Lead on.
text: And as she ushers him to the floor the music changes - a salsa -
text: lively. Amy stops:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Different piece - maybe we should...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: You kidding - take my hand.
text: And as she does - Virgil starts dancing to the music - feeling the
text: beat - in perfect rhythm but his moves are his own, something we've
text: never seen before - uninhibited, wild - a little funny, but also
text: there's something sensual in his abandonment.
text: All Amy can do is hang on for the ride - enjoying Virgil enjoying
text: himself. People even clear back a little to give him some room -
text: however he moves about the floor easily - somehow sensing where the
dialog: other couples are.
text: It's a whirlwind moment - a moment where the two of them get lost
text: with each other - for a second shutting out the world and it's just
text: them, the music and their movement.
text: Then suddenly the music is over. And they stop - the moment gone.
text: Virgil turns to Amy and she applauds Virgil's wild moves
text: He takes a bow with a flourish. Spins to another angle - another
text: bow. Spins back again - a step back and:
text: CRASSSH - he's into the buffet table - sliding to the ground - food
text: spilling on top of him. Amy, can't help but laugh, rushes to him.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You have to teach me that move.
text: And Amy reaches down to his guacamole covered hand - and pulls him
text: up into an embrace and as they kiss amidst sauce and salad dressing
dialog: - we see:
scene_heading: INT. AMY'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING
text: Amy - on the phone - looking out her window.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Betsy - you were telling me about your father,
dialog: his cataracts - you said he had a problem.
dialog: How is he now?
dialog: (she listens)
dialog: Doctor - Dr. Aaron? - do you have his number?
scene_heading: INT. BEAR MTN. GYM - DAY
text: A handful of people on various pieces of equipment. Virgil, tank
text: top, heavy sweat, on a stationary bicycle - working out. Amy next to
text: him on a treadmill - trying to keep up as Caroline from the front
text: desk comes and hands her something.
text: Amy reads it briefly then hops off the treadmill moving to Virgil.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Virgil, I just got some great news.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (picking up speed again)
dialog: The Atlanta project?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No, no - I was talking to my assistant
dialog: this morning - her father had these
dialog: severe cataracts...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (slowing)
dialog: Oh. Really.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: She put me in touch with a Dr. Richard
dialog: Aaron - the guy's the leading eye surgeon
dialog: on the eastern seaboard - he's been working
dialog: with techniques - I don't know all the jargon
dialog: - but I spoke to him earlier on the phone
dialog: at the Institute...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: You called this guy?
text: Virgil stops riding - starts to get off the bike.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (excited)
dialog: I told him all about you - he just faxed me
dialog: back - he'd love to get a look at your eyes
dialog: - he thinks maybe, mavbe - there might be a
dialog: chance of reversal.
text: Virgil faces Amy, best he can, while he pulls on his sweat jacket.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I don't get it - am I missing the sign
dialog: that says it's help the handicapped week.
text: Virgil starts to move away. Amy stops him.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I thought you'd be excited. What's the problem?
text: Virgil turns on her.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: No problem. That's the whole point
dialog: here Amy - there is no goddamned problem.
text: And Virgil turns and bumps into a stationary bike, he SHOVES it off
text: to the side, and makes his way out of the gym.
scene_heading: INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY
text: Virgil enters, visibly upset - passing a CO-WORKER coming out of the
dialog: shower.
speaker_heading: CO-WORKER
dialog: Hey Virgil.
text: Virgil steams right past him - not answering - hands feeling down
text: the lockers - finding his - he tugs it open - pulls off his shirt
text: and throws it in. He takes a breath, settles himself - then SLAMS

scene_heading: EXT. JENNIE'S SCHOOL
text: PARENTS are picking up their CHILDREN from Jennie's school. As
text: Jennie helps the last of the kids into her mother's car - she looks
text: up to see Amy across the street.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: Amy, right?
text: Amy nods - starts towards her.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'd like to talk to you if
dialog: I could -- about Virgil.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: Something wrong?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Sort of. There's something I don't
dialog: understand. You see I spoke to a doctor
dialog: who's apparently doing breakthrough
dialog: work on cataracts -
dialog: (Jennie turns to Amy)
dialog: - but when I brought it up to Virgil he acted as if...
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: What don't you understand?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: If I was blind almost all my life --
dialog: and there was even a remote possibility
dialog: I could see - I'd jump at it.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: When there's something you've adapted to,
dialog: accepted - you'd just want to change
dialog: it without even thinking about it?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We're very comfortable here, Amy.
dialog: Virgil has everything he needs.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I thought just maybe he'd like to not
dialog: be falling over things for the rest
dialog: of his life. Look, I see...
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: (cuts her off)
dialog: Yes you do and Virgil doesn't. He spent
dialog: the first eight years of his life having
text: his eyes prodded, pierced and poked by
dialog: doctors, faith healers, spiritualists,
dialog: shamans and medicine men. My father had them
text: lined up out the door. It hurt and disappointed
dialog: us all and it almost killed him. He doesn't
dialog: need to go through that again. Now - maybe
dialog: you understand.
text: And she turns on her heel and is gone.
scene_heading: EXT. VIRGIL'S COTTAGE - LATE DAY
text: Amy making her way up to the porch - hearing from inside.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL (V.0.)
dialog: No, no - why - why?!
text: She hurries up the steps, reaching the open door where she sees
text: Virgil, his head in his hands.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL (V.0)
dialog: I can't believe you're doing this to me.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What - Virgil?
text: Virgil turns sharply - Sophie jumps up - starts barking.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Sophie - stop it. Amy? C'mon in - it's just
dialog: the Rangers. I could check better than these
dialog: guys today.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: They lost?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I prefer to think of it as not winning.
dialog: I thought you would have been long gone
dialog: after that outburst from my evil twin
dialog: brother. We've had him committed you
dialog: know. Rikers Island - hard time.
dialog: (standing)
dialog: Can I get you something - - Coke - beer?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No - I - I'm fine. I just wanted apologize
dialog: for stomping around in life like Bigfoot today.
text: Virgil turns towards Amy.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Amy, you see the big tree outside?
dialog: How far is it from my front porch?
speaker_heading: AMY
text: Guessing, about thirty feet.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: To you. But to me, it's fourteen steps exactly.
dialog: Fourteen steps and I arrive right where I want
dialog: to be. But -- if I run or rush, I'll lose count
text: and slam into it.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'm sorry. Told you - can't leave well enough
dialog: alone. I - I guess I should get back, start to pack...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Rushing into trees again?
text: Off Amy's smile we CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. VIRGIL'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: On the Porch - the two of them - sipping glasses of wine - we see
text: their dinner - Hungry Man beef entree - each category of food in
dialog: it's own perfect little compartment.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You know this dinner - this is really quite...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Ordinary?
dialog: (she laughs)
dialog: It's an acquired taste - trust me.
dialog: Jennie thinks it's the only way I'll
dialog: know where my food is. But I have a
dialog: secret weapon.
dialog: (holds up a little bottle)
dialog: Hot sauce! Let's you know you're eating
dialog: something - like some.
text: He starts to sprinkle liberally on Amy's food. Amy, laughing grabs
dialog: the bottle.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: That's OK - I'll do it.
dialog: Don't want to overdo it.
text: She puts the bottle down - looks to Virgil - sips her wine. Time to
dialog: face it.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Virgil - I have to go home tomorrow...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Wait, wait - you smell that?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No - what?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: The winter pines - it's so strong at
dialog: night - drifts on the wind - wait -
dialog: hear the breeze then...
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: There.
text: Amy closes her eyes - takes in the scent - and they both sit there -
text: close - taking in the night air - enjoying the moment.
text: And on Virgil's face we see him lost in thought.
scene_heading: INT. VIRGIL'S HOME - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON VIRGIL - eyes closed - we hear a sound - like night
text: crickets. His eyes slowly open.
text: He rolls over - his arm reaching out for her:
text: But there's no one there. Virgil sits upright.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Amy?
text: Amy is sitting in a chair by the window.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'm here - trouble sleeping.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: C'mere.
text: And she crawls back into bed, Virgil takes hold of her and as she
text: settles into his arm, he strokes her face gently - a blind man's
text: version of watching his lover fall to sleep.
text: BLACK - then we hear voices
scene_heading: INT. VIRGIL'S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: CLOSE ON: Amy's face - the voices awaken her - cutting into her
dialog: dreams.
text: She looks out the doorway - sees Virgil and Jenny arguing on the
text: front porch. She can't hear what they are saying - but it's clear
dialog: there's a problem.
scene_heading: INT. VIRGIL'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING
text: Amy pulling a robe around herself - comes into the room - as Jenny
text: turns on her heel and walks away from Virgil.
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH - MORNING
text: Virgil stands there a moment - taking in what just happened. Amy
text: steps out onto the porch.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Everything alright?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Yeah, yeah. Morning - Look,
dialog: something I want to say...
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: The leaving thing - I know - hate it too.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: The other night - when we were dancing -
dialog: being with you - I felt different -
dialog: special - I don't know - whole.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: That was whole?
text: Virgil puts his hand out - she takes it - he turns to her.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (smile)
text: Just for a second I felt like I could see
dialog: you - all of you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What you said about this Doctor, this eye guy -
dialog: I know how important it is to you...
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (turns to him)
dialog: Are you sure you want to do this?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: We're just going to talk to the guy
dialog: - what could it hurt?
text: Off Amy's smile:
speaker_heading: SMASH TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - MORNING
text: A soaring shot. Amy's car - travelling across the bridge - heading
text: towards Manhattan.
speaker_heading: AMY (V.0.)
dialog: You're going to love the city
dialog: - so many things to see.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - MORNING
text: Virgil in the passenger seat - windows open - taking in all the
text: sounds - new and exciting. Amy watches him as she drives.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Waitwaitwait - he hasn't said he
dialog: can even do anything yet.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I know I just feel good about this.
text: (Amy looks to him - sees him feeling
text: the light against his face)
dialog: Virgil, before you lost all sight,
dialog: do you remember seeing anything at all?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Yeah, I do. I was just a baby when it
dialog: happened - but there is one thing.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Something ... puffy. That's all I
dialog: remember about it. Everyone says it's
dialog: "clouds," but I know I had it in my hands
dialog: - so it couldn't be clouds. This puffy
dialog: thing - that was something special -
dialog: it's stayed with me all these years -
dialog: I don't know why.
scene_heading: INT. NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL - EXAM ROOM - DAY
text: DR. RICHARD AARON, wire rims, short, stylish haircut - is finishing
text: a high-tech examination of Virgil's eyes. Cups attached to wires sit
text: over his eyes. The machine, an ELECTRORETINOGRAM, emits an
text: irritating strange flat line sound. The room is very dimly lit.
text: Aaron adjusts an intensity dial on the machine - a series of
text: flashing lights hit Virgil's eyes. The doctor jots down a reading -
text: then with a flourish, spins the machine away from Virgil's face and
text: pops a button emitting a detailed computer print out.
text: In the corner sits an older gentleman - Dr. Goldman - focused on
text: papers in his hands.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: OK - we're done.
text: Aaron bumps up the lights and wheels his chair back over to Virgil
text: as Amy moves to join them.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Some good news. You have grade 4
text: posterior subscapular cataracts.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: And this is the good news?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Good news in that I should be able to
dialog: remove them with little or no damage
dialog: to your cornea.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: So -- what does that mean -
dialog: they're gone - then what?
speaker_heading: AARON
text: The cataracts are acting like a curtain -
text: covering the window of sight. If the disease
dialog: to the retina is reduced as much as I think
dialog: it is - there's a very good possibility
dialog: we can give you sight.
text: Amy looks to Virgil - apprehensive. Virgil's expressionless - taking
dialog: this all in.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Sounds expensive.
speaker_heading: AARON
text: (looks to Goldman who nods imperceptibly)
dialog: We feel there's an opportunity for us all here -
dialog: I think I can get the institute to pick up the bill.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: So. Say you remove the cataracts -
dialog: do you have any idea what kind of vision I'd have?
text: Aaron looks to Goldman.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: At this time - no. Unfortunately the
dialog: cataracts are not allowing me to see the
text: retinal wall. I can't tell how advanced
text: the retinitas pigmentosa has become.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: So you're suggesting an operation
dialog: that may or may not be successful.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: But there is a chance he
dialog: could regain his sight.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: There have been a few cases of restored
text: vision in adulthood to a patient blind since birth.
dialog: (moves near Virgil)
dialog: The operation is delicate, I'll admit -
dialog: but nothing as invasive as what you went
dialog: through as a child. Of course there is
dialog: always some risks with any operation -
dialog: infection, swelling - long shot stuff.
dialog: I would do both eyes at the same time
dialog: - it's basically out patient surgery.
text: Virgil - an exhale of air. A lot to take in.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: What if it doesn't work? What if I have
dialog: the operation - with all it's risks -
dialog: and you remove the cataract - and it doesn't work.
text: Aaron looks to Amy.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: (somber)
dialog: It would be evident that you will
dialog: never be able to see.
text: Virgil's head shifts slightly. Not what he wanted to hear. Amy
text: reaches out takes his hand.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: That's what I need - to think.
scene_heading: EXT. AMY'S LOFT - SOHO - DAY
text: Virgil and Amy stepping out of a cab. Virgil using his cane - seems
text: blinder than we've seen him before. The city sounds an assault on
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: This is my place - there's a park
text: across the street and...
text: She stops - realizes he wants to walk in silence. They enter her
text: loft building, an old converted industrial space.
scene_heading: INT. LOFT STAIRWELL - DAY
text: There is an odd, loud sound which echoes three times after every
text: bounce. As they come up on the second floor landing, a basketball
text: comes flying down the hall which Amy fumbles with - then catches.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Ethan!
text: From around the corner comes ETHAN COLVIN, eight, oversized Knicks
text: shirt. Amy tosses him his ball.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: Sorry - my mom won't let me go
text: outside till she gets home from work.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Well, if the super catches you playing
dialog: ball in the hall, he'll have a coronary.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Never mind. Ethan,
dialog: this is my friend Virgil.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Hey, Ethan
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: (seeing his cane)
dialog: Are you blind?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: Cool. See ya.
text: And he turns and runs back up the stairs.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (apologetic)
dialog: Virgil...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Hey, the kid thinks I'm cool
dialog: - what's so bad.
scene_heading: INT. AMY'S LOFT - LATE DAY
text: Amy's loft is a wide open space - a KITCHEN facing onto a small
text: living area - a BED in the corner of the room - a WORK SPACE with
text: DRAFTING BOARD and DRAWING RACKS fill one side of the room. By a
text: window stands a plaster SCULPTURE stuck in the corner as if
dialog: forgotten.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: This is where I hang my hat
dialog: - it's a bit of a mess but...
text: Amy stops, realizes he can't see it. Virgil puts his overnight bag
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Now, Blind 101. Help me out with a mental map.
dialog: Walk me down a straight line and show me your
dialog: place, all the obstacles. Remember once you've
dialog: told me, they can't be moved - otherwise...
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Got it - here take my arm.
dialog: (they start about the room)
text: Couch, chair, TV to the left,
text: low table at.. .at 4 o'clock,
dialog: has the phone on it...
text: They come to the Sculpture, Virgil's hand grazes across it.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: AMY
text: Nothing. A sculpture.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: It's yours?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: My art school days - not very good.
text: Virgil continues to feel the sculpture from top to bottom, not
text: stopping during the dialogue.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
text: It's a mother? - holding her child - up in the air
dialog: - like she's proud? It's beautiful.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: It's not done yet -
dialog: one day I'll finish it.
text: Virgil turns - his hand to the wall - feels a window:
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Does this window open?
dialog: I could use some air.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (moving to the windows)
dialog: I think so.
text: As Amy throws open the window, a wind blasts through - catching a
text: stack of plans on her drafting table - blowing them across the
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Damn!
text: Virgil turns, concerned, makes his way to her.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: The wind - knocked over my plans.
text: Amy down on the floor picking them up - Virgil senses her down there
text: - crouches down beside her - tries to help her pick up.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: What is this - these plans?
text: Amy looks at Virgil - - his hand running across one of her plans.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Just my work - - some plans for the Atlanta
dialog: project we're bidding on - drawings of a lobby
dialog: we're finishing up, some other smaller stuff.
dialog: It's -- it's what I do.
text: Amy realizes they mean nothing to him - he hands them back - stands.
text: She watches him - then standing, moves to him.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I've got to get to work. Tonight we'll do something
dialog: - we could listen to music or go out for dinner...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: How about a movie?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: A movie?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Yeah. I haven't been in years.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Alright. A movie. I won't be long.
text: And Amy gives him a quick kiss and dodges for the door - a beat -
text: she forgets her purse - steps back in to see:
text: Virgil standing there quietly - his hand out on her plans again -
text: feeling the paper - searching for the design - wanting to know her -
text: wanting to understand her - finding nothing there.
text: Amy feels uncomfortable - quietly steps out - closes the door.
scene_heading: INT. REVIVAL THEATER - NIGHT
text: WIDE - the theater half full playing Woody Allen's "Annie Hall" the
text: very funny scene where Woody and Diane Keaton wrestle with the
dialog: lobster.
text: We move in slowly and discover Virgil and Amy leaning in close to
text: each other - Amy quietly describing the scene to him.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: There's these big pots and Woody's got
text: a huge lobster in his hand...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Lobster - what's a lobster?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (trying not to use her hands to describe)
dialog: It's a.. .kind of like.. it's got...
text: Then she looks to Virgil - sees he was kidding her.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: That's it - you're on your own.
text: Off Virgil's laugh:
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY LINE - NIGHT
text: BWAM - a subway train explodes past us.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT
text: A collection of typical night riders - everyone keeping to
text: themselves. Two kids sit in the corner - blasting their boom box
text: Virgil stands in the middle of the train - enjoying the vibrations.
text: Amy sits on a seat watching him.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: And they lived happily ever after.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Woody and Diane...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: And the lobster?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Stop with the lobster.
text: A song comes on the radio - Virgil's head turns.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Hey - you here that?
text: All she hears is the clatter of the subway.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What?
text: Virgil turns towards the music - BAPPING his hands rhythmically on
text: the subway car wall.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Hey - can you turn that up?
text: The KID shrugs - CRAKKS it up. It's Gershwin's "Can't take that Away
text: from Me." Virgil turns to Amy - picks up on the song - hands RAPPING
dialog: - he starts singing:
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: "The way you comb your hair,
dialog: The way you sip your tea..."
text: He finds Amy, pulls her up and into an embrace as he saunters them
text: down the aisle.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Virgil?!
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: "Can't take that away from meee" - what?
speaker_heading: AMY
text: People are watching.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Watching? Watching what?
speaker_heading: AMY
text: You. Me. Everyone is staring at us.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Well - it can be embarrassing.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (kidding)
dialog: Oh - I see.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No - you don't.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL Touche.
dialog: "The way you make me see..."
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (turns to him)
dialog: What do you mean?!
text: (Virgil gives her a look -
dialog: I want the operation)
dialog: You mean it. I mean I only want
dialog: you to have the operation...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Amy. I want the chance to see.
dialog: The chance to see Central Park,
dialog: the Brooklyn Bridge, apples, raisins,
text: a buffalo, a carbuerator and the man
dialog: in the moon.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But I would give all that up -
dialog: just to see this face.
text: And Amy folds herself into Virgil - a moment - they hold each other
text: - then - Amy starts to sing along with the song - Virgil joining in
text: - and they dance - together - in love.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT
speaker_heading: AMY/VIRGIL (V.0.)
dialog: "You can't take that away from me."
text: And the car explodes past again - and as the music dies we cut to:
scene_heading: INT. NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL - OPERATING ROOM
text: CLOSE ON: a platter of silver utensils - fine, exacting scalpels. A
text: gloved HAND comes into frame - picks up a clamp - and we follow it
dialog: to:
text: VIRGIL'S EYES - the clamp being used to hold it open. The work we
text: are seeing is grueling - difficult to watch - but at the same time
text: so fascinating it is hard to take our eyes off.
text: Dr. Aaron followed by Dr. Goldman - hands in the air - mask on -
text: leans over Virgil - looks to the ANESTHESIOLOGIST who nods - then to
dialog: no one in particular.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: OK Virgil - let's get to it.
text: And as he is handed a SCALPEL, we watch as it moves down to cut open
text: the white section of the eye - and just as it feels almost
dialog: unbearable to watch- -
scene_heading: INT. NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - DAY
text: We see Amy, coffee cup in hand, grab a second just poured cup out of
text: a vending machine. She makes her way over to reveal Jennie who sits
text: quietly reading a book.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Coffee? It's really bad.
text: Jennie looks up - smiles takes the cup. Amy sits down next to her.
text: They both sip for a moment.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Virgil never mentions his parents
dialog: - do they know?
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: Our mother died when I was 20 - Virgil wasn't
dialog: even a teenager. And our father - he's been
dialog: gone for quite awhile.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'm sorry. I didn't know.
text: Jennie looks into her coffee - takes another sip.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: (smile)
dialog: You're right this is bad.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: It must have been very tough on you
dialog: - taking care of Virgil alone after
dialog: your mother died.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: He's my brother.
dialog: Simple.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You don't like Virgil
dialog: doing this - do you?
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: I don't like Virgil getting hurt.
dialog: Hope is like fire, it can keep you
dialog: warm - - or it can burn you.
scene_heading: INT. NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL - OPERATING ROOM - DAY
text: Dr. Aaron: - focused on his exacting work. His hands move deftly.
text: CLOSE ON: Virgil's eye. Cut open. Aaron's probe working right in the
text: middle of it.
speaker_heading: DR. AARON
dialog: There you are.
text: And Aaron pulls out the cloudy cataract tissue - holding it up for
text: all to see - before he PLOPS it on a tray. Switching instruments -
text: he gingerly picks up a plastic implant - moving back towards the eye
text: - he glances at the nurse assisting him:
speaker_heading: DR. AARON
dialog: You know what they say, Virgil?
text: The eyes are the windows to the soul.
text: Virgil can't move - listens intently as he carefully places the
text: implant into Virgil's eye.
speaker_heading: DR. AARON
dialog: (with a wink)
dialog: That makes us the Windex to the soul.
dialog: (he focuses)
dialog: OK, both eyes done. Let's patch him up.
text: On a large monitor we see an EXTREME CLOSE-UP of Virgil's eye -
dialog: waiting.
scene_heading: INT. NEW YORK HOSPITAL - LATER
text: Virgil being wheeled down a hall - head wrapped in bandages.
scene_heading: INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY
text: As he enters:
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Hello?
text: Jennie's there - takes his hand.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Jennie?
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: How're you feeling?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: OK - a little pain,
text: like a tequila hang over
dialog: - is Amy here?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Right here - Dr. Aaron said you did great
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: So how's my hair - I'd hate the first time
dialog: I see myself to be a bad hair day.
dialog: (Virgil reacts to a sound)
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: There's camera guys here too.
text: WIDE - we now see the room has a small VIDEO CREW in it preparing to
dialog: document the event.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Camera guys?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: (entering)
dialog: For posterity. We're going to make you
dialog: famous. We're also sending this closed
dialog: circuit to one of our conference rooms
dialog: - there's a lot of people interested in
dialog: our results today. So how you feel Virgil?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Good. Great. Fine.
dialog: (a laugh)
dialog: Nervous.
text: Aaron moves about the room closing blinds to let in just a few slats
text: of light.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Nothing to be nervous about.
dialog: Now Jennie and Amy, if you would
dialog: stand off to my right -- I want
text: Virgil to get just a slight bounce
text: of light.
dialog: (returning to Virgil)
dialog: Ready Virgil.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Let's go.
text: Both Amy and Jennie subconsciously adjust their hair as Aaron starts
text: to unravel the bandages.
text: When the bandages are completely off - all that is left are two
text: gauze patches on both eyes.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Okay - last phase -
dialog: we remove these patches and...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
text: (suddenly apprehensive, hand up)
dialog: Okay - wait. So - so - what do I do?
dialog: I mean, what will I see first?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Well - we're all here - Amy,
dialog: your sister. This is new for
dialog: us all. Why don't we find out?
text: Aaron reaches up and plucks the two patches from his eyes - and
text: everyone waits.
text: Virgil slowly opens his eyes - he just seems to be staring blankly,
text: bewildered - not focusing at Aaron who stands before him, still
text: holding the bandages.
text: Amy looks to Jennie - to Aaron - what's happening? Then finally:
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Well?
text: And Virgil reacts - a startling look of recognition mixed with fear
text: crossing his face.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What is it Virgil?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: It's - it's - I don't know.
text: And now for the first time we see Virgil's POV:
text: There is light, movement, color, shadow - but somehow it is foreign
dialog: to us. There is no perception of depth -. no sense of definition of
dialog: shape or shadow - it is as confounding to us as it is to Virgil -
text: like an explosion of Picasso, Dali and Monet on screen.
text: Suddenly in the midst of this chaos of images - there is movement -
text: and a voice emits out of what we now for the first time recognize as
text: a mouth. Dr. Aaron speaks again - leaning in to Virgil, who reacts
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Virgil - what do you see?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Something's wrong.
text: Jennie's reaction comes pouring out of her eyes in tears, first
text: slowly, then a dam break.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Virgil what's wrong?
dialog: What's happening?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Everything's fine -
dialog: it's going to take...
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: It's not fine -
dialog: don't say it's fine.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Tell me what you're seeing Virgil.
text: Virgil suddenly pulling back - his eyes dancing around in his head -
text: trying to take it all in - trying to focus.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (over everyone)
dialog: I don't know - it's all screwed up -
dialog: this can't be seeing - something's wrong
dialog: - too confusing - what the hell's happening??!
text: HIS POV - the camera crew coming toward him for a closer shot - it's
text: like a giant monster violently moving towards us!
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: What is it - Stop!
text: Virgil's hand lashes out towards the camera crew - even though they
text: are 15 feet away.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: What? The camera?
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: (to the crew)
dialog: Stop moving!
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Virgil, it's just the camera.
text: The room has heightened into chaos - Virgil reacting to everything
text: he sees, any quick movement - Amy moves next to him - Aaron trying
text: to remain calm - Jennie assuring Virgil everything's OK.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Alright - alright - they've stopped.
dialog: OK. Let's everybody just calm down
dialog: - we'll take it slowly.
text: Everyone settles - takes a breath.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Virgil. What can we do?
text: They all look to Virgil - breathing heavy - his eyes swinging back
dialog: and forth.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I gotta focus - gotta think -
dialog: gimme a second - OK, OK - get me a
dialog: coke. Somebody?
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: He's thirsty - someone get him a drink!!
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: No - just a can - a bottle --
dialog: put something in my hands!
text: Amy reaches over - grabs an empty coke can.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Here - how's this?
text: Virgil takes it in his hands - closes his eyes - feels it. Then
text: slowly opens his eyes - trying to focus on what is in his hand -
text: Aaron catching on.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Good, Virgil - that's it - use your touch -
dialog: associate - now, tell me - what do you see
dialog: in your hand?
text: Long moment. Virgil holds it up - stares hard.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: A can. Is it a can?
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: What's going on?
text: They all look at Virgil turning the can over and over in his hand -
text: staring intently at it - learning it.
speaker_heading: AARON
text: (beams) He's associating - one sense to the other.
text: His fingers tell his brain - then his brain
text: tells his eyes and he recognizes the image
text: in front of him.
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: He's seeing!
text: Aaron looks to Amy and Jennie - they're still doubtful - he motions
text: to them to meet him outside.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Virgil - let's rest your eyes for today and
dialog: we'll check them again tomorrow. We should
dialog: all be happy - we've got something.
text: Virgil: not happy, just very confused. As Aaron leaves, Jennie takes
text: Virgil's hand while Amy stands there upset - watching him just
text: staring at a Soda Can.
scene_heading: INT. NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL - DAY
text: In the corridor, Dr. Aaron shaking hands with Dr. Goldman - people
text: exiting the near-by conference room all congratulating the two
text: doctors. As Amy exits the room - Aaron moves to her.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What just happened in there?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: You saw it. Success.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Success - wait a minute - then why can't
dialog: he see me, his sister, anything.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: He sees you. He just doesn't
dialog: understand that he sees you.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: But he'll overcome it - I mean -
dialog: this is temporary right?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: There's a very real possibility the
dialog: part of his brain area allocated to
dialog: vision is atrophied - given it's lack
dialog: of use, Virgil has probably used it
dialog: for some other function.
text: Jennie has stepped into the waiting area - has just heard Aaron.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: You didn't think of this?
text: This is as much an accusation of Amy as of Aaron.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: We had no way of knowing what his faculties
dialog: were until we gave him the operation. If you
dialog: remember - we didn't know what to expect
dialog: - though it's clear his retinal disease must
dialog: be in remission.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: So what are we supposed to do now -
dialog: you saw him - it's like he's another
dialog: person in there.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: He won't need to stay here - take him home
dialog: - let him rest. But I will need to see him
dialog: every couple of days for the next month.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Isn't there some kind of therapy
dialog: he should be doing - someone to help him.
text: Aaron stares at her - hadn't thought of this.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: OK, there is a visual therapist - Ray Webster
dialog: - a little unorthodox - that's why he's probably
dialog: your best bet, especially considering the unique
dialog: aspects of Virgil's condition. I'll contact
dialog: him for you - but there's no guarantee he can help.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: (can't believe this)
dialog: No guarantees.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Jennie, I told Amy here when we first talked - this is whole
dialog: new ground - for all of us.
text: And Jennie quietly turns and goes back into Virgil's room. Amy just
text: stares at Dr. Aaron - a little overwhelmed.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CHANGE AREA - DAY
text: Virgil - starting to dress. He stares at his clothes on a hangar -
text: not comprehending what it is. He closes his eyes - his hand going
text: out to feel it - then opening his eyes - he takes the shirt turns -
text: and notices someone watching him.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Hello?
text: HIS POV - it's his own reflection in a mirror next to his clothes.
text: Virgil stares at himself standing stock still - waiting for a
text: response from the person staring at him.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Is there...?
text: Slowly realizing that what he sees is himself. He starts moving
text: towards the mirror fascinated.
text: Virgil's POV - Focusing on the image as it slowly takes shape -
text: becomes clearer to him. His hand going up to his nose - moving it
text: back and forth - laughs at it's absurdity - then is taken with his
text: own smile. He tries a smile - comes off awkward as he starts to
text: stare at his teeth. Touching each part of his face he investigates
text: his chin, ears and finally his hair.
text: Then he stops - and just stares - and stares at a face that is his
text: own - but so incredibly foreign to him. Who is this person?
scene_heading: INT. VIRGIL'S ROOM - DAY
text: Jenny starting to pack up Virgil's things. Suddenly there is a burst
text: of laughter from the other room. She looks up quizzically
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CHECK-OUT - DAY
text: Amy in the check-in area - pacing - on a cellphone.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Duncan - I know the additions to the mall will
dialog: cost more.. look, I can't do this on the phone
dialog: - I'll be in tomorrow.. yes, I remembered they're
dialog: putting the fixtures in the lobby - I'll get
dialog: there as well - I'm just asking for one more day.
scene_heading: INT. WAITING AREA - DAY
text: Jenny - finishing packing up Virgil's things.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL (V.O.)
dialog: Amy?
text: Jenny looks up - Virgil standing in the doorway, dressed.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: No - it's Jennie.
text: She moves toward him - Virgil pulls back - hands out in front of
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: I'm sorry - I'll move slower - I just...
text: And Virgil's hands are on her face - eyes closed - feeling. He opens
text: his eyes - staring blankly - trying to figure this out.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: This is you.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: This is me.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY
text: Angle on Amy moving down the hall - hearing the voices.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: Everything's going to be alright
dialog: - we just need to get you home.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: No, no - I can't go home.
dialog: I need to be here - see the therapist
dialog: - doctor's. I want to be here.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: But I can't stay here - and you can't
dialog: do this alone--who's going to take care.. .?
text: She stops. Realizing.
text: ANGLE On Amy - outside the door - not wanting to go in.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: Amy? She's going to look after you?
dialog: She doesn't know anything about the blind.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I'm not blind anymore - and I'm not
dialog: going to let someone I care about
dialog: walk out of my life again.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: (moves to him)
dialog: It's not your fault he left.
dialog: You can't keep blaming yourself.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm staying here.
text: A pause - and Jennie moves her hand out to him - touches his arm.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
text: Amy feeling uncomfortable - starts to step away.
speaker_heading: JENNIE (O.S.)
dialog: Amy?
text: Amy turns - Jennie in the doorway.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
text: Virgil's finishing getting ready.
dialog: Could you walk me to my car?
text: Amy nods - sees an element of defeat in Jennie's eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL - LATE DAY
text: Jennie and Amy stand on the curb near Jennie's car. A moment of
dialog: uncomfortableness - then:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You alright?
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: I'm scared to death. I've spent my whole life
text: looking for any holes he might fall in.
dialog: I'd run up ahead and cover them. Everywhere
dialog: I look here, I see holes.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Please believe me - I don't want him
dialog: to get hurt anymore than you do.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: Amy - when Virgil was very young, he couldn't
dialog: see those close to him - so he never learned
dialog: to reach out.
dialog: (turns to her) Don't expect him to reach out when he's in pain,
dialog: or confused, or unhappy. If you really care
dialog: about him you have to just be there for him.
text: And before Amy can answer, she gets into her car - starts it up and
text: drives off.
scene_heading: EXT/INT AMY'S.LOFT - DUSK
text: Virgil slowly gets out of the cab, looks up at the buildings -
text: immediately gets dizzy and nearly falls over. Amy lunges to help
text: him. Virgil is laughing in spite of himself.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: This is just great - I don't believe this.
dialog: What's that saying - stop the world I wanna get off.
speaker_heading: ETHAN (O.S.)
dialog: Hey Virgil, it's Ethan.
text: Virgil turns to the familiar voice. Ethan, basketball under his arm,
text: coming out of the building with his Mom, KAREN COLVIN. Virgil scans,
text: tries to focus on them.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: That you Ethan?
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: It's me - and this is my mom.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Virgil - Karen.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Hi, Virgil - heard a lot about you.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: You look funny.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: You should see how I look from this side.
dialog: AMY Let's just get you inside -
dialog: then you can rest.
dialog: We'll see you later Ethan. Karen.
text: And she gives Karen a small glance as she takes Virgil's arm as they
text: start towards the stairs leading into the building - Virgil suddenly
text: slamming to a halt.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Wait, wait, what are we doing
text: - WE'RE WALKING INTO A WALL!!
text: Virgil's POV - the staircase. A flat image - a solid wall with
text: horizontal lines. Ethan, surprised, what's up here?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: It's OK - it's not a wall -
dialog: it's just a staircase. You're
dialog: going to have to trust me on
dialog: these things.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: God, I feel like... like such a child -
dialog: I just thought seeing would be different.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: We'll get a hold of this Ray Webster guy
dialog: - we'll get his help.
text: Virgil steps slowly forward - giant baby steps - each foot reaching
dialog: out to feel the step before making the commitment.
text: HIS POV - the 'wall' of stairs changing perspective with each step.
text: Like an accordion spreading itself out to us. This is all a very bad
dialog: acid trip.
scene_heading: INT. AMY'S APARTMENT - DUSK
text: VIRGIL'S POV - multi-colored balloons, dozens of assorted flowers,
text: bowls of colorful fruit and streamers intertwined across the room. A
dialog: candyland of seeing.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Man. Something exploded
dialog: in your apartment.
text: Amy laughs - pulls him into the room. Virgil trying to take it all
text: in - not understanding anything.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I wanted to do something
dialog: special for you.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: It's making me a little
dialog: bit dizzy - but it is special.
text: Virgil's hands go out - Amy moves to him - he holds her shoulders.
text: He stares at her.
text: As she turns her head slightly, Virgil is able to focus on her - her
text: eyes - her smile.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Okay - so - this is what
dialog: beautiful looks like.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Thank-you. You want to
dialog: see the rest.
text: Focusing on her, Virgil smiles, takes her face in his hands - leans
text: in and kisses her. She pulls back a little.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I can't believe this
dialog: - how nervous I am.
text: She kisses him then takes a step back.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What if you don't like what you see?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Do you want me to turn off the lights?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No - no. This is your first seeing day.
text: (she starts to unbutton her dress)
dialog: I want you to see everything.
text: And she drops the dress from her shoulders - it hits the ground - a
text: beat - and she stands there naked.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: OK?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Yes, very OK.
text: And she takes a step towards him and folds into his arms and as they
text: kiss we slowly fade to black.
scene_heading: INT. AMY'S LOFT - NIGHT
text: The sound of heavy New York rain. Amy awakening, and sees Virgil is
text: gone, his side of the bed empty. She looks across the room - where
text: she sees silhouetted against the moonlit window - - Virgil standing
text: next to Amy's sculpture, his face and body pressed up against the
text: pane of glass.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (wrapping a house coat around her)
dialog: Virgil?
text: Virgil turns around - half faces her - the rain on the windows
text: decorating his face.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I can't sleep - I'm afraid if I close my eyes...
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: It'll be black when you open them again.
text: Virgil nods. A moment and his hand goes out to her sculpture.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: You enjoy sculpting?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: At first. I liked the idea of molding -
dialog: taking the way I saw things up here- -
dialog: (touching her head)
dialog: - and making it take shape with my hands.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: But you never finish them.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Pieces never come out the way I wanted
dialog: - the way I saw them. I end up working
dialog: on them forever - like this one -
dialog: never getting them right.
text: Virgil stares out the window at the rain.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: This is what rain looks like?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
text: It looks lonely. Not what I expected.
dialog: But I like it.
text: Amy smiles - moves into him as he pulls her in close and they look
text: out at the night rain.
scene_heading: INT. ROSWELL-TREMONT - DAY
text: Amy working over a CAD computer with & draftsman.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You've got to alter each of
dialog: the windows by five feet...
speaker_heading: DRAFTSMAN
dialog: These are the specs you gave me.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I know - I'm changing them -
dialog: this is better.
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Betsy!
text: Betsy pokes her head in.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Can you get me some research on
dialog: those Maple trees we're leaving in.
dialog: They're too big - I want to change
dialog: them so they fit in with the design
dialog: better. Get rid of the dead weight.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Don't you have an appointment?
text: Amy looks to her watch. Starts for her jacket and the door.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Yes, yes. Thank-you.
dialog: Evan here will print out the new specs
dialog: - give them to Duncan - tell him I'll
dialog: be back in two hours.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN (O.S.)
dialog: Amy?
text: Duncan steps out of his office. She turns - virtually out the door.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Just give me two hours.
text: And she's gone.
scene_heading: EXT. NYU CAMPUS - NEXT DAY
text: A few KIDS smoking on the steps. Others entering, laden down with
text: books - a small sea parting to allow Amy helping Virgil up the steps
dialog: and inside.
scene_heading: INT. NYU HALLWAY - DAY
text: They make their way down the hall - past a - room where a group of
text: BLIND CHILDREN learn to read Braille. Amy can't help but stare at
text: these young faces struggling to learn. It's a whole different world.
scene_heading: INT. RAY WEBSTER'S OFFICE - DAY
text: A strange space, dark, as all the windows are covered. In a jar on
text: the desk - two pickled eyeballs stare back at Virgil and Amy waiting
text: patiently. There are books everywhere - periodicals stacked and
text: overflowing on shelves. A dead plant in the corner.
text: RAY WEBSTER - 60's, almost completely bald, wearing a worn NYU
text: sweatshirt, sits at the desk in front of them - flipping through a
text: file in front of him.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: Right - OK, Virgil - says here you went
dialog: blind at one - before you developed a
dialog: visual vocabulary.
text: (Webster stands - moves towards a bookshelf)
dialog: You have no sense of depth of field,
dialog: no knowledge of space, shape, size or
dialog: distance. Basically your eyes work but
dialog: your brain hasn't learned to process
dialog: the information.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You are mentallv blind. Neurologists
dialog: call this "visual agnosia".
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I call it pretty screwed up.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: Better term. I'll make a note of that.
text: Webster plops down a large book - flips through some pages, then
dialog: searching his pockets:
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: Dammit
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: Glasses, can never find 'em.
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Mrs. Fenster.
text: Mrs. Fenster pops her head in the door - this must be a ritual they
text: have as she instantly pulls her GLASSES off and hands them to
text: Webster who drops them over his nose. They are clearly woman's
text: glasses - pointed in the ends - little jewels. As Mrs. Fenster
dialog: leaves.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: (referring to the book)
dialog: OK. Alberto Valvo "Sight Restoration after
dialog: Long Term Blindness" - blah-blah-blah. -
dialog: ah here...
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "One must die as a blind person to be born
text: again as a sighted person. However it is
text: the interim, the limbo- -between two worlds,
dialog: one dead/the other powerless to be born -
dialog: that is so terrible."
dialog: (slamming the book shut)
dialog: There. You're in limbo.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What do you mean - there - he's in limbo.
dialog: That's all you have to offer?
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: What? - I'm Anne Bancroft all of a sudden?
dialog: I'm a professor - I teach people, how to
dialog: teach the blind how to become independent.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: There's no book on what you're going through
dialog: - I'd like to help - but like the rest of
dialog: things in life - it's up to you.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Wait a minute - up to me?
dialog: I thought you were going to help me here.
text: Webster rummages in his desk - pulls out a magazine photo - then
text: digging in a brown paper bag - he pulls out an apple.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: You want a lesson? Right - here.
dialog: What's this?
text: He holds out the apple for Virgil - who reluctantly takes it - holds
text: it in his hand, eyes closed, feels it - then opening his eyes he
text: holds it out in front of him, trying to focus on it.
text: HIS POV - as the apple slowly takes on dimension and shape.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: It's an apple.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: Good. Good.
dialog: (holding up the photo)
dialog: OK. What's this now?
text: Virgil stares at the photo. HIS POV - a photo of -- an APPLE. Not
text: that different from the real apple he holds in his hand - he holds
text: the real apple up to compare - using his eyes.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: It's an apple.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: (holding the paper out to Virgil)
dialog: Good. Good. But is it an apple or
dialog: just a picture of an apple?
text: And Virgil feels the paper and suddenly realizes - it's not an apple
text: - just a representation of one. Virgil is visibly disappointed.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: So this is a joke? Is that what you're
dialog: saying - your eyes lie to you? Great
dialog: - looking forward to this.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: Your eyesight can and will play tricks on
dialog: you Virgil. Remember that. No matter what
dialog: I could teach you - no matter what exercises
dialog: I could give you - they'll still play tricks on you.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: That's all it is right now - one big trick.
dialog: Nothing makes any sense. I can't function like this.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: (he moves to his chair)
dialog: Virgil - look - you have to learn to see -
dialog: just like you learned to speak. Only this
dialog: is not like learning a new language -
text: it's like learning language for the first time.
dialog: (he leans forward)
dialog: Perception - sight - life, is about experience
dialog: - about reaching out and exploring the world
dialog: for yourself. It's not enough to just see Virgil --
text: (he points two fingers into his eyes)
dialog: -- we've got to look as well.
text: And Webster turns the fingers from his eyes outward - to the world.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (wound up)
dialog: Well, thank-you Obi Wan Kenobi -
dialog: but that doesn't tell us anything.
dialog: What we need is some assistance here
dialog: - some kind of program - a set of exercises
dialog: - we're kind of adrift and...
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: Amy - last I checked - this isn't a game
dialog: of Parcheesi, it doesn't come with a set of rules.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I can't believe you're just...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Amy. Let's go.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No, wait, Virgil...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Let's go.
dialog: (standing)
dialog: Thank-you Dr. Webster.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: You want me - I'm always here.
text: And Virgil turns and half steps - half shuffles towards the door. We
text: hold on Amy's befuddled face - then:
scene_heading: EXT. NYU - DAY
text: Virgil feels his way down the steps - Amy rushing out after him.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'm going to call Aaron -
dialog: get him to recommend someone else.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: He's right, Amy. I've got to do this
dialog: on my own. No one taught you how to see.
text: Virgil starts walking stiffly towards the street. Amy hurries after
text: him - grabs him just as he was about to step into traffic.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I was a baby then - I had years to learn -
dialog: you don't - you need to...
dialog: (anxious) --we don't even know what to do
dialog: - where to start..
text: Virgil's hand goes out - brushes a mailbox.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: What's this - this thing?
text: Amy looks over.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: What - it's a mailbox.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: What color is it?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Blue.
text: Virgil stares at it - tries to take it in.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Blue. OK, good - that's a mailbox
dialog: - it's blue. There - we've started.
text: She says nothing. Virgil senses her apprehension.
dialog: AMY Let's just get a cab, get you home
dialog: - and tonight we can work on it.
dialog: (hand out)
dialog: Cab!
text: A cab veers across traffic - pulls up to them.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I want to walk. I want to see what's out there.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Fine. Let's walk.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Don't you have a job?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'm going to make time for this. I promise.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Go to work. If I need you -
dialog: I have your number.
text: A beat, she looks to Virgil then climbs into the cab and it pulls
dialog: away.
text: Virgil looks left, right - trying to decide where to start his
text: journey when we see the cab back up in front of him and Amy climbs
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Screw work - let's go try those eyes.
scene_heading: INT. LECTURE RALL - DAY
text: Aaron at a podium. The room filled with colleagues. A NEWSCREW
text: records the lecture from the back of the hall.
speaker_heading: AARON
text: Now just two weeks after surgery--the patient is
text: still having difficulty understanding images,
dialog: shapes, contours -
scene_heading: EXT. NY CITY STREET - NEW DAY
text: Virgil - determined to see - making his way down a street - trying
text: to dodge people coming at him from all angles. Amy walks a short
text: distance behind him - coaxing him along.
text: HIS POV - people seem to explode out of two dimensions into three.
text: This is clearly exhausting.
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT.)
dialog: - and his progress with depth of field has been especially slow...
text: WHAM - Virgil collides with a kid on a skateboard - Amy winces as he
text: quickly regains his balance - shakes it off - starts his journey
dialog: again - determined.
scene_heading: EXT. BROADWAY - STREET VNNDORS - DAY
text: Amy trying to help Virgil take in the confusion of images -
text: explaining to him items hanging about the stalls. It's clear he's a
text: little overwhelmed - when something familiar catches his eye. He
text: moves toward it:
text: HIS POV - focusing - trying to give it shape - it's a YELLOW CAB -
text: just like the one Amy drove off in - again he focuses - reaches out
text: - surprisingly wrapping his hand around the car.
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT.)
text: Virgil is still very reliant on his touch
dialog: to interpret objects in his surroundings -
text: He then realizes it's a porcelain toy from a souvenir shop. Amy
text: watches him examine it like a child as we hear:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT.)
dialog: - and his understanding of three dimensionality
dialog: is extremely limited and confounding to him...
text: Virgil - his hands all over a small long haired TERRIER. He looks to
text: Amy as he stands.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: It's a dog.
text: Amy on her cellphone - trying to get work done - nods - yes that's a
text: dog. Virgil looks back at the pup - which has now turned around
dialog: backwards.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Now what's that?
text: On Amy - disturbed by his slow progress.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN MARKET - ANOTHER DAY
text: Amy and Virgil being led through a series of plants and trees by a
scene_heading: EARTHY SALESWOMAN.
speaker_heading: SALESWOMAN
dialog: I believe we have just the tree you're
dialog: looking for your lobby. Needs very little
dialog: light - slow growing - ah here we are...
text: Amy and Virgil stop at a large Ficus Tree.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Nice. Good. What do you think Virgil?
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT)
dialog: He is also still having great difficulty
text: "scanning", basically putting a whole picture together.
text: Virgil stares at the large tree. Up - down - up - down - up - down -
text: up - down - Amy and the Saleswoman watch him, Amy wants to help but
text: can't comprehend what he's going through.
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT.)
text: If he looks at the top of a tree - then scans
text: to the bottom - he's forgotten the top by the
text: time he reaches the trunk.
scene_heading: INT. AMY'S WORK - DAY
text: ANGLE ON Virgil in Amy's office - staring at a construction sign -
text: FUTURE HOME OF etc... Using his finger to outline the letters of the
text: sign - he tries to read the word FUTURE. He mouths the letters -
text: tries to form the word.
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT)
dialog: This includes the ability to read. In reading a
text: word - he forgets the first letter by the time
text: he gets to the last.
text: Amy working with a draftsman - glances up to see Virgil struggling
dialog: with reading.
scene_heading: INT. NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL - LECTURE ROOM - DAY
text: Bathed in a bank of lights, Aaron at the podium continuing. Virgil
text: quiet - is seated behind him.
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT)
dialog: -- meaning ... he has a total lack of visual
dialog: memory. This is an unexpected physiological
dialog: flaw. We are hopeful Virgil can overcome this.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Thank-you - that's all for today.
scene_heading: INT. NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY
text: Virgil and Amy exit the hall, are immediately surrounded by
text: REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS. There's a sudden FLASH. Virgil reacts,
text: pulling away.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: A camera - it's OK -
dialog: taking your - picture.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: What, by flashing me in the face?
text: FLASH - there's another - Amy tries to block the light.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Please!! - It's not good for him.
text: Suddenly - there's a mike in his face, as CHRISTIE EVANS reporter
text: from Channel 2 news steps forward with CAMERA CREW in tow.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIE EVANS
dialog: Mr. Anderson. Christie Evans Eyewitness news.
dialog: We heard the Doctor speak about your progress
dialog: - and we're wondering what your expectations are.
text: As Virgil stops - stunned by the lights in his face. As he looks to
dialog: Amy we cut to:
scene_heading: INT. HOME - LATE DAY
text: TV MONITOR - Virgil turns to camera - starts talking to the
text: reporter. As we pull back we hear less and less as we reveal a
text: modest living room. A TEENAGER doing homework on a table in the
text: corner and a MAN - early 60's, rugged - sitting on a couch watching
dialog: the news.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Oh my God.
text: He leans forward - his interest piqued and he picks up the phone.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Information. Pinecrest.
dialog: For a Jennie Anderson..
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - LITTTE ITALY - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: A silver fork held up in front of us.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What's this?
text: Virgil and Amy sit on the patio of La Mela. Virgil's hand goes out
text: for the fork. Amy pulls it away.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Uh uh uh. See it first.
dialog: No cheating. Concentrate.
text: Virgil stares hard at it.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (guessing)
dialog: A pen. I don't know - let me touch it.
text: She hands it to him.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
text: A fork.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Right.. Now put it down in
dialog: front of you. How far is it from.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
text: Twenty feet
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You're not looking.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Dammit, Amy, Amy, I spent all day in front
text: of that panel feeling like a guinea pig.
text: Every time I open my eyes I have to look.
dialog: Can we just sit and have dinner for once?
text: Amy just stares. It's clear they're both tired.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'm just trying to help you see.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I know. But that's all it seems we're
dialog: about. How was your day - what goes on
dialog: at work - how about those Rangers -
dialog: did the stock market hold today -
dialog: is there anything else going on in our
dialog: world besides my eyes?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: OK, we've been invited to a party
dialog: - Duncan's birthday.
text: An ITALIAN WAITER appears - putting a large plate of spaghetti in
text: front of Virgil and Amy. Virgil is a little repulsed by what he
dialog: sees.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: What's this - looks like worms.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: It's spaghetti - it's fine.
text: As Virgil tries to maneuver his fork - Amy reaches behind her.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I brought you a present -
dialog: good for hand eye coordination.
text: She hands him a TOYS R US bag. He peers inside.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Great - you go to work building buildings
dialog: - I go home with building blocks.
scene_heading: INT. ROSWELL -TREMONT - LATE DAY
text: Amy - looking a little worn - staring blankly at her computer. A
text: three dimensional rendition of the mall rotates on the screen.
text: Duncan pokes his head in.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: I'm here for you to wish me
dialog: happy birthday. How's it going?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (distracted)
text: OK. He's progressing, slowly
text: - doing the best he can.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: I was actually wondering about the mall
dialog: designs. We're expected in Atlanta tomorrow
dialog: - with these plans.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I can't go to Atlanta tomorrow
dialog: - not with Virgil's problems,..
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Ok, ok
text: (Duncan moves in behind her)
dialog: I'm sorry. Things aren't going so well?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (stares at her work)
text: He seems blinder now than he ever was.
text: Duncan puts his hands on her shoulders - starts to knead them. Amy
text: starts to relax.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Do you ever wonder why
dialog: you do the things you do?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Didn't get what you expected did you?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Sometimes I think he's not going to make it
text: - that he's never going to be able to see.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Amy - listen to me. You liked this guy
dialog: - I saw that. You wanted to help him
dialog: - it didn't work out so hot. You can't
dialog: punish yourself.. Sometimes things just
dialog: don't work out the way we want them to
dialog: - look at us.
text: Amy smiles warmly.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Yeah. Thanks Duncan.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Anytime.
dialog: (beat, a joke)
text: Now back to work.
text: As he starts out of the room, Amy turns stops him.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Hey, Happy Birthday.
scene_heading: INT. AMY'S LOFT - DAY
text: Virgil sits at the kitchen table staring at everyday kitchen
text: utensils - being held by Ethan.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Measuring cup?
text: Ethan shakes his head - no - it's a cheese grater. Virgil stares
text: again. Ethan mimes grating cheese.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
text: Cheese grater.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: Yes - my man.
text: Ethan holds up something new - one of those strange spaghetti
text: strainers. Now they are both staring at something they don't
text: understand. Virgil looks to Ethan.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: Got me.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: You're no help. How am I supposed
dialog: to do my homework if...
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: Homework - dude - I
dialog: ain't doin' homework.
text: Virgil continues to look at the strainer as Ethan gravitates towards
text: his cane folded up on the table.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You're lucky you got a cane.
text: Virgil looks over - sees his fascination.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: You want it. I've been thinking
dialog: about throwing it out.
text: Ethan's up in a flash.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: Man - really - I can have it? Cool.
dialog: (picking it up)
dialog: I could be a Ninja Darth Vader fighter
dialog: with one of these - protect my mom from
dialog: the evil super.
text: Virgil is up - with the spaghetti strainer in his hand.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: But first you'll have to fight
dialog: off the evil --- whatever this is.
text: As they joust about - Virgil enjoying himself - there's a knock at
text: the door.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Could be the super - go for cover.
text: As Ethan ducks behind the couch, Virgil makes his way to the door,
text: fumbling with the handle - he opens it to:
text: JENNIE. Virgil stares at her. We soon realize he has no idea who
dialog: this is.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Yes?
text: Jenny looks at him, her eyes welling.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: Virgil - it's me.
text: And suddenly Ethan is there - cane drawn like a sword.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: En garde.
text: Jennie startled - looks to Ethan then Virgil. What's going on?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Jennie?! Jennie.. God, I'm sorry
dialog: - c'mon in - this is my friend Ethan
dialog: - what are you doing here?
text: Off Jennie's look:
scene_heading: EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY
text: Virgil and Jennie standing across the street from a building being
text: torn down. Hard hatted WORKERS hover about the large trucks at work.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: You want to tell me
dialog: what we're doing here?
text: Jennie points.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: That's him. That's our Father.
text: Virgil looks in the direction she's pointing - tries to focus on a
text: figure moving across the lot. The MAN we saw watching TV.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I can't - I can't see him.
text: Jennie looks to him.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: I thought your eyes were better.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: No. I - I don't want to see him.
dialog: My eyes aren't good enough - not yet
dialog: - he won't understand. It won't be enough.
text: Virgil takes a step back.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: He's our father. He heard about the
dialog: operation and he's asked to see you.
dialog: Look here he comes.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: GODDAMIT Jennie - I don't want to
dialog: see him - I don't even know why you
dialog: brought me here.
text: And Virgil takes another step back then turns and starts of f down
text: the street leaving Jenny alone.
scene_heading: INT. AMY'S BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Amy making her way up the stairs - roll of plans under her arm.
dialog: Opening her door to:
scene_heading: INT. AMY'S LOFT - NIGHT
text: A totally dark room. She drops her things.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Virgil?... Virgil?!
text: She flicks on the light - to reveal Virgil has been sitting in the
text: dark. She looks over - sees the scattered blocks on the floor.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I'm here. I forget about the lights sometimes.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Look - about this party tonight
dialog: - it's no big deal - maybe we should just...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: It's your partner's birthday. We should go
dialog: - besides you wanted me to meet your friends, right?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Yeah. Right.
scene_heading: INT. LOFT - NIGHT
text: Noisy, crowded - PEOPLE mill about carrying drinks - black and
text: silver balloons float about the ceiling. Moving through the crowd -
text: music blasting - Amy introducing people to Virgil over the noise.
text: A WAITER walks up to them holding a tray of wine.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Glass of wine? Red - white?
text: Amy reaches out - takes one.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Which is the red?
text: Amy looks at the waiter - then points to one. Virgil's hand reaches
text: out slowly - hovering - it's clear it's confusing - trying to
text: separate out one glass. The Waiter looks to Amy like "is he OK?"
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Virgil - here let me.
text: Her hand darts in front of his.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (quick)
dialog: No! Sorry - I mean - I'm almost
dialog: there - I think I got it.
text: And she backs off as his hand wraps around a glass - pulling it
text: back. At the last second knocking over two other glasses.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Dammit. Sorry.
text: The Waiter - trying not to spill on himself.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Trust me - you're not the first -
dialog: or probably the last. Let me get a cloth.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Thanks
text: The Waiter smiles - and as he walks off. Virgil nervously takes a
text: large drink of wine.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: I hope you're driving.
text: Suddenly from the front of the room - MARSHALL, the host calls out:
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
text: OK. He's coming up the stairs.
dialog: Everybody get ready - kill the lights.
text: Excitement - a buzz - Virgil looks around then CLICK - all the
text: lights go out. Virgil panics momentarily.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: What - what's happening?
text: Amy moves to him in the near dark room.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: It's for the surprise -
text: they turned off the lights.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Surprise - yeah.
text: And suddenly the lights flood back on, everyone screams: SURPRISE!!
text: Duncan - at the door with Betsy - genuinely surprised - catches his
text: breath - then fakes a quick heart attack and drops to the floor.
text: The room explodes in laughter - Amy included. This action is even
dialog: more confusing to Virgil.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Is he OK?
text: Hearing this - everyone breaks into bigger laughter - Virgil now the
text: focus of attention - good naturedly laughs - Amy smiles,
text: embarrassed. Virgil takes a gulp of his wine, finishing it off.
speaker_heading: LATER:
text: The Music is cranked! Many couples dance. Virgil exits the bathroom
text: - glances back in the mirror again, at his hair - not sure he likes
text: its style. He tries brushing it to the other side - it's OK. How
text: about the other way - not so bad - maybe. It's clear he's a little
text: tipsy as he keeps playing with his hair.
speaker_heading: WAITER (O.S.)
dialog: Here ya go Virgil.
text: Virgil turns - the Waiter stands there holding a glass of wine -
text: placing it carefully into Virgil's hand:
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Cheers, Kevin.
speaker_heading: AMY (0.S.)
dialog: (over the noise)
dialog: Virgil!!
text: Virgil embarrassed, turns - can faintly hear Amy's voice over the
text: music. Searches the room - bopping bodies - balloons being bashed
text: round - lights dim. The number of drinks he's had isn't helping.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Virgil--over here!!
text: Amy, standing with Duncan and Betsy.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
text: Maybe he's blind again.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Don't even think it. C'mon - I want the
dialog: both of you to meet him - he'll never
dialog: find us here.
text: With VIRGIL - smiling as he sees Amy, Duncan and Betsy move towards
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Virgil - I'm sorry - I went to get
dialog: Duncan. Duncan - Virgil. And this is
dialog: Betsy.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Hey Virgil good to meet you.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Heard a lot about you.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Heyyy! Yeah. Good to meet you.
text: Virgil thrusts his hand out - colliding it into Duncan's.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Sorry - things still get a
dialog: little cockeyed sometimes.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (holding up his drink)
dialog: Few more of these and I'll be the same.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Lemme get Kevin - my man -
dialog: he'll top you up. KE-VIN!!!
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Virgil!
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: What?
text: Uncomfortable - everyone stops.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Nothing. It's ok.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Amy, in Atlanta tomorrow...
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Duncan - I told you...
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: I spoke to Falk and he...
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (can't hear)
dialog: What?
text: Duncan pulls Amy in close to talk - shutting Virgil and Betsy out.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Amy said you had great hands.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: She did, did she.
text: Virgil holds them up in front of his face - tries to see them. Then
text: looks past them and watches Amy and Duncan - more importantly looks
text: at Duncan's hair, his clothes. It's clear he's becoming aware of
dialog: appearances. His own especially.
text: As they break their tete a tete.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: You know my father was blind for several
dialog: years, he had cataracts as well.
text: Somehow this comes out patronizing.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Really. I'm surprised I don't
dialog: know him. It's a club you know.
text: Kevin, the African American waiter comes up.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Yes.
text: Virgil throws his arm around Kevin.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Kevin - Duncan here the birthday man
dialog: - could use himself a drink. Kevin here
dialog: tells me he's black - did you know that
dialog: - I mean look at him - look at me -
dialog: isn't that the damnedest thing. He's black.
text: Amy is mortified, Kevin laughs.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: I'll get you a drink.
text: Virgil looks to Amy.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: What's that look?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What look?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I've never seen your face that way
dialog: before. It's.. .weird. What does it mean?
text: Before she can answer - a dance song breaks out - Betsy wraps her
text: arm around Duncan's.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Come on Duncan - let's dance -
dialog: move those old bones.
text: Duncan only acknowledges Betsy's contact with a raised eyebrow to
dialog: Amy.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: What the hell it's my birthday -- nice to
dialog: meet you Virgil - see you at the opening.
text: And they're gone onto the floor. Virgil watches him - sees the ease
text: with which Duncan moves, handles things.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Opening?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: The lobby we designed. Virgil - you can't...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Let's dance.
text: Virgil takes her arm and pulls her out on the floor. Amy - ready for
text: one of Virgil's wild dances takes hold of his hand. The music
text: blaring, Virgil starts to get into it - Amy starting to relax - then
text: Virgil slowly notices how everyone else is dancing - more
dialog: conservative.
text: He's even getting some looks from people. Slowly he winds down -
text: tries to mimic what everyone else is doing - ends up in just a slow
text: shuffle.
text: Amy watches him - sees he's uncomfortable - moves to him - but
text: Virgil turns on his heel and strides away. Amy follows after him.
scene_heading: INT. LOFT - CORNER - NIGHT
text: Virgil stands near the glass doors leading to an outdoor balcony.
text: Amy comes up to him - finds Virgil facing a wall - eyes shut.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Virgil's head cocks slightly towards her - just like when he was
dialog: blind.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I feel like Rip Van Winkle.
dialog: I've woken up from a thirty year sleep
dialog: - and the world's passed me by.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: It's just dancing. Who cares?
text: Virgil whirls on her - his hand on her shoulder to steady his look
text: at her.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: No-no-no-no. It's not the Goddamn dancing.
dialog: I wanted to come here tonight - show you I
dialog: could "fit" in. Like the big boys do. Big
dialog: seeing boys. Yes. Well, I don't. Don't.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: It's just going to take time.
dialog: You weren't ready. We shouldn't have come.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: No - I - me, shouldn't have come.
dialog: You want me to see - but you know what
dialog: - you know what - shit - I don't belong
dialog: in the wonderful world of seeing.
text: Amy reaches out to him.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Virgil  look .
text: Amy realizes what she just said - Virgil pulls his arm away.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: No, I won't. I'm tired of looking.
dialog: Fuck looking and the horse it came in on.
text: And he spins to get away from her and takes a step crashing right
text: into the sliding glass door which explodes in a shower of little
dialog: crystals.
text: The party slams to a halt - Amy stands stunned. Virgil shaken - tiny
text: cuts on his face.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Oh my God, are you alright?
text: Virgil slams his eyes shut.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Yeah, I'm just fine. Take me home.
scene_heading: INT. AMY'S LOFT - NEXT MORNING
text: Virgil, small nicks on his face, wakes up - rolls over - feels the
text: empty bed beside him. Looks up to see Amy pulling her coat on -
text: suitcase at her side.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Didn't want to wake you.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: You're going.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'll only be a couple of days.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: This isn't working.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What - we're not working - your eyes
dialog: - what's not working?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I get up every morning - I look in the mirror
text: - and I stare at a total stranger. I stare and
text: I stare - and no matter how hard I look - I
dialog: don't see Virgil there anywhere. And the more
dialog: I look at you...
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What? You don't see me?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I saw you better when I was blind.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Well, you're not blind any more.
dialog: I'm sorry if that disappoints you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I've got a plane to catch. I'm going
dialog: to go before we say things we don't mean.
text: And she grabs her bag and is out the door. As we hold on Virgil's
dialog: face.
text: AT THE WINDOW - Virgil looking out - watching Amy get in the cab.
text: As she drives away we see Virgil watch the car recede - then his
text: hand goes out.
text: HIS POV - his hand grasping at the tiny disappearing cab - trying to
text: hold onto it like in Times Square - trying not to let it go.
scene_heading: INT. FALK BOARD ROOM - DAY
text: CLOSE ON - Amy's sketches. The Mall has been integrated into the two
text: large trees - giving it shelter and shape.
speaker_heading: FALK (O.S.)
dialog: I love it.
text: Amy and Duncan sit across from Falk, a man in his 40's - earned
dialog: everything he's got - no bullshit kinda guy.
speaker_heading: FALK
dialog: But we already cut those trees down.
scene_heading: EXT. NYU CAMPUS - DAY
text: Kids milling about. A young couple neck unabashedly against a wall.
text: We see this is Virgil's POV - he's watching - people together.
scene_heading: INT. NYU HALLWAY - DAY
text: Virgil makes his way down the hall. Stops at an open doorway - a
text: sign next to it with raised letters in Braille. As his hand feels
text: across it - he also reads the visual letters - Dr. Ray Webster.
text: Peering inside - he sees a Lab - full of the NEWLY BLIND - some
text: TEENAGERS - a couple of ADULTS - a handful of SEEING IMPAIRED - all
text: learning to use a cane. The rapid tapping of their cane like a room
text: full of typewriters.
text: Virgil watches - the Blind working their way around a small obstacle
text: course - many of them running into desks, tables - it's tough,
dialog: frustrating work.
text: Suddenly Virgil feels someone next to him. Webster.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: You want to join us.
text: Virgil watches the blind.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: No - no - I'll wait for you
dialog: out here - when you're done.
text: As Virgil moves off to a hallway bench:
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: Virgil
text: Virgil turns as Webster tosses his something. Virgil misses it - it
text: hits the ground - he reaches down - finding it, he picks it up -
text: it's an apple. He looks to Webster who smiles back at him.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: I'll be done in a minute.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - ATLANTA - DUSK
text: Amy and Duncan walk through the lobby to their rooms. A little combo
text: plays music in the adjacent bar - a few people on the tiny dance
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You'd think he would have told us.
dialog: I mean those trees were in the photos.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: We'll just have to win him over tomorrow.
dialog: Let me buy you a drink - get those
text: creative juices going.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (looks at her watch)
dialog: Aw - no - I really...
text: But Duncan has her by the arm - and in one spin has her in a dance
text: embrace. This move seems comfortable, familiar to them both.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: C'mon - listen, they're playing our song.
speaker_heading: AMY

scene_heading: INT. WEBSTER'S LAB - LATER
text: Webster is cleaning up after class. Virgil watching some of the
text: Teenage kids and Adults find their way out of the room. As the last
text: of them leaves.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: OK - I'm just about done here - I got a place
dialog: for you - relax those eyes a bit.
scene_heading: INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT
text: A table front and center. Some empty beer glasses in front of them.
text: Two full ones in their hands - they're both a little in their cups.
text: A STRIPPER grinds and weaves her way about the small dance floor to
text: the sounds of Talking Heads "Burning down the House".
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (eyeing the girl)
dialog: You want to know the truth -- God's honest truth?
dialog: Seeing's been the shits.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: You got to be kidding me son. You can say
dialog: that - sitting here in these prime viewing seats.
dialog: Forget fixing your eyes - we're going to get
dialog: your head examined.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I'm serious. I was better off blind.
dialog: People don't have these expectations of you
dialog: you can't live up to. You're blind -
dialog: fine - they deal with it.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: Didn't get what you expected did you?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: When I was blind - I had an image of
dialog: what everything was, up here...
dialog: (points to his head)
dialog: now - it's all different - not at all
dialog: what I'd expected - not what I'd hoped for.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: Virgil, let me explain something here.
dialog: When you were blind - you dealt with things
dialog: one at a time - sequentially right? A wall
text: led to a door to a tree to a car. That's
dialog: how you got to what you wanted - right.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Seeing people - for better or worse -
dialog: deal with everything all at once - taking in
dialog: the whole picture - which sometimes confuses
dialog: the hell out of what they want.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Virgil, my advice after three beers - don't be
dialog: afraid to take in the whole picture - just don't
dialog: lose sight of what you want.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: What I want is to make it work with Amy.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: And what does she have to say
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: She just wants me to see.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: It's that important is it?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: You know what I learned a long
dialog: time ago. Seeing girls like seeing guys.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm not going to let her down.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT 102
text: Amy and Duncan are dancing - they seem good together. Nothing fancy
text: - but they move as one about the floor.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: See - not so bad.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Not so bad.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: It's nice to dance together again.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: You remember...?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: First time we danced - Connecticut. We
dialog: watched the leaves turn - so much to see
dialog: - I'd love to go back.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: So would I.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What happened to us Amy? You're so intent on
dialog: fixing everything - why'd you give up on us?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I learned some things can't be fixed.
dialog: We got married for all the wrong reasons.
dialog: I don't think I fell in love with you as
dialog: much as I fell in love with architecture.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (serious)
dialog: I never fell in love with architecture -
dialog: but I know I fell in love with you.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Now - that's bullshit.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: It used to work.
text: They smile at each other - everything's easy right now - pause -
text: they dance - Amy looks up at Duncan - who hesitates - then leans in
text: and kisses her.
text: A moment and Amy pulls away slightly - looks down for a second -
text: then she leans back in and they kiss again. We hold on this kiss,
dialog: then cut to:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: BLACK - we hear movement - then a light comes on in the bathroom.
text: Amy stands there clutching her clothes - staring into the mirror. In
text: the background we see Duncan curled up asleep in bed.
text: Amy stares at herself long and hard.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: Oh, God.
text: And she starts to dress:
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Amy? - what's going on -
dialog: what time is it?
text: Click - he flicks the bedside lamp on - squinting - finds Amy. She
dialog: doesn't talk - keeps dressing.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What's wrong? This was' a mistake -
dialog: a big mistake. Go back to sleep -
dialog: you've got an important meeting tomorrow.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: I've got? - hold on here - you're not
dialog: bailing out on me - I need you.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (flat)
dialog: For the meeting.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Of course for the meeting.
text: Dressed, she moves toward the doorway - Duncan sits up in bed.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'm going home.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: To be a babysitter.
text: She stops at the door.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Can't we for once be adults - face the
dialog: fact that we've just made a colossal error?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Fine - this was stupid, there - happy? -
dialog: but goddamit Amy - I still care about you.
dialog: Where do you actuallv think any of this is
dialog: going to lead with this guy?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I don't know - but the one good thing to come
dialog: of this mess tonight - I know I want to find out.
text: And she's gone - WHAM.
scene_heading: EXT. AMY'S LOFT - DUSK
text: A cab pulls up - Amy gets out - looks up at her loft - it's dark.
scene_heading: INT. AMY'S LOFT - DUSK
text: Kitchen light on - a pile of Ethan's blocks on the table. Amy makes
text: her way over to see it reads:
speaker_heading: ON THE ROOF
scene_heading: EXT. AMY'S ROOF - DUSK
text: Amy opens the door and sees Virgil leaning against the parapet wall,
text: staring out at the night Manhattan skyline. After a moment, he walks
text: back to the other end of the roof, turns and slowly walk - toward
text: the parapet wall again - all the time staring at the skyline - with
text: a smile and look of amazement on his face.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Hi
text: Virgil turns - finds her.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Hey.
text: Amy starts toward Virgil.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Whatcha doing?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: It's the craziest thing. You start back over
dialog: there - focus on a building. And when you walk
dialog: towards it - it changes - each step makes it
dialog: look different. I started out just looking
dialog: for the horizon.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You can't see it from here
dialog: - too many buildings.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: But it's still there - even though you can't
dialog: see it - right? You gotta have faith it's there.
dialog: Things exist beyond what I can see -
dialog: I just have to take it on faith.
text: She comes up next to him - Virgil, looking out over the wall turns
text: to her - studies her face:
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: You have so many looks?
dialog: AMY There's something I have to tell you.
dialog: I was getting confused - which is no
dialog: excuse for how I've acted, but...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Wait - no - this isn't your fault -
dialog: I'm the one's been a shit. You're too
dialog: hard on yourself - expect too much of yourself.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Virgil
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (stopping her)
dialog: Let me say this. Every day of my life -
dialog: I've wished for just one thing.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: To see.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: To be whole. For just one month. For just
dialog: one day or one minute. For one goddamned
dialog: half a second. And not just to be able to
dialog: run, or ride a bike, or drive a car.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But for once not to have a bruise from
text: bumping into something or to stand in a room
dialog: and have to ask "is anyone here" and here
text: that dead silence, knowing someone is there.
dialog: Not to have food on my sweater, or have to
dialog: put my finger in my glass to know when it's
dialog: full. I just want to be whole.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I went to see my father the other day.
text: Amy moves toward him.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I couldn't face him. I felt like
dialog: I was letting him down. I feel
dialog: like I'm letting you down.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: No, listen. I gave up years ago - I'm not
dialog: going to give up now. Amy - that day I met
dialog: you - for the first time in my life I felt
dialog: someone needed me as much as I needed them.
dialog: I don't want you to give up on me.
text: Amy out of breath - feels a surge of love for this man - moves in
text: kissing him. A long kiss - then:
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Besides I couldn't leave you -
dialog: I owe too much in back rent.
text: And as Amy pulls him into embrace - we hold on her face - then:
scene_heading: INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY
text: CLOSE ON - Dr. Aaron - harsh lights washing him out.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Up until the operation five weeks ago -
dialog: Virgil had been a touch person - someone
dialog: who's vocabulary, whole sensibility,
dialog: his picture of the world was based on
dialog: tactile -- non-visual terms.
scene_heading: INT. DOWNTOWN ATELETIC CLUB - DAY
text: A HEALTH INSTRUCTOR - 50's Jack LaLaine type - is giving Virgil the
text: tour of the facilities. They enter the weight/workout room. Various
text: shapes and sizes of people work out on various shapes and sizes of
text: workout machines.
text: Aaron's voice-over continues as Jack motions to Virgil to follow
text: him.. Virgil hesitates.
text: HIS POV - chrome, iron, plastic - but somehow it's more defined than
dialog: we've seen before.
text: Determined - Virgil starts his way into the gym - hand' out brushing
text: by what he sees in front of him.
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT)
dialog: But - now - as a sighted person - by
text: focusing singlemindedly on his goal,
dialog: Virgil has a new found ability to
dialog: understand his own physical relationship
text: to objects in his life around him...
text: Virgil now drops his hand - starts moving through the maze of people
text: and equipment - actually "seeing" his way.
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT.)
dialog: Distance, size, shape - perspective -
dialog: now all have profound meaning to him...
scene_heading: EXT. HEALTH CLUB - DAY
text: Virgil negotiating a glass door - exiting the building.
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT)
dialog: and though there are still miles to go in his
dialog: learning process - for all medical intents
text: and purposes - he is becoming a seeing person.
text: Virgil walking down the street - deftly dodging a kid on a
text: skateboard - throwing out his hand to hail a cab.
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT.)
dialog: This is an extraordinary achievement and
dialog: advancement for medical science and a
text: tribute to Virgil's determination to see.
scene_heading: INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT)
dialog: Ladies and Gentlemen - Virgil Anderson.
text: Applause and Virgil looking to Amy in the audience, stands - a
text: seeing man - and easily makes his way to the podium. Standing in the
text: lights he readjusts the microphone - moving it up from the much
dialog: shorter Aaron.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (clears his throat)
dialog: Since this may be one of our last
dialog: sessions - are there any questions?
scene_heading: VOICE IN THE DARK
dialog: Mr. Anderson - is there something you
dialog: were surprised to see for the first time
dialog: - something that looked quite different
dialog: than you thought?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Breasts.
dialog: (laughter)
dialog: No, really. Don't get me wrong - I love them
dialog: - they just weren't what I expected.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: What about your girlfriend?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Whose did you think I was talking about?
text: Laughs.
scene_heading: ANOTHER VOICE IN THE DARK
dialog: Now that you're fully seeing -
dialog: what are you looking forward to most?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Not having to do these sessions.
dialog: (laugh)
dialog: No - actually - being independent.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Can you read yet?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: No, but...
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Will you ever be able to?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: If you can't read - will you ever be able to drive?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (suddenly somber)
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Well how can you say...
speaker_heading: FAMILIAR VOICE
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Virgil. After so many years of darkness -
dialog: describe what it is to actually see.
text: Angle on the Voice in the dark. Webster.
text: CLOSE ON - Virgil - as he thinks about the question.
scene_heading: INT. ROSWELL-TREMONT - AMY'S OFFICE - LATE DAY
text: CLOSE ON - the Atlanta project. Miniature size. And a set of plans
text: laid out across Amy's desk. Virgil's hand comes into frame - touches
text: the model - moves to the plans - touches them.
text: ON VIRGIL - alone in Amy's office - looking at her work. We go to
text: his face - his eyes - we see that he is seeing Amy's work.
speaker_heading: AMY (O.S.)
dialog: You're here.
text: Virgil looks up - Amy at the doorway.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: The Atlanta project - I thought it went away.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Duncan did some song and dance - Falk's coming
dialog: to the lobby opening tomorrow - see our work.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I see it Amy.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Your world. What you do. The plans -
dialog: the work the ideas. The molding.
dialog: For the first time I really see what
dialog: you do - and not just up here...
text: (he points to his head) but in here.
text: Virgil's hand goes out to her chest - places it on her heart.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (moves in close, sexy)
dialog: Tonight is your night something
dialog: special I want to show you
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: What is it?
text: SMASH TO.
scene_heading: EXT. BUILDING - LATE DAY
speaker_heading: AMY (V.0.)
dialog: Everything.
scene_heading: TOP OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER
text: The sun starting to set - the whole of the five burroughs of New
text: York laid out in front of us. Virgil moves to the edge - looks out
text: over this amazing panorama.
text: Amy moves up next to Virgil - they take it in a moment.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: That's the Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State
dialog: Building, Chrysler building just over there...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Amy, look at me.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: This face - this is everything. It's all
dialog: I've ever wanted to see.
dialog: (he watches her)
dialog: You have so many looks.
dialog: What do all those looks mean?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Well. Let's see. This...
dialog: (makes corresponding face)
text: ... is sad. This...is frustrated.
dialog: This... is tired. This.. is confused.
dialog: This.. is happy. And this...
dialog: (her face softens)
dialog: ... is what in love looks like.
text: Virgil puts his hand on her face - looks at it carefully.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: This look - this look I love.
text: Amy leans forward and kisses him - and he soon forgets it even
text: happened. As they kiss we pull slowly back and away as the sun goes
text: deep gold and we start to hear what sounds like rain:
dialog: We cut to:
scene_heading: INT. AMY'S LOFT - NIGHT
text: And they are still kissing - and we realize they are in the shower -
text: together - kissing - exploring - very sensual. As Virgil moves to
text: kiss her neck - her breasts - Amy's head tilts back in to the spray.
speaker_heading: AMY
text: Virgil - it's raining.
text: And he moves up again - looks her in the eyes - and for a moment his
text: eyesight shudders ever so slight1y - it goes away and they kiss
dialog: again.
scene_heading: EXT. AMY'S LOFT - MORNING
text: Amy and Virgil on the street - each hailing separate cabs.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: So - eight o'clock tonight.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Eight o'clock - building opening -
dialog: I haven't forgotten.
text: She blows him a kiss and she's gone. Virgil watches her cab pull
text: away - clear something is bothering him.
text: HIS POV - his vision going in and out. Then clear, then clouded
dialog: again.
scene_heading: INT. DOWNTOWN ATHLETIC CLUB - DAY
text: Virgil's massage room. Not as organized as he had at Bear Mtn..
text: Virgil is working on an OVERWEIGHT MAN - his back is splotchy from
dialog: too much sun.
text: Virgil massaging - becomes preoccupied with his skin's imperfections
text: - losing his concentration.
speaker_heading: OVERWEIGHT MAN
dialog: Hey, Virgil - I'm the one supposed
dialog: to fall asleep here.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Yes - sorry.
text: He closes his eyes - gets back into his rhythm.
scene_heading: INT. ATHLETIC CLUB - LATER
text: Virgil, pack over his shoulder leaving for the day - about to cut
text: through the weight room - when it suddenly comes to a halt.
text: His POV - his vision fading in and out - and then suddenly quick

dialog: We smash to:
scene_heading: INT. NEW YORK HOSPITAL - DAY
text: Virgil at the desk. The Nurse looks up.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Daphne - I need to see Dr. Aaron
dialog: - right away. It's an emergency.
scene_heading: INT. NEW YORK HOSPITAL - EXAM ROOM - DAY
text: Dr. Aaron is again examining Virgil on the Electroretinogram. Done,
text: Aaron pulls the machine out of the way. Looks at Virgil - rubs his
text: hand across his face.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: What you just did?
text: Virgil imitates him.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: It means - the machine is only registering
dialog: sparks of activity - retinal sparks -
dialog: followed by nothing. How long has this
dialog: been going on?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I don't know - first I thought I was
text: tired - some blurs - occasional cloudiness
dialog: but it's been getting worse. Today I'm
text: getting complete blackouts.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Your retinal function is down ten
dialog: percent. I'm afraid - your retinal
text: disease seems to have returned.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: You're afraid. What does that mean - I
dialog: thought you corrected it. You told me
dialog: I was a 'seeing person'.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Now, you've every right to be upset.
dialog: Maybe you didn't have the blood vessels
dialog: to supply enough oxygen to the retinas.
dialog: - Possibly some trauma - there are so
dialog: many variables...(beat)
dialog: to be honest, I don't know. I wish to God I did.
text: Virgil stands, anxious - starts pacing.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: OK. You're the expert. Tell me - what
dialog: do we do now - how do we repair this?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Virgil. I -- I wish there was a
dialog: nice way to say this.
text: Virgil backs away - doesn't want to hear it.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: No - there is no nice way to say it is
dialog: there. No nice way to let the man know
dialog: it's all over - that.. he's going blind again!
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Virgil, I understand what...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: No you don't! Don't ever say that.
dialog: You'll never understand. Ever!
text: Aaron stands there - says nothing - tries to let Virgil's anger
text: dissipate. A long moment.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: How long?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Hard to say.
dialog: Month - few weeks -
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Days.
text: Virgil stands there stunned - then looking to Aaron.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: God, what do I tell Amy?
dialog: What do I tell her?
text: On Virgil's face.
scene_heading: INT. EYE INSTITUTE HALLWAY - DAY
text: Virgil steps into the hall - Sees:
text: A FIVE YEAR OLD BOY - blind - eyes half shut - hands reaching out,
text: plodding it' a half circle over to where his mother waits for him.
text: And we see the realization on Virgil's face of seeing his past - and
dialog: what he will return to:
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS - DAY
text: Virgil RUNNING, RUNNING, best he can - through the crowded street -
text: hands out - bumping into people - desperate - scared - trying to run
dialog: from himself - from his fate.
text: WHAM - he comes to a stop - out of breath - he looks left - right -
text: where do you go - then sees something off screen. His face torn with
text: fear - he moves forward - hand out - reaching to a window - to his
text: own REFLECTION.
text: And we push slowly in on the reflection as he touches the window -
text: his hand on his face - a face he may never see again - and a cloud
text: passes overhead and his reflection is gone.
scene_heading: EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY
text: Virgil stands at the site - amidst the rubble and mud. His Father
text: walks slowly over to him - raising his arms to embrace him.
text: Virgil takes a step back - not, ready - his father stops,
text: understands - looks his son up and down.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: You look good. Hey - how do I look?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I need some answers. Why'd you leave? Because
dialog: I'm blind - or because I quit trying to see?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: To the point - I like that -
dialog: something you got from me.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Cut the bullshit - "dad". I don't hear from
dialog: you for over twenty years - then you find
dialog: out I can see and all of a sudden you show up?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (looks around)
dialog: Hey. Virge - can we talk about this later, huh...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: No, not later. Now! Was my blindness so
dialog: wrong that made you tear our family apart.
text: Virgil's riled his father. He steps towards Virgil tries to speak
text: under his breath.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Every morning I woke up and looked at you
dialog: and saw my own failures. If I couldn't get
dialog: my own son to see then...What difference
dialog: does any of this make - you can see now
dialog: - hell, I knew you could.
text: Virgil watches his father - this stranger. His eyes start to well.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I'm going blind again.
text: His Father looks at him - stunned. He reels from the news - takes a
dialog: step back.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: The doctor told me today. You're the first
dialog: person I've told. I wanted to come see
dialog: you before it was completely gone.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (speechless)
text: A beat and Virgil's father takes another step back, then turns and
text: walks away - forever.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW BUILDING - LATE DAY
text: Virgil standing across the street. Trying to take in the building
scene_heading: EXT. NEW BUILDING - LATE DAY
text: Standing at the front as a security guard opens the door.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Sorry the building doesn't open until tonight.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I know. I'm Virgil Anderson...with Roswell
dialog: Tremont. We did the lobby. I'm here to
dialog: check some details for tonight.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Oh, okay, sure Mr. Anderson.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY - LATE DAY
text: The lobby is pretty, straightforward. Open - a few plants - a large
text: central check in desk. Simple - unobtrusive - nothing exceptional or
dialog: unique.
text: Virgil moves his way about the lobby - looking at it carefully from
text: every possible angle - his hand grazing across walls, entranceways -
text: desperately committing as much as he can to memory - finally ending
text: up in the middle of the room in a final attempt to absorb as much as
dialog: he can.
speaker_heading: GUARD (O.S.)
dialog: You want to see that the thing work?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Thing? What thing?
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: This thing
text: The Guard reaches over - hits a switch - and against one section of
text: windows a wall of water comes dripping down - causing a shower of
text: indoor rain - the sound instantly echoing off of the walls.
text: Virgil smiles - moves toward it - closing his eyes - listening to
text: the indoor rain - really taking in the room having total empathy
text: with what Amy has created.
scene_heading: INT. AMY'S LOFT - BATHROOM
text: Virgil, wrapped in a towel, is shaving. But he has his eyes closed.
text: Amy comes in, dressed beautifully - using the mirror to put her
text: earrings in. Virgil quickly opens his eyes.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: You nervous?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No - not a bit.
dialog: What do you think?
text: She pivots for him.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: You look great.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Really. Not too flashy?
text: (she looks in the mirror, she is nervous)
dialog: I'm going to change.
text: Virgil lets her go - calls to her.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: This is an important night for you.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: But you know what's most important...
text: (she pokes her head in)
dialog: That you're going to be there to see it.
text: Virgil turns to the mirror, stares at himself - contemplating what
dialog: he's up against.
scene_heading: INT. NEW BUILDING - NIGHT
text: The lobby is filled with business types, waiters circulating with
text: champagne, tiny hors-d'oeuvres. Virgil and Amy enter - standing at
text: the top of the stairs leading to the party. Virgil immediately going
text: into a performance for Amy.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: So.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Amy, it's good - very good.
dialog: I'm proud of you. I love the detail
dialog: - planted pots in the corners,
dialog: the moldings...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's got genuine lines.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Look around - do you see it?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: What?
text: He looks about the room - then turns towards the indoor rain.
text: HIS POV - clear - then slight haziness - a momentary flash of black
text: - then back in focus.
text: He turns to Amy. Puts his arm around her.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Our rain.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Your rain.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Hey Virgil.
text: He extends his hand. Virgil, obliged slowly extends his - having
text: trouble focusing - but Duncan helps him - taking hold of it and
text: shaking it.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
text: Still working on that hand shake
dialog: you'll get it don't worry.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Congratulations - the place looks great.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Thanks - here's the genius though -
dialog: I just get the gigs. Can I steal her
dialog: away Falks' over there and I can't
dialog: tell if he's impressed with our work
dialog: or just has gas from the pate.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Go - do your thing.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'll be right back. There's food
text: and drinks down on the floor.
text: Duncan and Amy start down the stairs as Virgil tries to find a safe
text: place to stand. His eyesight fading in and out - he looks around -
dialog: decides to negotiate the steps:
text: He takes one step on the stairs - looks down - is able to see Amy
text: with Falk and Duncan, looking up at him - she smiles - he does his
text: best - smiles back - lets go of the handrail - takes another step -
text: finally reaching the bottom floor.
text: He stands there for a long moment - lost as to where to move. A
text: glimpse towards the rain sculpture and he starts towards it using
text: the sound to help guide him.
text: Amy looks over - sees Virgil moving across the floor - gives him a
text: little wave - he doesn't notice her.
text: At the rain Virgil stands taking in the sound. A FIGURE comes up
text: next to him.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Quite a party. Love the detail of the building.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: Sometimes the detail doesn't matter.
text: Virgil stops - turns to Webster.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Ray. What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: Aaron called me. He was worried.
dialog: I've been trying to find you -
dialog: Amy's office told me you were
dialog: here. It's bad?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: It's almost gone. Last few days
dialog: have been pretty bad.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
text: Obviously Amy doesn't know.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: It's going to break her heart.
dialog: This is her big night - I didn't
dialog: want to ruin it. Thought I could
dialog: pull it off.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You can't avoid this forever.
text: Virgil turns back towards the rain.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I know
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So Ray? Is it better to have seen and
dialog: lost than never to have seen at all?
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: I thought it was loved and lost.
text: Amy comes up to them.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Dr. Webster - this is a surprise.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: Virgil invited me - wanted to show
dialog: you off I think. The place is terrific
dialog: - he's got every right to be proud.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Thank-you. I need Virgil for a
text: moment - schmoozing time.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
text: Shmooze away.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (as he's led away)
dialog: Thanks Ray. I'll call you.
text: ANGLE ON - Duncan standing anxiously with Falk and his wife Donna as
text: they arrive.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Virgil - I'd like you to meet Jack
text: Falk and his wife Donna up from Atlanta.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Pleased to meet you.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Amy tells us you were blind.
text: Amy spurts out a glass of wine. Virgil deflects the comment.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: That's OK - nice to see someone so honest.
speaker_heading: FALK
dialog: Amy tells us you're her inspiration.
dialog: Any help you can give us with our project?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I'm a little biased but I kind of
dialog: liked Amy's original design.
speaker_heading: FALK
dialog: But could we do better.
text: Amy jumps in with.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: We could do better, Mr. Falk - a lot better.
speaker_heading: FALK
dialog: Good, I like that attitude.
dialog: Let's keep trying for perfection.
text: Everyone smiles - Amy wraps her arm around Virgil.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: That's right - that's
dialog: why I've got Virgil.
text: Pleasant laughter all around - and as Amy and the others continue -
text: we push in on Virgil as he takes in this thought.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Virgil and Amy out front. People leaving - Duncan getting into a
text: town car with Falk and his wife - he looks back - gives the thumbs
text: up and climbs in after them. The car pulls away into the night.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: You wanna walk - I feel like some air.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: See what we see? Sure.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Can I take your arm - eyes a little tired.
text: As they walk.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: You really made the place
dialog: come alive with that fountain.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Thank-you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You know I've been thinking - you're doing
dialog: so great now - and if we get this new
dialog: design job we'd have some extra money
dialog: - I think we should go on a big seeing
dialog: celebration.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: A seeing celebration?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Yeah, maybe in a couple of months.
dialog: I looked into Egypt - we could see
dialog: the pyramids - we could see it
text: together for the first time.
dialog: What do you say?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: You know - there is something
dialog: I'd like to see.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Of course, anything.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: The Rangers play tomorrow. Season'll
dialog: be over before we know it - could be
dialog: our last chance.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: The Rangers. Sure, why not?
speaker_heading: BLACK
text: Then a tiny pinpoint of light ahead - one that grows increasingly
text: larger as we move towards a SOUND. A hum that grows in intensity
text: until the light fills the frame and BAM - we exit the tunnel and we
dialog: are:
scene_heading: INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT
text: That glorious first view - people - the white ice shining below like
text: a giant jewel- and the players - in bright colors scurrying about
text: the playing surface below.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: This is amazing - isn't it?
text: She looks to Virgil who is awed by what he is seeing. Then suddenly
text: on his face - a flash - one of those moments of darkness.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Should we find our seats. Looks
text: like the game's already started.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Yeah - I - I'll follow you.
scene_heading: INT. GARDEN - SEATS - LATER
text: Virgil and Amy in the loge seats - on the aisle - up behind the
text: goal. Amy looking at the stadium while Virgil next to her, watches
dialog: the game best he can.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I love the stadium the
dialog: way it's structure...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Amy - the game...
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Right - the game.
text: SMASH - a hard check into the boards deep in the Rangers end of the
text: ice. The puck squirts out Gretzky picks it up - fires it across ice
text: - one, two it's back to him and he has a wide open break from center
text: ice - the crowd is out of their seats - Virgil included - Amy
text: quickly getting caught up in the enthusiasm.
text: On Virgil's face - watching Gretzky skate towards him - excited -
text: then losing him - another flash of blackness - like a blow to the
text: head - and we hear the crowd suddenly explode - and as Virgil's
text: vision regains we see the players mobbing Wayne after his goal - the
text: little red light behind the net the only evidence of it happening.
text: We see the frustration as Virgil realizes he'll never see it.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: He scored, he scored - you see
dialog: that - it was amazing.
text: As the players make their way to center ice - the crowd sits and Amy
text: sees the expression again on his face.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What? That was good right?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Yeah - it was great - I was just...
text: Suddenly Virgil becomes transfixed. Walking down the aisle, away
dialog: from him:
text: A VENDOR - carrying a tray of PINK COTTON CANDY.
text: Virgil stares at it a moment - transfixed - then like in a trance -
text: he stands - stepping out into the aisle - a man on a mission.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Virgil, where are you going?
text: And he's on the stairs - carefully moving down the stairs toward the
dialog: vendor.
text: Then she sees the Vendor - handing Virgil a large cotton candy -
text: round and puffy like a cloud - but something he can hold in his
text: hand. Amy can't believe it - watching Virgil - his fascination at
dialog: finding this long lost memory.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: The puffy thing.
text: Angle on Virgil turning - admiring his prize - then looking up,
text: trying to find Amy - who waves to him excited.
text: HIS POV - scanning the crowd - it's hazy - then flashes of dark.
text: Amy's face - suddenly drops - it's clear, even though she is only
text: four rows up - he doesn't see her.
scene_heading: INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT
text: Game is over - Virgil is packing up his stuff - Amy staring. at him.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Virgil, what's happening?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Just having a bad eye day.
dialog: A lot to take in.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Tell me. What's going on?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
text: Nothing. I see almost nothing.
text: Amy: she feels like she's about to explode.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Oh God.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: It's OK.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: OK?!!
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: It's OK for you to cry.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (recovering)
dialog: No, no - I'm not going to cry.
dialog: Solve the problem. We made it
dialog: through one operation - we'll
dialog: make it through another. We won't
dialog: give up. We'll get this right
dialog: - we just need to...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I saw Dr. Aaron.
dialog: There's nothing they can do.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Then we'll find another Doctor.
dialog: There's got to be someone else.
dialog: We'll find something that works.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Don't you get it -
dialog: I can't go through this again.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: So just like that - we just forget it -
dialog: give up? Why the hell haven't you told
dialog: me what was going on?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: (whirls on her)
dialog: Because of this!!
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What this?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: You! Not letting it go - thinking
dialog: there's a solution. Goddamit,
dialog: I'm not design flaw in your fucking
dialog: work that you can just change to
dialog: make work Or throw away because
dialog: it doesn't meet your expectations.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Let's face it - it's over!!
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Virgil, give it time, you'll see.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: No! I won't! This conversation is ended!!
scene_heading: INT. AMY'S APARTNENT - NIGHT
text: The door swings open - Amy and Virgil enter - Virgil moves towards
text: the bed - pulls out his duffel bag.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I'm leaving.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What do you mean leaving - you're
dialog: leaving this apartment - you're
dialog: leaving New York - you're leaving me?
text: Virgil turns - they stand across the room from each other - miles
dialog: apart.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I'm going home.
text: Amy walks toward him, picking a battle, rejection.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: So you're big sister can take care of you -
dialog: feed you TV dinners for of your life.
text: Virgil tries to side step her.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I'm not going to go through this bullshit again.
text: Amy moves in front - confronting him
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Is that what this has all
dialog: been to you - bullshit?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Yes!! Who the hell were we fooling?
dialog: I'm blind - I'm not meant to see
dialog: - I don't belong here.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: God damn right you're blind. You want to
dialog: live in your own little world - this perfect
dialog: world that your sister built for you
dialog: - where no one can touch you ... where no
dialog: one can reach you.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Do you know the reason why I remembered the
dialog: cotton candy all those years? Because I went
dialog: to the game with my father. And it's the
dialog: only good thing I can remember about him.
dialog: The rest is him pushing me to be something
text: I'm not - then turning his back on me the
text: minute his plans fail.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I am not turning my back on you.
dialog: You want me to give up on you
dialog: - you love the self pity.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I don't want you to give up on ME.
dialog: But you won't give up on me seeing.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Because there must be other options.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Not anymore.
text: Virgil, avoiding her, sidesteps quickly past her - straight into the
text: lamp, which crashes to the ground and breaks.
scene_heading: DARKNESS.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Dammit.
text: A short few steps then a much larger crash - the sound of a large
text: heavier thing breaking.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Virgil!!
text: Amy feels her way to the lights - and turns them on. We see that
text: Virgil has collided with Amy's sculpture of the woman. He sits among
text: the pieces on the floor.
text: Virgil - feeling the damage.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (going to him)
dialog: Is anything broken?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: No - no bones are broken.
text: Virgil uses the wall to stand - then - with his hands out in front
text: of him he finds his way to the bed.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: It's finished - can't you see that!
dialog: We both didn't get what we wanted.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I never meant to hurt you.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: When you asked me to come here -
dialog: did you ever think this wasn't going
dialog: to work - that for one minute I may
dialog: not be able to see.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Did you ever think it would be OK
dialog: to have a relationship with a blind man?
text: Amy - a pause.. Too long.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: There's my answer.
text: And he grabs his duffel and pack - throws the last few things in -
text: and moving to the door - leaves.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - NIGHT - RAINING
text: Virgil riding - crossing the George Washington Bridge - going home.
text: He looks out the window - sees the receding city - and he closes his
text: eyes - listens to the rain.
scene_heading: EXT. PINECREST - MAIN STREET - NIGHT
text: The Bus comes down the main street of Pinecrest. Stopping - the bus
text: door opens and Virgil gets out - and turns to face up the street -
text: the street he knew so well that is so foreign to him right now.
scene_heading: EXT. VIRGIL AND JENNIE'S - NIGHT
text: The door opens. Jennie smiles warmly, reaches out to him.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: Welcome home.
scene_heading: INT. HOME - NIGHT
text: Virgil and Jennie entering his place - to be greeted immediately by:
text: SOPHIE bounding across the floor towards them - tail wagging -
text: tongue hanging out.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Sophie!?
text: And he bends down to hug her. Sophie laps at his face. Virgil holds
text: her back to get a good look at her.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Let me look at you.
dialog: You're so beautiful.. yes.
text: Jennie watches her brother - happy to have him home. Hoping to get
text: him back to 'normal'.
scene_heading: INT. VIRGIL'S HOME - LATER
text: Virgil walks around, touching things, seeing the simplicity of his
text: life. Nothing on the walls - no decorations - no plants. Everything
text: functional. He realizes this is a home designed by his sister.
text: He moves over to the photo of the family. He on his dad's shoulders.
text: Stares at it - at his father and mother for the first time.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: Mom and dad.
text: Virgil just stares.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: Everything's as you left it.
dialog: Nothing's changed.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Jen - I'm pretty tired -
dialog: I'd like to be alone.
text: The PHONE rings. Rings again. Virgil doesn't move - his apprehension
text: is clear - he knows who it is. Jennie sees this and moves toward the
dialog: phone.
text: Virgil turns and walks out onto the front porch - followed by
text: Sophie, as his sister picks up the phone in the background.
scene_heading: EXT. VIRGIL'S PORCH - NIGHT
text: He sits down - looks into the night as we hear Jennie faintly on the
text: phone. A beat and she hangs up. We hold on Virgil:
scene_heading: EXT. PINECREST STREET - DAY
text: Virgil walks down Main street. Seeing his town - a town he grew up
text: in but now seems so foreign. Virgil seems oddly disturbed by what he
dialog: sees.
text: The yellow bus drives by - full of kids - Carl at the helm. Somehow
dialog: it's not what he expected.
scene_heading: INT. ROSWELL-TRRMONT DESIGN FIRM - DAY
dialog: Amy organizing all her work on the Atlanta project - - the original
text: designs - the new design with the trees - then she sees:
text: The sketch she made of the "dancing trees". Her eyes hold - and she
text: slowly shuts them - and with them tightly closed - her hand reaches
text: out and runs along the drawings.
scene_heading: EXT. PINECREST - END OF MAIN STREET - DAY
text: We find Virgil standing - looking out at the end of the street where
text: he stood with Amy. In front of him he sees:
text: The "dancing trees".
text: VIRGIL'S POV - a retinal spark - a quick glimpse of the intertwined
text: trees - one lover choosing between two others.
scene_heading: INT. FIREHOUSE - LATE DAY
text: Virgil - stands in the middle of the room. Looks about at what was
text: at one time so special to him. Now it just seems old and dingy - the
text: magic is gone.
text: He closes his eyes for a moment - listens - cocks his head to the
text: left - the right - but there is nothing there.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN LIBRARY - LATE DAY
text: Virgil standing outside - staring at a building he's never seen -
dialog: never been inside.
text: HIS POV: flickering a moment.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - SUNSET
text: Virgil now sits at a table. Stacks and stacks of LIFE magazine
text: splayed out in front of him. He is flipping through them at a rapid
text: rate - like a drowning man searching for air.
text: IMAGES - cars, JFK, the pyramids, Martin Luther King, houses,
text: flowers, Marilyn Monroe, that Napalm burned little girl in Viet Nam,
dialog: African masks, Dachau prisoners, Nixon, Warhol paintings, the Mona
text: Lisa, that vulture watching over the little baby, the Eiffel tower,
text: First Man on the moon, the Venus De Milo, that guy in front of the
text: tank in Tianaman square .. and the Pyramids.
text: The pictures go by fast and furious - Virgil soaking them up like a
dialog: sponge - life, beauty, horror, great people, great events...
text: And we move in on his face - absorbing these images for the last
text: time - a face filled with anguish at a world disappearing. And we
dialog: cut to:
scene_heading: EXT. AMY'S ROOF - SUNSET
text: Golden rays of the late afternoon sun. Amy on the roof - leaning on
text: the parapet - watching the horizon.
text: Then a thought comes to her. And mimicking what Virgil had done -
text: she walks back to the other end of the roof, turns and looks out
text: towards the skyline again ... then starts slowly walking towards the
text: parapet till she reaches the wall again.
text: The reaction on her face - she doesn't "see" it - not like Virgil
dialog: did.
scene_heading: INT. VIRGIL'S HOME - DAY
text: Virgil is shifting furniture in his house. A table - moves it to the
text: window - moves a chair to join it - stands back to have a look at
dialog: it.
text: HIS POV - a moment of clear - then haze - then dark - then haze.
text: Virgil rubs his head - these last days of sight have been painful
text: and exhausting for him.
speaker_heading: JENNIE (O.S.)
dialog: Hello!
text: She's at the door. Virgil cocks his head in her direction.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: I picked up some things at the store -
dialog: T-shirts, I'm sure you're out, some socks...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Jennie, what's at the
dialog: end of Main Street?
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: Well - I think it's Vivian's little stationery...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
text: Beyond all the stores - past firehouse.
dialog: What happens when this is no more Main Street?
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: Well - there's nothing really - you know that. ~
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: No! You told me that's all there was.
dialog: That's wrong. There's a helluva lot out there.
text: Jennie surprised at where this is going.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: I told you what you needed to know.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: What was within my reach.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: What more do vou want?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Isn't there anything more that vou want?
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: Is this about our father -
dialog: he called told me...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: No. This isn't about him. Jennie -
dialog: you've spent your whole life as
dialog: blind as I was. The world doesn't
dialog: stop within our reach.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: Virgil, please. This is your home.
dialog: Stop thinking about what's out there
dialog: - things that will never matter to you.
dialog: You're safe here where everyone...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Where everyone what!?
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: Knows you.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: Can protect me?! (beat)
dialog: Jennie, this place was a wonderful safe
dialog: haven for me growing up. I know that.
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: And I can only imagine what you gave up
dialog: to keep this world for me. I thank you
dialog: and love you from the bottom of my soul.
dialog: But now I want to give you your life back.
speaker_heading: JENNIE
dialog: Virgil, I - I can't...
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: You can
text: Virgil reaches out his arms for her to join him.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: I'm reaching out, Jennie.
text: This gets Jennie and she goes to him, really hugging him for the
text: first time as tears flow from her eyes.
scene_heading: INT. AMY'S LOFT - LATE DAY
text: Amy, dressed in sweat pants and tee shirt sitting on the ground,
text: trying to piece the sculpture back together. It's a difficult fix.
speaker_heading: KNOCK KNOCK
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Amy - you in there.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Go away.
text: She scrapes some plaster into a dust pan. We hear enters a key in
text: the door - and the door opens. Duncan
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: I knew keeping this key would come in
dialog: handy one day. What a mess - what happened?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: It broke - I'm trying to fix it.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: So - guess what?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'm not in the mood for games.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: We got it. The goddamned Atlanta mall -
dialog: we got it!! Now - pull yourself out of this
dialog: slump - I want you to fly down this week to...
text: Continuing to work on the sculpture.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'm not going.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: What are you ta1king about?
dialog: What's the problem here?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: The problem?! Everything.
dialog: Nothing is right thank-you very much.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: You know what the problem is - you're
dialog: the problem - you met a blind guy you
dialog: thought was cool and spent the first
text: two months trying to change him.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Are you finished?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Not even close. Let me tell you something
dialog: - you can't change people to solve you.
dialog: You tried to do it with me - you tried
dialog: to do it with Virgil. You ever think
dialog: some of the things you try to fix
dialog: - ain't broke.
text: And he's gone - as Amy slumps into a chair - confused, tired - then
text: slowly she starts to hear:
scene_heading: TAP - TAP - TAP...TAPTAP - TAP
text: The SOUND of a CANE in the stairwell! Amy's heart starts racing -
text: she takes a breath - jumps up quickly and moves her way over to the
text: door - unlocking it and swinging it open:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (excitedly)
dialog: Virg .......
text: The CANE - being held by Ethan - as he taps his way down the stairs.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: Hey Amy.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Hi, Ethan. Sorry - I thought...
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: He's not coming back is he?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No - he's not.
text: Ethan sees she's covered in dust - looks past her into the loft.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: Whatcha doin'?
text: He looks past her at the sculpture half repaired.
speaker_heading: AMY
text: Cleaning up a mess - going to start over.
scene_heading: EXT. PINECREST - SUNSET
text: Virgil walks the path, Sophie following close behind. By the way he
text: walks, counting steps, touching landmarks, we realize he is using
dialog: sight very little.
scene_heading: EXT. HIDDEN VALLEY - SUNSET
text: Coming through the clearing, to the plateau where he took Amy, the
text: leaves now starting to turn golden colors - he stops - stands over
text: top of the pond.
text: VIRGIL'S POV - A retinal spark. The view across the valley, with
text: white clouds against the bluest sky.
text: His hand reaches out - to touch the edge of the world - to touch the
dialog: horizon.
text: And as he drops his hand, we see the clouds start to race by - while
text: the blue sky goes golden then drifts into darkness. Virgil doesn't
text: move from the spot. The screen goes almost black - then slowly the
text: sun starts to rise in the east.
text: Virgil makes no movement. A long beat - then - as the sun moves
text: across him - he realizes it's day. He stands and unfolds his cane.
text: It's clear he has returned to being completely blind.
text: As he turns and starts his way down the hill we hear:
speaker_heading: VIRGIL (V.O.)
dialog: Growing up blind - I had two dreams.
dialog: One was to see. The other - to play
dialog: for the New York Rangers.
scene_heading: INT. LECTURE HALL - N.Y. EYE INSTITUTE - DAY
text: Virgil stands at the podium speaking - dark glasses on, cane in
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: After the 'miracle' of my short period of
dialog: sight - I realize - I'd rather play for the Rangers.
dialog: (laughs from the dark)
dialog: It's not that it was so awful - I saw many
dialog: things - some good, some back some that
dialog: I'm already forgetting.
scene_heading: INT. WEBSTER'S LAB - NYU
speaker_heading: VIRGIL (V.O.)
dialog: But I realized that our eyes aren't what
dialog: make us see. We only live in darkness
dialog: when we don't look - look at what is
dialog: genuine about ourselves - genuine
dialog: about others - you don't need eyes for that.
text: Virgil sitting with three young blind children - working through
text: Braille with them. Webster watches from the corner of the room.
scene_heading: EXT. NYU - DAY
text: Virgil - small brown bag in one hand - cane in the other - exits the
text: building and makes his way across the street to Washington Square.

text: Virgil - taking in the sun - finishing off the last of his sandwich.
text: Balling up his paper bag - he taps his cane out - finds the garbage
text: can nearby - and tosses the bag - rim shot - it misses, hits the

dialog: You want to walk?
speaker_heading: VIRGIL
dialog: See what we see?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Yeah. Just see what we see.
