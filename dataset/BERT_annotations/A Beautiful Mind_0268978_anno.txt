scene_heading: EXT. - PRINCETON- PRESIDENT’ S RECEPTION
text: Sunlight dapples the flickering autumn leaves. Students in formal

text: ZWEIFEL is tall and wiry, like a scarecrow made of skin. SHAPELY is

speaker_heading: SHAPELY
dialog: Milnor’s gonna get the brass ring if

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZWEIFEL
dialog: He’s used to pretty metal.

dialog: Silver spoon.
text: REVERSE on the subject of their musings. A student with shaggy hair

speaker_heading: ZWEIFEL
dialog: It’s not enough he won the Carnegie
dialog: scholarship.
speaker_heading: SHAPELY
dialog: Has to have it all for himself.
text: CAMERA DRIFTS to a third figure standing near them at the bar. John
text: Nash can’t help but overhear their conversation. Zweifel notices.
speaker_heading: ZWEIFEL
dialog: First time the Carnegie prize has
text: been split. Now Milnor’s all bent.
text: Nash nods, looks again at the young man working the crowd.
speaker_heading: SHAPELY
dialog: He’s set his sights on the new

speaker_heading: ZWEIFEL
dialog: They only recruit the best brain

speaker_heading: ZWEIFEL

scene_heading: at SHAPELY & ZWEIFEL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: (to Nash)
dialog: Hi. I’m Fox.
text: That's when Milnor emerges from the crowd to join his friends.
speaker_heading: MILNOR
dialog: Ah the burden of genius. So many
dialog: supplicants, so little time.
text: Milnor’s eyes light on Nash. The beat of recognition is so slight
text: it’s almost imperceptible. Then he smiles.
speaker_heading: MILNOR
dialog: I‘1l take a white wine.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Excuse me.
speaker_heading: MILNOR
dialog: A thousand pardons. I simply assumed
dialog: you were the waiter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Play nice, Milnor.
speaker_heading: SHAPELY
text: Nice is not Milnor’s strong suit.
speaker_heading: MILNOR
dialog: An honest mistake. What with those
dialog: war ration shoes...
text: Nash's outfit does look off the rack compared to Milnor’s couture.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: It’s not your first mistake. I read
dialog: your brief on Nazi ciphers.
text: With that, Nash offers a slight nod, turns and walks off.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Who was that masked man?
speaker_heading: MILNOR
dialog: Gentlemen meet John Nash. The

speaker_heading: CHARLES
text: The prodigal roommate arrives.

speaker_heading: NASE
dialog: Roommate?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Did you know that a hangover is not
dialog: having enough water in your body to
dialog: run your krebs cycle?
text: Charles pulls off his pants, and hopping, both shoes.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Which is exactly what happens when
dialog: you die of thirst.
text: Now finally his shirt, which he throws on the couch.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: So dying of thirst would feel like

speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: I’m here to work.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I see.
text: Charlies spots a bowl of wrapped amaretto cookies on Nash's desk.
text: Nash covers the bowl before Charles can grab one, never once

text: Horner looks around the room.
speaker_heading: . HORNER
dialog: From now on, this is how you will

speaker_heading: MILNOR
dialog: Scared?
text: A beat. Then Nash smiles.
scene_heading: EXT.-PRINCETON GAMES QUAD-MINUTES LATER
text: Nash faces Milnor across the GO board. The play is incredibly fast.
text: As they speak, they never take their eyes off the game board.
speaker_heading: MILNOR
dialog: Let me ask you something, John.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Be my guest, Martin.
speaker_heading: MILNOR
dialog: Fox and Zweif correctly predicted

speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Adequate work without innovation.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I’m flattered. Are you flattered?
speaker_heading: ZWEIFEL
text: Flattered.
speaker_heading: MILNOR
dialog: I’ve got two weapons briefs under
dialog: security review by the DOD.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Derivative drivel.
text: The pace of play has increased to an amazing speed, less and less
text: marbles on the board.
speaker_heading: MILNOR
dialog: But Nash achievements: zero.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 11
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Is there an actual question coming?
speaker_heading: MILNOR
dialog: What if you never come up with your
dialog: original idea? How will it feel when
dialog: I‘m chosen for RAND and you're not?
text: Nash doesn’t answer, concentrates on his play.
speaker_heading: MILNOR
dialog: What if you lose?
text: And with that Milnor makes a deft move and takes the game. Nash
text: sits there. Stunned.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: You shouldn’t have won. The game is
dialog: flawed.
speaker_heading: MILNOR
dialog: Ah, the hubris of the defeated.
text: Nash is furious, sweeps the board with his hand, rises and walks

speaker_heading: MILNOR
dialog: Gentlemen, the great John Nash.
scene_heading: EXT.-PRINCETON DORM QUAD-SUNSET
text: Nash stands staring down at a GO board at his feet. His face lined

text: PULL BACK AND UP TO...
scene_heading: EXT.-PRINCETON DORM QUAD-ACCELERATED TIME

speaker_heading: ZWEIFEL
dialog: What the hell-.
text: Nash pulls something from his back pocket. It’s a knife. The others
text: jump up. Nash has a maniacal gleam in his eyes.
speaker_heading: SHAPELY
dialog: John, take it easy-
text: Nash lifts the board and in two deft strokes, slices away both
text: sides, leaving a triangle. He drops the cut board on the table.
text: Nash turns and walks away. The others stare after him.
speaker_heading: ZWEIFEL
text: He’s totally lost it.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: What a whacko, huh, Shapes?

speaker_heading: SHAPELY
dialog: Will you look at this....
scene_heading: EXT.-PRINCETON GAMES QUAD-AFTERNOON
text: TRACK down a row of two-player tables. All sitting over cut-down,

speaker_heading: MILNOR
dialog: I know the boys at RAND are doing H-
dialog: bomb research, sir. I’m hopeful-
text: But Van Neumann has become distracted by two students playing GO on
text: the triangular board. He moves to them. Milnor follows.
speaker_heading: VAN NEUMANN
dialog: What have we here?
dialog: q
speaker_heading: STUDENT
dialog: It‘s derived from GO. But variant
dialog: outcomes are made impossible by the
dialog: shape of the board. Quite simply,

speaker_heading: VAN NEUMANN
dialog: Where did it come from?
speaker_heading: STUDENT

speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Milnor just published another brief.
dialog: And I’ve come up with nothing...
text: Charlies walks to the glass, appraises Nash's work.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Hell, no. You invented window art.
text: Nash gestures to the first pattern.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: This group represents a game of

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: You know, food?
text: Charlies grabs Nash’s wax pencil from his hand, shoves it in his

speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: You have no respect for the peril of
dialog: the free world, do you know that?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Pizza. I have respect for pizza. And
dialog: maybe beer...

speaker_heading: MILNOR

speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Hey. Oh, hey Nash. Wilson tanked.
speaker_heading: ZWEIFEL

speaker_heading: MILNOR
dialog: This is gonna be good.
scene_heading: INT.-OLD HOME BAR-MOMENTS LATER
text: Nash is at the bar with BECKY, the blond co-ed. The two stand there
text: in awkward silence. The moment stretches on. Finally...
dialog: Maybe you want to buy me a drink.
text: Nash appraises her clinically. When he speaks now, his words have
text: a deliberate quality that belies their speed.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Look, I don’t know exactly what
dialog: things I am required to say in order
dialog: for you to have intercourse with me.
dialog: But could we assume I’ve said them?
dialog: I mean essentially we're talking

speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: That was sweet.

speaker_heading: BECKY

speaker_heading: VOICE (OVER)
dialog: Want a piece of friendly advice?
text: WIDER. Charles has sidled up beside him.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Is ‘ne’ an actual option?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: You may be a genius, but when it
dialog: comes to the calculus of human

dialog: buy them drinks. Smile. Nod a lot.
dialog: And maybe keep your mouth shut.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: What’s unfriendly advice sound like?
text: Charles CLAPS him on the shoulder and grins.
speaker_heading: CHARLES

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: You know, friend Nash; if you want
dialog: to win your own way...
text: Charles pulls the desk back from the window, but doesn’t let go.
text: Instead he bends, as if for traction.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: You can’t play by their rules....
text: Charles begins shoving the desk towards the window...
speaker_heading: NASH

speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: No witch’s slipper. Good thing.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: - Your answer isn't, face the wall.
dialog: It’s not in their books and in their

dialog: look closer. Do you understand?
text: Nash stares at him a beat.
speaker_heading: NASH

speaker_heading: NASH

speaker_heading: GENERAL
dialog: We have developed several ciphers-
text: But Nash raises his hand, silencing the officer. He stands still,

text: PUSH IN ON Nash’s eyes. In the black ocean of his pupils, the
text: reflected rows of code begin to move, forming shifting patterns.
text: PULL BACK ON Nash, still staring at the wall. Hours have passed,

text: Alicia tries the knob. Locked.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: Baby, what is it?
text: No answer. She bows her forehead against the door.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: John, please answer me. John?
text: But from beyond the shut portal, only silence.
scene_heading: INT.-NASH’S SUN PORCH-NIGHT

text: John stands at the window, staring out at the parking row. A black
text: sedan pulls up. Two suspicious men in trench coats and hats emerge.
text: NASH-CLOSE. Really nervous.
text: Then two women emerge from the car, followed by their kids. Not hit
text: men, just two families. WIDER
text: John turns to face a classroom full of students, all staring at him
text: with confusion. His eyes are hollow as he moves to his desk.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: (off booklets on his desk)
dialog: Here is the final exam I will be

scene_heading: INT.-MIT HALLWAY-AFTERNOON
text: Nash is walking down a corridor. (OVER) FOOTSTEPS behind him. He

text: Again FOOTSTEPS. He picks up his pace. So do the FOOTSTEPS.
text: Nash breaks into a run, down the corridor, ducking just inside an
text: alcove, back pressed against the wall, BREATHLESS.
text: The FOOTSTEPS grow LOUDER, closing until...Alicia and Zweifel turn
text: the corner, stop and stare at Nash.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: What are you doing? Didn’t you hear
dialog: me calling you?
text: John rubs his eyes, shakes his head. He didn’t.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: I wanted to surprise you for lunch.
dialog: Zweif said you'd be here. John...?
speaker_heading: NASH

speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: He's not on site today, sir.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: When will he be back?
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: I'm sorry, Professor.
text: A beat. Nash heads off.
scene_heading: INT.-MIT RAND HEADQUARTERS -HALLWAY-DUSK
text: The setting sun draws long shadows out the windows. Nash pulis his
text: office door closed. He turns, practically colliding with William.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: (jumping back)
dialog: Christ.
speaker_heading: PARCHER
dialog: You were looking for me.
text: Nash takes a second to gather himself.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: I can't keep doing this. I’m getting
dialog: paranoid. Any time a car backfires-
speaker_heading: PARCHER
dialog: I understand. Better than you can
dialog: - possibly imagine.
text: William looks away. His eyes are terribly sad.
speaker_heading: PARCHER
dialog: Great deeds come at great cost. Your
dialog: words, John.
text: William puts his hands on Nash’s shoulders.

dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: PARCHER
dialog: We're closing in on the bomb, in
dialog: large part due to your work. Isn’t
dialog: your fear a small price to pay?
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: You have to guarantee you can
dialog: protect me. Protect my family.
text: William’s tone is steely when he speaks.
speaker_heading: PARCHER
dialog: I told you attachments were
dialog: dangerous. You chose to marry the
dialog: girl. I did nothing to prevent it.
dialog: Don't make me regret that.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: What do you mean, prevent it?
text: William’s answer is only silence.
speaker_heading: PARCHER
dialog: The best way to insure everyone’s
dialog: safety is to continue your work.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: That’s bullshit. I'll just quit-
speaker_heading: PARCHER
dialog: No. You won’t.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Why the hell not-
speaker_heading: PARCHER
dialog: Because I keep the New Freedom from
dialog: becoming aware that you work for us.
text: Finally, John realizes William's eyes are dead.
speaker_heading: PARCHER
dialog: If you quit working for me, I quit
dialog: working for you.
text: In the dying light, William turns, heads for the front door.
speaker_heading: NASH

speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: (shouting)
text: Turn off the light.
text: He is up fast, SLAMMING his hand on the wall, extinguishing the
text: light. His fast moves have scared the baby who has begin to WAIL.
text: Nash moves to the window, knocking over Alicia’s easel and half
text: finished painting. He hurls the canvas out the door.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: I want this stuff out of here.
text: John raises the drawn blind a bit and peeks out.
text: QUT THE WINDOW. A black sedan. An identical car pulls up beside it.
text: A shadow inside the first car points towards John’s apartment.
text: A beat. John lets the shade fall again. He turns now to face his

speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: _ They’re out there.
speaker_heading: ALICIA

speaker_heading: NASH

scene_heading: INT.-NASH'S APARTMENT-HALLWAY-CONTINUOUS
text: Alicia rocks her baby in her arms, her ruined canvas at her feet.
text: She pauses over the phone. A beat. Then she lifts the receiver.
scene_heading: EXT.-HARVARD UNIVERSITY-DAY
text: Nash climbs the steps of the Mathematics building. His suit lcoks
text: slept in, his hair a wild garden. He keeps looking behind him.
text: Nash pauses by a sign that reads: GUEST LECTURER-COHN NASH. A beat.
text: He checks over his shoulder again, then heads inside.
scene_heading: INT.-HARVARD UNIVERSITY-MATHEMATICS BUILDING-DAY
text: Jchn is walking skittishly through the lobby when a small, familiar

speaker_heading: MARCEE
dialog: Mean Uncle John, Mean Uncle John.
text: She raises her hands high over her head, bares her teeth and looses

speaker_heading: MARCEE
dialog: See, I remembered.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: You sure did.
text: He lifts her up in his arms and hugs her, tight, eyes closing
text: against the smell of her small girl’s hair. Sets her down.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Someone really needed a hug.

dialog: Saw you on the slate. Couldn't miss

speaker_heading: NASH

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: (darkening)
dialog: What? Teli me...

speaker_heading: VOICE (OVER)
dialog: Professor Nash...
text: A GRADUATE STUDENT stands at the open door to the lecture hall.

speaker_heading: NASE
dialog: We’ll talk after. Okay?
text: Before Charles can stop him, Nash heads inside.
scene_heading: INT.-HARVARD-LECTURE HALL
text: John stands on stage, a blackboard scrawled with numbers behind
text: him. He is speaking, staring out into the audience.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: ...And so we see that conventional
dialog: number theory breaks down in the
dialog: face of relativistic exploration...
text: Nash's voice trails off. A couple of MEN have ENTERED at the top of
text: a stairway, wearing overcoats and hats.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Sometimes, our expectations are
dialog: betrayed by the numbers...
text: Nash's voice trails off again. Another MAN has emerged at the top
text: of the other stairway, also in overcoat and top hat.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Excuse me.
text: Nash is staring at the young Graduate Student in the front row.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Is there another way out of here?
dialog: 64
dialog: 
text: Folks look puzzled. The Student, confused, points to a side door.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: I’m sorry.
text: Nash turns and rushes off stage, out the side door. The audience
text: stares in befuddled wonder.
scene_heading: EXT.-HARVARD MATHEMATICS BUILDING-DAY
text: Nash emerges from a side door, moving fast towards the street. A
text: figure blocks his way. It's the lone Man from one of the stairways.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Professor Nash.
text: Nash stops cold in his tracks. Spins. The other two Men are
text: standing right behind him. Nowhere to run.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Let’s avoid a scene, shall we?
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: What do you want?
dialog: a rast
dialog: “ My mame is Dr. Rosen. I'm a
dialog: psychiatrist.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: I'd like you to come with me, John.
dialog: Just for a chat.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: And if I say no?
speaker_heading: - ROSEN
dialog: I have a court order signed by a
dialog: judge. I hope we can proceed without
dialog: any unpleasantness.
text: John offers a charming smile.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Well I suppose I don’t have much
dialog: choice.
text: : He begins towards the Man, then hauls off and DECKS him, hard,

dialog: a

dialog: 
dialog: 65
text: The two Men are on him in a second, grabbing him, restraining him.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Get away from me. Don’t you think I
dialog: know who you are?
text: Rosen approaches, pulling a hypo from a case in his coat.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Help! Somebody, please.
text: Folks are watching. At the top of the steps, Charles and Marcee
text: have emerged. John spots them.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Charles. Help. They’re Russian
dialog: spies.
text: That’s when Rosen sinks the needle into his arm.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: (gentle)
dialog: There now. All better.
text: Nash’s struggling begins to slow as the medication takes effect.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: (to the crowd)
dialog: Everything's all right here.
text: The two Men stuff John into the back of the car as Rosen climbs in
text: next to the driver.
scene_heading: INT. -SEDAN-MOVING
text: Nash stares out the window at Charles coming fast down the steps,
text: Marcee behind him.
text: Nash raises his hand towards his friend, finding only window glass
text: between them as the car pulls away, leaving the university behind.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: John...

scene_heading: INT. -OFFICE
text: Nash lays on a couch, Rosen sitting over him. Leather chairs, an
text: oak desk, degrees on the walls. Picture perfect.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: John, can you hear me?
text: Nash blinks. Takes in Rosen. Tries to sit up. No luck. He looks
text: down. His hands are bound.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: Go easy. The Thorazine takes a
text: little while to wear off.
dialog: (off John’s hands)
dialog: I'm sorry about the restraints.
dialog: But...
dialog: (rubs his chin)
dialog: You have a hell of a right hook.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Where am I?
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: Mclean Psychiatric Hospital.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: You can cut the shrink act, okay?
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: Who do you think I am, John?
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: I know who you are. You work for a
dialog: group called the New Freedom.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: - I don‘t know anything else, okay?
dialog: I’m just a code breaker. That's all.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: What are you going to do with me?
dialog: Are you going to kill me?
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: No. I’m going to try and help you.
text: John nods, then he shoves Rosen onto the floor. Jumps up, tries for
text: the door. But he goes down, hard. His ankles have restraints around
dialog: them too.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 67
text: John looks up from the floor. What he sees chills his bones.
text: Sitting on a window seat in the corner are two figures. Charles and
text: Marcee, staring at him expressionlessly.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Charles?
text: But his old friend says nothing, just sits there impassively.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Say something. Why won't you answer
dialog: me? ...What are you doing?
text: Rosen has stood, gone to the desk and pressed a buzzer. The door
text: swings open and two burly orderlies ENTER.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Oh, Charles, not you. You can’t be
dialog: one of them. Not you.
text: But Charles and Marcee show no expression, just sit, watching on.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: (small)
dialog: Marcee?
text: The Orderlies pull John standing. Rage rises in him like a tide.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Answer me, Charles. Say something.
text: Rosen has moved in front of Nash. Stares at him a beat.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: Who are you talking to? Tell me who
dialog: you see.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: (flaring)
dialog: - You know damn well. It’s Charles.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: (virtually hysterical)
text: He’s right there. With Marcee. He's
text: sitting right there.
text: Rosen stares at him a beat.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 68
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: There's no one there, John.
text: Rosen nods and the Orderlies begin dragging him out.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: What are you talking about? They're
text: right there. They’re right there.
text: John is growing hysterical.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: What are you doing? Say something,
dialog: Damn it Charles please just say
dialog: something.
text: The Orderlies drag Nash into the hallway, Charles and Marcee
text: staring after him like the dead, unmoving, perfectly still.
scene_heading: EXT.-MCLEAN HOSPITAL-DAY
text: Lovely steepled brick buildings situated on resplendent browning

scene_heading: INT.-MCLEAN HOSPITAL-DAY
text: John Nash sits on a cot in a cell, rocking, mumbling. PULL BACK...
scene_heading: INT.-MCLEAN HOSPITAL-HALLWAY
text: Alicia stands watching John through the window of his cell. She
text: turns now, eyes red, to face Rosen.
speaker_heading: : ALICIA
dialog: What’s wrong with him?
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: John has a disease called
dialog: schizophrenia.
text: Alicia can’t even ask what he means, only shakes her head.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: He's lost his ability to tell the
dialog: difference between what is real and
dialog: what is imagined.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: The men? The ones he thinks are
dialog: following him?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: Schizophrenics are often paranoid.
text: They see conspiracies everywhere.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: But John’s work...I think he deals
dialog: with conspiracies.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
text: Seeing conspiracies, finding hidden
dialog: codes, these are the hallmarks of
dialog: schizophrenia. But in John’s world,
dialog: these behaviors are accepted, even
dialog: encouraged. As such, his illness may
dialog: have gone untreated far longer than
dialog: is typical.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: What do you mean? How long?
text: Rosen takes a minute before he speaks. Then...
speaker_heading: ROSEN
text: Possibly since graduate school. At
dialog: least that's when his hallucinations
text: seem to have begun.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: What are you talking about? What
dialog: hallucinations?
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: Two, so far, that I am sure of. An
dialog: imaginary roommate named Charles
text: Herman. Also a girl named Marcee.
text: Alicia looks at Rosen like he’s the crazy one.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: Marcee is Charles’ niece. Charles
text: isn’t imaginary. He and John have
dialog: been best friends since Princeton.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: Have you ever met Charles?
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: Has he ever come to dinner?
dialog: 69
text: Rosen holds her gaze, watches her glimpse then discard the panic.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: He’s always in town for so little
text: time. Lecturing.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: Was he at your wedding?
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: He had to teach.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: Have you ever seen a picture of him?
dialog: Have you ever spoken with him on the
dialog: phone?
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: ...-This is ridiculous.
text: But her words carry more conviction than her eyes.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: I contacted Princeton. According to
dialog: housing records John lived in a
dialog: single. There was no Charles Herman
dialog: in attendance when John was there.
scene_heading: EXT.-MCLEAN HOSPITAL-GARDENS -NIGHT-WALKING
dialog: 70
text: Rosen and Alicia walk the tree lined paths. Over the horizon hangs
text: a low harvest moon, plump and yellow.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
text: Charles and Marcee are fantasies.
dialog: But to John they appear as real as
dialog: you or I.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: Doctor, there’s probably just a
dialog: records error at Princeton.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: I was with John when he saw them.
dialog: There was no one there.
text: She hugs her coat tighter.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: I believe John's world is laced with
dialog: delusions. Like dreams walking
text: through his waking life.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: This is absurd.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: Which is more likely, that your
dialog: husband, a mathematician with no
dialog: military training, is a government
text: spy fleeing renegade Russians...
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: You’re making him sound crazy-
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: ...Or that he has lost his grip on
dialog: reality?
dialog: 71
text: Alicia starts to speak. Then purses her lips, not sure what to say.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: The only way I can help John is to
dialog: snow him the difference between what
text: is real and what is in his mind.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: What John does is classified.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: He mentioned a supervisor at RAND.
dialog: William Parcher. Maybe he can
dialog: clarify things for us. But I can’t
dialog: get to him without clearances.
text: Alicia stops, eyes narrowing.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: You want me to help you get the
dialog: details of my husband’s work?
text: Rosen's sudden smile seems forced.
speaker_heading: . ROSEN
dialog: John thinks I’m a russian spy. Is
dialog: that what you think?
text: Alicia is silent. Holds Rosen’s eyes.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: You called me, Alicia. You knew
dialog: something was wrong.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 72
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: He wasn’t sleeping. I wanted someone
dialog: to talk with him. Zweifel recommend-
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: So your Mr. Zweifel, is he part of
dialog: this conspiracy as well?
text: Alicia stares at him a beat. Unsure. Then...
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: This was all a mistake. He’s just
dialog: over-tired. I’ll take him home now.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: Alicia, no one wants someone they
dialog: love to be sick.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: What I want is my husband released.
text: She’s growing agitated. Rosen's smile is full of compassion.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: John’s been given something to
dialog: sleep. Come back in the morning.
dialog: Nine AM-.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: I’m not leaving him here.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: He attacked me. I've committed him
dialog: Alicia. It's not up to you anymore.
text: She stares at him, fighting back the fear.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: After you’ve had a good night’s
dialog: rest, if we still can't agree on
dialog: what’s best for John I’l1ll release
dialog: him into your custody.
text: Alicia stares at him. Nowhere to go. Finally...
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: Nine. And I want him ready to leave.

speaker_heading: ZWEIFEL
dialog: Alicia-.

speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: You better come inside.
scene_heading: INT.-MIT RAND-NASH’S OFFICE

speaker_heading: FOX

speaker_heading: ZWEIFEL
dialog: But not likely. Lately he seemed
text: more and more agitated. Then, when
dialog: you called...
speaker_heading: ALICIA

text: FOX-CLOSE. His frown is inscrutable.
scene_heading: EXT. -MCLEAN-GARDENS -MORNING-WALKING
text: Crisp. Sunny. John and Rosen walk, John’s hands bound before him.
text: A burly ORDERLY paces them, a few feet behind. Patients mill.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: You seem calmer this morning, John.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Well it seems obvious by now that
dialog: you're not going to kill me. You can
dialog: imagine that’s a load off my mind.
text: Rosen can’t help but smile.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: ° You still think I'm a Russian spy?
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: You still want to pretend you're
dialog: not?
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: You are a rational man. Let me
dialog: appeal to your rationality. Why do
dialog: you think I didn’t see Charles and
dialog: Marcee in my office?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 77
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: I think you did see them. I think
dialog: this is all some kind of attempt to
dialog: brainwash me.
speaker_heading: , ROSEN
dialog: And why would I want to do that?
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: To break me. To find out what I
dialog: know.
text: Rosen nods. He doesn’t seem surprised.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: So Charles and Marcee, they are part
dialog: of this conspiracy too?
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: You must have recruited him. Maybe
dialog: you threatened Marcee.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: And your wife. She phoned me. Is she
dialog: part of this as well?
text: John stumbles a beat. Then recovers.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: My behavior must have seemed erratic
text: to her. She’s confused.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: Is she, John? Or is it possible that
dialog: you're confused?
text: Rosen motions across the courtyard. A white haired man stands in a
text: corner, gesturing angrily, TALKING to thin air.
speaker_heading: - ROSEN (OVER)
dialog: For years people have referred to
dialog: madness as being without reason. But
dialog: that isn’t true. That fellow is as
dialog: reasonable as you or I.
text: The white haired man begins to plead and SHOUT.
speaker_heading: ROSEN (OVER)
dialog: We simply cannot see his reason. We
text: cannot see the invisible adversary
dialog: who makes him so angry. But he can,
dialog: as clear as he sees you or I.
dialog: 
dialog: 78
dialog: 
text: Rosen stops, puts his hand on John’s arm.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: Look back on the times with Charles
dialog: and Marcee.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: I won't play this game with you.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: Is it possible that, like him, you
dialog: were really alone?
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: I won't indulge this.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: John, insulin shock has been known
dialog: to reduce schizophrenic delusions.
text: John stops, anger flashing in his eyes.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: The other shoe falls. What do you
dialog: want to give me? Sodium pentothal?
speaker_heading: — ROSEN
dialog: Just insula-
text: John knocks Rosen’s hand away with his bound wrists. Despite his
text: spiking temper, John seems almost relieved.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Spacebo, Comrade Rosen. I told you,
dialog: I don’t know anything. I’m just a
dialog: code breaker.
dialog: (voice rising)
dialog: But if this means an end to this
dialog: goddamned charade, then come on.
dialog: Drug me.
text: The Orderly has moved in. John spins to face the man.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Come on!
text: But Rosen stops the Orderly with a gesture. Turns to face Nash.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: John, treatment only works if you
dialog: fi want to get well. I won’t give you
dialog: ‘ the medication until you ask for it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 79
text: This turn seems to throw John. His expression darkens.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: This is insane.
text: Rosen’s expression is sad.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: Yes, John. I’m afraid it is.
scene_heading: EXT.-CAMBRIDGE STREET-DAY
text: Alicia is walking up a familiar street. She stops, looks up.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE...
scene_heading: EXT.-CAMBRIDGE STREET-MANSION-DAY
dialog: The same house we’ve seen before. And terribly different. Broken
text: windows. Dilapidated side boards. Long ago deserted.
text: Alicia walks to the front gate. The remains of an aging lock pad
text: hangs by wires. Broken. She pushes the gate, CREAKING, open.
scene_heading: EXT.-CAMBRIDGE MANSION-DAY
text: An old mailbox sits ahead. A rusting pad lock hangs at its base.
text: Alicia looks up at the empty house. Then she lifts a large rock and
text: begins HAMMERING away at the lock, face set with determination.
scene_heading: INT.-MCLEAN-NASH’S CELL-DAY
text: Nash sits alone in his cell. Spread out before him are documents
text: from Princeton. His housing form. A class list.
text: HOLD on John as he stares at the documentation. A beat. Is that a
dialog: crack in his resolve?
text: Then he wipes the materials onto the floor, angry. Draws his knees
text: up to his chin and sits, face fixed once again with determination.
scene_heading: INT.-MCLEAN-COMMON ROOM-EVENING
text: Alicia sits alone, uncomfortable. Other patients occupy other
text: tables. Many wear the vacant stares of the damned. Alicia’s eyes go
text: to an opening door.
text: John ENTERS, escorted by two Orderlies. He sits at the long table
text: across from her. The Orderlies retire to a table not far off.
text: Alicia reaches across and takes his hands, holds them in hers. The
text: pain on her face is palpable.
dialog: 
dialog: a
dialog: 
text: Folks in the room stare. Nash sits back,
text: herself. Takes a breath.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: John, I’m so sorry.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: At first, I thought you were one of
dialog: them. But I’ve been thinking about
dialog: it. They used you, Alicia. Of course
dialog: I must have looked mad to you.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: I was so worried.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: It’s going to be all right. But we
dialog: have to speak quietly. They may be
text: listening. There may be microphones.
text: Alicia bites her lip, tries not to react.
speaker_heading: NASE
dialog: I’m going to tell you everything,
dialog: now. I’m breaking protocol. But
dialog: you've got to know. You’ve got to
dialog: help me get out of here.
text: John rubs his wrist.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Damn implant.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I've been doing top secret work for
dialog: the government. There’s a threat of
dialog: catastrophic proportions. I think
dialog: the Reds must think I’m too high
dialog: profile to simply do away with. So
dialog: they’re trying to keep me here. So I
dialog: can’t do my work.
text: Alicia is staring at him, fighting back the tears.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Go to RAND. You’ve got to get in
dialog: touch with William Parcher. He can-
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: (too loud)
dialog: Stop! Just stop!
speaker_heading: B80

speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: John, I've been to RAND. There is no

speaker_heading: NASH .
dialog: Of course there is. I’ve been
dialog: working for him. I‘ve been-
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: What, John? Breaking codes? Dropping
text: them in a secret mailbox for the
dialog: government to pick up.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: How could you...?
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: Fox followed you one night. He
dialog: thought it was harmless. Loyal Fox.
text: Rlicia has reached into her bag. Lifts something onto the table.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: None of its been real, John.
text: And with that, she deposits on the table a stack of gray RAND
text: envelopes. All still sealed with John’s seal.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: They’ve never been opened.
text: John tears one open. Inside, his pages of code. His marked maps.
dialog: Never picked up. Never seen by anyone.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: There is no William. There is no
dialog: conspiracy. It’s all in your mind.
dialog: You're sick, John. Don’t you
dialog: understand, you’re sick.
text: Alicia begins to cry, the tears coming now, streaming down her
text: cheeks. Finally she bows to John’s hand on the table, pressing her
text: cheek to the back of his palm, body racked with trembling SOBS.
text: HOLD on John as he looks from his weeping wife to his work. He
text: lifts a torn magazine page, marked and scrawled.
text: HOLD on John. On his face, for the first time, fear.
scene_heading: INT.-MCLEAN-ROSEN’S OFFICE-NIGHT
text: Rosen sits over his desk. The door opens and a NURSE ENTERS.
dialog:

speaker_heading: NURSE
text: Doctor. It’s Nash. Code red.
text: Rosen is up fast.
scene_heading: INT.-MCLEAN-NASH’S CELL-NIGHT
text: Rosen UNLOCKS Nash’s cell and ENTERS to find Nash, his back to the
text: door, standing in a pool of blood.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: John?
text: Nash turns, holding his wrist in his hand. Blood is spilling
text: through his fingers.
text: As Rosen gently takes John’s hand he notices a brad from under the
text: mattress frame, torn free and bloody on the floor.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: There's nothing there.
text: The flesh on top of John’s wrist has been gouged away, almost to
text: the bone. The Nurse hands Rosen a wad of gauze. Rosen begins to
text: dress the wound. John is crying.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: There’s no implant. There’s nothing
dialog: there.
scene_heading: INT. -MCLEAN-TREATMENT ROOM-DAY
text: Small. A single gurney sits in the middle of the floor. A NURSE
text: stands by a silver medical table.
text: The door opens. Nash shuffles in wearing hospital clothes and paper
text: slippers. He sits on the gurney. Draws up his legs and arms.
scene_heading: INT. -MCLEAN-OBSERVATION ROOM-DAY
text: Rosen and Alicia watch through a plexi window.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: This, right now, is the final
dialog: nightmare of schizophrenia. The
dialog: horror of not knowing what is true,
dialog: what is real and what isn’t.
text: Leather restraints are pulled tight around his wrists and ankles,
text: his forehead.
dialog: 
dialog: 83
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: Imagine if you suddenly learned that
dialog: the people, the places, the moments
dialog: most important to you were not gone,
dialog: not dead, no, worse, had never been.
text: The Nurse places a plastic bit in his mouth. Lifts the hypo.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: What kind of hell would that be?
text: Alicia touches the divide as the Nurse swabs John’s arm, locks to
text: Rosen for the nod. She puts needle to flesh. Alicia turns away.
scene_heading: INT, -TREATMENT ROOM
text: See Nash as his body arches into the agony of insulin shock, eyes
text: rolling up, SCREAMING through the bit as we PULL BACK AND UP...
scene_heading: EXT.-MCLEAN-HIGH ANGLE

scene_heading: EXT. - LAWN- PRINCETON-SPRING

speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: Two a week. For six months. The

text: in the distance.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: The doctor thought a change of

dialog: RAND terminated his contract-
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: zZweifel and I tried to-

text: She looks off,
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: You can’t very well have a madman
dialog: keeping government secrets, can you?
text: gaze going well past the visible horizon.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: You'd be surprised how many people
dialog: don’t want crazy in their lives.
text: Fox wants to speak, he just doesn’t know what to say.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: John always spoke so fondly of
dialog: Princeton. I thought, maybe being
text: here, near familiar surroundings...
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Alicia, how are you?
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: The delusions have passed.’ I see
dialog: pictures of the Jews from Europe.
text: They have this look in their eyes.
text: Hard and stunned at the same time.
dialog: Like they’re trying to find an
dialog: entire world that’s been stolen out
dialog: from under them. That’s John too, I
dialog: think. Lost.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: E
text: There is definitely about her an odd feeling, both strong and
text: fragile, like giant plates of shifting ice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: No, Alicia. How are you?
text: For a moment she seems not to be able to even understand the
dialog: question. Then...
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: You know Heisenberg’s uncertainty
dialog: principle?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: The properties of the object are
text: influenced by the observer.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Often what I feel is obligation, or
dialog: guilt over wanting to leave, or
dialog: rage, against John, against God. But
text: then I look at him and I force
dialog: myself to see the man I married. And
dialog: he becomes that man. He's
dialog: ae, transformed into someone I love. And
dialog: then I'm transformed into someone
dialog: who loves him. It’s not all the
dialog: time. But it’s enough.
text: Fox walks on, amazed at this woman.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: John is a lucky man.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: And so unlucky.
scene_heading: EXT.-NASH HOUSE-PRINCETON-DAY
text: Nash sits on the porch swing, staring at a pad of equations, pen in

speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Hey, Chief.

speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Jesus, John.

text: She kisses him on the head and leaves them again.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Well, I must say it’s nice to know
dialog: you were real.
text: He swallows the pills, takes a long drink.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Zweifel wanted to come but...
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Squeamish?
dialog: (off Fox’s shrug)
dialog: I suppose I would be too. But alas,
dialog: I'm stuck with me.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Ah, I know that feeling.

speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: - Have you been to. campus? Milnor’s
dialog: running the math department.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: God, don’t tell him what happened to

speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I’ve missed you, John.
text: Nash seems sincerely puzzled.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 87
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Why?
text: Fox finds his answer blocked by a lump in his throat, looks away.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: I've been working on solving the
dialog: Riemann Hypothesis...
text: Nash slides his pad over to Fox.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: If I dazzle them, they’1l have to
dialog: reinstate me. But the medication
dialog: makes me blurry.
text: Fox's smile tries to hide the fact that Nash’s calculations don’t
text: seem to make much sense. He slides back the pad.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: There are other things beside work.
text: John stares at him.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: What are they?
dialog: {taps his temple)
dialog: This is who I was.
scene_heading: INT.-NASH HOUSE-KITCHEN-NIGHT
text: Alicia is doing the dishes. John stands staring at the kitchen

speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: (turning off the tap)
dialog: Is everything all right, John?
speaker_heading: NASE
dialog: What do people do?
text: By Alicia’s expression, this question is not coming for the first

speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: This. Just this.

dialog: No conspiracies. No earth shattering
dialog: discoveries. Just this.

speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Everything is so meaningless.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: It’s life, John. Activities

speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: What do I do now?
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: You could take out the garbage.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: World famous mathematician turned

dialog: that’s something.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: There you go. Onward and upward.
text: He lifts the trash bag, walks out the kitchen door. Alicia begins

text: ALICIA-CLOSE. Terrified. She spins as John re-enters.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: Who were you talking to?
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: The garbage man.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: Garbage men don’t come at night.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: I guess here they do.

speaker_heading: ALICIA

scene_heading: INT. -SUN "PORCH-DAY
text: Nash sits over his pad. He stares out the picture window. Then

text: Nash presses his pencil into the paper, crushing through the lead,
text: Zinally SNAPPING the hilt.
scene_heading: INT.-NASH BEDROOM-NIGHT
text: John lays on his back, Alicia curled beside him. Spring moonlight
text: pours in through the open window.
text: Alicia kisses his neck tentatively, then his face. John lies still
text: as a statue. He tilts his head away, strokes her head platonically.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: I'm sorry. The medication...
text: Alicia surrenders, sliding back down and laying on his chest. HOLD
text: on her face, sad eyes open in the moonlight.
scene_heading: INT.-NASH LIVING ROOM-AFTERNOON
text: John stands. with his SCREAMING baby in his arms. He seems entirely
text: unsure how to handle this unwieldy little human.
text: Alicia comes in from the kitchen. She SLAMS John’s medication and
text: water glass on the table.
text: Then she scoops up her child in one hand, retrieves the fallen
text: pacifier from the floor with the other.
text: She feeds their son the binky, the child’s CRIES instantly stilled.
text: Alicia exits with the baby. John stands in the middle of the room,
text: sad, helpless. No good at real life. He stares down at his pills.
scene_heading: INT.-NASH KITCHEN-SUNSET
text: Alicia stands staring into the mirror. She begins fixing her hair,
text: finding several streaks of premature grey.
text: Her fingers drift down to her cheek, trace the lines there. HOLD on

dialog: 
dialog: 90
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT.-NASH HOUSE-NIGHT

text: John sits at his desk, staring at the pills and water before him.
text: A beat. Theri he opens a drawer.
text: INSIDE THE DRAWER. Maybe five days worth of his pills. Not taken.
text: John drops the two new tablets inside. Closes the drawer.
text: Nash looks at his desk. Piles of unopened mail. Several math
text: journals. He notices a New York Times. He opens the paper.
text: NASH-POV. Columns of articles. Suddenly the text goes black,

speaker_heading: NASH

scene_heading: EXT.-NASH EOUSE-FOREST-NIGHT

speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Hello?
text: (OVER) ANOTHER RUSTLING. Nash spins to his right to glimpse another
text: darting shadow, vanishing into the night.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Who’s there?
text: That’s when John is grabbed from behind. His arms are pulled
text: backwards in restraint as a figure steps out of the darkness.
text: Hat and trench coat make him little more than an elegant shadow. As

dialog: Parcher.
speaker_heading: PARCHER
dialog: It’s good to see you, John.

speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: (finally)
dialog: You're not real.

speaker_heading: PARCHER

speaker_heading: PARCHER

scene_heading: INT.-TOOL SHED-NIGHT

speaker_heading: PARCHER

speaker_heading: PARCHER
dialog: Rosen? That quack? Schizophrenic
dialog: break from reality, right? Inability

speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: RAND has no record of you...
speaker_heading: PARCHER
dialog: Do you think we list our personnel?
text: John just stares at him.
speaker_heading: PARCHER
dialog: I’m sorry you had to go through
dialog: this. Your stay at Mclean must have
dialog: been...disorienting. Your wife meant
dialog: well, I’m sure. Your actions must
dialog: have looked quite bizarre to her. We
dialog: had no idea she’d go ahead and have
dialog: you institutionalized. But once she
dialog: did.... You were calling attention
dialog: to yourself. I thought it best you
dialog: stay put until the scrutiny passed.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: But Charles and Marcee....
speaker_heading: PARCHER
dialog: After your lecture, our operatives
dialog: approached Charles. We needed
dialog: someone to keep an eye on you.
dialog: Someone you would trust. He’s turned
dialog: out to be quite good, actually. If

speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: This is just a problem. I have to

dialog: I can't feel my Greams as deeply as

dialog: creates those too...
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: Are you saying that’s why you're
dialog: sick or because your sick?
text: But Nash isn’t listening.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: What if I buried myself in people?
dialog: In places? In the every day? Sank

scene_heading: INT.-NASH BEDROOM-NIGHT

speaker_heading: STUDENT
dialog: Freak.

scene_heading: EXT.-GAMES QUAD-DAY

scene_heading: INT. -LIBRARY-1970'S
text: Nash finishes writing on the pane. The symbols are now orderly,

speaker_heading: STUDENT
dialog: It’s all I want. To be like you.
dialog: Come up with something totally
dialog: original, you know?
text: John looks at this boy, the ambition in his eyes. So bright, so
text: familiar. The kid slides his notebook towards Nash.
speaker_heading: STUDENT
dialog: Maybe you'd take a look...
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: When was the last time you ate?
dialog: 
text: The boy stares at him blankly.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: You know, food?
text: Nash closes the boy’s notebook. Reaches into his brown paper lunch
text: bag and removes a sandwich.
speaker_heading: NASH
text: The woman loves mayonnaise.
text: He slides half his sandwich across. Pats the chair next to him.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: - Why don’t you tell me how you're

speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: I was thinking I might teach.
speaker_heading: MILNOR
dialog: You‘re a terrible teacher, John.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Details, details.
text: Milnor stares at him.
speaker_heading: MILNOR
dialog: What about, you know... Are they
dialog: gone?
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Oh no, they’re not gone. Maybe
dialog: they’1l never be.
text: Sitting across the path are Charles, William and
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: But I’ve gotten used tc ignoring
dialog: them. And I think, as a result,
dialog: they’ve kind of given up on me. Do
dialog: you think that’s the way it is with
dialog: our dreams and our nightmares? That
dialog: we have to keep feeding them for
dialog: them to stay alive?
speaker_heading: MILNOR
dialog: But they haunt you?
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: They're my past, Martin. Everybody's
text: haunted by their past.
text: Milnor looks up. Shapely, Fox and Zweifel race past. All young. He
text: looks back at Nash and the cool autumn day is empty once more.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Do you understand?
speaker_heading: ——

speaker_heading: MILNOR
dialog: Maybe. Almost.
text: A beat. Then Jchn stands.
speaker_heading: NASH

speaker_heading: MILNOR
dialog: I‘ll talk to the department. Maybe

speaker_heading: MILNOR

scene_heading: EXT.-NASH HOUSE-TWILIGHT

scene_heading: INT.-NASH HOUSE-TWILIGHT

text: The door opens and Alicia ENTERS. Looks around. The phone receiver

speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: Oh God, John, no. I’m so sorry.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: And I thought, what if I suddenly
dialog: wake up in a cell and you’re the

dialog: again and I can’t hold on?
text: She stares at him, eyes sparkling in the moonlight.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: But you held on.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: I held on.
text: He turns to face her, to look right into her eyes.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Because none of that felt as real,
dialog: as the chance of losing you.

speaker_heading: - ALICIA

speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: No. Just stars.
speaker_heading: ALICIA

speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: I can do this. They’re only kids,
dialog: right? What can they do to me. Write

dialog: walls. How bad could it be?
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Horrible. It could be horrible.
text: From this angle John might be talking to himself. PULL BACK TO
text: REVEAL he’s not alone. Alicia is standing behind him.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: (hands to his chest)
dialog: Oh no. Where’s-
text: His face is suddenly child-like with panic. She reaches into her

text: she folds and places in his pocket.
text: He smiles at her.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Thanks.
text: He turns and heads into the classroom. Alicia stares at him through
text: the door as the kids settle.
scene_heading: INT. - CLASSROOM-DAY - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: When I was a student here, they used
dialog: to say you had to be certifiable to

text: John’s smile is brilliant.
speaker_heading: NASH :
dialog: Now it seems you just have to be
dialog: certifiable to teach it.
text: The kids BREAK out in LAUGHTER, the tension broken.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: My name is John Nash. And I am going

scene_heading: INT.-PRINCETON-FINE HALL-1990's
text: THE DOOR swings open. Nash emerges amidst a gaggle of students. His

speaker_heading: MAN (OVER)
dialog: Professor Nash?
text: A MAN is standing by the doorway. This is HOWARD KUHN. Nash’s smile
text: is polite, but vaguely puzzled. Turns to one of his students.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Do you see him?
text: The student nods.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: You'll ‘forgive me. I’m always
dialog: suspicious of new people. .
text: Although Kuhn is puzzled, the students seem to take it in stride.
dialog: They just like this guy.
speaker_heading: STUDENT
dialog: See you next week, Professor.
text: Nash watches them go, smiling, paternal.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: I have a son that age. Harvard.
dialog: (rolls his eyes)
dialog: So, now that you are real, who are

scene_heading: INT.-FINE HALL-WALKING-MINUTES LATER
text: Nash and Kuhn walk. Students who pass greet Nash.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: I’m sorry. I’m just a bit stunned.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 122
speaker_heading: KUHN
dialog: Over the last ten years your
dialog: bargaining equilibria has become a
dialog: foundation of modern economics.
text: They have come to a familiar doorway. It’s the faculty lounge.
text: High Tea is in progress. The formal dress is gone. The students are
text: ‘multi-national, the waiters women. But the ritual is the same.
speaker_heading: KUHN
dialog: Shall we have some tea?
text: Nash stares through the door a long beat. When he looks back at
text: Kuhn, his eyes are sad.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: I’m not formally a member of the
dialog: department. I...
text: There is a tragic tenderness to his expression, an acknowledgement
dialog: of all that has been lost to time.
speaker_heading: KUHN
dialog: I guest lectured here before the
dialog: war. I‘m sure it will be all right.
text: He puts his hand on the small of John’s back. John looks at him
text: warily and then, finally, steps over the threshold.
scene_heading: INT.-FINE HALL-MATH FACULTY LOUNGE-DAY
text: Nash and Kuhn sit across from each other. A young girl serves them
text: tea from a silver service. Nash smiles at her.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Things have changed.
text: The sentence seems to resonate more deeply to him than he had
text: intended as it rolls off his lips. He grows pensive a beat. Then...
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: I thought the nominations for the
dialog: Nobel Prize were secret. I thought
dialog: you only knew if you won or lost.
speaker_heading: KUHN
dialog: That is generally the case, yes. But
dialog: these are special circumstances. The
dialog: awards are substantial. They require
dialog: private funding. As such, the image
dialog: of the Nobel is quite important...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 123
text: Kuhn stops a beat. Takes a sip of tea.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: So you came here to see if I was
dialog: crazy. To see if I'd = screw
dialog: everything up if I actually won.
dialog: Maybe dance at the podium or strip
text: naked and squawk like a chicken.
text: It’s Nash's tone that put’s Kuhn at ease.
speaker_heading: KUHN
dialog: Something like that, yes.
text: Nash stops, stares off. Then...
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Would I embarrass you? Yes, 1!
dialog: suppose it’s possible. You see, I am
dialog: crazy. I am dependant on the newer
dialog: medications. I still see things that
dialog: are not here. But I choose to ignore
dialog: them. Like a diet of the mind. I do
dialog: not indulge certain appetites. My
dialog: appetite for patterns. And perhaps
dialog: my appetite to imagine, even to
dialog: dream. I have lost much. But...
text: He opens his hands.
speaker_heading: STUDENT
dialog: Professor Nash?
text: John looks up. A young faculty member is staring at him. He reaches
text: into his pocket, lays something down in front of him. It’s his pen.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Another teacher stands behind him. He too lays his pen down before -
text: Nash. And now everyone in the room is rising, coming to him, laying
text: their pens down, one after another in a growing tribute to a
dialog: lifetime of accomplishment.
speaker_heading: KUHN
dialog: What...?
text: The pens keep coming. Nash opens his mouth to answer. But he can’t,
text: eyes suddenly flooding with tears for this journey taken so very
dialog: far.

text: Hundreds sit watching, as camera flashbulbs finally cease.
text: But Nash just stands there. A long beat. And even longer.
text: KUHN-CLOSE. In the audience. Concerned.
text: ALICIA-CLOSE. In the front row. Starting to worry.
text: BACK TO NASH. Still standing there. See what he sees. Hundreds of
text: faces staring back at him. Finally, just when all seems lost...
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Thank you. Thank you for your
dialog: patience.
text: But he’s not looking at the speech before him. He’s not looking at
text: the Audience. He’s looking only at Alicia.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: I have always believed in numbers.
dialog: In the equations and logics that
dialog: lead to reason. I was wrong. It is
dialog: only in the mysterious equations of
dialog: love that any logic or reason can be
dialog: found. Perhaps it is good to have a
dialog: beautiful mind. But a better gift is
text: to discover a beautiful heart.
text: And suddenly there is no one else in the room but the two of them,
text: Nash’s magical vision revealing the patterns of the heart.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Thank you for your belief in me
dialog: after so many years. You are the
dialog: reason I am here today.
text: Nash reaches into his breast pocket and takes out something
text: familiar. It’s her rose embroidered handkerchief.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: You are the reason I am.
text: And with that he tucks the handkerchief in his suit pocket.
speaker_heading: NASH

text: ALICIA-CLOSE. CLAPS as hard as the rest, full of love and pride.
text: John just Stands on stage. Taking it all in. Then, finally, he
text: bows, folks APPLAUDING even so loud that Nash can’t stifle a LAUGH.
scene_heading: INT.-ROYAL SWEDISH ACADEMY-COCKTAIL RECEPTION
text: John stands with Alicia and amidst the dwindling well wishers.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: Time to go?
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Yes, please.
text: He helps her on with her wrap. That’s when he sees them, standing
text: by the door. Three familiar figures. Charles, Marcee and William.
text: Then William does something odd. He gives Nash a small salute.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: What is it? What’s wrong?
text: He turns to his wife. His smile is long in coming, but when it
text: comes, it melts the worry on his face along with our hearts.
speaker_heading: NASH
dialog: Nothing. Nothing at all.
