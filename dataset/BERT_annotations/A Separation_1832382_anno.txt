speaker_heading: JUDGE (0.S.)
dialog: Madame, the things you are
dialog: saying are not reasons with
dialog: which you can file for a
dialog: divorce, unless there is
dialog: something else.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: JUDGE (0.S.)
dialog: Like if he is an addict,
dialog: physically abuses you or does
dialog: not give you an allowance.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: No, he is not an addict. On the
dialog: contrary, he is a good, decent
dialog: person...
speaker_heading: JUDGE (0.S.)
dialog: Then why do you want a divorce?
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: Because he won't come with me.
dialog: If he does I'll drop my case
dialog: for a divorce...
dialog: (to Nader)
dialog: Will you come?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: No, I won’t. If it’s important
dialog: for her to leave, she can.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: Your honor, ask him why he
dialog: won’t, why he doesn’t want to
dialog: come?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: (to Simin)
dialog: You know why.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: No I don’t.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: (to the Judge)
dialog: Let her give me one reason to
dialog: convince me why we should move
dialog: abroad in these circumstances.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: You give me one reason why we
dialog: should stay.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: (to Simin)
dialog: I‘1l give you a thousand. The
dialog: first one is I can’t leave my
dialog: father.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: But you can leave your wife?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: You brought me here! You filed
dialog: for a divorce! When did I leave
dialog: you?!
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: Didn’t you just say she can
dialog: leave if she wants to?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Yes and I'll say it again. When
dialog: you don't want to live with me...
dialog: I didn’t get you by force and
dialog: I’m not going to keep you by
dialog: force.. One day you came to live
dialog: with me. Today you don’t want
dialog: to.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: Your honor, his excuse is his
dialog: father’s illness.. His father
dialog: has Alzheimer’s. He doesn’t
dialog: even know that his son is
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: You think he doesn’t know.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: Does he?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Yes I feel that he does.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: It makes no difference to him,
dialog: whether it is you that is with
text: him or a stranger. He doesn’t
dialog: even know that you are his son.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: But I know that he is my dad.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: Doesn’t your daughter’s future
dialog: matter to you?
speaker_heading: JUDGE (0.S.)
dialog: (to Simin)
dialog: So all the children living in
dialog: this country don’t have a
dialog: future?
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: As a mother I prefer that she
dialog: not grow up in these
dialog: circumstances. Can I have this
dialog: right as a mother?
speaker_heading: JUDGE (0.S.)
dialog: What circumstances?
text: Simin falls silent.
speaker_heading: JUDGE (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Is your child better off here
dialog: with both her parents or there
dialog: without a father?
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: That’s why I am insisting that
dialog: he also come with us.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: I am not in a position to
dialog: leave.
text: There’s a brief silence between Nader and Simin who do not
text: even look at each other.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: (to the Judge)
dialog: What should we do now?
speaker_heading: JUDGE (0.S.)
dialog: Nothing. Go back to your lives.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: If we could, I wouldn’t file
dialog: for a divorce.
speaker_heading: JUDGE (0.S.)
dialog: You can have a divorce only if
dialog: he agrees to grant you one.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: He just said that he agrees.
dialog: (to Nader)
dialog: Didn’t you say you agree to a
dialog: divorce?
speaker_heading: JUDGE (0.S.)
dialog: (to Nader)
dialog: Are you willing to grant her a
dialog: divorce?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: If she prefers going abroad to
dialog: live to her husband and child,
dialog: then I have no objection to a
dialog: divorce.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: (to Nader)
dialog: What does “you prefer” mean?
dialog: (to the Judge)
dialog: Your honor please look at these
dialog: documents.
text: Simin shows the paperwork she is holding to the judge.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: Your honor after 18 months of
dialog: running around and expenses, we
dialog: got our residency. It has been
dialog: six months now and it will
dialog: expire in 40 days. Why should
dialog: we...
speaker_heading: JUDGE (0.S.)
dialog: Like I said, this is your
dialog: personal problem. For a
dialog: divorce, you need his consent.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: If he consents to a divorce,
dialog: what happens to my daughter?
speaker_heading: JUDGE (0.S.)
dialog: You have to agree on
dialog: everything. How old is your
dialog: daughter?
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: She’1l be eleven in two weeks.
speaker_heading: JUDGE (0.S.)
dialog: She can only come with you if
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: her father gives his
dialog: permission. If he doesn’t t
dialog: she can’t leave.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: He won’t give his permissio:
dialog: He knows I will not leave
dialog: without my daughter.
speaker_heading: JUDGE (0.S.)
dialog: That’s between you two. Goo

text: guard and slaps him hard. Nader holds Hojjat’s hand to stop
text: him from hitting him again. Azam tries to stop Hojjat who
text: is no longer in control. Simin stands in front of Nader to
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 61
text: stop Hojjat from hitting him. Other people surround them.
text: One of Hojjat’s blows strikes Simin’s face and nose. Nader
text: pushes Hojjat back and defends Simin. People take Hojjat to
text: the side. Hojjat yells and curses.
speaker_heading: AZAM
dialog: (yelling at Nader)
dialog: Why in God’s name did you come
dialog: here?
text: Worried, Simin takes Nader to another side. Nader doesn’t
text: object and sits down in a corner. His shirt is torn.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: Don’t sit here. Let’s go. Get
dialog: up...
text: Nader looks up and sees Simin bleeding from her nose.
scene_heading: INT. NADER’S CAR — EXT. STREET — NIGHT
text: Nader is behind the wheel with a disheveled look. Simin is
text: sitting in the passenger side seat with her head tilted
text: back. She is lightly bruised under her eyes. She is holding
text: a napkin to her nose.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Do you want me to push back you
dialog: chair?
text: Simin shakes her head to imply no.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: I’1l take you home and then
dialog: I’1l go get Dad and Termeh.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: What do you mean no?! You want
dialog: to go to your parents’ in your
dialog: state?!
text: Simin doesn’t respond.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: 62
dialog: It’s over. You’re coming back
dialog: home tonight.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: I don’t want to.
text: Nader is shocked at her response and doesn’t continue the
dialog: discussion.
scene_heading: INT. COURTHOUSE — CORRIDORS — DAY
text: In the busy and crowded corridors of the courthouse, Nader
text: is in search of the branch he has been summoned to. He is
text: holding a piece of paper in his hand. Among the many faces
text: seated in the corridor, he spots Somayeh, Razieh’s
text: daughter, sitting by herself. She is absorbed by the people
text: in handcuffs or in prison uniforms. Through a partially
text: opened door, Nader spots Hojjat who is busy speaking to the
text: examining magistrate’s assistant. A few feet behind him, is
text: Razieh standing next to the door. Nader waits for them to
text: finish and come out before going inside. Now Somayeh sees
text: Nader. She doesn’t know whether she should say hello or
text: ignore him. Nader is looking at her kindly. Hojjat and
text: Razieh come out of the room. They are not expecting to see
text: Nader. They pass each other without any kind of exchange.
text: Razieh still looks pale and sickly. Nader goes in. Hojjat
text: looks at Nader hatefully. Razieh takes her daughter’s hand
text: and walk towards the door to leave but it seems like Hojjat
dialog: wants to stay.
scene_heading: INT. EXAMINING MAGISTRATE’S ROOM — DAY
text: In a room with a window, which opens to the crowded
text: courtyard of the courthouse, Hojjat and Razieh are seated
text: on chairs opposite the examining magistrate’s desk. Nader
text: is seated two chairs over. Between them is an empty chair.
text: The door is ajar and the people and the traffic from the
text: room next door are heard. The secretary who is a young man
text: is seated behind another desk and is on the phone. The
text: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE makes notes according to their
dialog: answers.
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: So.. Mr. Hojjat Samadi and Ms.
dialog: Razieh...
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: Asnaghi.
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: Is that you ma’am?
speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: And you are Mr. Nader Lavasani..
dialog: (to Razieh)
dialog: Okay so what’s your complaint?
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: May I speak?
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: You filed a joint complaint.
dialog: Either of you may speak.
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: My wife was working in this
dialog: man’s home. Without my
dialog: permission of course. This man
text: accuses her of stealing. He
text: pushes her down the stairs and
dialog: she falls and loses my child.
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: Do you have the medical
dialog: examiner’s report?
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: It’s on your desk.
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: On what date was this?
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: What date was Wednesday?
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: (to Nader)
dialog: You heard the accusation? Do
dialog: you accept the charge? What is
dialog: your defense?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: (upset)
dialog: 63
dialog: 64
dialog: I am sorry, when I heard I was
dialog: very upset. I got up and went
dialog: to the hospital.
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: Then you accept that you did
dialog: this?
dialog: (pointing to the
dialog: medical examiner's
dialog: report and to
dialog: Hojjat)
dialog: Did you get this on that day
dialog: from the medical examiner’s
dialog: office?
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: That night we went to the
dialog: hospital. We took the hospital
dialog: file to the medical examiner's
dialog: office.
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: (reading from the
dialog: report)
dialog: Four and a half months... male...
dialog: (to Nader)
dialog: Well, explain.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: I accept that I was a little
dialog: too harsh with her.
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: What is harsh? Did you push
dialog: this lady?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: I didn’t push her. I tried to
dialog: get her out of the house.
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: Look sir. Please be clear.
dialog: You've been charged with
text: manslaughter. The fetus was at
dialog: four-and-a-half months and
dialog: counts as a complete human
dialog: adult.
dialog: 65
text: Nader is completely shocked at the magistrate’s words.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: I didn’t approach her with the
dialog: intent of pushing her.. I wanted
dialog: her to leave so that I could
dialog: close the door to my house.
speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: You didn’t push me?!
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: Ma’am, please.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: If I knew she were pregnant, I
dialog: wouldn’t even try to get her
dialog: out of the house like that. I
dialog: just wanted her to leave.
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: Ma’am Do you agree with his
dialog: explanation?
speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: He didn’t push me. He grabbed
dialog: me here and threw me out and I
text: fell on the stairs.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: I didn’t throw her. Like I said
dialog: I wanted to get her to leave my
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: You jerk, who gets a pregnant
dialog: woman to leave their house this
dialog: way?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: I didn’t know she was pregnant.
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: Why are you lying?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: 66
dialog: I found out at the hospital.
speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: Your honor, you’re like an
dialog: older brother to me, can't
dialog: everyone tell from the
text: appearance and body of a woman
dialog: that she is pregnant...
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: 4 to 5 months pregnant.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: When did I even have a chance
dialog: to see you? I was already gone
dialog: or leaving when you'd arrive.
dialog: When I’d come back in the
dialog: afternoon, you always had your
text: chador on and were leaving. In
dialog: fact whenever I’d see you, you
dialog: always looked like this with
dialog: the chador. How would I know
dialog: you...
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: (to Razieh)
dialog: He can claim that he couldn’t
dialog: tell from your appearance.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Besides, your honor, I would
dialog: never think that a pregnant
dialog: woman would apply for this kind
dialog: of work.
speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: Your honor, I spoke of my
text: pregnancy in front of him, his
dialog: daughter and her private tutor
text: who comes to their house. They
dialog: all heard it.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: When? I don’t remember.
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: No of course you wouldn't
dialog: remember.
dialog: 67
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Anyway, the issue isn't that I
dialog: knew or not.
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: Yes it is! If it’s proven that
dialog: you knew, the court can
dialog: sentence you to 1 to 3 years in
dialog: prison... Well?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: I didn’t know.
speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: His daughter’s tutor can
dialog: testify. Let her come in and
dialog: say that he didn’t hear me.
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: Can she come in tomorrow?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Your honor, I don’t want her or
dialog: the school involved. That’s not
dialog: good for my child.
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: (angry)
dialog: You trash. You’ve killed my
dialog: child. It's bad for your child?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Don’t insult me.
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: (a bit more calm)
dialog: Your child is human but ours
dialog: was an animal?
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: (to Hojjat)
dialog: Don't insult.
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: Am I insulting or he who took
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: Razieh has not
dialog: 68
dialog: my poor pregnant wife to clean
dialog: the shit between his father’s
dialog: legs?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Ma’am did I force you to come?
dialog: You came for...
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: (to Hojjat)
dialog: Look, if you disrupt the order
dialog: here, I ‘11 put you in prison
dialog: for three days.
speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: (to the Examining
dialog: Magistrate)
dialog: Please he's a bit hot-tempered...
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: (to Razieh)
dialog: Hot-tempered? I should sue you
dialog: for secretly working for a
dialog: strange, single man whom no one
dialog: knows...
speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: (in tears)
dialog: I only wanted to help with the
dialog: bills. Your honor, he hasn’t
dialog: worked for months.
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: The tutor has to come in as a
dialog: witness.
dialog: (to Nader)
dialog: Call her to come in tomorrow or
dialog: give her number to Mr. Izadi to
dialog: arrange it.
dialog: yet stopped crying.
speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: Your honor I’m here today for
dialog: one thing.. I lost my child but
dialog: it didn’t hurt as much as when
dialog: he accused me of being a thief...
dialog: 69
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: If we were thieves, we wouldn’t
dialog: have to come to your homes for
dialog: work.
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: (to Nader)
dialog: Do you have proof or a witness
dialog: that she stole?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: I didn’t say she stole? I went
dialog: to my drawer, and saw that my
dialog: money was short. And it was the
dialog: same amount that I pay her.
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: Why did you fight?
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: He accused her of stealing.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Your honor, my father is 80
text: years old. He is sick. He has
text: Alzheimer’s. She tied his hand
text: to the bed and left the house.
dialog: That day I came home early. I
text: saw him on the floor with his
dialog: hand tied to the bed. I thought
text: he had died. She came back and
dialog: I’m not saying I wasn’t angry,
dialog: I was. I told her to leave and
dialog: she was being stubborn and
dialog: wouldn't leave.
speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: Your honor, where should I have
dialog: gone? He accused me of
dialog: stealing. If I hadn’t asked for
dialog: the money and left, he would’ve
dialog: thought I had stolen the money.
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: Was your father hurt?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Yes he was a little hurt.
dialog: 70
text: Razieh gets upset at hearing this. She looks at the window
text: and then gets up to leave the room.
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: Ma’am sit down. Where are you
dialog: going?
speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: (pointing to the
dialog: window)
dialog: My daughter is going outside!
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: Come back quick. And close the
dialog: door.
text: Razieh leave and closes the door behind her.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDORS — DAY
text: With the excuse of checking up on her daughter, Razieh
text: comes out of the examination branch and walks through the
text: crowded and busy corridors towards the exit. She is
text: preoccupied with something.
scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD — DAY
text: She reaches the courtyard. She looks around and spots her
text: daughter playing in a corner of the yard. She walks towards
text: her. She spots a public telephone in the corner of the
text: yard. Doubtful, she changes her direction and walks towards
text: the public phone. She waits for the person who is on the
text: phone to finish their conversation. She is a little
text: worried. She gets a little notebook out of her bag. She
text: uses her broken glasses to read a number out of it. Her
text: turn to use the phone comes up. She dials the number. She
text: is waiting for the other end to pick up. She sees Hojjat
text: who has come to the courtyard looking for her. She hangs up
text: before Hojjat can see her and walks towards Hojjat.
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: Why are you taking so long?
speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: I’m not well. You go I'11l come.
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: 71
dialog: He says you locked up his
dialog: father and left.
speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: What should I say?
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: Say? If he files a complaint
dialog: you'll be arrested.
text: Razieh doesn’t know what to do. It is clear she is ina
dialog: difficult situation.
speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: You go on. I’11l come.
text: Hojjat leaves. Razieh is upset and full of doubt. She goes
text: back inside. Somayeh is standing in a corner and looking at
text: a small kitten that in the midst of all this commotion, is
text: standing by a prisoner’s foot. The prisoner is in handcuffs
text: and is in prison uniform. A guard is sitting next to him.
text: The prisoner is throwing his leftover food from a plastic
text: plate on the ground for the little kitten. The kitten is
text: eating it and rubbing itself against the prisoner’s leg.
text: Somayeh is curious and walks towards them and stands there
text: and watches the kitten.
scene_heading: INT. EXAMINING MAGISTRATE’S OFFICE — DAY
text: Now, Nader, Hojjat and Razieh are all standing in front of
text: the examining magistrate’s desk. They are all more
text: distraught than before. The door is still open and other
text: people waiting to see the magistrate are all standing in
text: line by the door with their files in their hands.
speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: He was sleeping. I locked the
text: door to keep him in. His son
dialog: would lock the door and leave
dialog: me the key in the mornings. I
dialog: saw that he does it so I...
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: He says you tied him to the
dialog: bed.
speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: 72
dialog: I was afraid he would wake up
dialog: and do something to hurt
dialog: himself. I swear on the Absent
dialog: Imam that I did it out of
dialog: compassion for him.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: The question is why did you
dialog: leave your place of work.
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: So if she left you should hit
dialog: her? Who said you could touch
dialog: my wife? If honor’s not
dialog: important for you, it is for
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Don’t be offensive.
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: (to Hojjat)
dialog: Sir, leave the room... go on.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: I want to file a complaint
dialog: against this woman.
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: Write your complaint. Take your

dialog: If he’s hurt, get a report.
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: What happens to our complaint?
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: (to Hojjat)
dialog: Sign this and leave.
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: (to Nader)
dialog: Call someone to post bail or
dialog: bring a deed for you.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: (extremely
dialog: shocked)
dialog: 73
dialog: Bail for what?
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: You’re charged with murder. I
dialog: can’t let you leave. The blood
dialog: money is forty-million tomans.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: How am I going to post bail or
dialog: bring a deed? I live at my
dialog: dad's.
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: Without bail you’1ll go to jail...
dialog: come and sign here.
text: It is clear that Razieh is upset from the situation Nader
text: is in. She comes forward with Hojjat and both sign the
text: paperwork. Nader is helpless.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: (pleading)
dialog: Your honor, my father is sick
text: and he’s home alone right now.
dialog: I couldn't find anyone to watch
dialog: him. I had to lock him in and
dialog: come here. My daughter will be
dialog: back from school this
dialog: afternoon. No one will be there
dialog: to watch them. I’1l leave you
dialog: my ID, my pay slips, whatever
dialog: you want but if I go to jail my

scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE

speaker_heading: NADER

dialog: Take care. I’1ll call you again
dialog: tomorrow.
text: During the message’s entire playback, Simin gets up and
text: walks toward Mr. Morteza’s room. Mr. Morteza is quiet and
text: sometimes looks at Simin. Simin is in conflict with
text: herself. Termeh comes out of the bathroom.
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: If you hadn’t left, Dad
dialog: wouldn’t be in jail right now.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: Your dad is not in jail because
dialog: of what I did. It’s because
text: he’s beaten up a pregnant woman
text: like a thug.
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: She came cause you left.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: (with sarcasm)
dialog: And he was just so upset that I
dialog: left.
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: He knew you weren’t really
dialog: leaving.
text: Simin falls silent for a moment. She is pensive.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: Did you tell him?!
speaker_heading: TERMEH

scene_heading: INT. SIMIN’S CAR — EXT. STREET — NIGHT
text: Mr. Morteza is sitting quietly on the passenger side chair.

dialog: divorce you... Not a word... “One
dialog: day you came to live with me
dialog: and now you don’t want to!”..
dialog: It's not as if I lived with him
dialog: for 14 years.
text: A brief silence ensues. She is very upset.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: If he'd say “I won't divorce

speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: Child! Only our child? That’s

text: The entire time Simin is speaking, Mr. Morteza is staring

scene_heading: EXT. COURTHOUSE — COURTYARD — DAY
text: Nader is walking through the courtyard towards the

dialog: here.
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: Dad... Hi.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: What are you doing here? Who'd

speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Did you speak to them?
speaker_heading: GRANDMA KATTI
dialog: 79

speaker_heading: MRS. GHAHRAEI
dialog: (worried)
dialog: So what should I tell them?
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: I don’t know what they’1ll ask.
speaker_heading: MRS. GHAHRAEI
dialog: What if he asks something that...
speaker_heading: FEMALE OFFICER
dialog: (to Mrs. Ghahraei)
dialog: Ma’am, your cellphone.
text: Simin doesn’t know how to answer Mrs. Ghahraei’s question.
text: Mrs. Ghahraei hands over her cellphone to the female

text: Simin leaves.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: (to Mrs. Ghahraei)
dialog: You should tell the truth.
dialog: (walking towards

scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: Where was he?
speaker_heading: MRS. GHAHRAEI
dialog: Mr. Lavasani was in the
dialog: Kitchen.
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: Did he have any reaction or
dialog: contribute to your
dialog: conversation?
speaker_heading: MRS. GHAHRAEI
dialog: If he did, I didn’t notice.
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: How did you realize she was
dialog: pregnant?
speaker_heading: MRS. GHAHRAEI
dialog: I think she told me.
speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: Ma’am you asked me. Why would I
dialog: tell you?
speaker_heading: MRS. GHAHRAEI
dialog: Oh yes her daughter was drawing
text: a man and a woman. She said
dialog: this is my daddy and mommy. I
dialog: said your mommy’s not that fat.
dialog: She said she has a baby in her
dialog: tummy.
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: So you didn’t find out from her
dialog: appearance?
speaker_heading: MRS. GHAHRAEI
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: Why are you lying? You’re a
dialog: woman. Women can tell from the
text: face of a woman if she’s
dialog: pregnant.
speaker_heading: MRS. GHAHRAEI
dialog: 82
dialog: Even if I could tell, what
dialog: difference does it make to Mr.
dialog: Lavasani?
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: This woman is his daughter’s
dialog: tutor. They’ve fixed their
dialog: stories.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Why are you insulting this
dialog: lady?
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: No one’s talking to you.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: When did I have the opportunity
dialog: to fix my story? I was in here
dialog: last night!
speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: Your honor, it is obvious. Now
dialog: that I am speaking to you, even
dialog: if that man...
dialog: (pointing to the
dialog: secretary)
dialog: doesn’t want to, he can hear
dialog: us.
dialog: (to the secretary)
dialog: Right?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: I didn’t hear you. My mind is
dialog: in a thousand places. Why would
dialog: I listen to your conversation?
dialog: Do I have to swear to God?
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: Like you even believe in God
dialog: and the prophet that...
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: No God and the prophet are for
dialog: your type only!
speaker_heading: MRS. GHAHRAEI
dialog: 83
dialog: (to the examining
dialog: magistrate)
dialog: He is an honorable man. I’ve
dialog: been going there for a year to
dialog: teach his daughter. He doesn’t
dialog: come into the living room till
dialog: I’m done teaching his daughter.
text: He stays in his room.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Why when she’s pregnant would
dialog: she not tell me about it? Why
dialog: would she hide it and come and
dialog: take this job? If I had known,
dialog: I wouldn’t have even hired her.
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: Why did you hire her when you
dialog: knew she didn’t have her
dialog: husband’s permission to work?
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: (to Mrs. Ghahraei)

speaker_heading: GRANDMA KATTI

speaker_heading: MRS. GHAHRAEI
dialog: Why?... Did daddy fight with

speaker_heading: GRANDMA KATTI
dialog: (trying to get
dialog: Somayeh to
dialog: explain)
dialog: Why should he fight with her?
speaker_heading: MRS. GHAHRAEI
dialog: (to Somayeh)
dialog: Maybe because she didn’t tell
dialog: him she was working in people’s
dialog: home? Did he hit her?
speaker_heading: SOMAYEH
dialog: My mom and dad never fight.
speaker_heading: MRS. GHAHRAEI
dialog: Then why were they fighting in

dialog: showed me.
speaker_heading: SOMAYEH

dialog: (to Razieh)
dialog: Why aren’t you saying anything?
speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: (to Nader)
dialog: You didn’t push me?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: I grabbed her here and sent her
text: back from the door. And that’s
dialog: because she was cussing in
dialog: front of my daughter.
speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: When did I cuss at you?
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: (to Nader)
dialog: Then how did she lose the baby?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: I'd also like to know what

scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE

speaker_heading: HOJJAT

scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE

speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: Yes the neighbors were there.
scene_heading: EXAINING MAGISTRATE

scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: (to Hojjat)
dialog: I’m the one who determines

speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: Sir do you realize his ex-wife

scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE

speaker_heading: RAZIEH

scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: A government employee or

speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: I don’t have anyone. It’s just

scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: You need someone to vouch for

speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: (worried)

scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: According to the complaint he

scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE

speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: I explained to you why...
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: This poor thing just lost her

scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE

dialog: Sir bring your voice down!
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: For God’s sake why don’t you
dialog: listen to us? He’s twisting

scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE

speaker_heading: HOJJAT

scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE

scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR — EXT. THE COURTYARD — DAY
text: Distraught, Hojjat comes out of the room. Worried, Razieh

speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: I swear on the prophet, I won’t
dialog: let you trample my rights this
dialog: time.. I’1l pour gas on myself
dialog: and set myself on fire at this
dialog: very courthouse...
text: Grandma Katti has also come forth to watch. Razieh is
text: scared. Termeh and Somayeh who are in the courtyard feeding

dialog: take Hojjat away.
speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: (to the officer)

scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: I already wrote the order.
speaker_heading: RAZIEH

scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: I’ve been patient for the past
dialog: two days.
text: Razieh puts her hand in her bag and brings out a plastic
text: bag full of pills.
speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: I beg you to forgive him. Sir,
dialog: look at these. Every day he
dialog: takes a bunch of these. Ever
dialog: since he lost his job, he’s
text: been depressed. He can’t help
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Sir can I ask you to please
dialog: forgive him this time?
speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: (to the examining

dialog: You're like his elder...
scene_heading: EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
dialog: Go tell him to find someone to

speaker_heading: RAZIEH

speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: It’s something the size of this

speaker_heading: SOMAYEH
dialog: Then how does it kick?
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: A four-month-old fetus kicks?!
speaker_heading: SOMAYEH
dialog: Yes. I heard it!
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: A four-month-old-baby doesn’t
dialog: even have arms and legs, how
dialog: can it even kick?
speaker_heading: SOMAYEH
dialog: Did you go into my mom's... my
dialog: mom’s belly and see what it’s
dialog: like?
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: No but in books you can go and
dialog: see the pictures. It’s a piece

speaker_heading: SOMAYEH
dialog: Somayeh
dialog: 92
dialog: If it doesn’t have anything,
dialog: then how did they know it was a
dialog: boy?
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: Was it a boy?
speaker_heading: SOMAYEH
dialog: After my mom gave birth to it
dialog: in the hospital, they found out
dialog: that it was a boy...
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: Did you see it too?
text: Hojjat is on his way out. He speaks to Somayeh. Upon

speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: Go sit next to your mother.

scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR — EXT. COURTYARD — DAY

speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: Will you tell her?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: She'll think it’s cause she

speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: 93
dialog: (with no other

dialog: Okay...
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: You promise?

speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: (jokingly)
dialog: Why do you promise?
text: The officer laughs. Grandma Katti and Somayeh walk towards
dialog: Nader.
speaker_heading: GRANDMA KATTI

dialog: Dad!
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: You didn’t know Ms. Razieh was
dialog: pregnant?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: No.
text: Another period of silence. Nader realizes that Termeh is
text: deep in thought.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Why do you ask?
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: It’s nothing.
dialog: 94
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Then why did you ask?
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: Last night mom said you knew.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Where was she to see if I knew?
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: She said when they told you at
dialog: the hospital that Razieh's baby
dialog: had died, you didn’t say
dialog: anything. You didn’t ask if she
dialog: was pregnant. You didn’t get
dialog: surprised. At times like this,
dialog: people usually ask if she was
dialog: carrying a child. It was like
dialog: you knew.
text: Nader is shocked at Termeh’s words. He stays quiet for a
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Your mom wants to turn you
dialog: against me.
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: Don’t tell her I told you this.
text: Nader is still quiet. It is clear he is upset.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE GRANDMA KATTI’S HOUSE — DAY
text: Nader’s car pulls over opposite Grandma Katti’s house. On
text: the other side, Simin and her mother get out of their car
text: and walk towards their house.
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: Will you tell her?
text: Nader is not sure how to respond to Termeh. He gets out and
text: walks to the other side of the street. Termeh stays in the
text: car. Nader walks across the street and reaches Grandma
text: Katti’s house. He rings the doorbell and enters. Termeh’s
text: anticipating gaze is at the door to Grandma Katti’s house.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 95
text: Her expression is that of worry. A few moments later,
text: Nader, walks out of the house holding his father’s arm.
text: Grandma Katti walks them to the door. Nader walks his
text: father across the street. He opens the rear passenger door
text: and helps his father into the back seat. Termeh’s hopeful
text: gaze is still at Grandma Katti’s house. Nader gets in and
text: when he turns the engine on and puts the car into gear, all
text: of Termeh’s hopes dissipate and upset, she turns her gaze
text: out of the window on her side. Nader realizes she is upset.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: I can’t sweetie.
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: Didn’t you promise?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: I’m sorry.
text: Nader drives off. A heavy silence falls between them in the
dialog: car.
scene_heading: INT. NADER’S HOUSE — STAIRWAY — DAY
text: Nader is holding his father’s arm and is climbing the
text: stairs. Termeh who is still clearly upset, is climbing
text: ahead of them and has reached the door and is waiting for
text: her grandfather to reach her.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Which step had she fallen on?
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: That one down there.
text: Nader turns the key in the lock and opens the door. His
text: gaze is on the stairs and he is deep in thought.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Take him inside, I'll be right
dialog: in.
text: Termeh takes her grandfather’s hand and takes him in. Nader
text: looks at the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY AND MR. MORTEZA’S ROOM — DAY
dialog: 96
text: Termeh seats her grandfather on the edge of the bed. He is
text: quiet and helpless like a child. She goes back to the
text: hallway. Something is keeping her preoccupied. She sees
text: Somayeh’s backpack which has been left behind the apartment
text: door. She opens it and from it, she takes out a drawing and
text: looks at it. A childish drawing of a man and a woman. The
text: woman has a protruding belly. From the drawing it can be
text: perceived that the man and woman are fighting. Nader opens
text: the door and comes inside. He sees Termeh looking at the
text: drawing. Termeh takes the drawing to her room. Nader, tired
text: of the events of the past two days, takes off his jacket
text: and sinks into the sofa. His gaze is upon his father who is
text: clearly less energetic than the week before.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: (to Termeh)
dialog: Sweetie will you put the kettle
dialog: on?
text: Without answering, Termeh walks into the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN — DAY
text: Frustrated with the stove’s broken lighter, Termeh lights
text: it with matches. Nader is standing in the kitchen doorway
text: and is looking at her.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: What would you like for lunch?
dialog: I’1l order in.
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: I’m not hungry.
text: Nader walks into the kitchen.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Are you mad at me?
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: What did you go and say to Mrs.
dialog: Kalani?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: What do you mean what did I
dialog: say?
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: 97
dialog: Why did you go to their house?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: I told her that they are coming
dialog: to investigate. To be aware. Is
dialog: that not okay?
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: If she is to tell the truth
dialog: then why should she be aware?
text: Nader is shocked at Termeh’s response. He realizes what she
dialog: means.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Come here. I want to show you
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: I have homework to do.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Leave it. I’m telling you to
dialog: come.
text: Nader leaves the kitchen. With no other choice, Termeh
text: follows him.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWAY — DAY
text: Nader opens the door to the apartment and walks towards the
text: stairs that lead downstairs. Termeh is perplexed and
text: standing in the doorway.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: You said she had fallen down
dialog: here right?
text: Termeh is worried that the neighbors might hear them.
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: Okay come inside and explain.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: I don’t want to say anything
dialog: bad. Okay... pretend that I am
dialog: that woman... I get thrown from
dialog: the door in this direction
dialog: right?
dialog: 98
text: Nader moves from the door towards the step on which Razieh
dialog: had fallen. To reach that step, he has to change his
dialog: direction.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Come. Look. When someone is
dialog: thrown, they travel straight
text: ahead till they hit something.
dialog: They don’t turn one way and
dialog: then turn another way and then
dialog: come and fall here. Right? If I
dialog: had thrown her, she should have
dialog: fallen straight ahead on those
dialog: stairs up there or ultimately
dialog: on this first step. Okay
dialog: imagine that you’ve been
dialog: pushed, move in this direction...
text: Termeh is deep in thought.
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: Then how did she fall down
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: I don’t know but she wasn’t
dialog: thrown on that step. Either she
dialog: fell on her own or something
dialog: happened to her afterwards.
text: Termeh is staring at the stairs. Nader goes towards the
text: apartment door.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: You go and stand where I was
text: standing. Look from that spot.
dialog: Go and stand there.
text: Termeh goes and stands on the stairs leading downstairs
dialog: where Razieh had fallen.
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: (going down the
dialog: stairs)
dialog: Why don’t you tell them these
dialog: things?
dialog: 99
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: (going inside the
dialog: house)
dialog: Forget them. I want you to
dialog: know. Look for yourself.
text: Nader goes inside and closes the door. Termeh is standing
text: in the stairway deep in thought.
scene_heading: INT. BEHIND THE APARTMENT DOOR AND HALLWAY — DAY
text: Nader is standing inside behind the apartment door. He too
text: is preoccupied. Before going out of the door, he sees his
text: father who is standing in the hallway and staring at him.
text: The two look at each other. Nader pushes down on the door
text: handle to open the door.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWAY — DAY
text: The door to Nader’s house suddenly opens and Nader pushes a

text: towards the stairway. The young officer stops at the top of
dialog: the stairs.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: (to the young
dialog: officer)
dialog: Sorry.
text: In the stairway, a police officer holding a piece of paper

speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: (to Razieh)
dialog: Is that the direction he threw

speaker_heading: RAZIEH
text: No, towards the lower floor.
speaker_heading: NADER

speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Where did you fall down?
speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: On these stairs.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Which step?
text: Razieh doubtingly points out the second step down from
text: Nader’s floor. Hojjat is paying complete attention to
dialog: everything that is being said.
speaker_heading: RAZIEH
dialog: I think it was this one.

speaker_heading: SIMIN

speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: (losing his

speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: Learn what? Fighting and
dialog: stubbornness?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: I don’t want her to learn from
dialog: you and be a coward and afraid
text: every time someone screams. He
dialog: knows where to come to scream.
dialog: Why doesn’t he come and
dialog: threaten me?
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: Yes I’m a coward.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Your whole life, instead of

speaker_heading: SIMIN

speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: Then why did you say you
dialog: didn’t?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: 118
dialog: Do you know what would happen

dialog: three years in prison. I only
dialog: thought of what would happen to
dialog: you. Who would you stay with...
text: Termeh doesn’t know what to do.
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: If you knew, why did you hit

speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: I knew she was pregnant but at

speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: (to Hojjat)
dialog: I’m afraid of something worse

speaker_heading: AZAM
dialog: 125
dialog: Ma’am it’s your husband who is
dialog: hurting this poor soul.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: They’re both being stubborn.
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: How’ve I been unfair? What
dialog: crime have I committed? Was it
dialog: anything other than the fact
dialog: that my wife was beaten and my
dialog: child died?
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: You're right.
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: Your husband is not taking
dialog: responsibility.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: I admit that he’s to blame but
dialog: what’1l all this lead to? One
dialog: or two years in court for a
dialog: payment plan for the blood
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: That’s what upsets me. Ma’am,
dialog: why do you think it’s for the

speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: When did I say such a thing?
speaker_heading: HOJJAT
dialog: I know you think this guy is a

dialog: and my husband won't get hanged
dialog: for this.
speaker_heading: AZAM
dialog: She’s right. And besides it’s
dialog: not like her husband did this
dialog: on purpose.
text: Upset, Hojjat stands up to leave. Mr. Ali follows him.
speaker_heading: MR. ALI
dialog: They’re good people for giving

dialog: ordeal.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: We'll decide on an amount right

speaker_heading: SIMIN

speaker_heading: SIMIN

text: Nader closes the dishwasher door and faces Simin.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: It was difficult but I managed

dialog: fifteen-million instead of
dialog: forty. Three five-million toman

dialog: consent.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: With whose permission did you
dialog: promise him money?!
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: I can’t handle the stress of my
dialog: child’s safety. Just now when

dialog: worry.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: You didn’t get what I just
dialog: said. I’m saying why are you
dialog: interfering?
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: I didn’t come here to fight.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: Oh God why can’t I make her

speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: Didn’t you say it was my fault,

dialog: 129
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: If I pay them, it means I have

dialog: He’ll never leave us alone.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: Do you think he will if you
dialog: don’t pay?
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Why should I bribe someone who...
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: Pretend it’s my dower that
dialog: you're paying.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: I would beg and borrow to pay
dialog: you your dower but extortion, I
dialog: neither have the money for nor

speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: Our child is going through
text: adolescence. She is suffering.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: If she were suffering she
dialog: wouldn’t have stayed.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: Why do you think she has
dialog: stayed? Chosen you? To keep us
dialog: from separating. She knows I
dialog: won't go anywhere without her.
dialog: She is suffering but she will
dialog: not show it.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: You’11 call them right now and
dialog: say that my husband says I
dialog: won't pay until it’s been
dialog: proven to me that I am
dialog: responsible.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: I’1l sell my car.
dialog: 130
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: I don’t want you to sell your
dialog: car for my sake.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: When your child is not
dialog: important enough for you to pay
dialog: fifteen million...
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Why are you talking nonsense?
dialog: Money’s not the issue. I won’t
dialog: give in till it’s been proven
dialog: to me that it was my fault.
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: As long as my child’s safety is
dialog: not guaranteed, I won't...
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: You don’t have the right to do
dialog: anything...
speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: If I hadn’t done anything you'd
dialog: still be in jail.
speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: I don’t want to be out because

speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: If you cry, I’1ll cry too.
speaker_heading: TERMEH
dialog: Why won’t you pay them so that

speaker_heading: NADER
dialog: Mom’s coming back has nothing
dialog: to do with this.
speaker_heading: TERMEH
text: It does. She had come to stay.

speaker_heading: SIMIN
dialog: What’s that got to do with my

speaker_heading: SIMIN
