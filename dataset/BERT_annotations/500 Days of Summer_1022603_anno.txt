dialog:

text: breath as the opening bars of "Born to Run" begin to play and
text: Summer starts to sing. Tom sees Summer as the actress in
text: whatever nonsensical karaoke video accompanies the song (it's
text: something to do with an old convertible, the sunset, and a
text: midget in a tuxedo.)
dialog: 
text: LATER. Tom sits in the booth with McKenzie (doing a shot) as

speaker_heading: MCKENZIE
dialog: I have no idea what you're talking

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Summer, hold on... you don't

dialog: And I know that today most

dialog: parents.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Well mine too but --

dialog: Oh yeah, And I read in Newsweek,

speaker_heading: TOM

dialog: Nothing. I just... You're

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Friends. Awesome. That's just

dialog: 
text: Tom walks a few more steps.
dialog: 
text: And then, seemingly out of nowhere, without his even
text: noticing, SUMMER HAS WRAPPED HER ARMS AROUND HIM AND PULLED
dialog: HIM INTO A KISS!
dialog: 
text: It's unbelievable. There's a few seconds where Tom isn't sure
text: if he's dreaming or not. But then he realizes, suddenly, out
dialog: of the blue, his best case scenario really is actually
dialog: happening.

dialog: 
text: Tom walks down the street. Or, more accurately, Tom struts
text: down the street. He's pointing at people as he passes,
text: winking, doing a little shuffle. He is the man. He checks out
text: his reflection in a window. A YOUNG PAUL NEWMAN stares back.
dialog: 
text: People wave as he passes, they clap, they give him thumbs up.
text: A parade forms behind him. The POSTMAN, a POLICE OFFICER, the
scene_heading: HOT DOG VENDOR, RONALD MCDONALD and MAYOR MCCHEESE, everybody
text: loves Tom today. HALL and OATES themselves walk with Tom
text: singing the song.
dialog: 
text: Cars stop at crosswalks to let Tom go by. The DRIVERS also
text: pump their fists in celebration of Tom's achievement last
text: night. He walks on, the man. We notice the sidewalk lights up
text: every time he touches the pavement like in "Billie Jean".
dialog: 
text: CARTOON BIRDS fly onto Tom's shoulder. He smiles and winks at
dialog: them.

scene_heading: INT OFFICE - SAME

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Hey Mr. Vance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: Yes, Mr. Vance?
dialog: 
text: And they're all business. As Tom turns to go, however, Summer
text: gives him a little coy smile that would be enough to make
text: anyone's day complete. Tom gives her the international signal
dialog: for `I'll call you later' in return. Vance sees none of it.

speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: Hi, I'm Summer..
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Summer, wow what an unusual name.

dialog: Hmm. So, basically you do want to

dialog: Ok.
dialog: 
text: He takes a deep breath. He's about to go on when:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: Whoa. Oh my god. We can't talk
dialog: during this song. It's too
dialog: beautiful.
dialog: 
text: And it is. Tom's hand is on the gear shift. She puts hers
text: there and locks it with his. Tom listens and Tom watches
dialog: Summer listening. There's something about this moment, the
text: way she sings along, the way her eyes close during certain
text: notes, the way her smile rises and falls like she could cry
dialog: at any minute from being overwhelmingly happy or just simply
text: overwhelmed. Tom is powerless to stop his feelings for this
dialog: girl.

dialog: So, uh, let me buy you a drink.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: No thank you.
dialog:

speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: (to the Douche)
dialog: Don't be rude. I'm flattered, I'm

speaker_heading: DOUCHE
dialog: It's a free country.

text: Summer and Tom make eye contact again, as if to say "now

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOUCHE
dialog: So you and him, huh? I can't
dialog: believe that. Is this guy really
dialog: your boyfriend?
dialog: 
text: And that question hangs in the air. Tom, panicked, decides to
text: cut the silence. All the pent up uncertainty and confusion,
text: coupled with the challenge to his manhood in front of the
text: woman he loves, all manifests in one single, solid, almost
text: automatic RIGHT CROSS TO THE GOOD LOOKING DOUCHEBAG'S FACE.
dialog: 
text: Which connects spot on and sends the Douche reeling.

text: Both Douche and Tom wince at the pain (Douche's chin, Tom's

speaker_heading: TOM

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: We have news.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Ok.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCKENZIE
dialog: It's about her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Do I want to hear it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Thats what we wanted to ask you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCKENZIE
dialog: It's just...lately you've
dialog: been...better.
dialog: 
dialog: 88.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You've been much much better.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCKENZIE
dialog: So maybe it's best we don't ever
dialog: bring her up again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Just let sleeping dogs lie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCKENZIE
dialog: Leave those dogs alone Tom!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You guys, look, I'm... I appreciate
dialog: what you're saying and, thank you,
dialog: really, for putting up with me
dialog: these past few months. I've been
dialog: crazy. But I've accepted the fact
dialog: that she and I were just two very
dialog: different people who wanted very
dialog: different things. I wanted to get
dialog: serious. Shit, I loved her. And I
dialog: know now, she just isn't the kind
dialog: of girl who can settle down with
dialog: one person and be happy. The way I
dialog: wanted. And she probably never
dialog: will. There was nothing I could do.
dialog: 
text: Mckenzie and Paul just sit there. Now more uncomfortable than

dialog: Tom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: It can't be. It's impossible!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It is.

scene_heading: INT OFFICE - LATER

speaker_heading: MCKENZIE
dialog: I've been calling every five

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What? Oh yeah. Great.

speaker_heading: MCKENZIE
dialog: Do you need anything?

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Twinkies?

speaker_heading: MCKENZIE
dialog: Sorry.

scene_heading: INT BOARDROOM - LATER

dialog: 
text: A female CO-WORKER, 50s, stands at the front of the room in
text: mid-presentation, showing slides that have something to do
text: with a cat in various poses. First we see, "Cat Reaching Up
dialog: for Out-of-Reach Milk Bowl."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CO-WORKER
dialog: This one says "Go for it!"
dialog: 
text: She clicks to the next slide. "Cat Hanging From Tree Branch."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CO-WORKER
dialog: This one says "Don't give up!"
dialog: 
text: Click. We see "Cat Considering a Giant Leap."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CO-WORKER
dialog: And this one says "You can do it!"
dialog: We have a whole line of
dialog: inspirational cards featuring
dialog: Pickles, my cat. I think people
dialog: will really enjoy them. Thank you.
dialog: 
text: She takes her seat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VANCE.
dialog: Good job Rhoda, I agree. Really
dialog: inspirational stuff. Now, who's
dialog: next. We haven't heard from
dialog: "Sympathy" in a while. Hansen...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (reacting to his name)
dialog: Hmm?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VANCE.
dialog: The Winter collection. You have
dialog: anything to contribute?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Uh...no. I really don't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VANCE.
dialog: You have nothing?
dialog: 
dialog: 92.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Well I wouldn't say nothing...
dialog: Actually, that's about right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VANCE.
speaker_heading: (DISAPPOINTED)
dialog: Oh...k. We'll come back to you.
dialog: McKenzie --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You know what...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VANCE.
dialog: Yes Tom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Can I say something about the cat?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: Well sure. Go ahead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: This here is, and Rhoda, you know I
dialog: mean no disrespect... but this...
dialog: this is total shit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCKENZIE
dialog: Tom!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: "Don't give up?" "You can do it?"
dialog: 
text: He points to the screen, still showing the "Cat About to
dialog: Leap" image.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: This isn't inspirational. It's
dialog: suicidal. He tries that jump, I'm
dialog: writing a sympathy card for that
dialog: cat. That's the last thing I want
dialog: to be doing with my life. It's bad
dialog: enough writing these things for
dialog: people.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: Hansen, this is a place of
dialog: business. We don't cut down our co-
dialog: workers --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: That's cause we're liars! It's what
dialog: we do here. Why don't we level with
dialog: people? Stop feeding them nonsense?
dialog: 
dialog: 93.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CO-WORKER (RHODA)
dialog: We're a greeting card company.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Yes but think about it! Why do
dialog: people buy these things? Not to say
dialog: how they feel. There's paper and
dialog: pens for that. People give these
dialog: cards when they can't say how they
dialog: feel. Or they're afraid to. And we
dialog: provide the service that lets `em
dialog: get away with that!
dialog: 
text: Tom is getting excited. The rest of the room is growing
dialog: uncomfortable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I say to hell with it! Let's level
dialog: with America. Or at least make them
dialog: speak for themselves! I mean,
dialog: seriously, what's this...
dialog: (picks a card off the
speaker_heading: TABLE)
dialog: "I'm sorry to hear your grandmother
dialog: has passed." What the hell? Let's
dialog: give em some truth. Something like,
dialog: "Sorry to hear about your
dialog: grandmother. Here's a card so I get
dialog: some credit in your time of need.
dialog: I'm sure it makes up for the fact
dialog: that grandma's dead."
dialog: 
text: Vance and the card-writing team are appalled.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Think about it.
dialog: (picks up another card)
dialog: "Congratulations on your new baby."
dialog: Eh... How bout... "Congratulations
dialog: on your new baby... Guess that's it
dialog: for hanging out. Nice knowing ya,
dialog: buddy."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: Hansen, sit down!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (picks up a card)
dialog: Wait, what's this? Ooh... fancy!
dialog: Look at this one with all the
dialog: hearts. Let's open it up. "Happy
dialog: Valentine's Day, Sweetheart. I love
dialog: you." Oh that's nice.
dialog: 
dialog: 94.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCKENZIE
dialog: Tom...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: If someone gave me this card, Mr.
dialog: Vance... I would eat it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCKENZIE
dialog: Tom!
dialog: 
text: Tom recognizes he's losing his shit. He takes a seat on the
text: boardroom table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: It's these greeting cards, Sir,
dialog: these cards, these movies, these
dialog: pop songs. They're responsible for
dialog: all the lies, the heartache,
dialog: everything! We're responsible!
text: Everyone shifts in their seats.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I think we do a bad thing here.
dialog: People should be able to say how
dialog: they feel, how they really feel,
dialog: without some strangers putting
text: words in their mouths. The truth. A
dialog: card is a nice thought but it
dialog: shouldn't do the dirty work for
dialog: you. You love someone, tell them
dialog: yourself, in your own words. Maybe
dialog: it's not love at all. Maybe there's
dialog: no such thing as love. Maybe
dialog: it's... "galoogoo."
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Yeah I made it up, so what?!
dialog: 
text: Tom gets up and walks to the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: It's all crap. We make and peddle
dialog: crap. And sometimes people believe
dialog: in this crap. I just can't do it
dialog: anymore, Mr. Vance. There's enough
dialog: bullshit in the world without my
dialog: help. I quit.
dialog: 
dialog: 95.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: And with that he gets up and walks off. The room is pretty
text: stunned. Someone coughs. McKenzie tries to start a clap. It
dialog: doesn't really take.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: EXT BUILDING - MINUTES LATER

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: How do you know?

speaker_heading: MCKENZIE
dialog: We know.

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: But... It's May! We broke up last

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm so sorry Tom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Married?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It's insane.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: It's impossible. It doesn't make
dialog: sense. Where did they meet? Is it
dialog: someone we know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: So everything she said. All that
dialog: stuff about... it can't be. Not
dialog: her. I know her too well. She
dialog: wouldn't do that.
dialog: 
text: His friends say nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Fuck!
dialog: 
text: And with that he storms off.

speaker_heading: MCKENZIE
dialog: Tom!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Let him go.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON Tom walking away from them.
dialog: 
text: Literally, his entire universe falls apart.
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: FX: BUILDINGS come crumbling down. The whole city turns to

text: force and reduced to nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: The right girl I guess.

speaker_heading: AUNT BETSY

speaker_heading: AUNT ANITA

speaker_heading: TOM

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: No. Where's that coming from?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUNT BETSY

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: TOM

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No I'm serious.

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: Some restaurant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Fun?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: Uneventful. Didn't get home until

dialog: late for a stupid work function.
dialog: How was your night?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Pretty standard.
dialog: 
dialog: Not much more to say. Stay with them for a few extra beats of

scene_heading: EXT OUTDOOR MARKET - LATER
dialog: 
dialog: Tom and Summer shopping at the fruit market. Unless we were
dialog: looking for trouble we wouldn't see any. But since we are, we
text: might notice she lags behind him as they walk through the

scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT - LATER

dialog: 
text: LATER. He uses a pencil on the wall to mark for a bookshelf.

dialog: I want to see it. Let's go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Ok cool.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: Unless you don't want to.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: No, I will. That's fine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: Ok.
dialog: 
text: A few more silent beats. Something's in the air.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT MOVIE - LATER
dialog: 
text: Tom and Summer watching the film. Tears begin to well in
text: Summer's eyes. They soon turn to audible sobs. Tom turns to
text: look at her, to offer some sort of comfort, believing it to
text: be a response to the movie. She doesn't look back.

scene_heading: INT TOM'S BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Tom drawing a straight line on his wall. Redecorating.
dialog: 
dialog: 105.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: And then he stops.
dialog: 
text: He looks at the line he's drawn. He extends it a little bit.
text: He draws another. He begins to furiously draw on the wall.
text: From out of nowhere, inspiration has hit. An image starts to
text: form. A pretty impressive looking futuristic skyscraper,
text: almost shaped like a tear drop.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: (240)
scene_heading: EXT MOVIE THEATRE - LATER
dialog: 
text: Same day from the past. They walk out, at first everything's
dialog: alright. It's exactly as we saw on page 7. But soon after
text: that she begins to cry again. Serious, real sobbing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Hey.
dialog: 
text: He goes to hug her. He hugs her. It's unclear if she hugs
dialog: back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Hey Sum, it's just a movie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: I know. I'm sorry Tom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Is everything alright with you?
dialog: 
text: She smiles, tries to pull herself together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: Yeah. I'm just...I'm sorry. I'm
dialog: being ridiculous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: It's ok. This happens to me every
dialog: time I watch "Hoosiers." Let's go
dialog: for a walk, ok. Let's get some air.
dialog: Or go to Sister Ray's.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: Ok.
dialog: 
dialog: They walk.
dialog: 
dialog: 106.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT RECORD STORE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Tom and a much more in control Summer walk down the aisles.
text: He grabs one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: It pains me that we live in a world
dialog: where no one's ever heard of
dialog: Spearmint.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: I've never heard of them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: And it's painful. Oh look.
dialog: 
text: He grabs a Ringo Starr album and shows it to her, just as
text: we've seen on Page 7. She smiles and they continue on down
text: the aisles.
dialog: 
text: In CU, Tom goes to hold Summer's hand. But something happens.
text: It could be a total coincidence, but just as his hand
text: approaches hers (in SLO-MO), she moves it away and keeps it
text: at her side. Tom puts his hands in his pockets, unsure if
dialog: there's something to read in that.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: (411)
scene_heading: EXT HARBOR - DAY
dialog: 
text: Tom sketches intensely. The landscape, the skyline, the

scene_heading: EXT RECORD STORE - LATER
dialog: 
text: Again, that fateful day continues. Tom and Summer outside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: So.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: So... Now what?
dialog: 
dialog: 107.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: Now...I think I'm gonna call it a
dialog: day.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Yeah? You wanna maybe...get some
dialog: dinner or something?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: I've got pasta at home.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Are you hungry?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: I'm pretty hungry, but --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Ooh!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I've got a great idea!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Let's get breakfast.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: Now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Pancakes?
dialog:

text: Tom shaves. Makes himself look presentable.

dialog: 108.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: 2. EXT CITY SIDEWALK - DAY
dialog: 
text: Tom sits on a street corner drawing new additions to the

dialog: 
scene_heading: 2. INT LIBRARY - DAY
dialog: 
text: Tom sits with his feet up on a table, headphones on his ears,
dialog: reading one of many Taschen books on innovative building
dialog: design.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 3. INT OFFICE LOBBY - DAY
dialog: 
text: Tom drops off his portfolio with the security guard in the
text: lobby of a high-rise.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4. EXT SOCCER FIELD - DAY
dialog: 
text: Tom and his mom and step-dad cheer on his sister playing
dialog: soccer. It's a nice temporary distraction for him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 6. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Tom getting bad news on the phone. He has a list written on
text: his wall (which is now composed of a dynamic cityscape of
text: futuristic looking structures). He crosses "Abrams and
text: Abrams" off the list. We notice several others are also
dialog: crossed off.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 5. EXT GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Tom has his car on the side of the road and is out measuring

scene_heading: 8. EXT PARK - DAY
dialog: 
text: Tom jogs. A little faster this time.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 9. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Tom getting more bad news from the answering machine,
text: crossing off yet another firm from the list. Few remain. He
text: sits on the bed with his shoulders slumped. For a beat, lost
dialog: in thought.
dialog: 
dialog: 109.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Then, as if to shut those thoughts out, whatever they were,
text: he turns on the TV and joylessly watches the nothingness.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 9. SPLITSCREEN - DAY
dialog: 
text: On the LEFT, Tom, alone, on a bus. Looking out the window.
dialog: Thinking.
dialog: 
text: On the RIGHT, Summer. In her wedding dress. The veil is
dialog: lifted. And she's a bride.
dialog: 
scene_heading: END MUSIC.

dialog: 
dialog: (478)
scene_heading: EXT OFFICE BUILDING - ANOTHER DAY
dialog: 
text: Tom, in a suit, exits a building after another dismal
text: interview. We can see he is frustrated but not deterred. In
text: the distance, his favorite spot in the city, where he took
dialog: Summer ages ago.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - DAY
dialog: 
text: Tom walks over and sits down on a bench. He stares off, lost
text: in thought. And then, from out of nowhere, there's her voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER (V.O.)
dialog: Hey.
dialog: 
text: Summer sits like an apparition on a neighboring bench. She
text: may have just sat down, she may have been there for hours.
text: Tom isn't sure if she's real. He doesn't quite know what to
dialog: do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: (re: suit)
dialog: Where you coming from?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What? Oh. Nowhere. How long have
dialog: you been sitting there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: Awhile.
dialog: 
text: Tom finds it hard to look at her.
dialog: 
dialog: 110.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: I come here a lot. I always loved
dialog: this place, ever since you brought
dialog: me here.
dialog: 
text: The mention of their past makes the atmosphere frosty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: So... I should probably say
dialog: congratulations.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: Probably. But only if you mean it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I don't know if I do honestly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: I understand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Yeah well...anyway...I hope you're
dialog: happy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: You really do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: God no.
dialog: 
text: They both laugh a little. The tension begins to dissipate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: How are you, Tom?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I'm good. Ish.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: That's good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Yeah I quit the office.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: Really? That's great! What are you
dialog: doing now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Mostly...sleeping. Breaking things.
dialog: 
text: Awkward silence.
dialog: 
dialog: 111.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: So who's the guy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: Who, my guy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Yeah... Wait. Don't tell me. I
dialog: don't want to know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: Tom...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: No really, I don't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: Ok.
dialog: 
text: More awkward silence. This one goes on a beat longer. And
speaker_heading: THEN:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: It's amazing to me. You're married.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: I know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You're not only someone's
dialog: girlfriend, your someone's wife!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: Pretty crazy, huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
speaker_heading: (SIGHS)
dialog: I'll never understand that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: Tom --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What's different now? How could
dialog: things change so quickly?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: I don't know. It just happened.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What happened?! That's what I don't
dialog: get.
dialog: 
dialog: 112.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: I... Tom...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What, tell me...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: I woke up one day and I knew.
dialog: 
text: Tom says nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: I knew I could promise him I'd feel
dialog: the same way every morning. In a
dialog: way that I... I never could with
dialog: you.
dialog: 
dialog: And there's not much else to say after that.
dialog: 
text: Tom gets up to leave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You know what sucks? Realizing that
dialog: everything you believe in is
dialog: complete bullshit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: What is?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Destiny, soulmates, true love. All
dialog: that stuff. It's nothing more than
dialog: silly childhood fairy tale
dialog: nonsense, isn't it? God!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: Tom, don't go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I should have listened to you,
dialog: Summer. You were right all along.
dialog: 
text: Summer takes a beat to let this hang there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: I was right?
dialog: 
text: And then, out of nowhere, she begins to hysterically laugh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What? This is funny?
dialog: 
dialog: 113.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: Tries to stop but it only makes it worse. Now's she's
text: completely cracking up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What are you laughing at?
dialog: 
text: And she can't stop. She's totally lost control.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (trying himself not to
speaker_heading: LAUGH)
dialog: You're a crazy person!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: Tom! You're the crazy person!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What are you talking about?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: One day I'm reading a book at the
dialog: corner deli and this guy sits down
text: and starts asking about it. Now
dialog: he's my husband!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: This is funny to you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: What would have happened if I went
dialog: to the movies instead? If I went
dialog: somewhere else for lunch? If I
dialog: showed up to eat ten minutes later?
dialog: Tom, it was meant to be, just like
dialog: you said. And as it was happening,
dialog: I knew it. I could feel it, sure as
dialog: the sun. And I kept thinking to
dialog: myself "Holy shit. Tom was right."
dialog: You were right about all of it.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: It just wasn't me you were right
dialog: about.
dialog: 
text: Tom is speechless. Summer takes his hand. We may notice her
dialog: wedding ring. We may also notice that this is the same exact
text: shot as the first scene of the screenplay. We hold it for a
text: few seconds more. And then, the hands separate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: Anyway, I should probably be
dialog: getting back. It was good to see
dialog: you. I'm glad you're well.
dialog: 
dialog: 114.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Summer gets up and starts walking away from him. After a
speaker_heading: SECOND:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Summer!
dialog: 
text: She stops and turns back. He takes in her face, most likely
dialog: for the last time ever.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I really do hope you're happy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUMMER
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: See you later.
dialog: 
text: And she walks away. The CAMERA TRACKS AWAY with her, leaving
text: Tom alone in the park, getting smaller and farther away every
dialog: second.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A FEW SECONDS OF BLACK, BEFORE...

scene_heading: INT OFFICE WAITING AREA - DAY
dialog: 
text: Tom, in a suit, with a hefty batch of architecture sketches
text: at his side, waits in the foyer of Allen, Prince, and Gethers
dialog: Architecture. From the room we can tell this firm is big
dialog: time.
dialog: 
text: Tom waits.
dialog: 
text: We notice, before he does, a VERY CUTE GIRL sitting in a
text: another chair, also waiting. She smiles. He smiles back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Are you here to interview?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Sorry?
dialog: 
dialog: 115.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Are you interviewing? For the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Oh. Yeah. Why, are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Yup.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Ah. My competition.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: It would appear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Gee, this is a little awkward.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Yes it is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Well, I hope you don't get it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: I hope you don't get it.
text: They both laugh. There's a silence for a few beats. And it's
dialog: during this time that something weird comes over Tom and we
text: can visibly see it in his face. He likes the look of this
dialog: girl. This girl is cute. He'd like to talk more with her.
text: And, honestly, he's a little surprised by it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: So, uh...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Hmm?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Are you from...California?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Grew up not too far from here.
text: Atherton, near Stanford.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I know Atherton. Nice area.

speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Have I seen you before?

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I, uh, don't know. I don't think
dialog: so.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Do you go to St. Patrick's? Not to
dialog: pray or anything but to stand
dialog: outside?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I do! I love that church. It's like
dialog: my favorite structure in the city.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: If only it wasn't near that
dialog: horrible mirrored thing...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Yes! Exactly. I totally agree!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I think I've seen you there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You have? Really? Hmm. I didn't see

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: It happens. You probably weren't

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 
text: He starts to go. But halfway through the doorway, he pauses
text: and looks back at the girl.
dialog: 
dialog: 117.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: If Tom had learned anything... it
dialog: was that you can't ascribe great
dialog: cosmic significance to a simple
dialog: earthly event. Coincidence. That's
dialog: all anything ever is. Nothing more
dialog: than coincidence.
dialog: 
text: ANIMATION. 1 second clip of the colored sequence. Real fast.
text: Hardly noticeable. But it's there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: It took a long time but Tom had
dialog: finally learned. There are no
dialog: miracles. There's no such thing as
dialog: fate. Nothing is meant to be. He
dialog: knew. He was sure of it now.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Tom was...
dialog: 
text: Tom turns back around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: ...pretty sure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: When this is over... uh... would

speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Oh. I'm sorta supposed to meet

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
speaker_heading: (DEFLATED)
dialog: Oh. Got it... No problem.
dialog: 
text: He turns back around and shakes that off, tries to refocus on
text: the task at hand. A job interview. And then he hears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Ok.
dialog: 
text: Tom turns back around.
dialog:

dialog: Why not?

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Yeah?

dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Great! So... I'll wait for you

dialog: or...something.
dialog: 
text: She laughs. She's cute when she laughs.

speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: We'll figure it out.
