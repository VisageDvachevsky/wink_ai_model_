speaker_heading: McCROSKEY
dialog: Look, Rex -- I want you to get on the horn
dialog: and talk this guy down! You're going to

dialog:

speaker_heading: KRAMER

dialog: 
text: The Air Controller's hand is now inside his pants

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KRAMER
dialog: Before we start, I'd like to say

dialog: must look pretty rough up there.
dialog: 
text: The Air Controller is now hopping around with both hands
text: inside his pants.

speaker_heading: STRIKER

scene_heading: INT. CHICAGO DISPATCH - NIGHT
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KRAMER

speaker_heading: KRAMER
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: All right, Striker, now you listen to me
dialog: and you listen close. Flying is no
dialog: different than riding a bicycle...it just
dialog: happens to be a lot harder to put baseball
dialog: cards in the spokes. Now, if you just
dialog: follow my instructions...

scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

dialog: First, I want you to familiarize yourself

dialog:

speaker_heading: KRAMER
dialog: All right. Now I'd like you to disengage

scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KRAMER (v.o.)
dialog: (matter of factly)
dialog: Just remember, the controls will feel very
text: heavy compared to a fighter.
dialog: 
text: Striker is fighting the wheel and the autopilot which is
text: drifting in his way. Finally, he throws the autopilot to the
text: rear of the cockpit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KRAMER (v.o.)
dialog: Don't worry about that. It's perfectly
dialog: normal. You must watch your airspeed
dialog: closely. Don't let it fall below 520. Both
dialog: your rudder pedals and elevator trim will
dialog: have additional play due to increased
dialog: drag, but you can compensate by lowering
dialog: manifold pressure below 154. Now there's
dialog: one other thing. Have you someone up there
dialog: who can work the radio and leave you free
dialog: for flying?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STRIKER
dialog: Yes! The stewardess is here with me!
dialog: 
text: Elaine rises. The autopilot is on her back, its hands

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KRAMER (v.o.)
