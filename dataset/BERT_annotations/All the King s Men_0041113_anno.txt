text: Jack Burden is looking over the morning edition of "The

speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Burden! Jack Burden! The boss wants
dialog: to see you.
text: He folds his paper, rises, and walks by the presses into

dialog: Interior: Madison's Office, Day
text: Madison, the city editor, is correcting copy at his desk.
speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: Hey, Jack, ever hear of a fellow
dialog: called Willie Stark?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No. Who'd he shoot?
speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: Oh, county... uh... treasurer, or
dialog: something like that.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What's so special about him?
speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: They say he's an honest man. What I
dialog: want you to do is to hop into your
dialog: car...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why, you promised me a vacation.
speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: Well, that can wait.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah... but there's a... a girl I
dialog: know.
text: He opens his newspaper to the society page and shows Madison
text: a photograph of Anne Stanton.
speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: Oh... Well, she can wait too.
text: Jack takes the paper back and looks at it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The question is... can I?
speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: The answer is... get up there.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Right.
dialog: (starts to go)
dialog: Oh... uh... what did you say his
dialog: name was?
speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The fellow's name.

text: As Jack Burden's jalopy pulls up before the Kanoma County
text: Courthouse of this back-country, one-street small town.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (voice over)
dialog: I found him in Kanoma City. A typical,
text: hot, dusty, backwoods county seat.
text: He gets out of the car, and notices a crowd of people gathered
text: around a platform in the town square. As he walks over the
text: begins to hear the words that Willie Stark is speaking.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: ...to lie to them in order to line
dialog: their own dirty pockets with the
dialog: taxpayers' money. When have the
dialog: citizens of Kanoma County ever
dialog: witnessed a campaign like this? Why
dialog: is the opposition so anxious to defeat
dialog: me? Why have they used every dirty
dialog: method known to make sure I'm not
dialog: elected county treasurer? Well, I'll
dialog: tell you why...
text: A man in shirt sleeves and suspenders, Tiny Duffy, comes out
text: of the local poolroom, listens for a moment to Willie's
text: speech, and signals to two uniformed men to go over and break
text: up the gathering.
text: Jack Burden stands close to the platform, next to Willie's
text: son, Tom, who waits patiently to distribute handbills.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: ...Because they're afraid of the
dialog: truth... and the truth is this.
dialog: They're trying to steal your money.
dialog: Yeah, I said steal. The county
dialog: commissioners rejected the bid on
dialog: the schoolhouse. Why? Well, they'll
dialog: tell you their reason is the job
dialog: will be done better. The county
dialog: commissioners would have you believe
dialog: that they're interested in public
dialog: welfare. They're interested in
dialog: welfare, sure. But it's their own.
dialog: Let's look at the reason in the light
dialog: of the facts and the figures. That
dialog: brick factory is owned by one of the
dialog: commissioners. That same brick factory
dialog: uses convict labor.
text: The sheriff and his deputy push through the crowd.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Sorry, Willie, you'll have to move
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: City Ordinance Number One-Oh-Five:
text: more than five people congregating
dialog: is disturbing the peace.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: (ignores him)
dialog: If you folks'll be so kind as to
dialog: read these handbills, my boy will
dialog: pass them out among you.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: There's an ordinance against that
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: (his face grim)
dialog: Pass 'em out, Tom.
text: The sheriff pushes Tom back, grabbing the handbills out of
text: his hand. Willie jumps down off the platform.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Let him alone!
text: The sheriff collars Willie, then notices Jack on the platform
text: snapping a picture.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: (to deputy)
dialog: Get that camera! Willie, you're under
dialog: arrest.
text: He takes Willie by the arm and leads him away. The crowd
text: follows them to the courthouse. Tiny Duffy wipes the sweat
text: off his neck and goes back into the poolroom.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: Interior: Kanoma City Poolroom, Day
text: Two of Duffy's men, Pillsbury and a local commissioner, are
text: playing pool as Jack enters.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Where can I find Tiny Duffy?
speaker_heading: PILLSBURY
dialog: Right over there, mister.
text: He walks over to Duffy. Some townspeople, who followed him
text: there, gather around him to listen.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Uh, they told me I could get my camera
dialog: back here.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Who told you that?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: People. Can I?
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: You the reporter that's been snoopin'
dialog: around town?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Are you Tiny Duffy?
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: What paper?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Chronicle.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: You sure come a long way to stick
dialog: your nose into other people's
dialog: business.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That's true... Only my boss on the
dialog: paper can't see it that way.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: It ain't any of his business either.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Whose business is it?
speaker_heading: PILLSBURY
dialog: Them as is tendin' to it. County
dialog: commissioners that the voters of
dialog: Kanoma County elected to tend to
dialog: their business and not take no buttin'
dialog: in from nobody.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You a commissioner?
speaker_heading: PILLSBURY
dialog: Yeah. Name's Pillsbury. Dolph
dialog: Pillsbury.
speaker_heading: 2ND COMMISSIONER
dialog: Me too. I'm a commissioner too.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Who isn't a commissioner?
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: He's the head man.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to Pillsbury)
dialog: Then you're in a position to know
dialog: where --
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: He's in a position to know nothin'.
dialog: And to say nothin'.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I thought you said he was head man?
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: He uses my head.
speaker_heading: PILLSBURY
dialog: (laughing loudly)
dialog: Oh, Tiny, you're a card... Ain't he
dialog: a card? Yeah, he's a card... Now,
dialog: who thought up those city ordinances
dialog: about arresting someone for making a
dialog: speech?
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Who's arrested? Nobody's been
dialog: arrested.
dialog: (looks toward the
dialog: door)
dialog: Hi, Willie.
text: Willie enters, accompanied by the sheriff and his deputy.
text: The others in the room, including Sugar Boy in his bartender's
text: apron, step aside to let him pass through.
speaker_heading: PILLSBURY
dialog: Hi, Willie.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: (to Sheriff)
dialog: Did you apologize to Willie?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: (mumbles)
dialog: Yeah, I apologized to Willie.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Did you give him his handbills back?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Yeah, I gave 'em back.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Give him back his flag and his bag
dialog: and...
dialog: (points to Jack)
dialog: give this man his camera.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: I'm going to be on that same street
dialog: corner tomorrow, Mr. Duffy.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: You go right ahead, Willie. We all
dialog: believe in free speech. We got to...
dialog: it's in the Constitution.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: My boy is out distributing those
text: handbills now.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: It's a free country, Willie. If you
dialog: can convince the people to vote for
dialog: you... you go right ahead.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: What did you want to see me about,
dialog: Mr. Duffy?
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: I wanted you to meet a fella came
dialog: all the way up from the state capital
dialog: to meet you. A reporter. Wants to
dialog: write you up... maybe put your picture
dialog: in the paper.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: (turns to Jack)
dialog: I'm happy to know you, sir.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Burden's my name... Jack Burden. Can
dialog: we go somewhere where we can talk?
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Now that ain't polite. Don't you
dialog: want to hear both sides of the story?
text: Jack examines the camera that has just been returned to him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I know your side.
dialog: (finds the plate
dialog: missing)
dialog: What happened to the plate your men
dialog: took from my camera?
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Must have dropped out. Oh, come on,
dialog: fellas, let's relax. It's a hot day...
dialog: Hey, Sugar Boy...
speaker_heading: SUGAR BOY
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Bring some cold beer for the boys.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: None for me, thank you kindly.
speaker_heading: PILLSBURY
dialog: Now you know Willie don't drink,
dialog: Tiny. His wife don't favor drinking.
dialog: And Willie's the teacher's pet, ain't
dialog: you, Willie?
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: I'll have some orange pop if you
dialog: don't mind.
text: Duffy roars with laughter.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Orange pop! All right, Sugar Boy.
dialog: Bring him some orange pop.
speaker_heading: SUGAR BOY
dialog: (stutters)
dialog: Th-th-the p-p-pop's s-s-sold out.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Did you hear that, boys? The p-p-
dialog: pop's s-s-sold out.
text: They all laugh.
speaker_heading: PILLSBURY
dialog: Now ain't he a card?
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: (his face hard)
dialog: He stutters, Mr. Duffy, but you...
dialog: you don't say anything.
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: Let's go, mister.
text: They turn and go out.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: Exterior: Dirt Road, Day
text: Jack is driving Willie home to his farmhouse. They pass a

text: smiles and waves to them.
dialog: Exterior: Stark Farmhouse, Day
text: As the car pulls into the drive we see Pa Stark in his rocking
text: chair on the porch, and Lucy, who stands at the top of the
text: steps, waiting to welcome Willie.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: (as they go up the
dialog: steps)
dialog: This is my wife, Lucy, Mr. Burden.
speaker_heading: JACK AND LUCY
dialog: How do you do?
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: That's my pa.
text: Jack reaches out to shake his hand.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: Interior: Stark Farmhouse, Night
text: Willie finishes chewing his food, pats his mouth with a
text: napkin, and pushes his plate back.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Now we'll talk.
text: Camera pulls back to include Jack, Lucy, and Pa, all seated
text: around the dinner table.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You've been talking for a long time,
dialog: Mr. Stark.
speaker_heading: PAPPY
dialog: Willie's got a lot to say.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: You sleepy, Pappy? You want to have
dialog: a nap?
speaker_heading: PAPPY
dialog: No, I want to hear it.
text: Lucy gets up and turns on a light in the kitchen.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I'm worried about Tom. It's getting
text: dark. He should have been home.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: He's a strong boy. Don't worry about
dialog: him. He can take care of himself.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How old is the boy?
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Fifteen.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How long have you been married?
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Nine years.
text: Willie grins at Jack's look of surprise. Lucy comes back
text: into the room.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: He was a neighbor's boy. They were
dialog: poor folks. Both died. I couldn't
dialog: have any children, so... He's a good
dialog: boy.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Oh, he's the best. I couldn't love
dialog: him any more if he was my own flesh
dialog: and blood.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to Lucy)
dialog: And now you, Mrs. Stark?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Oh, there isn't very much to tell
dialog: about me.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How did you meet?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I was teaching school and one day a
dialog: pupil walked in. It was Willie. I
dialog: couldn't have a grown man in the
dialog: class and Willie wanted to learn so
dialog: badly... so I married him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Is that the only reason?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (pressing Willie's
dialog: arm)
dialog: Except that I loved him.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Get the coffee, Lucy.
text: She goes back into the kitchen.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: When did they fire you, Mrs. Stark?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (as she serves the
dialog: coffee)
dialog: A couple of weeks ago. I'd been
dialog: teaching for a long time and nobody
dialog: ever said I wasn't all right. But I
dialog: don't care. I don't want to teach in
dialog: a schoolhouse that they built just
dialog: so somebody can steal some money.
dialog: And Willie doesn't want to be
dialog: Treasurer, either, if he has to
dialog: associate with those dishonest people.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: (glumly)
dialog: I'm going to run. They can't keep me
dialog: from running.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: If you don't mind the truth, Mr.
dialog: Stark, you haven't much of a chance.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: I'm going to run. They're not going
dialog: to kick me around like I was dirt.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I don't care if Willie loses... just
dialog: so he gets the truth to the people.
dialog: Isn't that true, Willie?
text: Willie is silent. Jack looks at him.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Isn't it, Willie?
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Hmmm?... Yeah, yeah, sure, that's
dialog: right.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Well, if you lose you can give a
dialog: little more time to studying your
dialog: law books.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, you studying law too?
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: By myself, at night.
speaker_heading: PAPPY
dialog: Willie's a smart boy.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: If I ever find the time I'm going to
dialog: take a course at the university.
text: The door opens slowly and Tom comes in from the porch. His
text: clothes are torn and his face is dirty and bloody. He still
text: carries some of the handbills. They rise to their feet and
text: cluster around him.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: What happened, Tommy boy? What's the
dialog: matter?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (head down, muttering)
dialog: I gave out the handbills, Pa.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Speak up. Speak up.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Let him tell it his own way. Go on,
dialog: Tommy.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: This time they were waiting for me.
dialog: They took them away from me. Threw
dialog: them in the dirt and beat me up. I
dialog: brought some of them back.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: (pats him on the back)
dialog: Good boy. Have you eaten yet, Tom?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Let him wash up first.
text: As Tom and Pappy go into the other room, a rock comes crashing
text: through the front window, shattering the glass. Willie, his
text: face filled with anger, throws open the door and stalks out
text: onto the porch. Jack stands at the door, watching Willie
text: shout into the darkness around him.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: I'm going to run... and you're not
dialog: going to stop me. I'm gonna run even
dialog: if I don't get a single vote.

speaker_heading: FADE IN:

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Here you are... the last of the Willie
dialog: Stark articles. Now can I go?
speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: Yes. You've earned your vacation.

speaker_heading: JACK

dialog: I hadn't been home in a long time.
dialog: Only a hundred and thirty miles from

dialog: the first time I wondered if it wasn't

dialog: How do I look, Jackie boy?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You look beautiful, Mother.
speaker_heading: MRS. BURDEN
dialog: I've got so many things planned for
dialog: you... parties and... it'll be just
dialog: like old times. But first, let's
dialog: have a drink.
speaker_heading: MCEVOY
dialog: Can't that wait until this evening?
text: She goes ahead and pours the drinks.
speaker_heading: MRS. BURDEN
dialog: Floyd... honey... my son's home.
speaker_heading: MCEVOY
dialog: How long do you plan on staying?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (coldly)
dialog: Two or three weeks. If that's all
dialog: right with you.
speaker_heading: MRS. BURDEN
dialog: I'm sure your father would be --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Stepfather, Mother.
speaker_heading: MRS. BURDEN
dialog: (reproachfully)
dialog: Now, Jackie... here we all are. Floyd,
dialog: Jackie, myself.
text: (raises her glass for
dialog: a toast)
dialog: To the best time we've ever had
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: JACK

text: They drink. Mrs. Burden gulps hers down avidly. Jack looks
text: at her and then at McEvoy.
speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: STANTON

dialog: Is my shingle showing?
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Good to see you, boy. Very good.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Good to see you, Judge. How have you
dialog: been? What have you been doing?
text: They walk back together to the patio tables.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Oh, just sitting here... waiting for
dialog: all of you to come home. You know,
text: when a man starts to get old his
text: eyes stray and play funny tricks on
dialog: him. As I watched you in that boat I
dialog: thought sure I saw a boy of twelve
text: with a fishing rod in his hands. And
dialog: I was sure the first thing he'd say
dialog: would be...
text: Jack catches sight of Anne Stanton walking down the path. He
text: runs to meet her. As they embrace, he looks back at the Judge.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Do you mind if I kiss your niece,
dialog: sir?
text: He kisses her, and they turn and walk away.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Thank you, Mother. Thank you very
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: MRS. BURDEN

text: Jack looks at Anne.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: We were just discussing whether you
dialog: should...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to his mother)
dialog: I like what I'm doing, Mother.
speaker_heading: MCEVOY
dialog: You do very well at it. I read your
dialog: articles about this fellow... Willie
dialog: Stark. Very convincing... Too
dialog: convincing for my tastes.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: A lot of people like them.
speaker_heading: MCEVOY
dialog: A lot of people are fools. Articles
dialog: like that shouldn't be permitted.
dialog: They only tend to incite people.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What are you afraid of?
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: I thought they were very good. I was
dialog: proud of you, Jack. I was particularly
dialog: interested in Stark's ideas on health
dialog: and medicine. You know the conditions
dialog: at the hospital I work in. They're
dialog: intolerable. I'd like to meet this
dialog: Willie Stark. He sounds like an honest
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: MCEVOY
dialog: Honest man? This state is full of
dialog: these log-cabin Abe Lincolns with
text: price tags on them. The louder he
dialog: yells the higher his price.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You think you can buy anything, don't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: MCEVOY
dialog: Yes, don't you?
text: There is a silence. Then McEvoy turns to the Judge.
speaker_heading: MCEVOY
dialog: What do you think, Judge?
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I think this state could stand a few
dialog: changes.
speaker_heading: MCEVOY
dialog: (his face white)
dialog: Well, I'll tell you what I think --
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Oh, please... let's not talk politics.
speaker_heading: MRS. BURDEN
dialog: Anne is right. I absolutely forbid
dialog: any more of it. I know what we need,
dialog: we need another toast.
dialog: (to the Judge)
dialog: You propose it, Monty... you're so
dialog: good at it.
text: The Judge picks up his glass and stands up.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: To the young people... to Anne, to
dialog: Jack, to Adam... To what lies before
dialog: them. To the world they'll make...
dialog: in spite of the mistakes we've made.
speaker_heading: MCEVOY
dialog: (rising)
dialog: The mistakes you've made, not me.
dialog: You're all still pretty high and
dialog: mighty, aren't you? You all think
dialog: this state needs a change. You don't
dialog: like the way it's run. Well, who's
dialog: going to run it? Willie Stark? The
dialog: Judge?
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: You? You can be bought too. As a
dialog: matter of fact you have been. And
dialog: with my money.
text: Jack's answer is to throw his liquor in his stepfather's
text: face. There is a pause. McEvoy wipes the liquor off with his
dialog: handkerchief.
speaker_heading: MCEVOY
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: That's a waste of good liquor.
dialog: (looks at Mrs. Burden)
dialog: Your mother wouldn't approve.

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Apologize? I'd rather die.
speaker_heading: MRS. BURDEN
dialog: I've got to live with him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, I don't. Neither do you. You
dialog: don't love him, Mother. You never
dialog: did.
speaker_heading: MRS. BURDEN
dialog: Son, don't spoil anything now... He
dialog: can help you.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I can get along without him. You
dialog: need this house. And the parties.
dialog: And the cars and the clothes and the
dialog: lies. I don't. It's the truth, Mother,
dialog: face it. For once in your life, face
dialog: it.

speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: (from the steps)
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: WILLIE'S VOICE
dialog: ...So get ready to laugh.
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: What's he up to?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Shut up!
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Get ready to bust your sides laughing,
dialog: 'cause it's sure a funny story. It's
dialog: about a hick... a hick like you, if
dialog: you please. Yeah, like you. He grew
text: up on the dirt roads and gully washes
dialog: of a farm. He knew what it was to
dialog: get up before dawn and get feed and
dialog: slop and milk before breakfast...
dialog: and then set out before sunup and
text: walk six miles to a one-room, slab-
dialog: sided schoolhouse. Oh, this hick
dialog: knew what it was to be a hick, all
dialog: right. He figured if he was going to
dialog: get anything done, he had to do it
dialog: himself. So he sat up nights and
dialog: studied books. He studied law because
dialog: he thought he might be able to change
dialog: things some... for himself, and for
dialog: folks like him.
text: Sugar Boy listens intently, sharing in the anger in Willie's
dialog: speech.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: No, I'm not going to lie to you. He
dialog: didn't start off thinking about the
dialog: hicks and all the wonderful things
dialog: he was going to do for them. No. No,
dialog: he started off thinking of number
text: one. But something came to him on
dialog: the way. How he could do nothing for
dialog: himself without the help of the
dialog: people. That's what came to him. And
dialog: it also came to him, with the powerful
dialog: force of God's own lightning, back
dialog: in his home country, when a
dialog: schoolhouse collapsed because it was
text: built of politics... rotten brick.
text: It killed and mangled a dozen kids.
dialog: But you know that story. The people
dialog: were his friends because he fought
dialog: that rotten brick. And some of the
dialog: politicians down in the city, they
dialog: knew that... So they rode up to his
text: house in a big, fine, shiny car and
dialog: said as how they wanted him to run
dialog: for governor...
text: Jack, electrified, grips Sadie's arm.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sadie, he's wonderful... wonderful...
text: Duffy fidgets as Willie continues to pace and speak, his
text: face filled with conviction, and with fury.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: ...So they told the hick... and he
text: swallowed it. He looked in his heart
dialog: and he thought in all humility how
dialog: he'd like to try and change things.
dialog: He was just a country boy who thought
dialog: that even the plainest, poorest man
dialog: can be governor if his fellow citizens
dialog: find he's got the stuff for the job.
dialog: Well, those fellows in the striped
dialog: pants... they saw the hick and they
dialog: took him in.
text: He points his finger at Duffy, who is coming over to speak
dialog: to him.

speaker_heading: WILLIE

dialog: the crowd.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Now, shut up! Shut up, all of you.
dialog: Now, listen to me, you hicks. Yeah,
dialog: you're hicks too, and they fooled
dialog: you a thousand times, just like they

text: Shots of uniformed policemen roughing up citizens. Willie
text: and Sugar Boy move in on a man being held by cops.
text: Willie looks on as Jack thumbs through his little black book.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (voice over)
dialog: Politics is a dirty game... and he
dialog: played it rough and dirty. Willie's
dialog: little black book was a record of
dialog: sin and corruption. And me, Jack
dialog: Burden? I kept the book and added up
dialog: the accounts.
text: Willie in a nightclub, surrounded by some show girls. A

text: Willie leads a marching band out onto a football field.
speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: WILLIE

speaker_heading: JACK

dialog: building...

speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: (through open door)
dialog: You low-down, no-good redneck...
text: She slams the door hard. We hear Willie laugh.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to secretary)
dialog: What goes on here?
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: That's what Sadie wants to know.
dialog: (she shows Jack
dialog: newspaper containing
dialog: photograph of Willie
dialog: at the nightclub)
text: The boss poses for too many pictures.
text: Jack grins, then walks into Sadie's office.
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: I'll kill him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why, Sadie, I'm surprised at you.
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: I'll kill him.
text: She goes to the door to yell to the secretary.
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: I hate all women.
text: She slams the door again, and returns to her desk.
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: Was she pretty?
text: Jack shoves the paper at her. She ignores it.
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: Was she pretty?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: If I met her on the street I'd never
dialog: recognize her.
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: Was she pretty?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How should I know? I wasn't looking
dialog: at her face... Look, if it's going
dialog: to cause all this grief, why don't
dialog: you let him go?
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: Let him go? I'll kill him. I'll drive
dialog: him out of this state.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Just because a guy's sitting with a
text: couple of girls on his knees in
dialog: public...
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: Public or private... I know him. How
dialog: about what happened in Chicago? That
dialog: girl on skates... and the time you
dialog: both went to St. Louis... There's a
dialog: new invention, you know, Photography
text: and newsreels. Willie Stark in a
text: nightclub... Willie Stark with a
dialog: blonde.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You could always bleach your hair.
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: I could also break every bone in his
dialog: neck. After all I've done for him...
dialog: Now he goes two-timing me.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: He's been two-timing Lucy. So there's
dialog: another kind of arithmetic for what
dialog: he's doing to you.
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: Lucy?
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: If she had her way he'd be back in
dialog: Kanoma City slopping the hogs right
dialog: now. And he knows it. He knows what
dialog: she'd do for him. She had her chance.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You seem to think Lucy's on her way
dialog: out, don't you?
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: He'll ditch her... Give him time.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You ought to know.
text: She slaps his face.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey, you got the wrong guy. I'm not
dialog: the hero of this piece.
text: The door to Willie's office bursts open and Willie dashes
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: All right, come on, both of you.
dialog: Let's go, hurry it up.
text: They go out through the reception room, pick up Sugar Boy,
text: and head down the corridor.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
text: Come on. Pillsbury put his hand in
dialog: the pork barrel and got caught. You
dialog: know, I never did trust that guy.
text: Some newsmen are waiting on the top landing.
speaker_heading: NEWSMEN
dialog: Have you heard about Pillsbury? What
dialog: do you intend to do about Pillsbury?
dialog: How about it, Governor?
text: Willie pushes by them.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Later, boys, later.
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: Say, Jack, go back and get the Judge.
dialog: Let's get him over to my hotel just

speaker_heading: ANNE

dialog: Hello.
dialog: (back to Willie)
dialog: You promised we could... uh... discuss
dialog: my charity project... Children's
dialog: home?
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Well, I'm very sorry. Something very
dialog: important came up. You'll call me
dialog: later, won't you?
speaker_heading: ANNE

speaker_heading: SADIE

text: Sugar Boy are also in the room.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Look at you, Pillsbury. Fifty years
text: old, gut-sprung, teeth gone, never
dialog: had a dime. If the Almighty had
dialog: intended for you to be rich he'd
dialog: have taken care of that a long time
dialog: ago. The idea of you being rich...
dialog: that's plain blasphemy. Ain't that a
dialog: fact?
text: Pillsbury doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Answer me!
speaker_heading: PILLSBURY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Louder, man. Don't mumble. Speak up.
dialog: Say it's a fact, a blasphemous fact.
speaker_heading: PILLSBURY
dialog: It's a fact, a blasphemous fact.
text: Sugar Boy laughs loudly. The phone rings and Sadie picks it
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: Yeah?... Oh, I see.
dialog: (hangs up)
dialog: Dumond can't come. He says his wife
dialog: is sick.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: I don't care if she's dying. Sugar,
dialog: get the car. Get him and bring him
dialog: over here.
text: Sugar Boy exists. Willie turns back to Pillsbury.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Now, you know what you're supposed
dialog: to do, don't you, Pillsbury? You're
dialog: supposed to stay poor and take orders.
dialog: Oh, there'll be some sweetening for
dialog: you from time to time... but Duffy'll
dialog: take care of that. Don't you go
dialog: setting yourself up on your own again,
dialog: do you understand that?
speaker_heading: PILLSBURY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Louder, man. And say, I understand
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: PILLSBURY
dialog: I understand that.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Give him a pen and some paper, Sadie.
text: There is a knock on the door.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: See who that is, Duffy.
text: Judge Stanton enters.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Oh, hello, Judge. Sit down. I'll be
dialog: with you in just a couple of seconds.
dialog: (back to Pillsbury)
dialog: Now write what I tell you to write...
dialog: Dear Governor Stark. I wish to resign
dialog: as auditor due to ill health, to
dialog: take effect as soon as you can relieve
dialog: me. Respectfully yours.
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: Did you sign it?
speaker_heading: PILLSBURY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: (roaring)
dialog: Well, sign it! Don't put any date on
dialog: it. I can fill that in when I need
dialog: it.
text: Pillsbury signs the paper.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Now bring it to me.
text: Pillsbury moves slowly, so Sadie yanks the paper out of his
text: hand and passes it to Willie.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Now get out.
text: Pillsbury slinks out of the room.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: The papers have the story.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Yeah, I know.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: They're talking about impeachment
dialog: proceedings.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: (rising)
dialog: Against who?
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: This time, Pillsbury.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: I got that "this time," Judge.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: How true is it?
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: It's too true.
text: The phone rings.
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: Yes?
dialog: (hands phone to Willie)
dialog: This is it, Willie. Jeff Hopkins on
dialog: the wire.
text: Willie takes the phone, but puts his hand over the mouthpiece
text: so that he can speak to Jack.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: What have we got on Hopkins, Jack?
dialog: (as Jack riffles
dialog: through the black
dialog: book)
dialog: Hello, Jeff. About that Pillsbury
dialog: business...
dialog: (reads from black
dialog: book Jack holds out
dialog: for him)
dialog: Here's what I want you to do when it
text: comes up in the legislature. Now,
dialog: wait a minute, wait a minute. You
dialog: listen to me.
dialog: (still reading from
dialog: book)
dialog: You got a mortgage coming due on
dialog: that place of yours in about five
dialog: weeks, haven't you? You'd like to
dialog: get it renewed, wouldn't you?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: All right, Tiny'll talk to you in
dialog: the morning.
text: He grins and hangs up the phone.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Get going, Tiny.
text: Duffy leaves.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: You haven't answered my question.
dialog: Why are you saving Pillsbury's hide?
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: I'm not a bit interested in
dialog: Pillsbury's hide. It's something
dialog: much more important than that. If
dialog: the McMurphy boys get the notion
dialog: they can get away with this, there's
dialog: no telling where they'll stop.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Or where you will... Pillsbury is
dialog: guilty. As attorney general of this
dialog: state, it's my job to prosecute.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Judge, you talk like Pillsbury was...
dialog: was human. He isn't. He's a thing.
dialog: You don't prosecute an adding machine
dialog: if the spring goes busted and makes
dialog: a mistake. You fix it. Well, I fixed
dialog: him. I'm not a bit interested in
dialog: Pillsbury. It's something much bigger
dialog: than that.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: Yes, it is.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: He's right, Judge. Can't you see
dialog: that he's right?
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: He's right because you want him to
dialog: be right. Because you're afraid to
dialog: admit you've made a mistake. Do it
dialog: now before it's too late.
dialog: (to Willie)
dialog: I'm offering my resignation as
dialog: attorney general. You'll have it in
dialog: writing by messenger in the morning...
dialog: dated.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: It took you a long time to make up
dialog: your mind, Judge. A long time. What
dialog: made you take such a long time?
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I wasn't sure.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: And now you are?
text: The Judge nods.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: I'll tell you what you are. You're
dialog: scared. You sat in that big easy
dialog: chair of yours for thirty years and
dialog: played at being a judge. Then all of
dialog: a sudden I came along and put a bat
dialog: in your hand, and I said, go ahead,
dialog: Judge, start swinging. And you did.
dialog: And you had a wonderful time. But
dialog: now you're scared. You don't want to
dialog: get your hands dirty. You want to
dialog: pick up the marbles... but you don't
dialog: want to get your hands dirty. Look
dialog: at my whole program, Judge. How do
dialog: you think I put that across?
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I knew how, but I never knew why.
text: He starts to leave.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: You're not by any chance thinking of
text: going over to McMurphy's boys, are
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I'm through with politics.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: I'm happy to hear that.
dialog: (extends his hand)
dialog: No hard feelings.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: (ignores the hand)
dialog: Goodbye, Governor.
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: Are you coming with me, Jack?
text: Jack turns away.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: You're making a mistake.
text: He goes. Willie closes the door behind him.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Do you think he means it when he
dialog: says he's through with politics,
dialog: Sadie?
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: No. No, I don't.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: What about you, Jack?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I've known the Judge all my life.
dialog: He's always meant everything he's
dialog: said.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: All right. All right. Take it easy.
dialog: I'll take your word for it.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Sugar, take Miss Stanton home.
dialog: (to Anne)
dialog: When am I going to see you again?
text: She doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: What's the matter, Anne?
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Please take me home now, Sugar Boy.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: You've got to understand me.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: (turns away)
dialog: I understand you. It's myself I don't
dialog: understand.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Do you think I like sneaking around
dialog: corners any more than you do? But
dialog: right now, with the Pillsbury business
dialog: and with your uncle quitting... If I
dialog: got a divorce...
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Maybe we'd better stop seeing each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: No. No, we won't stop seeing each
dialog: other, will we?
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Because you believe in what I tell
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: (puts her hand on his)
dialog: Because I believe what you tell me.
text: Sadie approaches.
speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: Good evening, Governor Stark.
text: (looks at Anne, but

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't want to know, but I've got
dialog: to.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Did he tell you --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Did who tell me?
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: I don't know. I... how should I know
dialog: if the Judge was ever broke?

speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: Hello... Come on, Anne, take this

dialog: some glasses, Anne, quick.
text: He joins Adam, who has opened the piano.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: (laughing)

speaker_heading: JACK

text: Another glass, Anne, for a ghost.
speaker_heading: STANTON

speaker_heading: ANNE

dialog: Adam... ghost... and me.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: What shall we drink to?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: To the ghost?... To Adam, to the
dialog: director of the new medical center.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: (bangs the piano keys)
dialog: Don't you ever stop working for him?
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Adam!
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: I came up here to get away...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm sorry, Adam.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Well, I'm not. What's wrong with
dialog: being the director of the new medical
dialog: center?
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: Nothing, except that I'm not going
dialog: to take it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why? Because your uncle resigned?
speaker_heading: STANTON

speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: What other things?
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: (looks at her)
dialog: You too?
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Yes, me too.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Anne, if Adam doesn't want to discuss
dialog: it, let's not.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: All right, let's discuss it.
speaker_heading: ANNE
text: But calmly.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: Calmly. Go ahead, Jack. Why do you
dialog: think he wants me?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Because you're the best man for the
dialog: job.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: It could have nothing to do with my
dialog: name being Stanton?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It could have. Let's grant that.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: That's your answer.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, it's not. If that were the only
dialog: answer I wouldn't be with him any
text: more. There's another side of it.
dialog: I've learned something from him. You
dialog: can't make an omelet without cracking
dialog: eggs.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: Or heads.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: But at least a hospital will be built,
dialog: and the sick will be cared for.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: At what price?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: At any price.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: Do you really believe that, Jack?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I really believe that Stark wants to
dialog: do good. You do too. It's a matter
dialog: of method. Many times out of evil
dialog: comes good. Well, pain is an evil.
dialog: As a doctor you should know that.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: Pain is an evil; it is not evil. It
dialog: is not evil in itself. Stark is evil.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The people of the state don't think
dialog: so.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: How would they know? The first thing
dialog: he did was to take over the newspapers
dialog: and the radio stations. Why be so
dialog: afraid of criticism? If Stark is
dialog: interested in doing good, he should
dialog: also be interested in the truth. I
dialog: don't see how you can separate the
dialog: two. No, Stark is not for me.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: (upset)
dialog: No, Stark is not for you. Well, what
dialog: is for you? Pride. Pride, that's all
dialog: it is... foolish, stupid pride. All
dialog: you've ever talked about is what you
dialog: could do if... if somebody would
dialog: tear down and build. All right, all
dialog: right, somebody has, and he's given
dialog: it to you. But he's not for you. No,
dialog: he's not for you.

speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: Hmmm. Yeah, I can see it. I've got

speaker_heading: SADIE

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: SADIE

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: He ditched Lucy, he ditched me, and

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: SADIE

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: SADIE
dialog: You and your high-tone friends. What

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're crazy, Sadie. You're out of

speaker_heading: SADIE

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Tom, you're going to have to obey

speaker_heading: TOM

speaker_heading: STANTON

speaker_heading: WILLIE

speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: To do some good for the people of

speaker_heading: STANTON

speaker_heading: WILLIE

speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: If that's a threat, you're wasting

speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Yes, I know. I'll tell you what...

speaker_heading: JACK

dialog: Why not? You belong with him. Jack,
dialog: how could you have done it? When
dialog: Anne brought me those papers she
dialog: told me you promised not to tell
dialog: Stark until...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah. I know.
dialog: (walks away)
dialog: Well, I kept my promise.
text: Adam looks unbelievingly at Anne. She looks away.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: Anne? Anne?
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
dialog: Interior: Jack's Hotel Room (State Capital), Day
text: Jack looks out the window. A portable radio is blaring out
dialog: the news.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
dialog: From all over the state they're
text: streaming in. From the hill country
dialog: and farms, the lumber camps... by
text: boat, by train, by horse, and on
text: foot. Willie Stark's army.
text: Through Jack's window we see the street blocked with cars
text: and people, all headed for the State Capitol Building. Anne
text: is in the crowd, trying to get across the street. Seeing
text: Jack in the window, she pushes her way across and enters the
text: hotel. He slams the window shut and comes back into the room.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
text: The state capital is filled with
dialog: rumors, one of which is that Stark
text: is planning to seize power by force.
dialog: As commander of the state militia,
dialog: he has --
text: Jack turns it off. He goes over to his bed and starts putting
text: clothes into a valise. There is a knock on the door. He
text: ignores it. Another knock.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Come in. The door's open.
text: Anne enters.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Jack...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What do you want?
text: She starts to cry. He grabs her, pulling her face close to
dialog: his.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: No, I want to see you cry.
text: He lets her go and she falls to the bed, sobbing.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Stop it!
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: I called you. All afternoon I've
dialog: been calling you.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I know. I was here.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: You've got to tell Adam. You've got
dialog: to see him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Tell him what?
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: He knows about me and...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: About you and Willie?
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: (nods)
dialog: I tried to explain to him. I... I
dialog: tried to explain to him that it wasn't
dialog: the way he thought it was.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How was it, Anne? You tell me.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: He hit me, Jack. My own brother...
dialog: he hit me.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Your brother is an old-fashioned
dialog: man. He believes in his sister's
dialog: honor. Me, I'm a modern man.
text: (slams clothes into
dialog: the valise)
dialog: The twentieth-century type. I run.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: (rises)
dialog: I'm frightened, Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: For who? Your brother, or Willie?
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: We're through.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Who's through with who?
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: He called me this afternoon. He's
dialog: going back to Lucy. He said it was
dialog: better that way.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Better for who? Him.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Both of us.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Did he tell you that too when he
dialog: asked you to betray the Judge? At
dialog: least I walked out on him.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Oh Jack... help me, please, please.
dialog: Adam's all I've got left now. Oh,
dialog: Jack, if you ever loved me...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: If I ever loved you.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'll go find Adam.
text: He takes up his coat.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXTERIOR: HOSPITAL SITE, DAY
text: A large billboard. It reads HERE ON THIS SITE WILL BE ERECTED
scene_heading: THE GOVERNOR STARK HOSPITAL -- TO HEAL SICKNESS -- TO EASE
scene_heading: PAIN -- FREE. NOT AS A CHARITY BUT AS A RIGHT. WILLIE STARK
text: Adam enters, looks at the sign, and walks on.
dialog: Exterior: Street Near Capitol Building, Day
text: Crowds of people headed toward the building, some with WIN
text: WITH WILLIE signs. A marching band plays music for them.
dialog: Exterior: Capitol Building, Day
text: Crowd waiting outside the building. Mounted policemen keep
text: them in line. From a large platform, loaded with people,
text: comes the chant "We want Willie, we want Willie." Jack pushes
text: his way through the people and speaks to a policeman standing
text: guard on the Capitol steps.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Where do you think you're going?
dialog: (recognizes Jack)
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't recognize
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Do you know who Dr. Stanton is?
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Yes sir.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Did he try to come through here today?
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Haven't seen him, sir.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, can you check the other
dialog: entrances?
speaker_heading: 2ND COP
text: There's no other entrances today.
text: The other entrances are blocked off.
dialog: Orders are to take no chances.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: If you care to come inside and wait,
dialog: Mr. Burden, we can find you a seat.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, thanks. I'll wait out here. If
dialog: Dr. Stanton shows up, let me know.
dialog: Pass the word along to the boys,
dialog: will you?
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Yes sir.
text: Jack turns and looks at the large crowd. A voice from a public
text: address loudspeaker begins to yell out commands to the crowd.
speaker_heading: LOUDSPEAKER
dialog: All right now. Everybody... that
dialog: means everybody... let's let Willie
dialog: know we're here! All together: WE
text: WANT WILLIE. WE WANT WILLIE.
text: The chant is picked up enthusiastically by the crowd.
dialog: Interior: State Legislature, Day
text: The speaker is trying to speak over the clamor of the
text: chanting.
speaker_heading: SPEAKER
dialog: We will first proceed to take the
dialog: judgment of the senate on the question
dialog: of the impeachment of the governor.
speaker_heading: SENATOR
dialog: (rising)
dialog: Mr. Speaker, this is a farce to ask
dialog: us to vote in the face of the kind
dialog: of intimidation and pressure that
dialog: has been exerted here in the past
dialog: few weeks. Even that crowd outside,
dialog: yelling on cue, is part of that
dialog: pressure.
speaker_heading: CROWD NOISE
dialog: We want Willie. We want Willie.
text: Willie gets up, and goes to the window.
dialog: Exterior: State Capitol, Day
text: The crowd, with Jack in the foreground. The crowd suddenly
text: goes wild as they see Willie appear at the window. In the
text: growing darkness he seems only a shadowy figure as he raises
text: his hands to wave to the crowd.
text: We see various shots of people straining to get a little
text: closer to the steps in order to see him better. Willie then
text: turns and goes back into the room.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: Exterior: State Capitol, Day
text: The crowd again, still waiting. The camera pans upward to a
text: loudspeaker.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: Attention, please. Attention, please.
dialog: This is a special announcement from
dialog: Willie Stark to you people out there.
dialog: He doesn't want any one of you to
dialog: leave...
text: The camera moves over the faces of the people listening.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: He wants you to stay in front of
dialog: this state Capitol until the fight
dialog: is over. If you want Willie Stark to
dialog: win, stay where you are.
text: They cheer. Camera picks up Jack watching the crowd's
text: reaction, then up to a plaque over the entrance to the Capitol
text: Building. It reads THE PEOPLE'S WILL IS THE LAW OF THIS STATE --
scene_heading: GOVERNOR STARK.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: Do you hear me... stay where you
dialog: are. Don't go away. Stay where you
dialog: are. Don't go away.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: Exterior: State Capitol, Night
text: Newsmen, photographers stand about, bored. The crowd, every
text: bit as large, is quiet but expectant. Everyone holds still
text: as the announcer's voice is heard again.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: Attention, please. Attention, please.
dialog: The balloting on the impeachment
dialog: proceedings against Governor Stark
dialog: has just ended. This is the result:
dialog: Willie Stark has won.
text: The crowd explodes. People break through the police barriers.
text: Mounted policemen ride in quickly to prevent a riot. Camera
text: picks up Anne in the crowd, trying to push through.
text: Jack stands on the steps of the Capitol, watching it all.
text: Suddenly Willie appears at the top of the steps, followed by
text: Sugar Boy. Sadie, Duffy, Pillsbury follow close behind. Willie
text: grabs hold of the mike and addresses the suddenly hushed
dialog: crowd.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: They tried to ruin me. But they are
dialog: ruined. They tried to ruin me because
dialog: they did not like what I have done.
dialog: Do you like what I have done?
text: Loud applause, and cries of "yes."
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Remember, it's not I who have won,
dialog: but you. Your will is my strength,
dialog: and your need is my justice, and I
dialog: shall live in your right and your
dialog: will. And if any man tries to stop
dialog: me from fulfilling that right and
dialog: that will, I'll break him. I'll break
dialog: him with my bare hands. For I have
dialog: the strength of many.
text: Having finished, he waves at them all. Then he notices Jack
text: and comes down the steps to greet him.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Hello, Jack boy, I'm glad you're
dialog: here. I knew you'd come back.
text: He walks back up the steps, his arm around Jack's shoulders.
text: They start to go into the building that way when Willie sees
text: someone. He smiles and puts out his hand.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Oh, doctor, I'm very glad to see
dialog: you.
text: Adam is seen, waiting at the entrance of the building. Before
text: Willie has taken a step Adam fires several shots into him.
text: Willie falls to the ground and Sugar Boy whips out his pistol
text: and fires at Adam. Three policemen with tommy guns open fire,
text: shooting into Adam's already fallen body. Then they turn and
text: point their guns at the mob of people rushing toward Willie,
dialog: forcing them back.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Stand back, everybody. Stand back.
text: Sugar Boy kneels beside Willie. Sadie stands against a pillar,
text: looking down on him.
speaker_heading: SUGAR BOY
dialog: (nearly crying)
dialog: D-does it hurt m-much, boss? D-d-
dialog: does it hurt much?
text: Jack looks up to see Anne struggling through the screaming
text: mob to get to Adam. She looks at Adam for a moment, then
text: turns away.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Anne, Anne... Where are you going?
text: She doesn't answer, only walks away. He runs after her and
text: catches hold of her arm.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: I don't know. Leave me alone.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: To do what?
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: I don't care.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, that's too easy.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: I don't know, I don't know, I don't
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Leave me alone, please.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, no more.
speaker_heading: ANNE
text: He's dead.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We're alive.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: My brother's dead.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We've got to go on living.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: So that Adam's death has meaning, so
dialog: that it wasn't wasted. Anne, our
dialog: life has to give his death meaning.
dialog: Don't you see that? Look at those
dialog: people...
text: He turns her around so that she can see the crowds still
text: struggling to get a look at Willie.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Look at them! They still believe in
dialog: him. And we've got to make them see
dialog: Willie the way Adam saw him, or
dialog: there's no meaning in anything...
dialog: anything.
text: A policeman approaches.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Mr. Burden... the governor's asking
dialog: for you. You better hurry. He's going
dialog: fast.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to Anne)
dialog: Will you wait here?
dialog: No reply.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Will you wait here?
text: She nods her head slowly. Jack walks through the building to
text: the pillar against which Willie has been propped. Sugar Boy
text: is still beside him. He stands behind Sadie and Duffy, looking
text: down at Willie.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: It could have been the whole world,
dialog: Willie Stark. The whole world...
dialog: Willie Stark. Why did he do it to
dialog: me... Willie Stark? Why?
text: His head droops to the side and he dies.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
speaker_heading: THE END
