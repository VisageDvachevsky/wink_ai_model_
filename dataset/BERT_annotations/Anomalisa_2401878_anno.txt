speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: She's very nice. I just felt a

speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Really? Most people...like
dialog: Emily.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Here you go.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Thank you. (pause) Most people
dialog: don’t really like to look at me too
dialog: much because -- you know.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I think you’re lovely.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: No you don’t. I’ve always done
dialog: phone work because I’d never get
text: hired to work in a store. Ora
dialog: restaurant. Or --
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: How did it happen, if it’s okay for
dialog: me ask?
speaker_heading: LISA

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Oh my God. Oh my God. No. Oh God.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: You're not like a pervert or

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No.
scene_heading: Anomalisa ---Final Shoot_ v4 Rev. 10/4/15 40.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: I just don’t understand why you'd
dialog: want to kiss me there.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Because...because I like you.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Why? I mean, I’m not smart like
dialog: Emily. And I’m ugly. You’re a
dialog: really smart guy. You should like
dialog: Emily. I don’t even understand a
dialog: lot of the words in your book. I
dialog: sat there with a dictionary. I try
dialog: to learn. But I’m never going to
dialog: be smart. And I’m ugly.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I find it enormously charming that
dialog: you read any book with a dictionary
dialog: next to you.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: (sigh)
dialog: My last boyfriend was eight years
dialog: ago. And he wasn’t even my
dialog: boyfriend. He was almost sixty and
dialog: fat and he worked in Human
dialog: Resources and he had a wife and a
dialog: his daughter was older than me.
dialog: And the only reason he pursued me
dialog: was because he thought he’d have a
dialog: good shot. Which he did.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I think you’re extraordinary.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I don’t know yet. It’s just

speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: I never went to college. I’ve

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Your voice is like...magic.
scene_heading: Anomalisa ---Final Shoot_ v4 Rev. 10/4/15 41.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Oh, really? Wow. Well, y’know, I

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It works. Do you sing?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: What? (giggling) No! No! God!
dialog: You're weird! I mean, I sing.
dialog: Everybody sings. I just don’t sing
dialog: well. I sometimes sing along with
dialog: the radio. I love Cyndi Lauper.
dialog: Because she’s got such a great
dialog: voice and she doesn’t care what
dialog: people think about her. She is
dialog: just herself and that takes a lot
dialog: of courage. I admire that. You
dialog: know what I mean?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I think so. Would you sing one of
dialog: her songs for me?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: (giggling) No!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: C'mon. It’d make me so happy to

speaker_heading: LISA

speaker_heading: LISA (CONT'D)
dialog: Um, well, Em picked me up at like
dialog: seven this morning so we could

dialog: Starbucks and I got a grande mocha
dialog: frappuccino. Emily got a grande
dialog: chai. I looked at the road atlas
dialog: and figured it’s a little over 200

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: I learned that word in your book.
dialog: I like that word. Anomaly. I like
dialog: the way it sounds and I like what
dialog: it means. I feel like an anomaly.
dialog: Before I used to know there was a
dialog: word for it, it made me feel bad to

dialog: it. Sometimes. I mean, not a lot,
dialog: but sometimes. Makes me special,
dialog: sort of. Y’know what I mean?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (drowsy) Anomalisa.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Ooh, I love that! It’s like
dialog: “anomaly” plus my name. Will you
dialog: call me that all the time? I guess
dialog: it’s kind of long to say all the
dialog: time. I mean, I guess I’m assuming
dialog: there is going to be an “all the
dialog: time.” There’s not going to an
dialog: “all the time”, is there? It’s

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

scene_heading: Anomalisa ---Final Shoot_ v4 Rev. 10/4/15 50.
speaker_heading: HOTEL MANAGER

scene_heading: Anomalisa ---Final Shoot_ v4 Rev. 10/4/15 51.
speaker_heading: HOTEL MANAGER
dialog: Thank you for coming, Mr. Stone.

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Is that a crime?
speaker_heading: HOTEL MANAGER
dialog: No, not at all. Certainly

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Philandering?
speaker_heading: HOTEL MANAGER
dialog: It isn’t that. My choice of words -

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: How do you even know that, anyway?
speaker_heading: HOTEL MANAGER

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Oh. Okay, then. Stick around, I’m
dialog: sure you'll get more of those. I’m
text: a sloppy sleeper.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: You're all sweaty. What was the
dialog: dream?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I don’t know. Something about the
dialog: hotel manager.
text: Michael lights a cigarette.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you hungry? We can order
dialog: breakfast. I have to get ready for
dialog: this speech.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Can I have scrambled eggs?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: I love eggs. (stretching) Scrambled
dialog: is my favorite egg style. What
dialog: about yours?

speaker_heading: LISA (CONT'D)
dialog: Mmm, these eggs are delicious.
dialog: Scrambled perfectly. You want to
dialog: try some?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (mouth full of food) Here’s what
dialog: I'm thinking.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: (mouth full of food)
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (takes a sip of coffee)
dialog: I want to be with you.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I need to be with you. I want to
dialog: leave my wife.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Really? Michael, that’s a big
dialog: decision. I don’t --
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No no no, it’s something I have to
dialog: do. I mean, if you’re interested.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: I mean, yeah. I mean it’s awfully
dialog: sudden. I mean, I don’t want to be
dialog: responsible for breaking up a
dialog: marriage. Do we need to decide now?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It’s been years since I’ve felt
dialog: anything like this. It’s like a
dialog: floodgate has opened. I can’t
dialog: close it. I don’t want to. I love
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: (pause) Okay. Um, I don’t know.
dialog: It seems so big and... Oh gosh,
dialog: okay. Yeah, let’s do it.
scene_heading: Anomalisa ---Final Shoot_ v4 Rev. 10/4/15 59.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Great! This is so great! (mouth
dialog: full of food) Anomalisa. So I'll,
dialog: I’1l call Donna and tell her. No,
dialog: maybe I should go see her. Right?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: (mouth full of food)
dialog: Yeah, that sounds right. I think
dialog: it’s such an important --
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Could you not...You’re clicking
dialog: your fork against your teeth.
dialog: Could you not do that?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Oh, sorry. People have told me
dialog: that before. I know, it’s a stupid
dialog: unconscious habit.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It’s okay. Anyway, you were
dialog: saying?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Just that I think it’s more
dialog: respectful. And you need to speak
dialog: to Henry. And explain that this
dialog: isn’t about him.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: But it is. It’s about him, too.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Oh. Well, don’t tell him that.
dialog: He’s just a little boy.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yeah. You're right. You’re being a
dialog: little controlling, don’t you
dialog: think?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: I don’t mean to. I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No, that’s okay.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Good, I’m glad.

speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Oh, sorry. I’ma pig. Sorry.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No, no. It’s okay. So, will you
dialog: live in Los Angeles? Or do you
dialog: need to stay in Ohio?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: (mouth full of food) Um, I’m sorry.
dialog: Hold on. (pause)
text: as she chews her food.
speaker_heading: LISA (CONT'D)
dialog: I could move to Los Angeles. I
dialog: could do that.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Good.
text: As Lisa speaks, Lisa #2 joins her in perfect synchronization
text: but very quietly. It’s start almost inaudibly, but as it
dialog: continues
text: through their dialogue, Lisa #2’s voice gets
text: progressively louder and Lisa’s voice gets progressively more
text: quiet. By the end of the scene, only Lisa #2 can be heard.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: We should go to the zoo today after
dialog: your speech. I hear it’s really
dialog: good. They have --
speaker_heading: LISA AND LISA #2
dialog: -- breeding programs for all these
dialog: endangered species.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I’m sorry what did you say?
speaker_heading: LISA AND LISA #2
dialog: Oh, they have breeding programs for
dialog: all these endangered species, so
dialog: you get to see things like pandas,
dialog: which I think are awfully cute.
dialog: They’re not really bears, I read.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (distracted) Yeah, sure. That
dialog: sounds fine.
scene_heading: Anomalisa ---Final Shoot_ v4 Rev. 10/4/15 61.
speaker_heading: LISA AND LISA #2
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Nothing. The zoo sounds good. My
text: stomach hurts. It feels empty.
text: It’s clenched.
speaker_heading: LISA AND LISA #2
dialog: Oh. Eat some more waffle maybe?
dialog: Did I do something wrong? I’m
dialog: sorry. Darling.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It’s okay. I’m anxious about my
dialog: speech, I suppose.
speaker_heading: LISA AND LISA #2
dialog: Of course. Well, we’ll have fun
dialog: after. We don’t have to go to the
dialog: zoo. We can just hang out here. I
dialog: have the whole weekend till I have
dialog: to get back to work.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: That’s great.
speaker_heading: LISA AND LISA #2
dialog: I’m so happy, Michael. I’ve waited
dialog: for someone like you my whole life.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I've waited too. We’1ll work it all
dialog: out, right?
speaker_heading: LISA AND LISA #2
dialog: Yes. Who would've thunk it? It’s
dialog: just so beautiful. Life can be.
dialog: Things can work out. That’s the
dialog: lesson.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Sometimes there’s no lesson.
dialog: That’s a lesson in itself.
speaker_heading: LISA AND LISA #2
dialog: I guess so.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I feel anxious, Michael. I feel
dialog: something. Like you’re different-—
dialog: acting.
scene_heading: Anomalisa ---Final Shoot_ v4 Rev. 10/4/15 62.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Me? No, no, no. Everything’s fine.
dialog: I’m just...
speaker_heading: LISA AND LISA #2
dialog: I know (sigh) I’m not great to look
text: at in bright sunlight.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No, you’re very pretty.
speaker_heading: LISA AND LISA #2
dialog: Okay. So, we could maybe go for a
dialog: walk and talk or something.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: LISA #2
dialog: So I'll see you after?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Of course.

dialog: representative. What do I say? Do
dialog: I smile while I’m on the phone?
dialog: They can tell if you’re smiling
