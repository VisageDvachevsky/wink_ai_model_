scene_heading: 1 EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- MORNING
dialog: 
text: Day breaks. Hassan (50) arrives at a solitary house made of
text: adobe, in the southern deserts of Morocco, carrying a satchel
text: and a large bundle wrapped in cloth.
dialog: 
text: He walks past a corral made out of branches, where several
text: goats bleat, and knocks on the front door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 2 EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Abdullah (40), opens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HASSAN
dialog: (In Arabic)
dialog: Good morning Abdullah... I brought
dialog: you this...
dialog: 
text: He holds up the bundle.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 3 INT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Abdullah's family is inside the house. There is a room, a
text: small table and a simple kitchen. Yasira (38) is roasting
text: some goat meat assisted by Yamil (16) and Zora (17), her
dialog: daughters.
dialog: 
text: Abdullah and his sons, Yussef (13) and Ahmed (14), are sitting
text: on the floor around the small table, looking at a well-
text: conserved .270 caliber Winchester 60 rifle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HASSAN
dialog: (To Abdullah)
text: It's almost new.
dialog: 
text: He takes out several boxes of cartridges from his satchel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HASSAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Three hundred cartridges...
dialog: 
text: He opens a box and shows them one of the golden bullets.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HASSAN (CONT'D)
dialog: The hunter who gave it to me said
dialog: you can hit up to three kilometers
dialog: away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABDULLAH
dialog: How much do you want for everything?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HASSAN
dialog: One thousand dirhams.
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABDULLAH
dialog: One thousand dirhams? I'll give you
text: one thousand and a goat.
dialog: 
text: Abdullah and Hassan exchange a look and Hassan smiles.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4 EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Hassan and Abdullah's family are behind the house. Hassan
text: stands with the rifle in front of a rock some twenty yards
text: away and he turns toward Abdullah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HASSAN
dialog: With this rifle, your sons will be
dialog: able to kill plenty of jackals.
dialog: 
text: He aims at the rock and pulls the trigger without holding
text: the rifle properly. It is clear that he doesn't know how to
text: fire a weapon, and the shot cracks loudly. The rifle kicks
text: and hits him roughly in the shoulder. The bullet flies far
text: wide of the rock. The women laugh nervously.
dialog: 
text: Rubbing his shoulder, Hassan turns to Abdullah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HASSAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Let one of your sons shoot.
dialog: 
text: Abdullah looks at his boys and points at the younger one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABDULLAH
dialog: Let Yussef shoot.
dialog: 
text: When Hassan is about to hand Yussef the rifle, Ahmed cuts
text: him off, upset.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AHMED
dialog: I want to shoot first.
dialog: 
text: Father and son exchange an angry glance. Hassan, without
text: realizing it, turns and gives the rifle to Ahmed. The boy
text: grabs the gun: it is heavier than he thought.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HASSAN
dialog: Look, load it like this.
dialog: 
text: Hassan opens the chamber, inserts the bullet and then closes
text: it. Once it is loaded, he points at the safety.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HASSAN (CONT'D)
dialog: This is the safety. Push it in when
dialog: you're ready.
dialog: 
text: Ahmed nods. Unsure of himself, he raises the rifle and,
text: almost without aiming, fires. The shot kicks up dust far
text: from the rock. His sisters laugh.
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HASSAN (CONT'D)
dialog: If he doesn't hit the jackals, at
dialog: least he'll scare the shit out of
dialog: them.
dialog: 
text: Ahmed lowers the rifle. His father grabs it and gives it to
text: Yussef enthusiastically.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABDULLAH
dialog: Your turn.
dialog: 
text: Yussef grabs the rifle and loads it confidently. He lifts
text: the rifle with ease and takes his time aiming. He seems
text: innately skilled at the maneuver. He shoots and the bullet
text: hits just below the rock.
dialog: 
text: Abdullah celebrates the shot and mockingly turns to Hassan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABDULLAH (CONT'D)
dialog: Now this kid shoots a hell of a lot
dialog: better than you.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 5 EXT. GOAT CORRAL -- LATER
dialog: 
text: Yussef takes one of the goats out, ties and ropes it and
text: gives it to Hassan. Abdullah supervises. Yasira approaches
text: and gives Abdullah a bag.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YASIRA
dialog: Your lunch.
dialog: 
text: Abdullah takes it and turns to his sons.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABDULLAH
dialog: You better kill at least three
dialog: jackals.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HASSAN
dialog: And make sure no one sees you with
dialog: the rifle, hide it if you see someone
dialog: approach you.
dialog: 
text: Ahmed nods. Abdullah and Hassan go on their way.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 6 EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- LATER
dialog: 
text: Yasira and Yamil are far from the house, cleaning some
text: goatskins stretched out on some branches.
dialog: 
text: Ahmed, with the rifle in his hands, opens the corral gate
text: and enters to herd them out. He calls his brother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AHMED
dialog: Yussef, Yussef...
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 7 EXT. SIDE WALL, YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Yussef is squatting on the other side of the house, spying
text: through a crack, breathing excitedly.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 8 INT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Zora is inside, undressing. She has a long body and her
text: cinnamon skin is soft and clean. Every now and then she
text: aims a complicit glance at the crack through which Yussef is
dialog: spying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AHMED (O.S.)
dialog: Yussef...
dialog: 
text: Zora turns around toward where the voice is coming from.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 9 EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Yussef is still spying. Ahmed approaches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AHMED
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 
text: Yussef turns around and signals for him to lower his voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AHMED (CONT'D)
dialog: I told you not to spy on her again.
dialog: 
text: Yussef pays no attention and keeps spying. Ahmed pulls him
text: by the shoulder and makes him lose his balance. Yussef falls
text: on his ass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AHMED (CONT'D)
dialog: I said don't spy on her.
dialog: 
text: Yussef gets up and dusts himself off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YUSSEF
dialog: What the hell do you care?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AHMED
dialog: Come on, let's go.
dialog: 
text: He turns around and leaves.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 10 EXT. DESERT -- DAY
dialog: 
text: The goats graze. Yussef and Ahmed watch them sitting on the
text: side of a hill. They look hot and bored. They both throw
text: stones at a small rusty can. Yussef throws one and misses.
text: Ahmed throws his and does. He draws a line in the ground.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AHMED
dialog: Five to two.
dialog: 
text: A jackal is stalking the goats. Yussef spots it.
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YUSSEF
dialog: There's a jackal over there.
dialog: 
text: Ahmed raises his head but cannot see it. Yussef points at
text: it, but Ahmed still cannot locate it. Yussef despairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YUSSEF (CONT'D)
dialog: Over there.
dialog: 
text: Ahmed finally spots it. He loads the rifle, but when he is
text: about to aim, the rifle fires. The shot hits amidst the
text: goats, lifting up a small cloud of dust.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YUSSEF (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing, you idiot?
dialog: 
text: The jackal flees, terrified, while the goats scamper in
dialog: different directions.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 11 EXT. DESERT -- LATER
dialog: 
text: Both brothers are sitting under a tree, eating bread and
text: drinking water from a goatskin canteen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YUSSEF
text: Zora doesn't mind.
dialog: 
text: Ahmed keeps eating without turning to look at his brother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AHMED
dialog: She doesn't, but I do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YUSSEF
dialog: This is between her and me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AHMED
dialog: You're both pigs. Next time I'm
dialog: going to tell my dad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YUSSEF
dialog: Stay out of this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AHMED
dialog: If you want me to stay out of it,
dialog: don't do it.
dialog: 
text: Yussef gets annoyed, stand up and leaves.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 12 EXT. DESERT -- DAY
dialog: 
text: The brothers are sitting apart from each other. Ahmed guards
text: the goats with the rifle on his lap.
dialog: 
text: After a while, Yussef goes to sit behind a large rock. He
text: makes sure his brother isn't watching and he pulls his pants
text: down to start masturbating.
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
text: When he is at his most concentrated, a shot rings out and
text: startles him. He quickly pulls his pants up and another
text: shot rings out. Yussef gets up to see what his brother is
dialog: doing.
dialog: 
text: Ahmed is aiming the rifle at a rock some two hundred yards
text: away. He fires a third time.
dialog: 
text: Yussef runs up to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YUSSEF
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 
text: Ahmed doesn't pay attention, and focuses on the rock in the
dialog: distance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AHMED
dialog: Hassan said that it could hit things
text: three kilometers away, but it can't
dialog: even reach that rock over there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YUSSEF
dialog: That's because you don't know how to
dialog: shoot. Give me the rifle.
dialog: 
text: Ahmed looks at his brother defiantly, then hands the rifle
text: over. Yussef aims and fires. The shot echoes through the
text: vast desert; the frightened goats scamper a few yards away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AHMED
dialog: See, it can't reach it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YUSSEF
dialog: Give me another bullet.
dialog: 
text: Yussef aims and fires. The bullet hits the rock and kicks
text: up a lot of whitish dust.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YUSSEF (CONT'D)
dialog: See.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AHMED
dialog: Yeah, but that's not three kilometers.
dialog: 
text: Ahmed remains pensive and suddenly starts climbing to the
text: top of the hill. Once at the top, he looks around for a
text: moment and then calls his brother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AHMED (CONT'D)
dialog: Yussef, come here.
dialog: 
text: Yussef climbs the slope. Ahmed signals a road that in the
text: distance cuts across the great desert plain, and points out
text: a traffic sign that indicates a curve ahead.
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AHMED (CONT'D)
dialog: I bet you the bullet can't hit that
text: far away.
dialog: 
text: Ahmed loads the rifle and aims at the sign. He fires and
dialog: nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AHMED (CONT'D)
dialog: These fucking bullets aren't any
dialog: good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YUSSEF
dialog: You're not aiming right.
dialog: 
text: Yussef points at a yellow car driving along the road.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YUSSEF (CONT'D)
dialog: What'll you give me if I hit that
dialog: car?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AHMED
dialog: I'll shoot.
dialog: 
text: Ahmed reloads. The empty cartridge falls to the ground. He
text: fires again - the car keeps going. Yussef asks for the rifle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AHMED (CONT'D)
dialog: You see? Nothing happens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YUSSEF
dialog: Let me shoot.
dialog: 
text: He also drops the used cartridge on the ground, reloads and
text: shoots the traffic sign. He fires and nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AHMED
dialog: I told you. Hassan's a liar.
dialog: 
text: A bus approaches. Ahmed points at it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AHMED (CONT'D)
dialog: Shoot at that one...
dialog: 
text: Yussef loads the rifle parsimoniously, shuts the chamber,
text: raises the weapon, aims and fires.
dialog: 
text: The bus drives on. Ahmed turns to his brother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AHMED (CONT'D)
dialog: See: nothing.
dialog: 
text: The bus drives on another three hundred yards and suddenly
text: stops in the middle of the road.

dialog: (Her entire story in

dialog: Once there was a hawk who wanted to
dialog: fly higher than everyone else. He
dialog: trained every day and hunted little
dialog: birds so he could eat them and be
text: strong.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Pajaritos? Little birds?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Of course, that's what hawks eat.
dialog: So, one day the hawk flew so, so
text: high that it crashed into an airplane.
text: It fainted and started to fall. And
text: when it was about to hit the ground,
text: all the birds flew toward him and
dialog: saved him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: They saved him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Yes, and when the hawk was healthy
dialog: again he went to talk to the birds
dialog: and said: I want to thank you for
dialog: saving me, but I can't change and
dialog: I'm going to keep hunting you. The
dialog: little birds answered: we don't care
dialog: that you hunt us, because that's who
dialog: you are. But we will always save
dialog: you, because that's who we are.
dialog: 
text: The children are silent.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
text: Pat died while she was sleeping.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMELIA

dialog: 
text: The group of tourists spread about a small eatery with open

dialog: 
text: At a table, on one end of the terrace with views to a cluster

speaker_heading: WAITER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSAN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: We don't have diet Coke.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Then a regular Coke.
dialog: 
text: The waiter smiles and goes to place the order. Susan takes

text: and then starts wiping the plate and the cutlery thoroughly.
dialog: 
text: Richard looks at the mountain range through a pair of

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Look, look: a hawk.
dialog: 
text: Richard follows the hawk with his binoculars for a few seconds

speaker_heading: RICHARD (CONT'D)
dialog: This country is incredible.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSAN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What d'you mean why? I thought you
dialog: would like it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Really: why are we here?
dialog: 
text: Richard knows that Susan's answer implies something else.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: To forget everything, to be alone.
dialog: 
text: Susan, sardonically gestures toward the other tourists with
text: her chin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Alone?
dialog: 
text: Richard sighs in disappointment. The waiter arrives with
text: the Cokes and the food, which does not look particularly
text: appetizing. He leaves everything on the table and goes.
dialog: 
text: Richard is about to pour his drink when Susan stops him.
dialog: 
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Throw out the ice.

speaker_heading: RICHARD
text: The Coke is warm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Yeah, but you don't know what kind

dialog: 
text: She grabs Richard's glass and tosses out the ice. Then she
text: does the same thing with hers. They are quiet for a moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Why can't you ever relax. You're
dialog: always stressed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You're the one stressing me out.
dialog: You're why I can't relax.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You could if you tried.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Tried? Don't you think I tried?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You're never going to forgive me,
dialog: are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Do you even know what I'm talking
dialog: about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Susan, please; we didn't come all

dialog: 
text: Susan gets angry and faces him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSAN

speaker_heading: BOYS

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOYS (CONT'D)
dialog: Stilo...stilo...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I don't have any money... I don't

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 
text: Richard just gets in the bus. Susan stares at the boy with

dialog: 
scene_heading: 26 INT. BUS -- LATER
dialog: 
text: Susan sits next to the window, in the middle of the bus.
text: She looks hurt and sad. Richard walks over and sits next to
dialog: her.
dialog: 
text: The bus starts. Through the window, Richard can still see
text: the boy with the binoculars. He smiles until he sees an older
text: boy snatch the binoculars away and push the little boy.
dialog: 
text: The bus drives away, but Richard can't take his eyes off the
text: scene. The older boy walks away with the binoculars.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 27 EXT. DESERT -- DAY
dialog: 
text: The bus drives down a straight road that divides the desert.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 28 INT. BUS -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: The bus drives on. Some of the old men sleep. Susan leans
text: her head against the window and watches the landscape scroll

dialog: 
text: Susan holds out her hand and takes Richard's, as a sign of
text: reconciliation. He holds hers and caresses it.
dialog: 
text: Susan gets comfortable to try to sleep. She closes her eyes
text: when suddenly something smashes the window and Susan collapses
dialog: forward.
dialog: 
text: Richard turns to look at the punctured glass and then Susan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Susan, what's wrong?
dialog: 
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
text: Susan doesn't answer, limp on her seat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHARD (CONT'D)
dialog: What happened?
dialog:

scene_heading: 29 INT. VOLLEYBALL COURT -- DAY
dialog: 
text: In an indoor volleyball court with bleachers, several Japanese
text: girls play volleyball. They all compete intensely for the
text: point. There is excitement, but everything occurs quietly.
dialog: 
text: A player jumps and spikes the ball. Chieko (16), tall,
text: beautiful, with strands of hair painted purple, volleys the
text: ball back up. It reaches one of her teammates who sets up
dialog: another to spike it.
dialog: 
text: Chieko's team wins the point. The referee, instead of
text: whistling, lifts up a red flag.
dialog: 
text: The players congratulate each other silently, in sign
text: language. The only sound we can here is the parents' clapping
text: as they watch the game from the stands.
dialog: 
text: Chieko's team serves. Again, the game is heated. A rival
text: player spikes the ball, and it is barely out of bounds.
text: However, the referee, with his red flag, calls the point.
dialog: 
text: Chieko is upset and goes to argue with him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEKO

speaker_heading: REFEREE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEAMMATE

dialog: 
text: Chieko breaks loose and approaches the referee.

speaker_heading: CHIEKO

speaker_heading: REFEREE

speaker_heading: REFEREE
dialog: You're out.
dialog: 
text: Chieko is furious. She starts to make obscene gestures.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEKO
dialog: You're an asshole.
dialog: 
text: The coach walks onto the court. He holds her to calm her
text: down and then takes her away. Despite Chieko's violent
text: reaction, everything is still silent. From the bleachers,
text: Yasujiro (47), Chieko's father, dressed in a nice suit with
text: the tie undone, with a sad pride about him, disapproves of
text: his daughter's actions.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 30 INT. LOCKER ROOM, VOLLEYBALL COURT -- DAY

dialog: in sign language.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEAMMATE 1
dialog: You shouldn't have lost your temper.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEKO

speaker_heading: TEAMMATE 2
dialog: If you hadn't been thrown out, we
dialog: would've won the game.
dialog: 
text: Chieko, angry, gets up and starts to rummage through her

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEAMMATE 1
dialog: Why are you in a bad mood?
dialog: 
text: Chieko doesn't answer. Teammate 2 approaches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEAMMATE 2
text: She's always in a bad mood because
dialog: nobody's fucked her yet.
dialog: 
text: She caps this with an obscene gesture that bothers Chieko.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEKO
dialog: I'm gonna fuck your dad to get rid
dialog: of my mood.
dialog: 
text: Teammate 1 laughs, amused. Teammate 2 gives Chieko a scornful

speaker_heading: YASUJIRO

speaker_heading: YASUJIRO (CONT'D)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOSTESS
dialog: Do you have a table?
dialog: 
text: Chieko doesn't manage to read her lips. The hostess, smiling,
text: awaits an answer. Chieko waits, expectant, for the hostess
dialog: to repeat herself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOSTESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you have a table?
dialog: 
text: Chieko nods and points at her group of girlfriends, who are
text: sitting on the barstools next to the bar.
dialog: 
text: The hostess smiles another stupid smile and lets Chieko by.
text: Further off, her friends spot her and make silly faces.
dialog: 
text: Chieko laughs, walks over to them. They are all dressed the
text: same: short skirts, tight t-shirts. Some of them have
text: piercings in their nose, lips and ears. They all exude
text: hormones in their silence.
dialog: 
text: Chieko goes to talk to them in sign language.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEKO
dialog: Why all the way in the corner?
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITSU
dialog: Because of the view.
dialog: 
text: Chieko turns around and stares at one of them wearing a Milan

text: the boy finally turns away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITSU (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you like him?
dialog: 
text: Chieko nods without taking her eyes off him.

text: The young man in the Milan jersey approaches Chieko.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Hello.
dialog: 
text: Neither Chieko, nor her friends answer. The guy turns to
text: look at one of his friends, who signals for him to insist.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I play with you?
dialog: 
text: Chieko, obviously, cannot hear him. She keeps playing.
text: Suddenly, Mitsu notices the young man's presence and taps

dialog: 
text: The young man turns to look toward his friends as he speaks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you want to come have a drink?
dialog: 
text: Chieko gets frustrated; she cannot read his lips. He stops
text: looking at his friends and awaits an answer, but all he sees
text: is three silent girls staring at him stupefied.
dialog: 
text: Chieko talks to Mitsu in sign language.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEKO
dialog: Tell him I couldn't read his lips.
dialog: 
text: The young man, upon seeing them communicate, is caught off

dialog: 
scene_heading: 35 INT. BATHROOM, EVE'S -- DAY
dialog:

speaker_heading: MITSU

dialog:

dialog: 
text: Chieko hikes up her skirt and starts to pull down her panties.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITSU (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEKO
dialog: Now they're going to meet the real

dialog: 
scene_heading: 36 INT. EVE'S -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Chieko sits on one of the restaurant's benches. Before her

text: her pussy.
dialog: 
text: One of the young men seems to notice, and is stunned. Chieko
text: smiles and does it again. He watches Chieko again and
text: discretely turns to one of his friends to tell him.
dialog: 
text: Chieko turns her back to him and faces the bar. She looks
text: over at Mitsu, who shakes her head, amused.
dialog: 
text: A beeper rings on Chieko's skirt. She picks it up and reads:
dialog: "Don't forget your appointment with the dentist. Papa."
dialog: 
text: She puts the beeper away and turns toward Mitsu.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEKO
dialog: I'll see you later at my place.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: She struts out.

scene_heading: 37 EXT. DESERT -- DAY
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Ahmed runs to help him. Yussef gets up, covered in dust and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: YUSSEF

speaker_heading: YUSSEF (CONT'D)
dialog: Something we ate make us sick so we

speaker_heading: YASIRA
dialog: And is that why you're insulting

speaker_heading: YUSSEF
dialog: We were feeling really ill.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: YASIRA

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AHMED
dialog: Our stomach really hurts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YASIRA

scene_heading: 40 INT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- DAY

speaker_heading: YUSSEF

speaker_heading: AHMED

speaker_heading: YUSSEF

speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (mumbling senselessly)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Is anybody a doctor?
dialog: 
text: Nobody answers. Richard starts to lose his cool.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Please: a doctor.
dialog:

speaker_heading: RICHARD (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ANWAR
text: It's far away, about four hours.

speaker_heading: RICHARD

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Tell him we need his help.
dialog:

scene_heading: 57 INT. BUS -- DAY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARTH
dialog: Marrakech isn't this way. They're

speaker_heading: RICHARD

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (A Anwar)
dialog: Isn't there anywhere else we can

dialog: 
dialog: 36.

scene_heading: 62 EXT. HAMLET -- DAY

speaker_heading: SUSAN

scene_heading: 67 EXT. PATIO, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY

speaker_heading: ANWAR

scene_heading: 68 INT. ROOM, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY

dialog: 
scene_heading: ANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I need to call an ambulance and

speaker_heading: RICHARD

speaker_heading: ANWAR
dialog: She can take care of her.
dialog: 
text: Richard leans over Susan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You're going to be ok.

text: towards the grandmother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANWAR
dialog: (In Arabic)
dialog: Hold and release the tourniquet every

dialog: 
scene_heading: ANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER
dialog: (In Arabic)
dialog: Get out of here... out...
dialog:

speaker_heading: SUSAN (CONT'D)
dialog: No, water...
dialog: 
text: With her hand, Susan mimes drinking a glass of water. The

speaker_heading: SUSAN (CONT'D)

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSAN (CONT'D)

dialog: 
scene_heading: 75 INT. ROOM, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Susan is lying down. A small pool of blood has collected
text: under her neck. She looks restless. She whispers weakly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Get me out of here... please...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I'm going to as soon as I can. I've
dialog: already called Rachel; she's going
dialog: to tell the embassy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I told you we shouldn't have come.
dialog: 
text: Just then Anwar enters. The grandmother takes the basin and
text: sets it in a corner. She gets some pieces of cloth and starts
dialog: to soak them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: How long until the ambulance gets
dialog: here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANWAR
text: About an hour and a half. It's coming

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: That much? Isn't there anyone here

dialog: 44.
dialog:

speaker_heading: RICHARD (CONT'D)
dialog: We've got to get her out of here.
text: There's no one to tend to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANWAR
dialog: My brother already called a doctor,
dialog: he's coming.
dialog: 
text: Richard is going to say something, but holds back. His
text: despair and confusion are evident.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANWAR (CONT'D)
dialog: Trust my grandmother; she knows a
dialog: lot about remedies.
dialog: 
text: The grandmother wrings out the rags and puts them on a table.
text: She takes some herbs, a fistful of earth from the floor and
text: she tosses them into the basin. She stirs it and pulls out
text: a clump of mud which she lays out on one of the pieces of
dialog: cloth.
dialog: 
text: Susan looks horrified at the dirt. The grandmother leans
text: over her and tries to clean the wound with the other moistened
text: rags. Susan resists.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER
dialog: (In Arabic)
dialog: I have to clean you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANWAR
dialog: (To Susan)
dialog: Miss, my grandmother is going to

dialog: 
text: The grandmother finishes cleaning her with the damp cloths

text: but Susan flinches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No, not that.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER

scene_heading: 80 INT. DENTIST'S OFFICE -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Chieko is sitting in the reception area, waiting her turn.
text: There is a woman with a twelve year-old son listening to a
text: walkman and an old couple.
dialog: 
text: The receptionist (50) will not stop talking to the old lady.
dialog: 
dialog: 48.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: My niece sells these creams. And
dialog: just look at my skin now. I'm going
dialog: to turn fifty-two and look, almost
dialog: no wrinkles...
dialog: 
text: The woman continues her banal chatter. Chieko observes her
text: grotesque mouth. She then looks at the old man's bored face,
text: the old woman's feigned interest, the mother's annoyed
text: expression, and the boy, who rocks his head to the music.
dialog: 
text: A man walks out and the receptionist gestures at Chieko and
text: points toward the door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 81 INT. DENTIST'S OFFICE -- DAY
dialog: 
text: The dentist (47) - tall and, unlike the receptionist, with
text: impeccable skin covering his hardened, attractive face -
text: examines Chieko's mouth. His face comes very close to hers
text: as he looks at her, making her nervous. The fat receptionist
text: walks in without knocking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
text: Here are the sterilized drill bits.
dialog: 
text: The dentist looks up at her. She leaves the drill bits on a
text: table and leaves. The dentist turns back to Chieko and speaks
text: face to face with her so she can read his lips.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENTIST
dialog: I-think-you-have-two-cavities-in-
dialog: your-molars.
dialog: 
text: She smiles. The dentist moves closer to Chieko's mouth again;
text: she cannot stop looking at him.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Chieko licks his cheek. He is surprised, but
text: continues his checkup. She licks him again, this time on the
text: lips. He pulls away, flustered.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENTIST (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 
text: She grabs his hand, puts it on her inner thigh and rubs it
text: against her pubis.
dialog: 
text: He, confused, tries to pull his hand away, but she prevents
text: him from doing so. The scene starts to turn slightly
text: grotesque. After a slight struggle, he pulls his hand back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENTIST (CONT'D)
dialog: What's the matter with you?
dialog: 
text: She grabs his hand again and, again, pulls it toward her
text: pubis. He gets angry and moves back. The fat woman enters
text: again without knocking, sees they are agitated and, without
text: a word, walks out and closes the door.
dialog: 
dialog: 49.
dialog: 
text: The dentist turns toward Chieko.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENTIST (CONT'D)
dialog: Get out.
dialog: 
text: She shakes her head. She is excited, anxious, scared,
text: fragile. He pulls her by her wrist out of the chair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENTIST (CONT'D)
dialog: Get out right now.
dialog: 
text: He walks to the door and opens it. Just before she walks
text: out, Chieko draws out a slight smile, which is almost a grin.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 82 EXT. TOKYO STREETS -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Chieko walks down crowded Tokyo streets. She walks with a
text: lost gaze, unsettled.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 83 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING, TOKYO -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Chieko arrives at an upper class apartment complex. The
text: architecture is cutting edge, but impersonal and cold.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 84 INT. LOBBY, TOKYO APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Chieko enters the lobby. Beside the doorman are two men
text: dressed in suits: Kenji (31) and Hamano (50). The janitor
text: gestures at Chieko with his chin. The men walk over toward
text: her and cut her off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAMANO
dialog: Are you Yasujiro Wataya's daughter?
dialog: 
text: Chieko doesn't manage to read his lips. She is silent. The
text: doorman notices the situation, walks out from behind his
text: small desk and shouts at the men.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: She's deaf mute. Face her when you
dialog: speak so she can read your lips.
dialog: 
text: Kenji and Hamano are disconcerted. Hamano stands squarely
text: in front of her and speaks slowly, emphasizing every word.
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 50.
dialog: 
text: Hamano reads it and turns his face toward hers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAMANO (CONT'D)
dialog: No, he didn't do anything wrong. We
dialog: just want to talk to him. Do you
dialog: know where he is?
dialog: 
text: She shrugs her shoulders. Kenji gives her his card. Upon
text: receiving it, Chieko turns to look at him. Their eyes meet
text: and she looks down. She then looks up again, blushing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI
dialog: Tell him to call us. And don't be
dialog: scared, we're not going to do anything
dialog: bad to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAMANO

scene_heading: 85 INT. CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Chieko walks into the apartment. It is a large apartment,
text: elegantly furnished. Although decoration is scant, some
text: hunting trophies stand out: a scimitar-horned Oryx, sheep,
text: and others. There are also photographs of Yasujiro hunting.
dialog: 
text: A wall is dedicated to family photos. Among them is a picture
text: of Chieko as a little girl with her father and her mother.
dialog: 
text: Chieko sees a note on the table at the entrance. She puts
text: the policeman's card down and picks up a note from her father
dialog: that says: "I waited until five and you didn't make it.
dialog: I've got a meeting and I'll be back late. I left you some
dialog: soup and some chicken for dinner. Kisses. Papa."
dialog: 
scene_heading: 86 INT. CHIEKO'S ROOM -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Chieko sits in front of a mute T.V., channel surfing. She
text: stops at a fashion show, then some cartoons.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, on a news program, we see the photographs of Ahmed
text: and Yussef. Chieko looks at them for a moment and then
text: changes the channel. She is watching T.V. when a red bulb,
text: set between a yellow bulb and a blue one, starts to light up
text: insistently as the doorbell rings.
dialog: 
text: Chieko notices and shuts off the T.V.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 87 INT. LIVING ROOM, CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- DAY
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 51.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITSU
dialog: Are you ready?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEKO
dialog: Yeah, I'm just going to get my bag.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITSU
dialog: The cops came again?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEKO
dialog: Yeah. They hadn't come in nine
dialog: months. But these were different
dialog: cops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITSU
dialog: Did they come to ask about your
dialog: mothers' death?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEKO
dialog: No, but they're probably going to
dialog: ask my dad about the same things.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITSU
dialog: They're just not convinced, are they?
dialog: 
text: Chieko shakes her head, remains pensive and then smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEKO
dialog: Believe it or not, I liked one of
dialog: the cops.
dialog: 
text: Chieko puts Kenji's card in her purse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITSU
dialog: Did you put on some panties?
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALARID
dialog: Stop right there...

speaker_heading: ALARID (CONT'D)
dialog: They're from around here. Find out

speaker_heading: KUMIKO
dialog: No, but he understands some.
dialog: 
text: Haruki seems to understand what they're saying and leans in
text: to whisper something to Takeshi, his brother. They both
dialog: laugh.
dialog: 
text: Haruki approaches Chieko and talks to her face to face so
text: she can read his lips.
dialog: 
dialog: 72.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARUKI
dialog: What's your name?
dialog: 
text: Chieko and her friend smile. Chieko takes out her notebook
text: and pen and writes her name. Haruki reads it out loud.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARUKI (CONT'D)
dialog: Chieko?
dialog: 
text: Chieko nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARUKI (CONT'D)
dialog: My name's Haruki.
dialog: 
text: Chieko nods, trying to show she's understood. Haruki takes
text: out a flask and holds it out to her. Chieko opens it and
text: smells it. Haruki stands in front of her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARUKI (CONT'D)
dialog: It's whisky.
dialog: 
text: Chieko smiles and gives a long swig. Mitsu asks for some
text: and also gives it a long drink.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARUKI (CONT'D)
dialog: Do the cops come around here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITSU
dialog: (Gutturally)
dialog: Sometimes.
dialog: 
text: Haruki takes out some ecstasy and gives it to them. Mitsu
text: and Chieko look at each other and down the pills with a gulp
dialog: of whisky.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 124 EXT. PARK, TOKYO -- LATER
dialog: 
text: Half-drunk and rushing from the pills, Chieko, her friends,
text: and Haruki and Takeshi, play on the swings and see-saw.
text: They laugh at almost anything. Haruki and Chieko are on the
text: see-saw and every time Chieko rises, Haruki looks at her
text: bush. Chieko knows this sometimes opens her legs even more
text: so he can look to his heart's content. Hormones float in
dialog: the air.
dialog: 
text: Mitsu also takes advantage of the occasion. She flirts with
text: Haruki whenever she can. Haruki looks happy to be the object
dialog: of their attention.
dialog: 
text: Takeshi, who has started to make out with one of Chieko's
text: friends, turns to the group and speaks slowly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAKESHI
dialog: Why- don't- we- go- to- Montana?
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 125 INT. TAXI, TOKYO -- EVENING
dialog: 
text: Night begins to fall. Haruki sits between Mitsu and Chieko.
text: He strokes Chieko's knee with his hand; she seems turned on.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 126 EXT. NIGHTCLUB STRIP, TOKYO -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The taxi parks outside the Montana. Chieko, Mitsu and Haruki
text: get out of the car and meet with the others at the door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 127 INT. HALLWAY, NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: They enter. The music, the light, the crowd, it is almost
text: hallucinatory. For Chieko, it is a silent concert of movement
dialog: and chaos.
dialog: 
text: She and her friends push their way through the place. Haruki
text: grabs Chieko by the hand, pulls her toward the floor and
text: starts dancing. Chieko looks at the other dancers' rhythm
text: and follows. She slowly manages to follow.
dialog: 
text: The other deaf-mutes also dance. Some do better than others,
text: lost in the sea of lights and people.
dialog: 
text: For Chieko, the dance turns into something hypnotic. She
text: dances with her eyes closed, concentrated on her own rhythm.
dialog: 
text: When she opens her eyes, she sees that Mitsu, a little drunk,
text: is grinding against Haruki, feeling him up.
dialog: 
text: Chieko seems annoyed by this and goes to defend her territory.
text: She starts dancing next to Haruki, but she is constantly
text: interrupted by the surrounding crowd.
dialog: 
text: The struggle between Chieko and Mitsu is a little bit
text: ridiculous. It is finally resolved when Mitsu takes Haruki
text: by the face and starts to kiss him. Chieko doesn't know what
text: to do. Mitsu and Haruki start to make out intensely.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly Chieko is left standing in the middle of the club,
text: motionless, while her friends dance awkwardly and Mitsu and
text: Haruki are having the time of their lives. Chieko, defeated
text: by her friend, decides to leave. Mitsu spots her out of the
text: corner of her eye and waves goodbye. Chieko smiles back and
text: walks away from her friends as they dance.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 128 INT. LOBBY, TOKYO APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Chieko enters her building and goes straight to the doorman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: Good evening, how may I help you?
dialog: 
text: Chieko takes out a piece of paper and a pen from her purse
text: and writes a note. She gives it to the doorman together
text: with Kenji's card. He reads it carefully, and when he's
text: done he turns to her.
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOORMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Very well miss, I'll call him now.
dialog: 
text: The doorman picks up a cordless phone and dials.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOORMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Lieutenant Kenji Mamiya, please?
dialog: 
text: There is a pause. The doorman gestures to Chieko that the
dialog: lieutenant will answer in a moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOORMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Lieutenant? Yes, look, I'm with the
dialog: deaf-mute girl you saw in the
dialog: afternoon, and she asked me to call
dialog: you... Yes, her... She says she needs
dialog: to talk to you, alone... about her
dialog: father... If it's possible, in her
dialog: apartment, tonight.
dialog: 
text: Chieko watches attentively.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 129 EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Yussef and Ahmed are sitting against the wall of the house.
text: Yussef's lip is split. Ahmed's nose is bleeding.
dialog: 
text: Abdullah paces desperately, while his wife and daughters
text: watch the scene, silent. Abdullah stops to look at Yussef.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABDULLAH
dialog: Why did you do this?
dialog: 
text: They don't answer. Abdullah leans over and slaps Ahmed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABDULLAH (CONT'D)
dialog: Answer me, god damn it!
dialog: 
text: Ahmed won't answer and he turns to Yussef again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YUSSEF
dialog: We were testing the rifle.
dialog: 
text: Abdullah turns and gives Yussef a powerful slap, which he
text: endures with silent dignity.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABDULLAH
dialog: Are you idiots? You killed a woman,
dialog: (He turns to Zora)
dialog: And you, you got naked so your brother
dialog: would see you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AHMED
dialog: Yes, she got naked lots of times. I
text: saw how Yussef spied on her.
dialog: 
dialog: 75.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZORA
dialog: That's not true.
dialog: 
text: Abdullah turns to Yussef.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABDULLAH
dialog: Is it true or not?
dialog: 
text: Yussef is silent. Abdullah walks two steps forward and slaps
text: Zora. He looks furious, scared, indignant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABDULLAH (CONT'D)
dialog: Why did you do this to us?
dialog: 
text: He can barely hold in his tears. Zora brings her hand to
text: her face tearily. Abdullah turns to Ahmed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABDULLAH (CONT'D)
dialog: Where's the rifle?
dialog: 
scene_heading: 130 EXT. HASSAN'S HOUSE -- DAY
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: What organization gave you the weapon?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HASSAN
dialog: I've told you it wasn't an
dialog: organization; I got it from a hunter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: What hunter?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HASSAN
dialog: A Japanese hunter gave it to me many
dialog: years ago. I've got a picture inside.
dialog: She can get it.
dialog: 
text: He turns to look at his wife. She has also been beaten and
text: is guarded by two cops. The interrogating cop authorizes
text: her. She walks in and comes out with a photograph of Hassan
text: with Yasujiro, posing with the scimitar-horned oryx. He hands
text: it over and the cop examines it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HASSAN (CONT'D)
text: He's holding the rifle he gave me.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 131 EXT. DESERT -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Yussef and Ahmed dig up the rifle and the bullets in front
dialog: of their parents and sisters.
dialog: 
text: Abdullah grabs the rifle, dusts it off and puts the bullets

dialog: 
dialog: 76.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABDULLAH
dialog: We're going to hide out at Naguib's
dialog: house. If the cops come, tell them
dialog: we went south.
dialog:

text: and Ahmed. The women watch them get lost on the horizon.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 132 EXT. HASSAN'S HOUSE -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Alarid's truck parks in front of Hassan's house again. Hassan
text: is still cuffed and being interrogated. Furious, Alarid gets
text: out of the truck and goes toward him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALARID
dialog: This Abdullah doesn't live where you
dialog: said he did.
dialog: 
text: He walks over to kick him. The wife intervenes from where

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: They live where he said they do.
dialog: 
text: Alarid turns to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALARID
dialog: You're going to take us.
dialog: 
text: With a gesture, he orders his subordinates to put her in the
text: truck. She obeys, docile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALARID (CONT'D)
dialog: And if they're not there, I'll cut
dialog: your tongue out and I'll kill your

dialog: 
scene_heading: 133 EXT. DESERT -- DAY

speaker_heading: WIFE

speaker_heading: WIFE (CONT'D)

dialog: 
scene_heading: 135 P.O.V. ALARID'S BINOCULARS -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: In the distance, we can still see Abdullah, Yussef and Ahmed

dialog: 
scene_heading: 136 EXT. DESERT -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Alarid quickly gets out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALARID
dialog: There they are.
dialog: 
text: All the cops get out with their high powered rifles.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 137 EXT. DESERT HILLS -- DAY
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: YUSSEF
dialog: The police, the police...
dialog: 
text: They run up a hill to try to lose them, but shots start to
dialog: ring out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YUSSEF (CONT'D)
text: They're shooting at us.
dialog: 
text: Abdullah stands before his sons and lifts up the rifle as a
text: sign of surrender. The shots cease for a few seconds, but
text: they suddenly start again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABDULLAH
dialog: Get down. Run.
dialog: 
text: The three shepherds run, huddling as low as they can. More
text: shots. They desperately climb between the rocks. Bullets
text: whiz past everywhere.
dialog: 
text: Abdullah makes one last attempt at surrender. He lifts up
text: the rifle again, sets it on the ground and backs away. But
text: the gesture is in vain, as the bullets still rush past.
dialog: 
text: They begin to run again when Ahmed is hit in one of his
text: calves. He collapses and rolls downhill. Abdullah hurries
text: to rescue him and drags him behind a rock.
dialog: 
text: Ahmed won't stop screaming from the pain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AHMED
dialog: They shot me, they shot me...
dialog: 
dialog: 78.
dialog: 
text: Yussef dives on his belly and snakes his way through the
text: rocks. He gets the rifle, loads it and aims at the trucks.
dialog: 
text: He shoots without hitting anything. Abdullah turns to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABDULLAH
dialog: Don't shoot, don't shoot!
dialog: 
text: Yussef doesn't pay attention. He loads again and aims.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 138 P.O.V. RIFLE SIGHTS -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Yussef aims carefully. He picks out one of the cops who has
text: been shooting barely protected by one of the trucks' fenders.
text: Yussef shoots and the policeman collapses.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 139 EXT. HAMLET "LOS LOBOS" -- LATER
dialog: 
text: The religious ceremony has ended and everyone throws rice at
text: the bride and groom. Debbie and Mike enjoy doing it.
dialog: 
text: Several cowboys, among them Santiago, have gone to their

dialog: 
text: Music begins to blare.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 140 EXT. HAMLET "LOS LOBOS" -- DAY
dialog: 
text: The band plays various Norteño songs. Everyone waits for

dialog: 
text: Amelia dances with Mike and Debbie with Santiago; both Amelia
text: and Santiago show them a few steps.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANTIAGO
dialog: (To Debbie, in Spanish)
dialog: Like this, look...
dialog: 
text: He kicks his heel back, then forward. Debbie watches,

text: face, moves closer to Amelia and watches her dance for a
text: while, she notices and stops, embarrassed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACINTO
dialog: (Both in Spanish)
dialog: Amelia, will you let me dance with
dialog: you?
dialog: 
text: Amelia remains unperturbed, without answering him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACINTO (CONT'D)
dialog: I've been asking you for a dance for
dialog: 30 years. Does it really cost you
dialog: that much?
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Amelia stares at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMELIA

speaker_heading: JACINTO
dialog: C'mon Amelia, she's been dead for 10
dialog: years.
dialog: 
text: Amelia looks around and then turns to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Okay, just one.
dialog: 
text: Jacinto chivalrously takes her by the waist and they begin
text: to dance. Santiago watches them, amused, and continues to

dialog: 
text: Jacinto draws Amelia closer and they kiss gently.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 141 EXT. HAMLET "LOS LOBOS" -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Beer starts to flow and some of the guests get overbearing.

dialog: 
text: The guitarist in the band stops the music.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUITAR PLAYER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUITAR PLAYER (CONT'D)
dialog: We-want-cake, we-want-cake...
dialog: 
text: The audience and the band sing the little cake song. A giant,
text: tacky wedding cake, covered in cream, arrives. The bride
text: grabs the knife and gets ready to cut it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUITAR PLAYER (CONT'D)
dialog: Take- a- bite, take- a- bite...
dialog: 
text: The bride gives into the ritual. She tries to take a bite
text: out of the cake without using her hands and someone pushes
text: her face into the cream. Debbie and Mike laugh.
dialog: 
text: A cowboy pulls out a gun and, festively, fires. Debbie is
text: frightened and goes to hide behind Amelia.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Don't worry, it's ok.
dialog: 
text: The man puts the gun away and walks back onto the dance floor
dialog: as if nothing had happened.
dialog: 
dialog: 80.
dialog: 
text: Luis asks the band to stop the music for a little bit and he
text: takes the microphone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUIS
dialog: Good evening everyone... Hey... I
dialog: want to say something. Love came
dialog: today, it came here all pretty...
dialog: (he taps his heart)
dialog: It's kind of like a little mouse is
dialog: crawling inside of me. Because that's
dialog: what love is, it's like your insides
dialog: get all twisted into knots... and
dialog: that, baby, is what you've taught
dialog: me. And because you've shown me, I
dialog: want to tell everyone that hopefully
dialog: love will get inside them
dialog: too...because it feels so good,
dialog: really...Thanks a lot and keep havin'

scene_heading: 142 EXT. HAMLET "LOS LOBOS" -- NIGHT

speaker_heading: AMELIA (CONT'D)
dialog: See you soon, son.

speaker_heading: SANTIAGO
dialog: Is there a problem?
dialog: 
text: The officer turns to look at them suspiciously. He obviously

dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER

speaker_heading: SANTIAGO
dialog: Me, sir? No.

scene_heading: 148 INT. SANTIAGO'S CAR -- NIGHT

scene_heading: 149 EXT. IMMIGRATION DESK, BORDER CROSSING -- NIGHT

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Son of a bitch...

scene_heading: 161 INT. CHIEKO'S ROOM -- NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: 162 INT. ENTRANCE TO CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

speaker_heading: KENJI
dialog: Hello.
dialog: 
text: She bows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI (CONT'D)
dialog: They told me you wanted to talk to
dialog: me.
dialog: 
text: Chieko, who has been unable to read his lips, asks him with
text: her hands that he speak slowly and face her. Kenji is
text: embarrassed by his tactlessness and tries to be more
dialog: considerate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry. Is there something you
dialog: wanted to tell me?
dialog: 
text: Chieko nods and asks him in with her hand. Kenji takes off
text: his shoes and leaves them at the door. Chieko leads him to
text: the living room and with a gesture asks if he wants anything
dialog: to drink.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you have tea?
dialog: 
text: Chieko nods and goes into the kitchen. Kenji glances over
text: the apartment. Chieko comes back from the kitchen holding a
text: strange gadget which she puts on the living room table. A
text: small bulb lights. Kenji just watches her.
dialog: 
text: Chieko gestures for him to sit down. Kenji and Chieko sit
text: across from each other.
dialog: 
dialog: 95.
dialog: 
text: Chieko takes out her notebook and pen, writes something down
text: and hands it over to Kenji. Kenji reads, seems surprised
text: and reads again slowly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI (CONT'D)
dialog: "My father had nothing to do with my
dialog: mother's death," what's this?
dialog: 
text: Chieko is disconcerted at the question. She takes her
text: notebook and starts writing. Kenji reads and turns to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI (CONT'D)
dialog: Your father was asleep when she jumped
dialog: off the balcony?
dialog: 
text: She nods. She gets up, asks Kenji to go with her and walks
text: toward the balcony.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 163 EXT. BALCONY, CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: She opens the door to the balcony and points at the void:
text: it's over twelve floors. Kenji looks over; the distance is
text: dizzying. Chieko writes in her notebook and shows him the
text: piece of paper.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI
dialog: You saw her jump?
dialog: 
text: She nods and writes again. She looks perturbed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI (CONT'D)
dialog: You've already told the other
dialog: officers?
dialog: 
text: She nods again. Kenji holds her by her arms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know what you're talking
dialog: about.
dialog: 
text: Chieko remains motionless for a few seconds. She scrawls in
dialog: her notebook "Then why do you want to talk to my father?"
text: Kenji reads and then turns to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI (CONT'D)
dialog: It's about a hunting rifle in his
dialog: name.
dialog: 
text: The red bulb on the gadget starts to blink. Chieko spots it
text: from the balcony and signals to Kenji that she has to go to
text: the kitchen. She runs off.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 164 INT. LIVING ROOM, CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Kenji stands and looks at the photographs of Yasujiro hunting
text: all over the world: with a kudu in Africa, a black bear in
text: Kamchatka, Hassan and the Oryx in Morocco.
dialog: 
dialog: 96.
dialog: 
text: Chieko comes back with a cup of steaming tea.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI
dialog: Does your father still hunt?
dialog: 
text: She shakes her head. She writes something and hands it over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI (CONT'D)
dialog: There was an incident with a rifle
dialog: in your father's name. That's why
dialog: we want to talk to him.
dialog: 
text: The news weighs on Chieko; she looks away. The sounds of
text: Tokyo come in through the living room: its car horns, its
dialog: voices.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly a rush of wind comes in. Chieko sees the balcony
text: doors are open and goes to close them. She then comes back
text: to the living room and sits down, dejected.
dialog: 
text: Kenji sits down beside her and leaves the tea on the table.
text: He doesn't know what to do and looks uncomfortable.
dialog: 
text: She picks up the notebook and writes. Kenji reads.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI (CONT'D)
dialog: No, your father isn't going to jail.
dialog: We just need to talk to him.
dialog: 
text: There is a long silence. Chieko seems immersed in a remote,
text: inaccessible world. Kenji turns his face to hers so that
text: she can read his lips.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI (CONT'D)
dialog: I have to go now. Thank you.
dialog: 
text: Chieko grabs his arm and shakes her head, urging him to stay.
text: They exchange a look for an instant and Kenji insists.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI (CONT'D)
dialog: I have to go.
dialog: 
text: He gets up to leave. Chieko signals for him to wait for a
text: moment and goes to her room.
dialog: 
text: Kenji stands in the middle of the room, waiting. Chieko
text: comes back completely naked. Her skin bristles.
dialog: 
text: She walks toward him, breathing through her mouth. Kenji is
text: disconcerted when he sees the quiet teenager approach. She
text: walks all the way up to Kenji and when she is about to take
text: another step, he holds her back with both hands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 
dialog: 97.
dialog: 
text: She doesn't pay attention, breaks free and stands a few inches
text: away from him. She is almost panting. She holds out her
text: hand and caresses Kenji's ear. He stands there, immobile,
text: without taking his eyes off Chieko's.
dialog: 
text: She takes his hand and puts it on one of her breasts. Kenji
text: strokes her breast and then pulls his hand away. She grabs
text: it again and puts it back on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI (CONT'D)
dialog: No, no, no... this is wrong.
dialog: 
text: Kenji looks turned on and confused: Chieko is beautiful, but
text: he knows he cannot go on and takes his hand away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI (CONT'D)
dialog: No, I can't. You're just a girl.
dialog: 
text: She walks up to his face and licks it. He is confused.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI (CONT'D)
dialog: Enough, please.
dialog: 
text: He grabs her by her arms and moves her away. She grabs the
text: sleeve of his jacket and pulls him back. She hugs him and
text: suddenly Chieko starts crying, disconsolate.
dialog: 
text: Kenji, bewildered, first does nothing, but upon seeing
text: Chieko's despair, holds her. She buries her face in his
text: shoulder. Her nakedness becomes increasingly fragile.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 165 EXT. DESERT -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Abdullah, afraid, watches his son shoot. The police have
text: stopped firing and run for cover. Yussef loads the rifle
text: again and aims carefully. He shoots and, in the distance,
text: we can see one of the headlights on a police truck shatter.
dialog: 
text: Abdullah shouts at Yussef desperately.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABDULLAH
dialog: Yussef, stop shooting!
dialog: 
text: Furious, Yussef loads the rifle again and starts shooting at
text: the cops. Ahmed won't stop screaming from the pain. Confused,
text: Abdullah doesn't know if he should console his wounded son
dialog: or stop the enraged Yussef.
dialog: 
text: In the distance, the cops reorganize. We hear the faraway
text: shots of Alarid giving orders.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALARID
dialog: Move that truck... god damn it...
dialog: 
text: One of the cops gets onto a truck and uses it as a parapet.

speaker_heading: ABDULLAH
dialog: Give me that rifle.
dialog: 
text: He tries to wrest it away, but Yussef resists. The struggle
text: and Abdullah finally pulls it away. When Yussef tries to
text: snatch it back, the police fire a round of shots and the two
text: barely have time to hide.
dialog: 
text: The air is thick with gunshots. Yussef and Abdullah,
text: terrified, stick to the stones. The bullets strike very
text: close to them, and they can't even raise their heads.
dialog: 
text: Ahmed won't stop complaining. Abdullah shouts at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABDULLAH (CONT'D)
dialog: Ahmed, don't move.
dialog: 
text: The gunshots rain down for over a minute. When they stop,
text: Abdullah turns to look at Ahmed, who is lying motionless on

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABDULLAH (CONT'D)
dialog: Ahmed! Ahmed!
dialog: 
text: Oblivious of the police, he gets up and runs toward him.
text: Motionless, Ahmed just moans. With every breath, his shirt
text: grows bloodier.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABDULLAH (CONT'D)
dialog: Ahmed! Ahmed!
dialog: 
text: He rolls Ahmed over and lays his head on his lap. Abdullah
text: cannot stop crying. Yussef, ducking, runs toward his brother.
text: Abdullah laments nervously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABDULLAH (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't die, don't die.
dialog: 
text: Yussef is shocked upon seeing his dead brother. He stands
text: up and, without caring whether anyone fires at him or not,
text: he raises the rifle up in the air for the police to see that
text: he is not aiming, and starts to break it against the rocks.
dialog: 
text: When he's finished breaking it he opens his arms and walks
text: toward the police. One of them policemen looks at him through

speaker_heading: ALARID
dialog: Aim.
dialog: 
text: The police aim and hold Yussef in their sights. He keeps

dialog: 
text: Yussef walks until his is 10 meters away from the police and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: YUSSEF
dialog: I killed the American, I was the

speaker_heading: AMELIA

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Why is the air so hot?
dialog: 
text: Amelia stops and tries to distract them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: (the entire dialogue
dialog: in English)
text: Because coyotes and snakes and quails

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: So am I.

text: Mike drags his feet a few yards behind.
dialog: 
text: They walk for a long stretch through the thorny brush until

dialog: 
text: Amelia lays a limp Debbie down on the ground and sits on the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMELIA

dialog: We're going to rest here for a while.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What if there are snakes?

speaker_heading: AMELIA

dialog: 
scene_heading: 169 EXT. DESERT -- LATER
dialog: 
text: It is well into the morning. Amelia and the children sleep

dialog: 
dialog: 102.
dialog: 
text: Looking through the branches, she spies on the truck and
text: watches another one join it. Mike awakes and sits up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What happening?
dialog: 
text: Amelia ducks and lays Mike face down. The two trucks slowly
dialog: approach.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: (To Mike, in a low
dialog: voice, in Spanish)
dialog: Stay still.
dialog: 
text: A truck drives by about eighty yards away and then passes.
text: The other one cuts diagonally across its path and then gets
text: lost in the desert.
dialog: 
text: Amelia gets up and shakes off the dust. She looks out of
text: place, wearing her best clothes torn by the bramble. She
text: makes sure the trucks are leaving.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Why are we hiding if we didn't do
dialog: anything wrong?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: (In English)
dialog: Because they think we did something
dialog: wrong.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That's not true: you're bad.
dialog: 
text: Amelia freezes upon hearing the boy's words.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMELIA

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMELIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Debbie, sweetheart, wake up.
dialog: 
dialog: 103.
dialog: 
text: She closes her eyes again. Amelia notices her lips are dry

dialog: 
text: Upon seeing that she doesn't react, Amelia looks for the
text: trucks: they're far away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 170 EXT. DESERT -- LATER
dialog: 
text: Amelia carries Debbie in her arms under the burning sun,
text: following a cattle trail. Mike walk behind, pale, sweaty.
text: Amelia looks to the horizon: there is no sign of the trucks.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 171 EXT. DESERT -- DAY
dialog: 
text: They are still walking. Amelia can barely go on. She stops
text: to rest. She is sweating copiously. Mike also looks weak.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 172 EXT. DESERT -- LATER
dialog: 
text: The heat is strong and Amelia is beaten. She looks for the
text: shade of a cluster of mesquites and lays Debbie down. Then
text: she turns to Mike.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Sweetie, I'm going to go look for

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: AMELIA

scene_heading: 173 EXT. DESERT -- DAY
dialog:

scene_heading: 174 EXT. DESERT -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Amelia drags her feet as she walks. She can go no further.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 175 EXT. DESERT -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Amelia sees a small hillock and climbs it with difficulty.
text: She surveys the environs from the top. In the distance she
text: sees a Border Patrol truck driving down a path.
dialog: 
dialog: 104.
dialog: 
text: With great effort, Amelia runs down the hill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: (In Spanish)
dialog: Stop, stop...
dialog: 
text: The truck doesn't stop. Amelia keeps running, flailing her
text: arms and screaming wildly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMELIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Sir... sir... stop...
dialog: 
text: The truck stops and backs up. Amelia keeps going, tripping

dialog: 
text: John (29), a thoroughly Mexican officer, gets out and she
text: runs up, panting, to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMELIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Please help me.
dialog: 
text: John stares at her suspiciously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMELIA (CONT'D)
dialog: I have to go get two kids I left

dialog: 
text: John looks at her suspiciously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (In Spanish, with a

dialog: Are they illegal immigrants?

speaker_heading: JOHN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMELIA

dialog: 
text: John keeps staring at her. He points to a mesquite.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Stand there and don't move.
dialog: 
text: Amelia obeys. John goes back to the vehicle, opens the door
text: and sits down and grabs the radio.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Attention base, I have a 4533...I
dialog: have the suspect.
dialog: 
dialog: 105.
dialog: 
text: Amelia doesn't manage to hear what the radio says. She looks
text: attentively at what the agent is doing. John stops and runs
text: back to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: You're under arrest. Turn around
dialog: and put your hands behind your head.
dialog: 
text: Amelia despairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: I left those kids in the desert, I
dialog: swear.
dialog: 
text: John pushes her forcefully against the truck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Turn around, now.
dialog: 
text: She turns around with her hands over her head. John handcuffs

scene_heading: 176 INT. BORDER PATROL VEHICLE -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Amelia, cuffed, and John, drive down a path in the desert.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Which way are they?
dialog: 
text: Amelia studies the terrain. She points at some mesquites in
dialog: the distance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: (In Spanish)
dialog: Over there.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 177 EXT. DESERT -- DAY

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Where are they?
dialog: 
text: Amelia explores the landscape, anguished.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: They must be around here.
dialog: 
text: Another border patrol truck arrives and pulls up next to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELISEO
dialog: What happened?

speaker_heading: AMELIA (CONT'D)
dialog: They must be over that way.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 178 EXT. CLUSTER OF MESQUITES -- DAY
dialog: 
text: They arrive at the cluster. The two trucks park and the

dialog: 
text: They walk around: nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: There's nobody here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: (To Eliseo, in Spanish)
dialog: I left them about a kilometer in

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELISEO
dialog: (In Spanish)
dialog: Which road?
dialog: 
text: She doesn't know what to say. John grabs her by the arm and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I don't believe you.
dialog: 
text: Amelia looks at him desperately.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMELIA

speaker_heading: ELISEO

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Maybe she's not, let's go.

speaker_heading: SUSAN

speaker_heading: RICHARD

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSAN

speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I need to pee again.

speaker_heading: RICHARD

speaker_heading: RICHARD (CONT'D)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I can't.
dialog: 
text: They laugh. He kisses her. We start to hear the stream.

speaker_heading: SUSAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Now I can.
dialog: 
text: While she pees, they kiss painfully. She starts to cry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHARD

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You missed; you got my leg.

text: on the hood.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly a helicopter with American insignia flies over them
text: and goes to land in an empty lot.
dialog: 
text: Anwar looks up and watches the helicopter descend. The
text: helicopter kicks up a cloud of dust before the stunned gaze
text: of dozens of children. Some camels are frightened. Some
text: starving dogs bark at it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 189 EXT. TOWN -- EVENING
dialog: 
text: They carry Susan to the helicopter in a stretcher. They
text: load her in carefully. Richard follows her through the wind

dialog: 
text: A reporter speaks to the camera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER
text: In this helicopter is Susan Jones,
dialog: an American mother of two who was
dialog: seriously injured in a terrorist
dialog: attack. It appears fundamentalist
dialog: organizations planned the attack...
dialog: 
text: The helicopter settles softly in the parking lot. It is
text: immediately surrounded by several Moroccan soldiers. The
text: doctors on the ground prepare the stretcher.
dialog: 
text: Ken walks hurriedly toward the chopper, guarding himself
text: from the wind.
dialog: 
text: Susan is immediately placed on the stretcher and quickly
text: taken to the emergency room. Richard follows close behind

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Mr. Jones, I'm Ken Clifford,

dialog: as soon as she's stable...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Thank you...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KEN
text: There are lots of reporters waiting.
dialog: Is there anything you want to say to
dialog: the press? A statement against

dialog: 
text: Richard looks at him as if he doesn't know what he's talking
dialog: about.
dialog: 
dialog: 117.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: The last thing I'm worried about

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOROCCAN DOCTOR
dialog: (In good English)
dialog: We're going to have to operate
dialog: immediately.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Is she going to be ok?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOROCCAN DOCTOR
dialog: It's probable. We're going to try to
text: save her arm. She's been bleeding
dialog: internally, and there's been some
dialog: clotting so there's a high risk of
dialog: gangrene.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (insistently, as if
dialog: he hadn't heard the
dialog: doctor)
dialog: But she's going to be ok?
dialog: 
text: The Moroccan doctor puts his hand on Richard's shoulder and
text: thinks about his answer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOROCCAN DOCTOR
dialog: Yes, she's going to be ok.
dialog: 
text: The doctor leaves and Richard goes back to looking at his

dialog: 
text: The doctors are still prepping her. Richard walks in.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 193 INT. EMERGENCY ROOM -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: He stands next to Susan, who is unconscious. He looks at a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Hey sweetie, how are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE (O.S.)

dialog: they brought some baby chickens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Oh really?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE (O.S.)
dialog: I held one in my hand. He was really

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Dad, are you ok?

scene_heading: 195 INT. CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Chieko, naked, sits in an armchair, again submerged in the
text: remote world of her silence. Before her, Kenji observes her
text: nakedness, her sadness, her pained beauty.
dialog: 
text: For a while they remain motionless. She seems to return
text: from the long journey to herself and turns to look at him.
text: Their eyes meet. There are still tears in Chieko's eyes.
text: They hold each other's gaze until Chieko gets up, gets her
text: notebook, scribbles down some words and gives them to him.
dialog: 
text: Kenji reads them and looks at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI
dialog: You don't have to apologize for
dialog: anything.
dialog: 
text: She sits down beside him. They look at each other again for
text: a few, long seconds. Chieko takes his hand, strokes it for a
text: moment, kisses it, sucks one of his fingers and then puts it
text: back in its place.
dialog: 
text: She grabs her notebook and starts writing a long note. It
text: takes her almost a minute to do so. Kenji, nervous because
text: of her proximity, watches her write feverishly.
dialog: 
text: Chieko finishes writing, folds the note and hands it to Kenji.
text: Kenji starts unfolding it, but Chieko stops him. She takes
text: it away from him, folds it again and puts it in his breast
text: pocket. She signals for him to read it later.
dialog: 
text: Kenji gets up to go. She stands next to him. Her nakedness
text: contrasts with Kenji's toughness. He bows his head to say
text: goodbye and she moves aside for him to pass. Kenji walks
text: past her as she watches.
dialog: 
text: Kenji reaches the door. He opens it and turns to look at
text: Chieko again, who has been left in the middle of the hall.
text: He bows his head again and leaves.
dialog: 
text: Chieko watches him leave and closes her eyes painfully.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 196 INT. ELEVATOR, CHIEKO'S BUILDING -- NIGHT

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: Officer... officer...

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOORMAN (CONT'D)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI
dialog: Good evening, I'm lieutenant Mamiya.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YASUJIRO
dialog: Good evening, how can I help you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI
dialog: Sir, there was an incident and...
dialog: 
text: Yasujiro looks at him attentively. Kenji, still moved by
text: Chieko, looks distracted, confused.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't mean to bother you, but...
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Do you own a .270 caliber Winchester
dialog: 70 rifle with the registration
dialog: number...
dialog: 
text: Kenji looks through his pockets, takes out a small notebook
text: and looks up the missing number.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI (CONT'D)
dialog: UK-9023?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YASUJIRO
dialog: I don't remember the license, but I
dialog: did have a rifle like the one you
dialog: described.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI
dialog: Is it true that you gave it to a Mr.
dialog: Hassan Ibrahim, who lives in southern
dialog: Morocco?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YASUJIRO
dialog: Hassan Ibrahim?
dialog: 
dialog: 121.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI
dialog: He says he was your guide in a hunt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YASUJIRO
dialog: Hassan? Of course. He was a very
dialog: good guide and I gave him the rifle.
dialog: Hassan is a very kind man. Did
dialog: anything happen?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI
dialog: There was an attempted murder with
dialog: that rifle, and the Moroccan police
dialog: want to confirm it's not off the
dialog: black market.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YASUJIRO
dialog: No, I gave it to him.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Is Hassan ok?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: 
text: Yasujiro remains silent for a moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YASUJIRO
dialog: Am I legally involved?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI
dialog: Not for the moment. You may have to
dialog: go testify for your friend.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YASUJIRO
dialog: Can I leave now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI
dialog: Good night.
dialog: 
text: They both bow to say goodbye. Yasujiro walks toward the
text: elevator. Kenji calls out to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI (CONT'D)
dialog: Excuse me.
dialog: 
text: Kenji approaches and Yasujiro awaits, expectant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI (CONT'D)
dialog: Your daughter told me about your
dialog: wife on the balcony. I'm very sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YASUJIRO
dialog: What balcony?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI
dialog: About how your wife killed herself
text: by jumping off the balcony.
dialog: 
dialog: 122.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YASUJIRO
dialog: My wife never jumped off a balcony.
dialog: She shot herself in the head. My
dialog: daughter was the first to find her.
dialog: 
text: Kenji is left speechless.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YASUJIRO (CONT'D)
dialog: I've explained it to the police
dialog: several times. Don't bother us with
dialog: that anymore, please.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI
dialog: I'm very sorry sir, we won't bother
dialog: you anymore. Good night.

scene_heading: 198 EXT. TOKYO STREETS -- NIGHT

scene_heading: 199 INT. BAR -- NIGHT

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI
text: Another whisky.
dialog: 
text: The T.V. has been turned on to a Japanese newscast. Kenji
text: takes out Chieko's note, reads it and, as soon as he is done,
text: closes his eyes. He looks around. Everybody seems to be

dialog: 
text: A reporter appears on T.V.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Susan Jones, the American woman
text: wounded in an attack in Morocco ten

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Do you want something to eat? I
dialog: could make you a sandwich.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENJI

dialog: 
text: From the balcony, naked, Chieko observes the city stretching

dialog: 
text: Yasujiro walks in and encounters his daughter completely
text: naked. There are still traces of Chieko's tears in her eyes.
dialog: 
text: Yasujiro is affected when he sees his daughter like this,
text: but says nothing. He slowly walks toward her. Chieko looks
text: hurt, but whole.
dialog: 
text: Yasujiro stands beside her. They look at each other. Chieko
text: holds out her hand and takes his. Chieko squeezes. She looks
