text: listening to the RADIO, a BBC-like AFRICAN CORRESPONDENT
dialog: reporting...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BBC CORRESPONDENT (O.S.)
dialog: It would seem things are changing
dialog: quickly within the interim

dialog: consolidating their control of the
dialog: government in the wake of the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BBC CORRESPONDENT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: He also condemned the Native

dialog: presented a threat to the very
dialog: fabric of national security...
dialog: 
text: Seeing Agu, FATHER turns off the radio.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIG BROTHER

speaker_heading: BIG BROTHER

speaker_heading: BIG BROTHER
dialog: We are seeing that witch woman on
dialog: the road today. She is saying we
dialog: are thieves. Why is she saying
dialog: that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER

text: has taken away her ration. The land
dialog: we are letting the refugees use has
dialog: been in our family since before
dialog: your Grandfather, we gave her a
dialog: place in the camp but she refused.
dialog: 
text: Agu watches his father eat, slowly, tasting and appreciating
text: every bite, smiling at Mother. Agu realizes his own way of

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU
dialog: So she's crazy?
dialog: 
text: Agu burps involuntarily.
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
text: They quiet down again, but suddenly Sister FARTS. They all

speaker_heading: AGU

speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: What is this?
dialog:

dialog:

speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
dialog: If I am closing my eye, I am seeing

dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
dialog: You can be walking on road and

scene_heading: EXT. VILLAGE STREETS - DAY
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Just behind them a contingent of 20 PLF REBELS descend on

dialog: 
text: Agu and his family find a SMALL GROUP of civilians waiting on
text: the ground, pinned down by gunfire. Some of the MEN from the
text: Church with clubs and machetes.
dialog: 
text: Father nods to them, points in one direction. They shake
text: their heads. He points in the other direction. They shake
dialog: their heads no again.
dialog: 
text: They ALL slip between the stairs of the same building,
text: assessing their situation. Rebels spread out on the hill
text: overlooking the town.
dialog: 
text: There is no where to go. Father looks at his children,
dialog: knowing it was a mistake not to get them out of town.
text: Beckoned by a village man, the family runs across the road,

speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
dialog: I am not feeling my legs. It is

speaker_heading: PERSON-

text: an invisible looming threat heralded by a cacophony of high
text: pitched projectiles, ground shaking explosions, and CRIES of

dialog: 
text: BANG. Father looks out a small slit. He sees an NRC SOLDIER
text: FALL from a sniper hit. The soldiers move for cover,
text: seemingly held at bay by the nearby shooter.
dialog: 
text: He looks back at all the faces in the room with him. Fearful.
text: Another shot rings out, it is near. He looks up and realizes
text: the SNIPER is in their building.

speaker_heading: AGU
dialog: (to his Father)

speaker_heading: MAN #2 MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: And if they are Army they Shut up! Shut up!

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN #2
dialog: (through his teeth)
dialog: I am rather to be outside than to

speaker_heading: FATHER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MAN

speaker_heading: FATHER

scene_heading: EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - MINUTES LATER
dialog: 
text: Agu, Big Brother, Father, Grandfather and several of the men

dialog: 
text: Agu and Big Brother run.
dialog: 
text: Agu dodges around a corner as a bullet hits the wall beside
dialog: him.
dialog: 25.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Safely around the corner, he stops and looks over for Big
text: Brother who was just a second ago behind him. Agu looks down,
text: Big Brother is lying face down in a pool of blood. Agu
text: reaches for his Big Brother as his body is pelted by bullets.
dialog: 
text: Reloading, they see Agu frozen in place. They aim to fire
text: just as Agu regains his senses and runs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BUSH - CONTINUOUS
dialog:

dialog: 
text: The sounds of WAR gone.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BUSH - DUSK
dialog:

dialog: 
text: He cries drunkenly, walking deeper into the wilds.

scene_heading: EXT. FOREST TREE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Agu tries to sleep on a branch of a tree, he still cries a

scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - LATER
dialog: 
text: Agu again wanders the intermittent bush and woods.
dialog: 
text: He finds one rotten fruit hanging from a tree. Devours it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST CREEK - LATER
dialog: 
text: A small babbling creek. Agu drinks water. The sounds of

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST VILLAGE - DUSK
dialog: 
text: Agu finds a hunting lodge of some kind. It has not been
text: inhabited for some time.
dialog: 
text: He digs through what's left. Finds some grains of rice in the
text: bottom of a basket.
dialog: 26.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST VILLAGE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Agu has the grains of rice in an old pot with water. But he

text: immediately regrets it, running over to it to see if any of
text: the rice is left.
dialog: 
text: He cries again, more out of fatigue and hunger than sadness,
dialog: there is nothing else he knows to eat.
dialog: 
text: He tries eating grass.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BUSH - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Agu, stomach in pain, vomits.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BUSH - DAY
dialog: 
text: Tired, hungry, thirsty, Agu walks aimlessly.
dialog: 
text: He sees a BOY, just a bit older than him, lithe and dark as
text: coal, in tribal dress, a thin stemmed flower head dress on
dialog: his crown.
dialog: 
text: Agu, stops, unsure if he is real.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
text: A forest spirit.
dialog: 
text: The boy runs away. Agu follows.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CREST OF HILL - DAY
dialog: 
text: Agu crests the hill and into the valley below. He looks back,
text: the boy is gone. He runs deeper down a path leading into the
dialog: forest.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BUSH PATH - FOREST - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Suddenly the forest animals go unusually quiet.
dialog: 
text: Agu stops. Looks around. The forest is dark and unwelcome. It
text: looms over him, seeming to grow taller in his mind.
dialog: 
text: He bends down into the tall grass, watching the forest seem
text: to move. Frightened, Agu lowers himself further, listening,
dialog: watching.
dialog: 27.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: SILENCE. The forest seems to move from inside. He freezes,
text: the hair tingling on the back of his neck, his mouth still
text: wrenched from crying.
dialog: 
scene_heading: FOOTSTEPS. GRASS RUSTLES. FOOTSTEPS LOUDER. Then, MACHINE GUN
text: FIRE zips over his head. The thick grass cut and pecked by
text: bullets.
dialog: 
text: MEN rush and pounce past him but he cannot see them, he can
text: only hear their desperation and equipment clanking.
dialog: 
text: Agu sees TWO PLF Rebels cresting the ridge line. POP POP,
text: they drop.
dialog: 
text: He turns to see where the shot came from just in time to see
text: a SMALL BOY -- machete in hand, a shortened rifle strapped to
text: his back -- in mid-air jumping at him.
dialog: 
text: WHAM. The boy's foot lands with a thud on Agu's raised arm.
dialog: 
text: Agu SCREAMS, sure he has been killed, tries crawling away. He
text: turns and looks. The BOY whacks him with the broad side of
text: the machete.
dialog: 
text: Agu SCREAMS and CRIES harder, curling like a beaten dog.
dialog: 
text: The boy hits him again and Agu relents. He sees a vision that
text: makes him sure he is dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
dialog: This is what death is feeling like.
dialog: 
text: Out of the forest, a surreal spectacle: 50 NATIVE DEFENSE
scene_heading: FORCE (NDF) SOLDIERS --- not GOVERNMENT or PLF REBEL ---
text: emerge from the edge of the forest.
dialog: 
text: They look like they are wearing the costumes of some tribal
text: warrior ceremony. Their heads and bodies in elaborate grass
text: wraps and crowns, amulets hang from their bodies.
dialog: 
text: ONE is stark NAKED except for lengths of belt-fed bullet
text: chain wrapped around his body and leading into his GPMG.
dialog: 
text: They are ALL young, in their twenties, some boys in their
text: teens and even younger.
dialog: 
text: Agu, hypnotized by their colorful, yet vigilant and potent
text: presence, is in awe, until another BOOT pins him to the
dialog: ground.
dialog: 
text: HANDS roughly turn him over. His shirt is yanked over his
text: head and used to tie his arms behind his back. He is shoved
text: again, YELLED at, TAUNTED, until...
dialog: 28.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Make way!
dialog: 
text: SOMEONE is approaching from behind them, the NDF Soldiers
text: finish tying Agu's arms, then step back in respect and watch
text: a MAN pass, followed by an ENTOURAGE OF 10 more NDF Soldiers:
text: his AIDE, CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER, BODY GUARDS, and CONTROLLER
text: GUARD (a MAN who holds what equates to a Roman Eagle Staff
text: adorned in tribal motifs) as well as a contingent of his
scene_heading: SMALL BOY UNIT (SBU).
dialog: 
text: This MAN moves slowly, like someone who can afford to take
text: his time. His clothing tribal with a distinctive chief-like
dialog: flare to it. There is no question, he is the boss, he is
text: their COMMANDANT.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: Why is this thing here on the

dialog: (no one responds)
dialog: Who is catching this thing?

speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: Strika. Is it you who is finding
dialog: this thing?
dialog:

speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: Enh! Strika? Untie him.
dialog: (to the other NDF Soldiers)
dialog: So all of you grown men here, and

scene_heading: FAST KILL AND BONE

dialog:

dialog: 
text: The sound startles Agu in the midst of pouring a cup of water

dialog: 
text: Feeling Strika's eyes still on him, Agu looks back, and
text: Strika is right next to him.
dialog:

dialog:

dialog: 
text: Strika motions, signaling him to focus down the road. The air

text: LIGHT ARMORED VEHICLES rolling in their direction.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
dialog: I am almost laughing and almost

dialog: 
text: Three trucks becomes FOUR TRUCKS, then FIVE. Large Caliber

dialog: 
text: ANGLE FROM POV OF FIRST GOVERNMENT TRUCK
dialog: 
text: A SQUAD of SBU-NDF SOLDIERS scurry across the road like a
text: fleeing deer. Only one stays behind, CHICKEN LEGS, stopping,
text: turning, revealing, an RPG.
dialog: 
text: The PLF DRIVER, realizing, slams on the breaks. Grinds the
text: transmission into a lower gear, then neutral, fighting to get
text: it into reverse when. ZWOOOF -- the RPG slams into his cabin.
dialog: 
text: BOOM. The first truck's engine compartment shatters in a hail
text: storm of shrapnel, fire and smoke into the cabin.
dialog: 
text: Hope signals aggressively. The SBU rushes onto the road
text: dragging SPIKE STRIPS, RPGs and GPMGs. They ensure no
dialog: retreat.
dialog: 52.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: For a second, nothing happens. Agu closes his ears, expecting

dialog: 
text: The GOVERNMENT TROOPS hold their rifles into the air.
dialog: 
text: ONE MAN in the convoy yells out...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARMY CORPORAL
dialog: Please do not shoot us!
dialog: 
text: Agu grips his machete harder. Sweat beads all over his face.
text: He looks around petrified, confused, excited.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (O.S.)
dialog: On the floor!
dialog: 
text: Agu sees SEVENTY NDF SOLDIERS emerge from the jungle,
text: ANNOUNCING their presence with an echoing BARK. An impressive
dialog: show of scale of force.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: Agu, where is the fucking
dialog: ammunition?
dialog: 
text: Agu remembers he forgot the extra ammunition. He scrambles
text: back down into the ditch as...
dialog: 
text: KPWAP! Agu flinches and ducks. Someone in the bush sprays the
text: truck, bullets ricochet off of the metal door of the middle
text: truck, a windshield is shattered. Then all the NDF soldiers
text: open fire. It is a quick and effective slaughter.
dialog: 
text: Agu holds his ears. It all happened so quickly he didn't see
text: the full carnage, but when he gets up, the trucks are chewed
text: up and the men inside are dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (O.S.)
dialog: Disarm and disrobe them!
dialog: 
text: Rambo repeats the CALL, moves forward with another SBU squad.
dialog: 
text: Some of the Government Soldiers are crying, as Rambo's men
text: kick away the weapons and yank off their clothes.
dialog: 
text: Commandant, his ENTOURAGE, and CONTROLLER, emerge from the
text: bush with guns aimed and ready. He is proud of the catch.
dialog: 
text: Upon seeing him, NDF SQUADS move up the road to secure the
text: front and down the road to secure their tail.
dialog: 
text: The SBU moves to join the CENTER. Agu walks past a few trucks
text: and stripped soldiers with necks strained towards death.
dialog: 53.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Hope grabs Griot and Preacher, jumps into the back of a truck
text: and looks around, throwing useless items over the side.
dialog: 
text: Commandant and his entourage look for a healthy man and are
text: disappointed by all the dead men. Finally, they find one, the
text: CORPORAL, alive.
dialog: 
text: Commandant's Body Guards drag him to Agu.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: Agu, come here, enh. Come here
dialog: right now. Come here. These are the
dialog: dogs who killed your father.
dialog: 
text: Agu looks disdainfully at the man quivering on the ground
text: beneath Commandant, blabbering incomprehensibly, shaking his
text: head at Agu. Agu's nerves fire off.
dialog: 
text: Out of the corner of his eye, ONE GOVERNMENT SOLDIER runs for
text: the bush. He is nearly naked, his body glistens with his
dialog: comrades' blood.
dialog: 
text: No one seems to mind. Then, MUZZLE FLASHES out of the bushes
text: at the end of the road. KWAP, KWAP-KWAP. Flesh explodes from
text: the man's thigh and scatters to the ground. He falls without
text: screaming.
dialog: 
text: Our attention returns to the man held in front of Agu.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: Agu, you will kill this man.
dialog: 
text: The Corporal moans dreadfully, pissing himself as he cries.
text: The pool of urine from him and from Commandant is all around
text: his flip-flops, mixing with blood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARMY CORPORAL
dialog: Please, Sah. I am an engineering

speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: Open it.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRIOT
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 
text: Griot holds up a surveying scope. He offers it to Commandant

text: Commandant his rifle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: No, no, this won't do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AIDE
dialog: A pistol?

speaker_heading: TWO-I-C

speaker_heading: CSO

speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: Rambo, seize him, hold his ass to
dialog: the ground.
dialog: 
text: Commandant unzips his pants and urinates on him.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: (in Agu's ear)
dialog: God and the spirit of your Father
dialog: is wanting you to kill him.
dialog: 
text: Commandant grabs Agu's hand, the one holding the machete and
text: squeezes his own hand around Agu's.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: Like this. Just bring this hand up
dialog: and knock him well well.
dialog: 
text: He takes Agu's hand and raises it high. Agu stares into the
text: petrified man's eyes. He looks at his feet, urine and blood
text: splattered on them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: Use all of your force, imagine the
text: blade sinking deep into him like
text: chopping a coconut.
dialog: 
text: Agu's face grimaces, as he gathers all his strength, he slams
text: fiercely into the corporal's head. The blade splits the skin
text: on the man's forehead and gashes his skull.
dialog: 
text: The man screams an unbearable, screeching, grating sound.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes! That is how you are dealing
dialog: with the NRC. Do it again! And
text: again and again until he shuts up.
dialog: 
text: The NDF Soldiers hold the Corporal up, goading Agu on.
dialog: 
text: Agu brings the machete up, swings it hard. KWOMP!
dialog: 
text: The man's screams as sound grows dim.
dialog: 
text: Agu chops again. The THUD vibrates up his arm, droplets of
text: blood suspend in the air and sparkle.
dialog: 
text: Anger, memories of his father and his brother, gunned down in
text: the street fueling anger he didn't know he could muster
text: starts swinging harder.
dialog: 56.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Strika walks over with his rifle and helps Agu. Together,

dialog: 
text: Commandant pulls him up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: Watch his blood, Agu. That is
dialog: justice. That is what God wanted.
dialog:

dialog: women here, before you are even
dialog: knowing it, your soldier is
text: standing at full `tenshun. They are
dialog: having breasts so soft and so round
dialog: that their clothes are rejoicing to
dialog: be holding them. And they are
dialog: having bottoms with specs so nice
dialog: that anytime they are sitting down,
text: the ground is also rejoicing. They
dialog: are knowing well well how to make a

dialog: and loving, kai! The last time I am

speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: You all will see, because that is

dialog: will see it all with your own eyes.
dialog: 60.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The men's eyes glaze over deliriously staring into the fire.
text: Then a SOUND causes them all to turn, weapons up in defense.

speaker_heading: TWO-I-C
dialog: Commandant, sir!
dialog: 
text: 12 CIVILIAN REFUGEES stare in bewilderment at their
text: encampment, followed by two NDF PICKETS who salute
dialog: Commandant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: Who is this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TWO-I-C
dialog: Refugees, sir. They say the PLF and
dialog: the NRC took their village three
dialog: days ago. They killed most, but let
dialog: these ones go.
dialog: 
text: Commandant stews on the intel. The SBU watch him, waiting for
dialog: him to make a decision -- will it be battle?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: Well, let us be giving their

scene_heading: EXT. EMPTY LOT, BURNT VILLAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: ANGLE WIDE over a burnt out village. Civilian trucks and cars
text: smolder. A BATTLE is raging. From across town we see that the
text: PLF defend a hill that the NDF are advancing on.
dialog: 
text: Commandant watches the progress through his SURVEYOR SCOPE.
text: The NDF are held at bay by an RPG attack. They respond with
text: fierce fire. Moving in open against bullets.
dialog: 
text: Commandant's main entourage all kneel behind him in the lot.
text: THREE squads in defensive positions beyond them. Agu and the
text: rest of the SBU stand near an unfinished wall. The sound of
text: the occasional passing bullet shocks no one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOPE
dialog: (whispering to Agu)
dialog: See what the PLF does to you?
dialog: 
text: Hope points to a line of DEAD CIVILIANS. Their hands chopped
text: off on a rock next to them. A WOMAN and a CHILD lay on the
text: street, as if they laid down where they stood to take a nap
text: and never got up. The woman's head unnaturally propped up
text: against the wall staring permanently at her twisted feet.
dialog: 
text: A BULLET zips past and ricochets off the wall next to Agu.
dialog: 61.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Agu looks around. He notices the smashed bullet at his feet.
text: Just as he bends over to pick it up, where his head would
text: have been, a bullet smashes into the wall. No one seems
dialog: interested.

speaker_heading: COMMANDANT

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TWO-I-C

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: Explain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TWO-I-C
dialog: It's very difficult, suh. Our men

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: But nothing. Take the bridge, that

dialog: 
text: Commandant motions for the MORTAR MAN to set up a mortar to

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD TO BRIDGE, BURNT VILLAGE - SAME
dialog: 
text: Two-I-C and his forward operation team are hunkered down
text: behind a building facing a PLF stronghold -- TWO MACHINE GUN
text: nests with sand bags in front of the heavily defended bridge
text: which looks like a former check point.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TWO-I-C
dialog: We need support, suh. The men's
dialog: spirts are low, suh.
dialog: 
text: Behind Two-I-C there is general chaos. The men are not

text: men around him to help him carry an injured RAMBO to safety,
dialog: but no one will help him.
dialog: 62.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He is driven to tears in the chaos, spinning in circles

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: Agu, Strika, come here. Look at
dialog: this.
dialog: 
text: Agu and Strika obey. Commandant holds the scope up for them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: This is a very special device, you
dialog: can be seeing the enemy with it,
dialog: even when they are hiding.
dialog: 
text: Agu, through the scope, sees the FORWARD STRIKE NDF SOLDIERS
text: unload and disperse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: You see?
dialog: 
text: He motions for the mortar to fire. Agu looks through it while
text: the first blasts force the PLF to scurry. Strika, impatient
dialog: for his try, paces.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: It's magic.
dialog: (to the men)
dialog: I need volunteers! Who has heart?
dialog: Who wants to fight with me? Who
dialog: isn't afraid of bullets!?
dialog: 
text: The men ROAR BACK in affirmation. Commandant moves amongst
text: the men, placing his hand on their chest, feeling their
dialog: hearts.
dialog: 
text: When it's Strika's turn to look, Commandant interrupts his
text: try by asking him if he has heart for battle. Conflicted
text: between wanting to try out the scope and the call for battle,
text: he affirms he is ready to fight while the "toy" is put away
dialog: by the Aide.
dialog: 63.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: Commandant selects men and boys to go with him, those who
text: aren't selected are pushed aside and kneel down in shame and
text: disappointment. Amongst the selected are Agu, Strika, Hope,
dialog: Chicken Legs, and Griot.
dialog: 
text: An AA technical rushes back around the market towards the
text: intersection under a hailstorm of bullets and clouds of
text: smoke, PREACHER is in the back firing back with RANDY and a
text: couple other SBU's.
dialog: 
text: The Technical screeches into position at the top of the
text: intersection leading to the bridge.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: Chicken Legs, go!
dialog: 
text: Chicken Legs runs to the intersection with Griot in support,

dialog: 
text: The SELECTED TEAM, about 20 MEN and SBUs, advance towards the
dialog: bridge.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD TO BRIDGE, BURNT VILLAGE - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Commandant CHANTS a war chant, "no retreat, no surrender, men
text: dropping, men moving". The men respond to the CHANT, all of
text: them, a battle cry that rouses. They keep huffing into the
text: chant as Commandant addresses them...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: These bullets?
dialog: 
text: The WHISTLE of bullets increases and, where most rational men
dialog: would duck, has no affect on Commandant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: They are nothing. No one can touch
dialog: us!
dialog: 
text: The Commandant pulls a chanting Agu up near him and uses him
dialog: as an example.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you afraid?
dialog: 
text: Agu shakes his head, even if inside he is afraid.
dialog: 
text: Commandant, along with Tripod and the Controller.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: Moove it! Gentlemen! Moooooove
dialog: it!
dialog: 64.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The NDF SOLDIERS YELL again. A NERVE TINGLING BATTLE CRY.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: No retreat! No surrender! Men
dialog: dropping! Men moving!
dialog: 
text: The bullets whistle by angrily. Then, a tidal wave of wind
text: and fire is laid down on them, tearing up a building's wall
text: and wooden kiosks around them. The men do not flinch, they
dialog: believe they cannot be hit, although some MEN do go down, the
text: majority continues the advance.
dialog: 
text: Agu is astonished, but because everyone else keeps moving, so
text: does he. To his left, Commandant smiles at him, loving the
text: adrenaline of battle. TRIPOD prancing in front of them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: Agu, let me be see your aim, hit
dialog: that man.
dialog: 
text: Agu aims at a PLF running across the road. Pulls the trigger.
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: Agu, it is on safety, what was Two-
dialog: I-C teaching you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU
dialog: To always be leaving it off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: Off. How will you be firing quickly
dialog: if it is in safety? Enh? Listen.
dialog: 
text: Commandant takes the rifle, looks for a clean shot at PLF
text: fighters. KWAP-KWAP. A man goes down. He looks back at Agu.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: Like that.
dialog: 
text: Agu, safety off, fires. It nearly knocks him off balance. He
text: looks at Strika and Commandant for approval, but their
text: attention is on the PLF, who seem to be moving in from all
dialog: directions now.
dialog: 
text: Agu, Strika, Griot, Hope, Chicken Legs and Preacher all
text: yelling at the tops of their lungs as they go forward towards
text: the Rebel positions, increasing in speed, bravado,
dialog: fearlessness and ferocity.
dialog: 
text: As the PLF Rebels near the bridge, a hidden NDF company
text: ambushes them, on their heels, they rush back to the
dialog: intersection.
dialog: 65.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: ANGLE FROM the PLF REBELS. See the TWO Companies Commandant
text: sent around the sides spilling out onto the road on either
text: side of town. They too storm the PLF position recklessly.
dialog: 
text: The PLF, seeing they are surrounded, drop their weapons and
text: run for the edge of town.
dialog: 
text: The NDF advance turns into a sprint. The bravado works, as
text: they drop more retreating rebels.
dialog: 
text: Bodies, weapons, and ammunitions scatter the ground.
dialog: 
text: Agu looks for Commandant and Strika, his nervous system on
dialog: fire.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. EDGE OF BURNT VILLAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Agu and the SBU patrol the edge of the town and jungle,
text: picking up dropped supplies and loot from dead rebels.
dialog: 
text: Commandant stands over the bodies of SEVEN DEAD NDF SOLDIERS,
text: amongst them, RAMBO. Commandant looks like he feels great
text: remorse. Preacher, bandaged but alive, says a prayer.
dialog: 
text: ONE LIVE REBEL in underwear, arms tied behind his back, is
text: being prodded by Chicken Legs and begging for his life.
text: Chicken Legs shoots him in the hip. He falls, twitching.
text: Chicken Legs enjoys his catch and takes his time finishing
dialog: him off.
dialog: 
text: Agu notices that some of the RPG's are made of WOOD, as if
text: they were theatrical props, he kicks one. Solid and dense.
dialog: 
text: BOOM. Chicken Legs shoots the PLF prisoner again. He turns
text: over, his life slowly draining from him.
dialog: 
text: Agu sees ANOTHER BODY laying face down and quickly starts
text: searching his pockets. He takes the bandoliers, smells the
text: water bottle, looks in his pack, brown-brown in a foil
text: envelope, batteries, and a small ball of cloth tied up with
dialog: string.
dialog: 
text: He unravels it. Inside he finds GOLD NUGGETS. He looks at
text: them curiously, unsure what they are, puts one in his mouth,
dialog: bites it.
dialog: 
text: BOOM. Preacher finishes off the naked prisoner. His brains
text: splattered on the pavement. No one seems to take note, by now
dialog: a common practice.
dialog: 66.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT./INT. COMMANDANT'S BURNT VILLAGE HQ - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Agu calls Strika and shows him the gold. Strika looks at it
text: warily, as if Agu shouldn't have it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU
dialog: What?
dialog: 
text: Strika shakes his head and motions to follow him. Agu sighs
text: as he obliges.
dialog: 
text: They salute and pass Commandant's body guard and enter an
text: abandoned post office. Strika leaves Agu behind at the
text: doorway of Commandant's room, motioning for him to go in.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COMMANDANT'S HQ - SAME
dialog: 
text: Agu listens as Commandant speaks via radio to SUPREME
text: COMMANDER Dada Goodblood on the other end. It's a close
dialog: conversation. Strategy. Something mentioned about an
dialog: intersection of highways. Cut offs to the Capital. And
text: Commandant being promoted, soon, to General.
dialog: 
text: His silhouette paces around in the lantern light. Maps are
text: laid out on the floor. He kneels down, studying them.
dialog: 
text: Agu coughs, to call attention to himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: (still studying the maps)
dialog: Sit.
dialog: 
text: He points to his cot across the room. Agu enters, careful not
text: to step on any of the maps spread out on the ground.
dialog: 
text: Agu places the WAD WITH THE GOLD NUGGETS on Commandant's
text: table, then obediently waits next to the cot, watching
text: Commandant studying the map.
dialog: 
text: Commandant stops, notices the wad, curious, opens it, drops
text: its contents in his hands. He looks up at Agu, impressed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: You fought bravely today, Agu.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU
dialog: Thank you, sah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: You see what happens when the men
dialog: listen to me?
dialog: 67.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU
dialog: Yes, sah.
dialog: 
text: Commandant lays out a line of brown-brown. He snorts it and
text: beckons Agu to do the same. Agu, having seen others do this,
text: knows how, but has never experienced it. He sniffs eagerly.
text: The Brown-brown going straight to his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: You are wanting to know how to be
dialog: leading?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU
dialog: No, sah. I am happying to be
dialog: following you, sah.
dialog: 
text: His nose tingles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: That is good, Agu, because there is
text: no learning to be leading. Some men
dialog: is born to leading, other is born
dialog: to following, and other is only
text: waiting to be dying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU
dialog: I am following you, sah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: No, Agu. You are different. You are
dialog: reminding me of me when I was a
dialog: little boy, and this means you are
dialog: borning to be leader. But even the
dialog: best leader Agu, must first be
dialog: learning to be good follower.
dialog: Sometimes I even have to be
dialog: following the Supreme Commander, if
dialog: when I am not agreeing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU
dialog: Yes, sah. I am a good follower,
dialog: sah.
dialog: 
text: Commandant points at the map. Lines of two highways intersect
text: near the bottom center. He points at it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: You are seeing this place. Supreme
dialog: Commander is saying this is
dialog: important. So it is important for
dialog: me then.
dialog: 
text: Agu nods.
dialog: 68.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: If we get this place, then we can
dialog: go to Taro. Is that where your
dialog: mother is?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU
dialog: I am thinking she is in the
dialog: Capital, sah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
text: After Goodblood greets us, we all
dialog: will be going to the Capital, that
dialog: is a certainty.
dialog: 
text: Agu nods. It is hard for him to think of her without feeling
dialog: emotions, and he doesn't want to show Commandant these
text: childish emotions.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: I am wanting to be helping you more
dialog: than the others, Agu.
dialog: 
text: Preacher SINGS somewhere in the encampment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: But do not be telling anyone I am
dialog: helping you like this, this will be
dialog: our secret. Can you be keeping this
dialog: secret, Agu?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU
speaker_heading: (PLEASED)
dialog: Yes, sah.
dialog: 
text: And with Commandant's attention, he is able to forget, for
text: this instance, his mother again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: Then be saying it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU
dialog: I can be keeping this secret, sah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: In this family where I am being
dialog: father, we cannot have the other
dialog: children getting jealous, Agu!
dialog: 
text: He rubs Agu's head, roughly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: Kneel down in front of me. You do
dialog: me this thing.
dialog: 69.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Agu, respectfully, kneels down in front of Commandant as he
text: blows out the lantern light. It is near darkness except for
text: the campfires outside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: I am not punishing you, Agu. I am
dialog: helping you, to care for you.
dialog: 
text: He touches Agu on his shoulder, then his hands drift down
text: Agu's arm to his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: This is what commanding officer is
dialog: supposed to be doing to his best
dialog: boy soldier. Play with him, cherish
dialog: him, protect him, enh?
dialog: 
text: He brings Agu's hand down towards his own genitals. Agu is
text: too afraid to move. Commandant moves Agu's head towards his
text: crotch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: Touch my soldier, Agu, with your
dialog: mouth. This is a command. You took
dialog: an oath to obey, and now obey.
dialog: 
text: Agu's moves to do as he is told. We TILT AWAY AND UP to
text: Commandant, leaning back and mentally departing.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. EDGE OF BURNT VILLAGE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Agu's face appears out of the darkness, illuminated by the
text: lantern lights. His face shows excruciating pain. Everyone is
text: already asleep, so he tries to walk quietly, but it is too
text: painful. He whimpers.
dialog: 
text: Strika has been waiting for him. Agu collapses into Strika,
text: crying. Strika holds him. They lay amongst all the other NDF
text: Soldiers, who are already sleeping.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
dialog: Strika. He is my only friend,
text: Mother. His eye are too red, his
text: teeth are too brown, his head is
dialog: too too big, but he is my friend
text: even if he is looking too ugly.
dialog: 
text: Strika throws his arm around Agu, protecting him.
dialog: 70.

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NATIONAL HIGHWAY JUNCTION - DAY
dialog: 
text: The convoy has stopped in the middle of the country side.
text: Everybody is prepping themselves for battle.
dialog: 
text: The NDF Soldiers smoke their joints laced with powder, others
text: sniff brown-brown, while loading up ammunition and prepping
dialog: for combat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (O.S.)
dialog: No one in the land we are going is
dialog: your friend. They are the farmers
dialog: who feed your enemy.
dialog: 
text: Hope sees Agu hobbling in pain. Looks at him, assessing if he
text: is fit for battle or not. He takes a knife and cuts a slice
text: along Agu's temple. Agu winces in even more pain as Hope
text: smears brown-brown into its bloody abyss.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: The farmers' wives whose breasts
dialog: feed babies who will grow to join
dialog: the enemy ranks, whose wombs breed

dialog: he would think, feels special under Commandant's gaze.

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NATIONAL HIGHWAY JUNTION - LATER
dialog: 
text: The men are kneeled around Commandant. Agu cannot make eye
text: contact with him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: This is the nature of the place we
dialog: are going. The homeland of the
dialog: collaborators and traitors. Our
dialog: people's blood has flowed for year.
dialog: Now must their blood flow, too. Let
dialog: us pray to the spirits and God.
dialog: 
text: The men circle around Commandant, chanting a prayer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: God, be guiding us in everything we
dialog: are about to be doing. Give us the
dialog: strength to fulfill your justice.
dialog: 
text: The men start DANCING around Commandant and SINGING a gruff,
text: guttural war chant.
dialog: 
text: As they are moving out, a CONVOY OF WHITE "UN" VEHICLES speed
text: by down the Highway.
dialog: 71.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Agu looks curiously at one of the PASSENGERS, a WHITE WOMAN.
text: Time slows down so he can see her face staring back from
text: behind the glass windows of the hermetically sealed air-
text: conditioned van.
dialog: 
text: The WOMAN locks eyes with him, but instead of sympathy Agu
text: sees fear in her face. This immediately angers him even if he
text: doesn't know why he is feeling angry.
dialog: 
text: At the same time, a photographer in the back seat snaps
text: photographs of him and the other NDF soldiers.
dialog: 
text: The NDF soldiers yell at the convoy and point their rifles
text: into the air, taunting. As it passes, it speeds up, leaving
text: them in a cloud of red dust.

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VALLEY ABOVE RURAL VILLAGE - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. RIVER NEXT TO RURAL VILLAGE - DAY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BACK OF RURAL VILLAGE - DAY
dialog:

dialog: village.
dialog: 
text: 40 NDF Soldiers with Commandant and Preacher clear the jungle

dialog: village.
dialog: 
text: VILLAGERS RUN. Agu hears the SCREAMS... his eyes alight.
dialog: 
text: The NDF Soldiers OPEN FIRE, charging as they fan out further.

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RURAL VILLAGE - DAY
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
dialog: God, help me to be doing the thing

dialog: 
text: NDF Soldiers behind Agu drop grenades into houses. Women

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FORTIFIED HOUSE STREET - DAY
dialog: 
text: Agu sits over the corpse of an NRC Soldier. He looks around,
text: as if surprised that it is daylight.
dialog: 
text: Hope is speaking to him, but when words come out of Hope's
text: mouth, they sound like a garbled language.
dialog: 
text: Agu looks up at him blankly as he takes a hit from the joint.
dialog: 
text: Now he is surrounded by SEVERAL of his BOY UNIT soldiers who
text: stare and laugh at Agu sitting on the dead soldier.
dialog: 
text: He looks at the group of YOUNG BOY SOLDIERS crying.
dialog: 74.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU
dialog: What is wrong with them? Why are
dialog: they crying?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: Commandant won't let them go with
text: him into battle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU
dialog: Where is this battle?
dialog: 
text: He looks at Strika who shrugs his shoulders. Agu calls the
text: crying BOYS over to him and leads them down the street..
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FORTIFIED HOME - DAY
dialog: 
text: Agu walks down the street with the CRYING BOYS just as his
text: SBU blows up the gates of a fortified house.
dialog: 
text: BOOM. The gates go down in a shower of explosives. Agu and
dialog: the rest storm in.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FORTIFIED HOME
dialog: 
text: Agu and Strika run upstairs, scavenging, breaking,
text: scattering, tipping...
dialog: 
text: There are pictures on the wall. Family, smiling faces, long
text: mildewed.
dialog: 
text: Hope is knocking down a door. KPWAM! KPWAM!
dialog: 
text: Agu and Strika join in, kicking, kicking, kicking. They break
dialog: through.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FORTIFIED HOME - BROKEN ROOM
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
dialog: God, there is nothing to be keeping
dialog: you from watching what we are
dialog: doing.
dialog: 
text: The VOICES laugh, the world shakes.
dialog: 
text: They flip open an armoire. A quiet settles over the room as
text: Hope and Griot take a moment to look at what they have found.
dialog: 75.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A WOMAN, late-twenties, and her 10 year-old DAUGHTER hide
text: with their backs to the men.
dialog: 
text: The woman looks like it could be an emaciated version of
text: Agu's Mother, she even has THE SAME DRESS AS HIS MOTHER.
dialog: 
text: Agu looks at them, his eyes, so high, seem to float on his
dialog: shoulders.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU
dialog: Mother?
dialog: 
text: Hope looks at Agu, amused. Agu moves to hug her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (CONT'D)
dialog: I am not recognizing you.
dialog: 
text: The women turn in fear just as Agu reaches to hug her. It is
text: not Mother. The girl is also emaciated, her knees like
text: jutting knobs.
dialog: 
text: Agu hugs the women anyway. They scream, shrinking away from
dialog: Agu.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (CONT'D)
dialog: I am not bad boy. I am not...
dialog: 
text: Agu tries to hug them, but they SCREAM again. He realizes
text: they are not his Mother and Sister, their fear angers him. He
text: grabs them, pulling at their clothes.
dialog: 
text: Hope and Griot grab the WOMEN by their legs and drag them
text: away as desperate, stark shrieks fill the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (CONT'D)
dialog: You are not my mother! And you, you
dialog: are not my sister!
dialog: 
text: They continue screaming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (CONT'D)
dialog: Enough!
dialog: 
text: The woman clasps her hands together, tears all over her face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: God, please take my daughter safely

dialog: to You.
dialog: 
text: Justice pulls down his shorts and shows himself to the woman
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Devil bless you! Devil born you!
dialog: 76.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Griot holds her down. Strika holds her down, and so does Agu
text: as Hope unzips his pants.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU
dialog: Devil is not blessing me. Shut up!
dialog: Shut up! Shut up!
dialog: 
text: Agu pulls the girl away from her mother, she grasps onto her
text: mother's hand, suspending herself in the air. And now we stay
text: on the LITTLE GIRL'S FACE.
dialog: 
text: She is SCREAMING, but still holds on to her mother, her nails
text: digging into her mother's wrist.
dialog: 
text: On Strika, he bites the little girl's wrist, breaking her
dialog: grasp.
dialog: 
text: Agu falls back with the girl, then drags her light body away
dialog: from her mother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (CONT'D)
dialog: You are not my sister.
dialog: 
text: Strika starts jumping on the LITTLE GIRL. Her breath punched
text: out of her, the GIRL'S screaming stops as all hope is drained
text: from her, her eyes go blank.
dialog: 
text: Griot gets his soldier ready to rape the mother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (CONT'D)
dialog: You are not my mother.
dialog: 
text: Agu walks to her, and at point blank, raises his rifle and
text: dispatches the Mother with a bullet to her head.
dialog: 
text: WHIP PAN to Hope who was still raping her. He stops and looks
text: at Agu like he has lost his mind, PANNING BACK to Agu whose
text: attention has already been drawn outside, to the next room
text: where the walls have been destroyed, providing an OPEN PLAN
dialog: VIEW of the rest of the village...

scene_heading: INT./EXT. FORTIFIED HOME TOWN SQUARE - DUSK

dialog: 
text: Agu, Strika, and Commandant's body guards exit the room

dialog: 
text: Outside. Surviving CIVILIANS have been rounded up and sit in
text: the middle of the street. A scene now unremarkable and
text: familiar to Agu. The NDF Soldiers have taken and loaded
text: everything they possibly can into their trucks. WOMEN cry in
text: a drained, fatigued moan. They slap their faces and claw at
dialog: their own arms.
dialog: 
text: Commandant is happy. He stretches his back.

speaker_heading: CSO

speaker_heading: TWO-I-C
text: A piece of his own RPG is hitting

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: What do we do with them?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: Leave one living. Tell him to run

dialog: 
text: The convoy stops a 100 hundred meters before it as THREE
text: HEAVILY ARMED MEN approach them from the sides of the road,

dialog: 
text: They wear the same amulets and pieces of equipment as the NDF

speaker_heading: CHARCOAL NDF SOLDIER

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The Charcoal NDF Soldier steps to the side with his VHF

speaker_heading: CHARCOAL NDF SOLDIER (CONT'D)
dialog: I have instructions to take you to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU
dialog: These people do not run.
dialog:

speaker_heading: COMMANDANT

dialog: 
text: Commandant seems to have little respect for this man, who
text: leads them deeper into the complex, past a flurry of
text: activity, aides with papers, armed guards, and other
dialog: functionaries.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: I have been asked to leave my men
text: on the edge of town.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEPUTY
dialog: We apologize for the inconvenience.
dialog: We do not want to alarm the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: When can they enter? I have-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEPUTY
dialog: I do not know Goodblood's plan for
dialog: you. I assure you, you will know A-
dialog: S-A-P.
dialog: 
text: He motions for them to sit in an austere waiting room. A
text: SINGLE ARMED GUARD in fatigues sleeps in the room. Deputy
text: clears his throat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEPUTY (CONT'D)
dialog: You will wait here.
dialog: 
text: Commandant looks around the room, unimpressed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: You will bring something to drink
dialog: for us. Water.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEPUTY
dialog: Certainly.
dialog: 82.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: They sit. Collapsing with their field clothes into squeaky
text: and odd civilian spaces. Their weapons dangle on their sides.
text: Two of the BODY GUARDS light a joint. Agu tugs on their
dialog: shirts.
dialog: 
text: He notices the distant look on Commandant's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
dialog: I am looking at him, and I am
text: seeing he is not happy to be
dialog: waiting.
dialog: 
text: Agu gets a hit of the joint. He too collapses against the
text: floor, watching the clock, an analog mid-century clock with
text: hands that slowly rotate around its face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
dialog: And I am seeing these people
text: entering with more than they are
dialog: having when they are leaving and I
dialog: am wondering why they are leaving
dialog: their things behind and if I should
dialog: be telling them.
dialog: 
text: We see CHINESE BUSINESS MEN enter the office, and then leave,
text: and then Commandant readying himself as if it were their
text: turn, but then the Deputy apologizes, and leads in a group of
text: LEBANESE BUSINESS MEN who enter with brief cases and then
dialog: exit without.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
dialog: And with every person that is
dialog: coming, and every person that is
dialog: going, I am seeing anger on
text: Commandant's face grow.
dialog: 
text: And as the clock moves faster, Commandant slams the arms of
text: his chair, BAM, waking the room, and the sleeping ARMED
speaker_heading: GUARD.
dialog: 
text: Just then the Deputy enters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEPUTY
dialog: Supreme Commander is so very upset
dialog: to keep you waiting. Please, follow
dialog: me.
dialog: 
text: The men stand, stretching the stiff muscles. And go through
text: the doors into another, slightly more pleasant, waiting room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEPUTY (CONT'D)
dialog: Please sit, I will be with you
dialog: shortly.

dialog: They stir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEPUTY (CONT'D)
dialog: The Supreme Commander felt ill and

dialog: 
dialog: The Deputy can see this will not satisfy Commandant, who
text: looks like he could squeeze the life out of this functionary.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEPUTY (CONT'D)
dialog: But he invites you to his home
dialog: first appointment in the morning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: Where are you putting us to be

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEPUTY
dialog: I hope this room, with the air

scene_heading: INT. SUPREME COMMANDER'S HQ - HALLWAY - DAY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEPUTY
dialog: Commandant, I trust you rested

scene_heading: INT. SUPREME COMMANDER'S OFFICE - DAY
dialog:

dialog: conversations.
dialog: 
text: Commandant takes a seat, the rest of the entourage hold back
text: uncomfortably, along the edge of the room.
dialog: 
text: The Deputy enters a door on the opposite side of the room
text: where UHF radio chatter links Goodblood to his commanders and
text: fighters across the country. There, an elder statesman like
text: intellectual appears in the doorway, DADA GOODBLOOD, followed
dialog: by the deputy.
dialog: 
text: EVERYONE stands and salutes. Agu strains to finally see the
text: man they have all spoken about. He wears a fine combination
text: of clothes, and looks smart, even in his morning slippers,
text: newspaper in hand, Deputy holds his coffee. He sits on the
text: smaller chair, near to Commandant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOODBLOOD
dialog: At ease Gentlemen. At ease...
dialog: 
text: Goodblood smiles warmly as he sits.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOODBLOOD (CONT'D)
dialog: Commandant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: Supreme Commander, sah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOODBLOOD
dialog: I must apologize for yesterday, so
dialog: much busy-ness these days, it's
dialog: worn me down.
dialog: 
text: Commandant doesn't hide his frustration.
dialog: 85.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: I'm sorry you were feeling weak,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOODBLOOD
dialog: I see your family has grown.
dialog: 
text: He looks at the entourage watching them, in particular the
dialog: boys.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOODBLOOD (CONT'D)
dialog: They will want to eat while we
dialog: talk. Unless you are hungry, too?
dialog: 
text: Goodblood looks at Deputy, who quickly realizes he must usher
text: the men to the adjoining room that offers Commandant and
dialog: Goodblood more privacy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: I am hungry. Two-I-C, bring me a
dialog: plate.
dialog: 
text: Two-I-C starts to move-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOODBLOOD
dialog: Two-I-C, you stay. Deputy?
dialog: 
text: The Deputy nods dutifully.
dialog: 
text: In the dining room a table of European style food is quickly
text: sacked by the men. Strika and Agu stuff croissants into their
text: pockets and sit on the floor, rolling slices of meat and
text: stuffing them in their mouths.
dialog: 
text: Agu keeps one eye on the meeting, where the Commandant and
text: Goodblood share weighted stares. Goodblood reading
dialog: Commandant's emotional weariness, Commandant reading
text: Goodblood's ill intentions. Two-I-C is paralyzed between
dialog: them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: What is this, Chief? Why are you
dialog: making me wait?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOODBLOOD
dialog: It is your duty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: Something has changed, what is it?
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: We are not taking the Capital?
dialog: 86.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOODBLOOD
dialog: Protecting our people remains the
dialog: priority. As you know, the world is
dialog: becoming aware of this war, now. No
dialog: one will escape judgment when it is
dialog: over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: Chief, to protect our people, we
dialog: have the force and the momentum,
dialog: why stop, why wait?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOODBLOOD
dialog: It used to be survival of the
dialog: strongest, the strong dominating by
dialog: brute force, but now it is survival
dialog: of the wittiest and the decisions
dialog: we make have far deeper
dialog: consequences.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: Then what is your plan for my
dialog: battalion? Are you not making me
dialog: General?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOODBLOOD
dialog: I am not. I am giving your
dialog: battalion to Two-I-C, Commandant.
dialog: That is why I brought you here.
dialog: 
text: Two-I-C is overtly surprised, Commandant is able to contain
dialog: his, only just.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOODBLOOD (CONT'D)
dialog: And you, I will promote to Deputy

dialog: immediately. I hope you will accept

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
text: Two-I-C get out.
dialog: 
text: Two-I-C drops his salute and smile. He doesn't know whether
text: to stay or go. Goodblood releases him.
dialog: 87.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOODBLOOD
dialog: I want the ceremony of change over
dialog: tomorrow, so that Two-I-C... I mean
dialog: newly, Commandant in absence, may
dialog: take the battalion back out for
dialog: security details. As you know, and
dialog: much thanks to you, we have the NRC
text: on their heels. With support from
text: the UN and ECOMOD, the battle now
dialog: is for public image. Two-I-C and
dialog: other commanders like him will
dialog: provide that for us until the junta
text: crumbles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: You are taking my battalion?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOODBLOOD
dialog: Commandant, your battalion is my
dialog: battalion. One of hundreds across
dialog: the nation. I will remind you that
dialog: you are a soldier, you are subject
dialog: to orders, you listen and obey
dialog: orders.
dialog: 
dialog: Agu has never seen anyone speak to Commandant in this way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: And for my services, Chief? I
dialog: built this battalion. I am their
dialog: father.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOODBLOOD
dialog: That honor remains yours.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: And payment? What share of the
dialog: resources will I have, for this
dialog: honor?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOODBLOOD
dialog: If you are wanting to be a man of
dialog: industry and resources, then find a
dialog: job with a mining company. I am
dialog: offering you something else
dialog: entirely, an education.
dialog: 
text: Commandant steams, reading the room. SEVERAL of Goodblood's
text: SECURITY PERSONNEL quietly enter the edges of the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOODBLOOD (CONT'D)
dialog: Do not forget, your most important
dialog: duty is obedience. Your first duty
dialog: is obedience...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 88.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOODBLOOD (CONT'D)
dialog: your second duty, obedience. Your
dialog: third, obedience. Everything is
dialog: obedience. Without obedience you
dialog: have nothing. Have you forgotten
dialog: yourself?
dialog: 
text: Commandant adjusts his tone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: I have not Chief. I am not a
dialog: politician, I am a soldier.
dialog:

speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: I will have one last night with

text: A dwarf like Old Woman SLIDES the window open.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHOREHOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A small room. A fluorescent light casting a blue glow over
text: everything. The men's faces shine with sweat. All of the
text: windows and doorways have heavy black material blocking any
text: light from escaping.
dialog: 
text: The men fill up the room. Agu looks up, he cannot believe
text: what he sees.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
dialog: Imagination TV.
dialog: 
text: On the screen is a bootleg Jimmy Cliff film.
dialog: 
text: A HEAVY WOMAN, THE MADAME, approaches them, her eyes shine

text: walks with a limp.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MADAME
dialog: Enh, so you come?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: Ma. Bring something that will
dialog: satisfy my soldiers and my soldier!
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: Bring beer! Bring soda! Bring it
dialog: all!
dialog: 
text: The men laugh forcefully, glancing down the empty hall
text: eagerly. Agu notices a GIRL, young and pretty, sleeping on a
text: bench at the exit to the room. The Madame shouts at her...
dialog: 90.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MADAME
dialog: Get up you, can't you see we are
dialog: having guest?
dialog: 
text: The young girl gets up slowly and goes to a cooler. She bends

speaker_heading: YOUNG GIRL
text: The beer is warm.

speaker_heading: COMMANDANT

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MADAME
dialog: No problem. No problem.
dialog: 
text: The Commandant becomes serious again, his eyes seem to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MADAME (CONT'D)
dialog: No problem.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: Hey Mama, this one's fresh papaya.
dialog: 
text: The men laugh harder. She is annoyed, but not unaccustomed.

dialog: barely 14.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MADAME
dialog: If it is woman you are wanting,

dialog: 
text: She goes and grabs a basket of crisps and places it in front
text: of Agu as FOUR WOMEN appear in the doorway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MADAME (CONT'D)
dialog: We are having enough for you men,
dialog: but there is no more girls for the

dialog: 
text: Agu looks up, angrily.
dialog: 
text: Commandant picks up a hesitant Two-I-C and pushes him out
text: first, the rest of the men waste no time disappearing into
dialog: the hall.
dialog: 92.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Within seconds, the room is empty, leaving Agu behind with
text: the girl. Strika, high and tired, lays on the floor to take a

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHOREHOUSE, SMALL ROOM - LATER
dialog: 
text: Agu sits with his head resting in his arms at the table. An
text: empty beer bottle laying in front of him. He watches the
dialog: Jimmy Cliff movie.
dialog: 
text: Sweat beads on his nose as he eats a chip. The young woman
text: collects the bottles on the table.
dialog: 
text: He studies her face, the pulsing of her blood in her neck,
text: the sweat on her brow and nose. He watches her butt move, her
text: breasts shake as she cleans the table off.
dialog: 
text: Slowly, he reaches out his hand to touch her, she turns and
text: looks at him as if she would bite his arm off.
dialog: 
text: Frustrated and bored, he leaves the room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WHOREHOUSE COURTYARD - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Agu walks over to the shuttered windows of the "sex stalls"
text: and watches various couples copulating. He reaches into his

dialog: 
text: The doors to a room around the horseshoe shaped building
text: swing open, as Two-I-C, half dressed and naked bursts out,
text: sliding down against the wall leaving a trail of blood.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHOREHOUSE - HALLWAY/SMALL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The men drag Two-I-C down the hallway and back into the room
text: with the TV, laying him out on the table. He bleeds from a
text: hole in his head, his face looks like all the pain in the
text: world is coming through him.
dialog: 
text: Commandant enters last, only wearing a sheet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: What is happening? Huh? What
dialog: happened?

speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: What happened to my man? Wh- What
dialog: happened here?
dialog: 
text: They all look at the GIRL Two-I-C had been with, she looks to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: I was just playing with his gun,
dialog: and it just went off. I don't know
dialog: what happened. I don't know- I'm

speaker_heading: GIRL COMMANDANT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: COMMANDANT

scene_heading: INT. UNFINISHED BUILDING, 2ND FLOOR - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Agu sits next to Two-I-C, who is wrapped in a blanket,
text: shivering, his skin shines with a greenish pallor.
dialog: 
text: Agu squeezes a wet cloth over his forehead, dripping brown
dialog: water.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
dialog: His spirit is fighting to be let
text: free from his body.
dialog: (whispering to Two-I-C)
dialog: It is hurting because you are
dialog: thinking about it. If you are
dialog: stopping to think about it, there
dialog: is nothing to be feeling. The
dialog: thinking is the hurting.
dialog: 
text: Outside and around the buildings, the rest of the NDF
text: Battalion rests and waits for orders.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNFINISHED BUILDING, 2ND FLOOR - DAY
dialog: 
text: Two-I-C wheezes. Agu sits at one of the desks separating a
text: bullet from its shell, empties the gun powder onto a piece of
text: gum foil. Agu lights the powder in a POOF. He scrapes the
text: white-grey residue into a line and sniffs it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNFINISHED BUILDING, 2ND FLOOR - DUSK
dialog: 
text: The moon is full and shines into the room. Finally, Two-I-C
text: stops moaning. Agu turns and looks.
dialog: 
text: Approaching Two-I-C, thinking he is dead. Two-I-C's eyes are
text: open and he's trying to whisper something. Agu cannot hear
text: it. He leans in closer. Two-I-C's breaths a death rattle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TWO-I-C
dialog: You are just a boy.
dialog: 
text: Agu looks at his hand, clammy and yellow, fingers gripping
text: his blanket.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TWO-I-C (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you know you are just a boy?
dialog: 95.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Two-I-C begins to tremble, panic. Agu reaches for his hand,
dialog: holds it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TWO-I-C (CONT'D)
dialog: Was this all for nothing?
dialog: 
text: He looks at Two-I-C, unsure why he is feeling sad for this
dialog: man at this moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
text: It is like God is turning his gaze
dialog: on Two-I-C.
dialog: 
text: Two-I-C exhales, the trembling ceases. He is dead. Agu, drawn
text: by the fading light, walks to the balcony overlooking the
dialog: town.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: Agu? Is that you.
dialog: 
text: Agu can barely perceive Commandant sitting in the railing,
text: his skin reflecting the faint embers of a joint cupped in his
text: hands. Agu does not respond.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (SOFTLY)
dialog: Agu. Come. Sit down with me.
dialog: 
text: Agu leans into the railing. Commandant rubs the back of his
dialog: neck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: It is dangerous times now, Agu.
dialog: Can't be trusting nobody. That is
dialog: why it is always good to be
text: sleeping with one eye open. And
dialog: that is why I have you and Strika.
dialog: 
text: Tripod enters with RADIO OPERATOR.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRIPOD
dialog: Goodblood is asking for you.
dialog: 
text: Commandant waves him away. Tripod, aware things have changed,
text: waits an explanation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: Sometimes Agu, sometimes I am
dialog: feeling sorry for you.
dialog: 
text: Agu cannot tell if he heard him say it or if he dreamed he

dialog: 
text: Preacher SINGS over Two-I-C's body. They strip him of his
dialog: "Two-I-C" jacket, his belt, boots, and anything else of use.
text: He is left with only his dirty socks and underwear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
dialog: It is taking Two-I-C all day to be
text: dying, and then he is dying when
text: the moon is full and the night is
text: shining like silver.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: You are my new Two-I-C.
dialog: 
text: Commandant places the jacket on Tripod, who proudly puts it
text: on over his bare chest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
dialog: The the only way not to be fighting
dialog: anymore is to be dying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: This was not God's work. This was
dialog: man's. The Supreme Commander was
dialog: our friend. Now he is our enemy.
dialog: But we are not fearing change...
dialog: for we are strong!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEN
dialog: Strong and proud!

scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE CAMP - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Fog swirls along the canopy of the jungle. Commandant's tent

dialog: 97.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
dialog: Mother. If this war is ever ending
dialog: I am thinking, I cannot be going
dialog: back to doing child thing.
dialog: 
text: Everyone sleeps. Suddenly they are attacked from unseen
text: forces. Bullets pound the ground around them, burying men in
text: dirt and tearing others up with shrapnel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
dialog: We are just wild animals now with
dialog: no place to be going.
dialog: 
text: Agu and Strika hold each other while bullet shells pour on
text: them. The battle is over as quickly as it began.
dialog: 
text: Commandant is frazzled. He picks up his hat, dusting it off,
text: while yelling for the men to fall back.
dialog: 
text: Preacher moves up and down the line, checking the men.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: Tripod, Hope!
dialog: 
text: Agu looks down the line. They are both bleeding. Hope is
text: dead. Tripod still breathes, but his body is leaking blood
text: from many wounds. He screams while staring wildly at everyone
text: looking down at him, breathing.
dialog: 
text: His eyes roll into the back of his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
dialog: Bullet is just eating everything,
dialog: leaf, tree, ground, person --
dialog: eating them -- just making person
dialog: to bleed everywhere... so much
dialog: blood.
dialog: 
text: They pick through the useful gear and begin to move out.
dialog: 
text: Preacher whispers a prayer to himself as Commandant pulls

text: unceremoniously as the men move out.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE - DUSK
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Commandant signals, move down the line..."move out."

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Agu puts his pack on and starts to leave when he sees Strika

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU
speaker_heading: (WHISPERING)
dialog: Strika? Strika! We are having to go
dialog: or they will be leaving us.
dialog: 
text: Strika shakes his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's go.
dialog: 
text: Agu watches as the others disappear into the bush without

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (CONT'D)
dialog: Strika! We have to be going. Stand
dialog: up and let's go!
dialog: 
text: Strika shakes his head, sadly.

speaker_heading: AGU (CONT'D)
dialog: What is wrong with you?
dialog: 
text: Agu goes to Strika.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (CONT'D)
dialog: What is wrong?
dialog: 
text: Strika looks at Agu, wheezing. He shows Agu a small shrapnel

dialog: 
text: Worried but with no other choice, Agu picks Strika up and
text: throws him onto his back.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE - DAWN
dialog: 
text: Agu notices a cricket on a leaf. He snatches it quickly,
text: bites half of it, then gives the other half to Strika, who
text: lets it sit in his mouth with out swallowing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
dialog: I am wanting to say to Strika, I am
dialog: tired too.
dialog: 
text: GUN FIRE ECHOES again in the distance. Quietly, they move out
dialog: again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
dialog: I am tired, and so the words are
text: not coming out of my mouth.
dialog: 99.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Agu picks up Strika to carry him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
dialog: I will be an old man before this
dialog: war is over...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A SONG.
dialog: 
text: Agu hears it and sits up quickly. It's the song his mother
text: used to sing to him in the kitchen hut.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU
dialog: Enh... Strika, a song. Music. Like
dialog: my mother sings...
dialog: 
text: He looks around, trying to find its ephemeral source. But it
text: goes silent. He tries to see if Strika is listening, his head
text: resting on Agu's shoulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (CONT'D)
dialog: Strika?
dialog: 
text: He shakes Strika. But Strika doesn't respond.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (CONT'D)
dialog: Strika?
dialog:

text: BOOTS looking in decent condition.
dialog: 
text: He stops peeing and pries the boots off, falling back into
dialog: the water.
dialog: 100.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: When he gets up he notices the GIRL from the whorehouse, now
text: fully pregnant trying to climb out of the trench to escape.
dialog: 
text: His first instinct is to grab his rifle and aim. She sees
text: this, they lock eyes, but she tests him, stepping higher. He
text: lowers his aim.
dialog: 
text: She thanks him with her eyes, but doesn't make it more than
text: 15 feet before SWOOFFF, a bullet from a SNIPER far off on the
text: other side of a BURNED FIELD drops her - the MEN the trench
text: Agu is hiding in was built to hide from.
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MUDDY RED TRENCH - DAY

text: The rain mists on Agu, newish boots hanging on his shoulders

speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
dialog: Mother, your song is making my body
dialog: to move and I am not having to
dialog: think anymore, not about Strika,
dialog: not about this war, not about any
dialog: of the thing that are jumping into
dialog: my head.
dialog: 
text: He sits in a fox hole overlooking the burnt field. PREACHER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: Ammo. Find me some fucking bullets

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU

speaker_heading: PREACHER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU
dialog: Him.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
dialog: I want to be going to that person
text: who is singing and taking all of
dialog: the sound so I can be keeping it in
dialog: my pocket, to be having it for
dialog: myself.
dialog: 
text: The trench is filled with more water. Agu walks through it
text: towards the inner part of the NDF defenses, the water up to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
dialog: I am wanting to lie down on the

dialog: the smell of mud in my nose, just
dialog: like Strika.
dialog: 
text: Agu looks at his reflection in the water staring back at him.
text: He moves, it moves. He walks, it follows. Around him, the men
dialog: have created smaller mini-indentations to protect themselves

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
dialog: I am wanting to feel how the ground
dialog: is wet all around my body so that
dialog: if I am sweating, I am feeling like
text: it is the ground sweating through
dialog: me.
dialog: 
text: NDF Soldiers are like ghosts in the heavy mist. He cannot see
text: more than a couple feet in front of him at a time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)
dialog: And I am wanting to stay in this
dialog: same place forever, never moving
dialog: for anything, just waiting waiting
text: until dust is piling on me and
dialog: grasses is covering me and insect
dialog: is making their home in the space
dialog: between my teeths.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU (V.O.)

dialog: 
text: Commandant sits on a throne of earth, a purple rappa covering

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGU
dialog: Commandant, suh. We are out of

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: Kai! This fog, Agu. It is our

dialog: 
text: Agu nods, dutifully. Commandant relights the joint.
dialog:

speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: Everyone betrays you, eventually.

speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: No, Sah. We are going.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: You are the only one stupid
text: standing in front of me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: I am going, sah! I have no

scene_heading: ANOTHER NDF SOLDIER

dialog: 
text: More voices call out from beyond the mist that they are

dialog:

text: down his rifle, still hanging on his shoulder.
dialog: 104.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Electricity courses through Agu's temples, fear and confusion
text: cloud his face. More men move to support Preacher, and Agu
text: sees this, knowing his bullets couldn't stop them all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: I see. I see you are a big man now,
dialog: Two-I-C. And where will you be
dialog: going? You will surrender to the
dialog: other NDF? No. They will eat you.
dialog: And to the ECOMOD? That would be
dialog: wiser, but, then what? Jail? War
dialog: crimes? If they let you go, you
dialog: think you will ever have it as good
dialog: as you have it right now in this
dialog: mud? You think that you will be

dialog: 
text: He paces along the trench, leaning into his men, centimeters

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: You all will go back to your towns,
dialog: but they will fear you. Your
dialog: families will not associate with
dialog: you. You will be nobodies, with
dialog: your poor, uneducated minds. And
dialog: you will sit all day, and you will
text: watch the sun rise and set, waiting
dialog: with thousands of others for some
dialog: big man to come along and say "I
dialog: have some job for you."
dialog: 
text: He looks around, gauging the comprehension of his men.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: Orphans. You are all orphans like
dialog: me. You think I will let you waste

speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you thinking?
dialog: 105.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He grabs the rifle, kneels down, holding it against his heart
text: and closing his eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: You want to kill me?
dialog: 
text: Agu can't. Commandant is disappointed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: You want to surrender?
dialog: 
text: Agu nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: Then surrender.
dialog: 
text: He turns to the rest of the men.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: When you are poor and hungry with

dialog: days, you will remember these days
dialog: as your best. And know, one day I
dialog: will call on you again. And you
dialog: will come. Because you will
