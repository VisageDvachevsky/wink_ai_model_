dialog: December 3, 1975.
scene_heading: 1 PRIMEVAL SWAMP - EARLY DAWN
text: It is very early in the dawn - blue light filters through
text: the jungle and across a foul swamp. A mist clings to the
text: trees. This could be the jungle of a million years ago.
text: Our VIEW MOVES CLOSER, through the mist, TILTING DOWN to
text: the tepid water. A small bubble rises to the surface;
text: then another. Suddenly, but quietly, a form begins to
text: emerge; a helmet. Water and mud pour off revealing a set
text: of beady eyes just above the mud. Printed on a helmet,
text: in a psychedelic hand, are the words: "Gook Killer."
text: The head emerges revealing that the tough-looking soldier
text: beneath has exceptionally long hair and beard; he has no
text: shirt on, only bandoliers of ammunition - his body is
text: painted in an odd camouflage pattern. He looks to the
text: right; he looks to the left; he looks INTO CAMERA, and
text: slowly sinks back into the swamp, disapperaring completely.
text: Our VIEW HOLDS, We begin to HEAR natural, though
text: unrecognizable JUNGLE SOUNDS, far off in the distance.
text: We PAN TO REVEAL a clump of logs half submerged in the
text: swamp; and part of what seems to be a Falstaff beer can
text: in the mud. A hand reaches out, and the beer can disappears.
text: As we TILT UP, we NOTICE that the log is hollow
text: and houses the rear of a M-60 machine gun, hand painted
text: in a paisley design.
text: Now the VIEW MOVES AWAY, ACROSS the ancient growth, PAST
text: the glimmer of what seems to be another soldier hiding in
text: ambush, wearing an exotic hat made from birds and bushes.
text: ACROSS to a dark trail where the legs of those in black
text: pajamas move silently across our ever TIGHTENING VIEW.
text: Their feet, boots and sandals leave no impression; make
text: no sound. A slight flicker of light reveals a pair of
text: eyes in the foliage across the path, waiting and watching.
text: The VIEW PUSHES ALONG WITH the Vietnamese, MOVING FASTER
text: AND FASTER WITH them, until suddenly, directly in front
text: about ten feet away, an enormous AMERICAN clad in rags
text: and bushes and holding a 12 gauge automatic shotgun
text: casually at his side, steps in front of them. He smiles
text: laconically, and BLASTS OUT FIVE SHOTS that rip THROUGH
text: US. By the second shot, the whole jungle blazes out
text: with AUTOMATIC FIRE.
text: Out VIEW TURNS as the men around us are thrown and torn,
text: screaming and scattering into the jungle. More AMERICANS
text: appear; unexplainably, out of the growth. It is now that
text: we fully SEE the bizarre manner in which they are dressed.
text: Some wear helmets, others wear strange hats made from
text: feathers and parts of animals. Some of them have long
text: savage-looking hair; other crew-cut or completely shaved;
text: they wear bandoliers, flak jackets, shorts and little else.
text: They wear Montagnard sandals or no shoes at all, and their
text: bodies and faces are painted in bizarre camouflage patterns.
text: They appear one with the jungle and mist, FIRING INTO US
text: as they move.
text: The soldier we saw earlier emerges from the swamp, dripping
text: mud, his MACHINE GUN BLASTING FIRE.
text: We begin to move quickly with one Vietnamese, breathlessly
text: running for his life; we MOVE INTO the jungle with him,
text: only to be impaled on a large spear of a smiling AMERICAN
text: painted and wearing feathers like an Indian. OUR VIEW
text: FALLS WITH him to the ground, STARING UPWARDS, as FLAME
text: and EXPLODING MUD scatter above us. Men scream and die
text: around us. The screams amid the GUNFIRE and EXPLOSIONS
text: are piercing and terrible, as though the jungle itself is
dialog: frightened.
text: An AMERICAN wearing a jungle hat with a large Peace Sign
text: on it, wearing war paint, bends TOWARD US, reaching down
text: TOWARD US with a large knife, preparing to scalp the
dialog: dead.
text: OUR VIEW MOVES AWAY, along with the running sandals of a
text: Vietnamese soldier, MOVING FASTER AND FASTER, only to be
text: stopped by still another of the savage-looking AMERICANS
text: with primitive ornamentation, wearing only a loin-cloth
text: and green beret. He opens his flame-thrower directly ON US
text: and the NVA soldier and we are incinerated in flame,
text: bright psychedelic orange-red flame. Outrageous, loud,
scene_heading: electric ROCK MUSIC OVERWHELMS the SOUNDTRACK :
scene_heading: MAIN TITLE : APOCALYPSE NOW
scene_heading: 2 TITLE SEQUENCE
text: The CREDIT TITLES proceed as the FLANE CONSUME US,
text: growing more intense, brighter, more vivid, purifying;
text: transforming into an intense white heat that we can barely
text: look at, like the sun itself.
text: Then it EXPLODES, breking apart, and shattering once
text: again. It begins to cool, as the TITLES CONTINUE. It
text: is as though WE ARE MOVING through the white center of
text: cooling flame, forming a spinning web, and becoming more
text: distant. The TITLES CONTINUE.
text: We are MOVING TOWARD planetary nebulae; MOVING through the
text: stars; MOVING closer to the Earth. We can BARELY HEAR the
text: MUSIC now.
text: We MOVE CLOSER to the earth; beautiful, covered in clouds,
text: as though SEEN from a satellite. The TITLES CONTINUE.
text: We are MOVING CLOSER to the earth; through the soft clouds,
dialog: close enough that we can MAKE OUT the Western Hemisphere;
dialog: CLOSER to North America; CLOSER, to America, then California;
text: Los Angeles, STILL CLOSER to the odd, finger-like

scene_heading: 3 EXT. MARINA DEL REY
text: The VIEW finally SETTLES ON a partically luxury cabin
text: cruiser harbored at a particular dock late in the day.
text: It is large, pleasure boat: The people are relaxing in
text: bathing suits and towels and robes. They are drinking
text: cocktails, and snapping pictures. The boat belongs to the
text: head of a large American Corporation, and this is his
text: party. This man, CHARLIE, is sitting, his shirt off to
text: catch some of the late sun. Others have their faces
text: smeared with white suntan oil that reminds us of war
text: paint. Charlie is going on and on :
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: ... It's crazy -- sugar is up to
dialog: 200 dollars a ton -- sugar !
speaker_heading: LAWYER
dialog: What about oil ?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Food, oil --look, let me show you
dialog: something. This is the economy of
dialog: the United States in two years --
text: He takes a newspaper, draws a circle.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: This is West Germany.
dialog: (he draws another,
dialog: bigger circle)
dialog: This is Japan.
dialog: (another , bigger)
dialog: This is Italy.
dialog: (a dot)
dialog: This is Iran.
dialog: (a very big circle)
dialog: And this is Saudi Arabia... In
dialog: two years ?
dialog: (a gigantic circle)
dialog: Do you understand ?
speaker_heading: ACCOUNTANT
dialog: What's to prevent it ?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Maybe nothing. But I'll tell you,
dialog: I didn't build a two-billion-dollar
dialog: company in the last twenty years
dialog: by doing nothing. We can protect
dialog: our interests.
dialog: (pause, for a drink)
dialog: We are still the most powerful
text: nation in the world. Militarily.
text: He leans to his associates, in a half-whisper.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You know bodyguard; he was a
dialog: captain in Viet Nam. You talk to
dialog: him, except he won't talk. This
dialog: kind of man can kill you with his
dialog: pinky. A nice quiet fella, though.
text: The VIEW BEGINS TO PULL AWAY from this group.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (continuing)
text: Carries a attache case at all
dialog: times. You know what's in it ?
dialog: (another sip)
text: An Ingram Machine pistol.
text: Gradually, Charlie's voice softens as we MOVE AWAY, and a
text: NEW VOICE, the voice of someone thinking, COMES IN OVER it :
speaker_heading: CHARLIE					WILLARD (V.O.)
dialog: I don't tahe chances, and			Bullshit. You can kill
dialog: neither should this country.			with the ridge of your
dialog: If we're strong, we should			hand to the throat; you
dialog: protect our interests, and			can crush a skull with
dialog: we should have the respect			your knee... but you
dialog: of the world, even if it				can't kill anybody with
dialog: takes another war.				your pinky.
text: The VIEW MOVE ALONG the guests of this small party :
text: Pictures being taken, some people are swimming. It is the
text: good life. Now WILLARD'S VOICE TRACK DOMINATES.
speaker_heading: WILLARD (V.O.)
text: The attache case has been empty
dialog: for three years, but it makes him
dialog: safe to think there's a machine
text: pistol in it.
dialog: I don't like automatic weapons.
dialog: They jam.
dialog: I saw a friend of mine get
text: ripped open because he flicked his
text: M-16 to automatic, and it jammed.
dialog: How much money did the contractors
dialog: make on the M-16 ?
text: Our VIEW IS MOVING through the people on the boat; some
text: reading, flirting, drinking.
speaker_heading: WILLARD (V.O.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: He likes to hear stories about Nam.
dialog: I tell him I can't; they're not
dialog: cleared. The truth is he wouldn't
dialog: understand.
text: We can now SEE A MAN with his BACK TO US, looking the
text: opposite way. An attache case resting near to him. We
scene_heading: MOVE CLOSER.
speaker_heading: WILLARD (V.O.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: There's no way I can tell them...
dialog: what really happened over there.
dialog: I wouldn't've believed it if
dialog: someone'd told me.
text: We are now RESTING on his back. Occasionally, he sips
text: from a beer, but we cannot see his face.
speaker_heading: WILLARD (V.O.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: There was only one part that
dialog: mattered -- for me, anyway. I
dialog: don't even know if I remember
dialog: all of it. I can't remember
dialog: how it ended, exactly -- because
dialog: when it ended I was insane.

scene_heading: 4 EXT. A STREET IN SAIGON - DAY
text: A Saigon boom street in late 1968. There are bars and
text: shops for servicemen; the rickshaws, the motorbikes.
text: Our VIEW MOVES TOWARD one particular officer; B.L.
text: WILLARD , in uniform, a Captain of the Airborne, followed
text: by four or five Vietnamese kids trying to shine his
dialog: shoes and sell him things.
speaker_heading: WILLARD (V.O.)
dialog: But I know how it started
dialog: for me -- I was on R. and R.
dialog: in Saigon; my first time south
dialog: of the DMZ in three months. I
dialog: wasn't sure, but I thought this

text: Willard looks back.
speaker_heading: 5 HIS VIEW
text: an American CIVILIAN.
scene_heading: 6 MED. VIEW
text: Willard ducks into a bar.
scene_heading: 7 INT. THE SAIGON BAR - DAY
text: Not much in this place -- a bar, linoleum flooring, a few
text: tables and chairs, and a juke box. The lounge is fairly
text: crowded. Willard takes off his cap and walks quietly
text: past the soldiers at the bar. Some of them, catching
text: sight of his ribbons, stop talking as he moves by.
text: An INFANTRY CAPTAIN enters the bar, buys a couple of
text: drinks and approaches Willard's table.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: How about a drink ?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Sure, thanks.
text: He sits down at the table with the drinks.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Winning the war by yourself.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: (he calls for the waiter)
dialog: Part.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Which part is that ?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: My part.
scene_heading: (TO THE WAITER)
dialog: Beer, with ice and water.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: That's good gin.

dialog: Delta ?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: North ?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Yeah. Way north.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: What unit were you with ?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: None.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Rangers, eh?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Sort of.
text: The JUKE BOX starts BLARING. Annoyed , Willard looks over
text: his shoulder.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Were you Longe Range Recon --
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: No -- I worked too far north for
speaker_heading: LRRP.
text: He reaches into his shirt pocket for a cigarette, and the
text: Captain leans over the table to light it for him. Willard
text: notices the CIVILIAN on the street has glanced in the bar,
text: then enters and sits down at a table by the doorway.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: That's quite an array of ribbons...
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Let's talk about you.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: I was an FO for the 25th.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Tracks ?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Fat. That's real fat.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Sometimes.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: At least you always have enough
dialog: water. How many gallons does
dialog: each one of those damn things
dialog: carry ?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: You know, I can remember once,
text: getting back below the DMZ -- and
dialog: the first Americans we ran into
dialog: were a track squadron. I just
dialog: couldn't believe how much water
dialog: they had. We'd been chewing
dialog: bamboo shoots for almost a week,
dialog: and before that, for two weeks,
dialog: we'd been drinking anything --
dialog: rain water, river shit, stuff
dialog: right out of the paddies. And
dialog: there were these guys standing
text: by their trucks spilling water
dialog: all over. I could've killed them.
dialog: (solemnly)
dialog: I swear to God I would have, too,
dialog: if ...
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: I didn't know we had units up
dialog: there in North Vietnam.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: We do.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: How long were you up there ?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: A long time.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: A year ? Waiter another beer.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I go up on missions. Listen
dialog: Captain, buy me all the beer
dialog: you want, but you better tell
dialog: that asshole over there you're
dialog: not going to find out anymore
dialog: about me.
text: Willard glances over his shoulder and indicates the
text: Civilian. The Civilian is given a sign by the Captain.
text: He rises and comes over to the bar.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What do you want ?
speaker_heading: CIVILIAN
dialog: (indicating the Army jeep)
dialog: If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon
dialog: Group, we'd like you to come with
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Whose orders ?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th
scene_heading: A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 --
scene_heading: Com-Sec -- Intelligence --
dialog: Nha Trang.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Who are you ?
speaker_heading: CIVILIAN
dialog: The agency.
text: Willard looks at the Civilian a moment, and then walks
text: roght out toward the jeep without saying another word.
text: The Civilian follows.
scene_heading: 8 EXT. HELICOPTER - DUSK
text: A darkly painted "HUEY" ROARS over low paddies and jungle
text: before emerging onto an open plain. It crosses a barbed
text: wire and sand-bagged perimeter and lands in a heavily
text: fortified, concealed compound.
speaker_heading: WILLARD (V.O.)
dialog: They took me to some place outside
dialog: Nha Trang... Intelligence Headquarters
dialog: for all operations in South East Asia.
dialog: I'd worked for Intelligence before --
text: Armed men jump from the Huey -- among them Willard. A
text: large camouflaged cover is moved, revealing an underground
text: corridor -- they enter.
scene_heading: 9 FULL SHOT - UNDERGROUND PLOTTING ROOM
text: A door swings wide -- Willard steps through and comes to
text: attention, blocking the view of the room. A strange
text: reddish light pervades. The room is covered with plastic
text: maps and filled with smoke.
text: The whole place has been hewn out of the ground itself
text: and there is a sense of the cut-back jungle growth slowly
text: reclaiming it.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters,
dialog: reporting as ordered, sir.
speaker_heading: COLONEL (O.S.)
dialog: Okay, Willard, sit down.
text: Willard sits in a chair that is set in a center of a
text: bare concrete floor. Across from him, around steel desks
text: and tables sit several men. The nearest one, a COLONEL
text: puts his cigar out on the bottom of his shoe -- behind
text: him sits a MAJOR and a seedy-looking CIVILIAN.
speaker_heading: COLONEL
dialog: Have you ever seen this officer
dialog: before, Captain Willard ?
text: He points to the Major.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: COLONEL
dialog: This gentleman or myself ?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: COLONEL
dialog: I believe on your last job you
dialog: executed a tax collector in Kontum,
dialog: is that right ?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I am not presently disposed to
dialog: discuss that, sir.
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: Very good.
text: He turns to the Colonel and nods his approval. The
text: Colonel gets up and goes to a large plastic map.
speaker_heading: COLONEL
dialog: You know much about about Special Forces;
dialog: Green Berets, Captain ?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I've worked with them on occasions
dialog: and I saw the movie , sir.
text: The officer smiles at this.
speaker_heading: COLONEL
dialog: Then you can appreciate Command's
dialog: concern over their -- shall we say
dialog: 'erratic' methods of operation.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I have never favored elite units,
dialog: Captain, including your paratroopers
dialog: or whatever. Just because a man
text: jumps out of an airplane or wears
text: a silly hat doesn't give him any
dialog: priviliges in my book -- not in
dialog: this man's army.
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: We didn't need 'em in Korea --
dialog: no sir, give me an Ohio farm boy
dialog: and an M-1 Garand, none of this
dialog: fancy crap -- no sir.
speaker_heading: CIVILIAN
dialog: (stopping him)
dialog: Major.
speaker_heading: COLONEL
dialog: We have Special Forces A
dialog: detachments all along the
dialog: Cambodian border. Two here and
dialog: another one here -- twelve or
dialog: fourteen Americans -- pretty
dialog: much on their own; they train
dialog: and motivate Montagnard natives;
dialog: pick their own operations. If
dialog: they need something, they call
dialog: for it, and get it within
dialog: reason. What we're concerned
dialog: with is here.

text: The A detachment at Nu Mung Ba.

dialog: but --

speaker_heading: COLONEL
dialog: ... Captain, we know something's
dialog: going on up there -- Major --
text: The Major looks at some papers in front of him.
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: Communications naturally dwindled
dialog: with the lack of V.C. activity,
dialog: this is routine, expected ... but
dialog: six months ago communication
dialog: virtually stopped.
speaker_heading: COLONEL
dialog: About the same time -- large numbers
dialog: of Montagnards of the M'Nong descent
dialog: began leaving the area -- this in
dialog: itself is not unusual since these
dialog: people have fought with the Rhade
dialog: Tribe that lived in the area for
dialog: centuries. But what is unusual is
dialog: that we began to find Rhade refugees
dialog: too -- in the same sampans as the
dialog: M'Nongs. These people aren't afraid
dialog: of V.C. They've put up with war
dialog: for twenty years -- but something
text: is driving them out.
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: We communicate with the base
dialog: infrequently. What they call for
dialog: are air strikes, immediate --
dialog: always at night. And we don't
dialog: know what or who the air strikes
dialog: are called on.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Who ?
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: You see, no one has really gone
dialog: into this area and come back alive.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Why me ?
speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: Walter Kurtz, Lieutenant Colonel,
dialog: Special Forces. We understand
dialog: you knew him.
text: He puts Kurtz' dossier in Willard's hand.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: COLONEL
dialog: He's commanding the detachment
dialog: at Nu Mung Ba.
text: The Colonel gets up and walks over to a tape recorder,
text: flicks it on. The recording is first STATIC -- the
text: AIR CONTROLLER then asks for more information on target
text: coordinates -- it all sounds very routine, military.
text: Then a frantic VOICE comes on, talking slurred, like
text: someone dumb, except very fast.
speaker_heading: VOICE (ON TAPE)

speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I only met Kurtz once.
speaker_heading: CIVILIAN
dialog: Would he remember you ?
speaker_heading: WILLARD

speaker_heading: COLONEL

text: Willard shrugs.
speaker_heading: CIVILIAN

speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I thought he was a lame.
speaker_heading: COLONEL
dialog: A lame ?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: This is years ago, before he
dialog: joined Special Forces, I guess.
dialog: We had an argument.
speaker_heading: COLONEL
dialog: About what ?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I don't know. He was a lame,
dialog: that's all.
speaker_heading: COLONEL
dialog: But why ?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: He couldn't get through a
dialog: sentence without all these
dialog: big words; about why we kill.
speaker_heading: COLONEL
dialog: Well, he's killing now.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: CIVILIAN
dialog: What does that mean ?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't
dialog: believe he's capable of that.
dialog: I just don't believe it.
speaker_heading: COLONEL
dialog: It's got to be Kurtz.
speaker_heading: CIVILIAN
dialog: The point is that Kurtz or
dialog: somebody attacked a South
dialog: Vietnamese Ranger Platoon three
dialog: days ago. Last week a Recon
dialog: helicopter was lost in the area --
dialog: another took heavy damage --
text: direct fire from their base
dialog: camp.

speaker_heading: WILLARD

speaker_heading: CIVILIAN

dialog: even rumours leaked out.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: You want me to clean it up --
text: simple and quiet.
speaker_heading: CIVILIAN
dialog: Exactly -- you'll go up the
text: Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. --
text: appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by
dialog: accident, re-establish your
text: acquintance with Colonel Kurtz,
dialog: find out what's happened -- and

speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: We're gonna have some help to
dialog: get in the river. You know
dialog: these waters, Chief ?
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: 'Bout six months ago I took a man
dialog: up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was
dialog: regular Army too. Shot himself
text: in the head. I brought his body
text: back down.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Shot himself. What for ?
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Beats me -- the sun was too much
dialog: for him, or the mud. Who knows ?
text: Pause, looking at Willard.
scene_heading: 18 CLOSE SHOT - ON WILLARD
text: Suddenly, his attention is diverted -- there is a slow
text: buffeting, as if the air around them is being sucked out
text: and replaced quickly. The boat shakes slightly. There
text: is a distant ROLLING NOISE like interrupted thunder. All
text: the men have stopped whatever they're doing -- stand up
text: and look out toward the shore and the green jungle hills
text: beyond. The buffeting and NOISE CONTINUES -- they all
text: stand silently -- suddenly it stops.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Arch light.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: I hate that -- Every time I hear
dialog: that noise something terrible
dialog: happens.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Anybody see some smoke ?
speaker_heading: CLEAN
text: Too far inland.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: There they are.
text: He points up to the sky.
scene_heading: 19 FULL SHOT - ON THE SKY
text: Way up -- past any clouds and barely discernible, we SEE
text: the black silhouttes of four B-52 bombers, their vapor
text: trails streaming white against the dark blue sky.
speaker_heading: CLEAN
dialog: Charlie don't ever hear 'em. Not
dialog: till it's too late -- don't have
dialog: to hit you neither, concussion'll
dialog: do it for a quarter mile or better.
dialog: Burst your ears -- suck the air
dialog: outta your lungs.
scene_heading: 20 FULL SHOT - BOAT - CREW
text: They are looking up. Willard sits down, unconcerned.
text: He takes out the dossier given him by ComSec. He
text: flips through the letters and other documents.
speaker_heading: WILLARD (V.O.)
dialog: The dossier on A detachment had
dialog: letters from Kurtz' wife and the
dialog: wives and families of his men.
dialog: All asking where to send future
dialog: mail, understanding the necessery
dialog: silence due to the nature of
dialog: their work -- None of the men had
dialog: written home in half a year.
text: Occasionally, in the b.g., we FEEL the terrifying buffeting
text: of the distant B-52 BOMBING.
scene_heading: 21 CLOSE - ON WILLARD
text: studying, examining a report.
scene_heading: 22 MONTAGE - PICTURES OF KURTZ
text: Kurtz' face evolves through the various stages of his
text: career as represented in the pictures in the dossier,
dialog: as Willard reads :
speaker_heading: WILLARD (V.O.)
dialog: Lieutenant Kurtz has shown a
dialog: dedicated and well-disciplined
dialog: spirit. He is a fine officer,
dialog: combining military efficiency --
dialog: with a broad background in the
dialog: Humanities, the Arts and Sciences ...
text: Another picture of Kurtz in Germany, standing next to the
dialog: 161st Petroleum Supply Group sign.
speaker_heading: WILLARD (V.O.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ... He views his military career
dialog: as the dedication of his talents
dialog: to bringing our values and way of
dialog: life to those darker, less
dialog: fortunate areas in the world.
text: A SHOT of Kurtz at jump school.
speaker_heading: WILLARD (V.O.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ... I feel Captain Kurtz' request
dialog: for Special Forces training is
dialog: highly unusual in regard to his
dialog: past humanitarian concerns, and
dialog: his somewhat liberal politics,
dialog: though I can see no reason to
dialog: deny it.
text: A CLOSE SHOT of Kurtz with Green Beret on in the Vietnam
text: jungle. His face is blank and vacant.
speaker_heading: WILLARD (V.O.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ... We feel Major Kurtz' need to
dialog: bring a sense of Western culture
dialog: to the backward peoples of these
dialog: areas will be of use in
dialog: accordance with our 'Vietnamization'
dialog: programs ...
text: MOVE IN TO Kurtz' empty eyes until the photograph is just

scene_heading: 23 EXT. HAU FAT - AN ADVANCE STAGING AREA
speaker_heading: WILLARD (V.O.)
dialog: One day later we came to an
dialog: advanced staging area along the
dialog: coast. This was our last chance
dialog: to pick up supplies before
text: approaching the mouth of the
dialog: Nung River.
dialog: 
text: The VIEW OF THE COASTLINE leading up along the long load-
text: ing docks at Hau Fat, an advance staging area for opera-
dialog: tions "Brute Force" and "Mailed Fist."
text: Everywhere are tents -- oil drums -- sandbagged bunkers --
text: helicopters -- tanks -- guns -- men. Nobody builds
dialog: advanced staging areas like the Americans.
text: As the P.B.R. approaches the docking area, Lance notices
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Hey.
text: They look as a Chris-craft speeds by pulling a fancy water-
text: skier who waves as he slaloms by. The men just look at
dialog: one another.
text: 24 VIEW ON THE DOCK
text: The P.B.R. pulls in -- the men scan the busy surroundings.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Lance -- I want you to go with the
dialog: Captain an' get three extra drums
dialog: of fuel and maybe scrounge some
text: more 50 caliber.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Yeah -- look at those uniforms.
scene_heading: 25 FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - TROOPS
text: A platoon drills in the hot, lazy sun; they are clean and
text: pale, in contrast to Lance and the others, just off the
dialog: airplane.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Poor bastards, have a long year
dialog: to go.
text: The troops turn and march TOWARD US with six weeks of
dialog: Advanced Infantry Training to back them up.
scene_heading: 26 FULL SHOT - DOCK - P.B.R. - CREW
text: They are tying up at the dock -- a young SERGEANT is fill-

speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: I don't know anything about these
dialog: papers, sir.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: They're in order -- it's perfectly
dialog: clean -- just check with ComSec-
dialog: Intel like I said.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Well, you know I don't have the
dialog: priority to do that, sir. It
dialog: says here not to contact Com-Sec-
dialog: Int. Who's your commanding
dialog: officer ?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Right now -- I am.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Well who the hell verifies that ?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I do.

speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: No shit -- what's all the activity
dialog: for around here ?
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: The show --
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: What show ?
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Big show in the parade grounds

speaker_heading: CHIEF

scene_heading: 27 FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - PEDESTAL
text: A large, well-built pedestal has been erected -- this is
text: surrounded by a deep moat filled with punji stakes and
text: garnished with concertina wire. It is empty --
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO :
scene_heading: 28 FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - TROOPS
text: The entire area around the pedestal and right up to the
text: wire is mobbed with seething American fighting men. Some
dialog: of these boys have just gotten here -- others have been in
dialog: the jungle for months. All have one thing in common, to
dialog: see and if possible grab an American girl. Their need far
text: surpasses that of the run-of-the-mill rapist, pervert,
dialog: or child-molester. To counter their need of course are
text: the moat, punji stakes and barbed wire -- but implementing
text: this are seven "riot control positions" equipped with the
text: lastest in teargas launchers, attack-trained German shep-
text: herds and assorted psychological warfare aides. Even so
text: armed, the great mass of wild men are right up to the wire.
scene_heading: 29 FORWARD AREA

speaker_heading: CHEF

speaker_heading: CLEAN
dialog: Yeah -- you can really get hung
text: up on them like the cat in the
dialog: Delta.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: What cat ?
speaker_heading: CLEAN
dialog: One that went up for murder -- he
dialog: was an Army Sergeant.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: I never heard about that.
speaker_heading: CLEAN
dialog: Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy
dialog: mag, man -- I mean like he was there
dialog: when it arrived -- He just knew.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: So what happened ?
speaker_heading: CLEAN
dialog: He was working A.R.V.N. patrols
dialog: and had one a them little cocky
dialog: gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow,
dialog: the Lieutenant took his new Playboy
text: one day, sat on the end of the dock,
dialog: and wouldn't give it back.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
speaker_heading: CLEAN
dialog: Then went too far -- he sat
text: there and starts mutilating the
text: centerfold. Poking pins in her an'
dialog: all that. Sergeant says, don't do
dialog: her like that. You leave your
dialog: shitty little hands off that girl.
dialog: Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in
dialog: Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't
dialog: do that again. You'll wish you
text: hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked
dialog: his iron to rock and roll and gave
dialog: the little zero a long burst
dialog: through the Playboy mag. Man, it
dialog: blew him clean off the dock --
dialog: Hell, just the magazine was floatin'
text: there all full of holes.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: They nail him for it bad ?
speaker_heading: CLEAN
dialog: He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't
dialog: give him no medals or nothing --
text: In the b.g., we begin to HEAR a SWELL of TWO THOUSAND
text: MALE VOICES; the ENGINES of four helicopters approaching.
text: All heads turn skywards while one descends onto the
text: pedestal kicking up a lot of dust and general resentment.
text: On the nose amd doors of the black Huey are painted large
text: Playboy rabbits. Finally the blades are trimmed and a
text: strange silence descends over the men. The door of the
text: copter slides partially open -- two young Green Berets
text: step out with M-16's to varied catcalls. When this
text: abates a young, extremelly well-dressed man emerges. He
text: is the epitome of a Hollywood AGENT. Hair is combed
text: impeccably and free of dandruff -- clothes are formal
dialog: but hip -- shoes are shined -- Quite some dude -- his
text: presence causes some stirring but seems to strangely
dialog: quiet the man.
text: He walks over to the microphone.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: I'd like to say hello from all of
dialog: us up here, to all of you out there.
dialog: All of you who've worked so hard
dialog: during Operation Brute Force --
dialog: Paratroopers -- Infantry -- Airmen
dialog: -- Medics -- Marines -- and Sailors.
dialog: And I want you to know that we feel
dialog: proud of you and know how hard your
dialog: job is. To prove it -- we've brought
dialog: some entertainment we think you're
dialog: gonna like: The Playmate of the Year
dialog: and her two runners up !
text: He pulls open the door and three unbelieveably beautiful
text: sex playmates in fringed go-go outfits leap out and start
dialog: dancing to the Creedence Clearwater Revival singing
dialog: "Suzy Q."
text: 30 MONTAGE ON THE GIRLS AND MEN
text: VARIOUS SHOTS as the girls dance in an incredibly erotic
text: manner -- smiling.
text: The faces of the G.I.'s pass -- their jaws drop -- some
text: look almost horrified. Chef is hypnotized -- Mr. Clean
text: cries. Chief mouths unspoken obscenities with sentimental
dialog: tenderness.
text: Others grab the air in front of them. With each movement
text: their need increases by the square.
scene_heading: 31 FULL SHOT - PEDESTAL - GIRLS - MEN
text: They crush forward starting to scream -- men fall on the
text: wire -- the guards in the "riot control positions" forget
text: -- the attack dogs are trampled. The mob as one surges
text: forward onto the wire. Men scream and fall into the moat,
text: which is filling up fast. The Agent sees this all as he
text: has seen it before. He casually pulls the pin of a smoke
text: grenade; the girls retreat into the copter -- he follows,
text: then the two Green Berets. The ROTARS WHINE -- the black
text: Playboy Huey lifts off just as the first crazed men reach
text: it. They grab frantically for the wheels, but miss. The
text: Huey wheels up into the blue sky, leaving them all below.
dialog: Such are the ways of war.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 32 EXT. FULL VIEW - DAY
text: The P.B.R. moving further up the primitive coastline.
text: There are few signs of civilization; no villages, no

speaker_heading: WILLARD (V.O.)
dialog: Two days out of Hau Fat, there was
dialog: nothing but us and the coastline.
dialog: I felt like I had set off for
dialog: the center of the earth...

speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Smoke !
speaker_heading: WILLARD

text: They all turn. Chief points up the coast.
scene_heading: 33 FULL SHOT - THE COASTLINE
text: A thick train of black smoke rises from the green jungle.
speaker_heading: WILLARD

text: The Chief grabs field glasses.
speaker_heading: CHIEF

speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: First Air Cavalry. They're the

scene_heading: 34 FULL SHOT - THE BEACH AND VILLAGE
text: A vast field of devastation -- smashed and smoking palm
text: trees -- deep, ragged craters -- gutted and burning huts
text: -- shattered sampans and bodies washing around in the
dialog: surf.
scene_heading: 35 MED. SHOT - BEACH - WILLARD AND CREW
text: They wade through the water to the beach where they are
text: met by a heavily armed group of men.
text: Overhead jets swoop by FIRING ROCKETS, the NOISE drowning
text: out Willard's attempt at conversation with some of the men.
text: We can't hear any of the talk, but we notice that the
text: Sergeant turns up to a particular Huey, and points to it.
scene_heading: 36 FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS
text: Three Hueys swoop in low -- they are heavily laden with
text: machine guns -- rockets and loudspeakers. The two out-
text: side copters hover, while the center copter lands, raising
text: a lot of dust. It cuts its rotors and the other copters
text: pull up and off to the side. Two armed soldiers jump
text: from the doors and stand with guns ready. Then a tall,
text: strong looking man emerges. He wears a well-cut and
text: neatly-stretched tiger suit. It is COLONEL WILLIAM KILGORE
text: -- tough looking, well-tanned, with a black mustache.
text: He crouches over, holding his hat in the rotor wash. It
text: is no ordinary hat but a L.A. Dodgers baseball hat. He
text: walks out, and then stards to his full immense height and
text: with his hands on his hips he surveys the field of battle.
text: His eyes are obscured by mirror-fronted sunglasses.
speaker_heading: KILGORE
dialog: (bellowing)
dialog: Lieutenant: Bomb that tree line
dialog: back about a hundred yards -- give

speaker_heading: KILGORE
dialog: Bring me some cards.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Sir ?
speaker_heading: KILGORE
dialog: Body cards, you damn fool --
dialog: cards !
text: The soldier rushes over and hands him two brand new
text: packages of playing cards wrapped in plastic. Two other
text: soldiers get out of the copter and walk over. They are
text: well-tanned and carry no weapons. They seem more casual
text: about the Colonel than anyone else. The Sergeant walks
text: up, leading Willard, the Chief and Lance.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: (formally)
dialog: Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th
dialog: Recon Group -- I carry priority
dialog: papers from Com-Sec Intelligence
dialog: 11 Corp -- I believe you understand
dialog: the nature of my mission.
speaker_heading: KILGORE
dialog: (not looking up)
dialog: Yeah -- Na Trang told me to
dialog: expect you -- we'll see what we
dialog: can do. Just stay out of my way
dialog: till this is done, Captain.
text: He cracks the plastic wrapping sharply -- takes out the
text: deck of new cards and fans them. The Colonel strides
text: right past Willard with no further acknowledgement. The
dialog: others follow,
scene_heading: 39 TRACKING VIEW
text: The Colonel walks through the shell-pocked field of
text: devastation. Soldiers gather around smiling; as Kilgore
text: comes to each V.C. corpse he drops a playing card on
text: it -- carefully picking out which card he uses.
speaker_heading: KILGORE
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Six a spades -- eight a hearts --
dialog: Isn't one worth a Jack in this

text: The Colonel goes on about this business.
scene_heading: 40 TRACKING ON KILGORE
text: moving through the corpses, dropping the cards.

text: something to him. He stops.
speaker_heading: KILGORE
dialog: What ? Here. You sure?
text: The soldier points to Lance, who immediately puts down
text: the card he was holding. Kilgore strides over to the

speaker_heading: LANCE

speaker_heading: KILGORE
dialog: Just hold up a second, Captain --
dialog: I'll get to you soon enough --
dialog: We've got things to do here.
text: Willard eats it, for now. Kilgore puts his hand on
text: Lance's shoulder, and continues flipping the cards in-
text: discriminately on the bodies as they talk.
speaker_heading: KILGORE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ... we do a lot of surfing around
dialog: here. Like to finish up operations
dialog: early and fly down to Vung Tau for
dialog: the evening glass. Have you ever

text: He passes a twisted gun emplacement with about five
text: bodies -- sprinkles cards all over them.
speaker_heading: KILGORE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ... we keep three boards in my
dialog: Command Huey at all times. You
dialog: never can tell when you're gonna

dialog: a swell two days in advance. We
dialog: try to work it in.
text: He stops at a particularly wild-looking Viet Cong who
text: has died with his mouth agape -- staring wild-eyed in
text: horror at the sky. Kilgore pauses.
speaker_heading: KILGORE
dialog: (continuing; to himself)
dialog: Hell, that's an Ace if I ever saw
dialog: one.
text: He puts the card in the gaping mouth.
scene_heading: 42 CLOSE VIEW OVER THE VIET CONG
text: We SEE the Colonel and the others walk off -- the dead

speaker_heading: KILGORE

speaker_heading: KILGORE

speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: (he shrugs)
dialog: Mercenaries -- agents, traitors --
dialog: they put out caches.
speaker_heading: KILGORE
dialog: Can you trust them?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: No. They put out two or three
dialog: for every one I needed. When
dialog: you get to the one you'll use,
dialog: you just stake it out. If
dialog: something feels wrong, you just
dialog: pass it up. On one mission, I

speaker_heading: KILGORE

speaker_heading: WILLARD

speaker_heading: KILGORE

speaker_heading: KILGORE

speaker_heading: KILGORE
dialog: And I don't intend to get some of

speaker_heading: WILLARD

speaker_heading: KILGORE

dialog: The pilots are used to this -- they bank sharply

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO :
scene_heading: 79 FULL SHOT - BEACH HUTS, SOLDIERS
text: Americans line up blindfolded Viet Cong and N.V.A.

text: Other soldiers are already setting up heavy weapons
dialog: emplacements -- 50 cal machine guns etc. Three

text: He nods yes meakly.
speaker_heading: KILGORE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: That's good, boy, because it's
dialog: either surf or fight.

text: one of the guards. They all think he's going to
text: shoot the surfers or someone. They move back uneasy.
speaker_heading: KILGORE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'm gonna cover for 'em -- that's
dialog: all.
text: He cocks thye weapon. Lance looks around uneasily. The
text: Colonel walks over.
speaker_heading: KILGORE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You think that section on the
dialog: point is ridable, Lance?
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: I think we ought to wait for

text: A SHELL SCREAMS OVER -- they all hit the dirt except

text: A sky-crane without pod descends slowly toward us --
text: The P.B.R. hangs below it.
text: The Chief, mr. Clean and Chef stand watching this sight
text: alomg with other soldiers. A man guides the descending
text: copter till the boat settles carefully in the shallows.
text: The Chief and others leap aboard; unshackle the hoists
text: -- load on ammunition and fuel. The battle is still
text: going on around them. They all look up as a wadge

scene_heading: 93 FULL SHOT - PHANTOMS - MONTAGE

text: The Chief is at the helm --the engine starts; Clean
text: and Chef work feverishly, ducking for cover every-so-

speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Forget that extra drum -- it's

speaker_heading: CLEAN

text: Kilgore watches the waves with his field glasses --

text: Lance crouches below. Willard is up looking off in another
text: direction. SHELLS SCREAM over, but even their noise is
text: drowned out by the fierce SHRIEK of the PHANTOMS and the
text: deafening BLAST of HIGH EXPLOSIVES. Willard stares at the
text: tree line where it comes down to the river. The JETS are
dialog: making a hell of the tree line; a hell of fire and bust-
text: ling steam thet nothing could live in. Willard's glance
text: goes further downriver through the black smoke and there
text: merging in the river -- small and vulnerable, is his boat.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: (to Lance)
dialog: Look. There it is; the boat.
text: Lance looks over -- a tremendous relief on his face. But

dialog: the boat.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: He'll kill us.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: He can't kill us.
dialog: (realizing as he says it)

dialog: You smell that?
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KILGORE
dialog: Napalm, boy -- nothing else in

text: They reflect the glow from the burning trees.
speaker_heading: KILGORE
dialog: (continuing; nostalgically)
dialog: I love the smell of napalm in

dialog: One time we had a hill bombed
dialog: for 12 hours. I walked up it
dialog: when it was all over; we didn't
dialog: find one of 'em ... not one
text: stinking gook body. They
dialog: slipped out in the night -- but

speaker_heading: KILGORE

speaker_heading: KILGORE

dialog: The wind --
speaker_heading: LANCE

speaker_heading: KILGORE

speaker_heading: KILGORE

speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: The kid can't ride sloppy waves.
text: They turn and stare out to sea.
scene_heading: 96 FULL SHOT - THE POINT - SURFERS
text: The wind has changed. Instead of blowing spray back
text: over the waves and hollowing them out, this strange
text: wind is causing white caps and cross chop.. reducing
text: the swell to slop. Mike and Johnny lay low on their
text: boards, overjoyed.
speaker_heading: WILLARD (O.S.)
dialog: The kid can't stand sloppy waves.
scene_heading: 97 MED. SHOT - THE BEACH - LANCE, KILGORE, WILLARD
speaker_heading: WILLARD

speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !
speaker_heading: KILGORE

speaker_heading: KILGORE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: It's the napalm -- it's causing
dialog: the wind -- ruining my perfect

text: He staggers off toward the trees followed by his

speaker_heading: KILGORE

text: 98 FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R.
text: The P.B.R. along the river shallows -- The Chief and

scene_heading: 99 MED. VIEW ON WILLARD AND LANCE
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Are you finished surfing?
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Yeah... thanks.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Want to say goodbye to the
dialog: Colonel?
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Nah.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Then let's get the hell out of
dialog: here.
text: They break and run like hell toward the boat in the
text: distance. OUR VIEW TRACKS with them. They are
text: cheered by the crew -- suddenly, Willard sees some-
text: thing and stops... Lance continuing. In a pile of
text: equipment that the Hueys have left are two surfboards
text: -- Willard looks at them.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: No -- no, Captain.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Which one's the Colonel's?
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: The Yater -- the clear one
text: with the thin stringer.
text: Willard glances over to it with determination. There
text: is still MORTAR FIRE coming in between him and the
text: board. Suddenly, Willard makes a run for it.
speaker_heading: CHIEF (O.S.)
dialog: Incoming ! Incoming -- son of
dialog: a bitch.
text: The ROUNDS bracket the P.B.R. and line up the beach
text: toward Willard. He stands there and doesn't move, the
text: surfboard under his arm. The shells kick up sand.
text: Lance has dropped. Fragments whistle by, one rips
text: a chunk of foam and fibreglass from the rain of the
dialog: board.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: (calm)
dialog: This one , Lance?
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Yeah, Jesus Christ !
text: Once again, Willard takes off fast as hell with the
text: board under his arm. Lance follows toward the boat,
text: through the water. Willard hands the board up to Mr.
text: Clean, and they both scamper abroad, exhausted and
dialog: relieved.
speaker_heading: CLEAN
dialog: What'd you that for?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: When I was a kid I, never had
text: a Yater spoon.
text: Mr. Clean stuffs the board in the stern 50 Cal. mount.
text: The boat turns -- ENGINES RUNNING HARD and ROARS OFF
text: toward the deeper water of the river -- the board
text: clearly visible on the stern.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO :
scene_heading: 100 FULL SHOT ON THE RIVER - P.B.R
text: The P.B.R. ROARS BY going down the river at full speed.
text: It is swerving and zig-zagging to avoid potential enemy
dialog: fire.
scene_heading: 101 MED. SHOT ON THE CREW
text: They all are in full battle positions -- their twin
text: fifty Cal. guns turning; warily covering the jungled
text: banks. The Chief is at helm -- Willard crouches
text: against some armor plate, huddled with his M-16 ready.
text: Chef is behind him at the radio. Lance leans back
text: from his forward turret.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Maybe we better stay in under
dialog: the trees till dark -- we got
dialog: his Yater.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: He didn't look like he'd take
dialog: that sitting down.
text: They all look up into the sky -- expecting the worst.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Let's put some distance between
dialog: us and Charlie.
text: The Chief nods.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Lance ---
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Why don't you roll us a big
dialog: joint? I think the Captain'd
dialog: like that.
text: They all look at Willard uneasily. After a suspensful
text: pause, Willard smiles:
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Take one a mine --
text: He fishes into his breast pocket -- pulls out a huge
text: cigar-sized joint. They all smile -- Willard lights
dialog: up.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO :
scene_heading: 102 FULL SHOT - THE P.B.R.
text: It zig-zags away from us down the river at high speed.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO :
scene_heading: 103 FULL SHOT - THE TREES, BOAT, CREW - NIGHT
text: The boat is hidden under some trees along the river
text: bank. The men wait tensely listening --
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: You hear it again?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: No -- I don't think so. But
dialog: it'll be back. They were
dialog: circling. It'll be back.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: You think he'd of shot us?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Any time -- us -- Americans.
text: Lance looks over at Willard.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I don't think he´d of shot us on
dialog: the beach but -- he'd of shot us
dialog: if he saw me taking the board --
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: A Yater spoon is hard to get --
dialog: especially here.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: He's a man who knows what he
dialog: wants -- he does know what he wants.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Can I go get those mangos now?
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: I'll go with you in a while --
dialog: judt hold tight awhile --
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Captain -- that was all true
dialog: about the rats and chocolate
dialog: and stuff?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: And you could just tell when
dialog: the supplies were booby trapped?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: It's a feeling you get in the
dialog: jungle. When you get good, you
dialog: can find a track and tell not
dialog: only how many they are, but
dialog: their morale, how far they're
dialog: going, whether they're near
dialog: their camp, the weapons they're
dialog: carrying.
speaker_heading: CLEAN
dialog: How can you tell their weapons..
dialog: an' how far they're going?
text: Willard smiles.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Mostly from the imprints when they
dialog: put them down to rest. their morale
text: from the way they drag their feet,
dialog: or the joints that may be lying
dialog: around. If they're near a base
dialog: camp, they wouldn't be conserving
dialog: food; they'll be throwing it away
text: half-eaten. If the branches aren't
text: broken, their weapons are slung.
dialog: But all this is just technique..
dialog: There's a feeling you get after a
dialog: while, that's what's important.
dialog: I was going through a village once.
dialog: I was looking for a certain party.
dialog: I took off my boots, and walked
text: into each hut. It was midnight.
dialog: I went into three like that and
dialog: suddenly I realized I´d gone into
dialog: each hut the same way -- standing
dialog: up -- so the next one I went in on
text: my belly. An RPD burst took out
text: the door a bit above my head.
dialog: (he shrugs)
dialog: Things like that.
text: A pause, and then suddenly his attention is diverted --
text: They all are silent -- It is pitch dark -- we HEAR the
text: distant SOUND of ROTOR-BLADES and indistinguishable
text: language on a loudspeaker -- The talk stops -- the
text: ROTORS grow LOUDER until almost overhead.
speaker_heading: KILGORE (V.O.)
dialog: (over a loudspeaker)
dialog: I'm not gonna hurt or harm you,
dialog: boy -- I just want the board
dialog: back -- You can understand --
dialog: It was one of my best -- You
dialog: know how hard it is to get a
dialog: board you like, boy. I'm not
dialog: gonna hurt or harm you --
dialog: Just leave it where I can find
dialog: it --
text: The HELICOPTER DRONES on into the night -- the same
text: speech starts again further off -- Finally the noise
text: ceases.
speaker_heading: CLEAN
dialog: Jesus -- that guy's too damn
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: I wonder if that was the same
text: copter.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: He's probably got 'em all over
text: the river with that recording.
dialog: We better move now while it's
dialog: dark.
text: Chef steps forward with a plastic basket.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take
dialog: Lance with you --
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I'll go with him --
text: They all look at him.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I wanta get my feet on solid land
dialog: once in awhile --
text: He grabs an M-16 and follows Chef over the side.
scene_heading: 104 MED. SHOT - THE JUNGLE - CHEF, WILLARD - NIGHT
text: They cautiously walk through the underbrush.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Chef.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Yes, sir --
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Why they call you that?
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Call me what, sir?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Chef -- is that 'cause you like
dialog: mangoes an' stuff?
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir
dialog: -- I'm a sauciere --
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: A sauciere --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: That's right, sir -- I come from
dialog: New Orleans -- I was raised to
dialog: be a sauciere.. a great sauciere.
dialog: We specialize in sauces; my whole
dialog: family. It's what we do. I was
dialog: supposed to go to Paris and study
dialog: at the Escoffier School; I was
dialog: saving the money. They called
dialog: me for my physical so I figured
dialog: the Navy had better food.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: What are you doing out here?
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Cook school -- that did it.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: CHEF
text: They lined us all up in front of
dialog: a hundred yards of prime rib --
dialog: magnificent meat, beautifully
dialog: marbled.. Then they started
dialog: throwing it in these big
text: cauldrons, all of it -- boiling.
dialog: I looked in, an' it was turning
dialog: gray. I couldn't stand it. I
dialog: went into radio school.
text: They move into a slight clearing.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: -- quiet --
text: Chef crouches close -- redies his M-16. Willard ges-
text: tures that he heard something; he points.
scene_heading: 105 MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE
text: PAN SLOWLY over jungle -- END REVEALING Willard and Chef.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: (silent)
dialog: There...
text: He points -- motions Chef to move away -- they cover
text: the spot. A few yards from them they hear something
text: move. It is obviously no small jungle creature. They
text: walk toward a patch of black elephant grass; their guns
text: at the ready. They look at each other. Willard is
text: cold, methodical, doing something he knows well. There
text: is a noise again -- some of the growth rustles. He
text: and Chef move a distance apart, and join in stalking
text: the probable V.C. Willard directs the Chef with hand
text: gestures, and bird and cricket sounds. They move
text: stealthily, closing the apex of their triangle on the
text: hunted. The two men drop low into the elephant grass,
text: and remain motionless. Then Willard makes the cricket
text: noise, and they move closer. Willard's left hand edges
text: out along the M-16's far end, so that he only has to
dialog: point the finger of that hand and he will hit what he
text: wants. He makes another command and they rush the
text: trapped enemy.
scene_heading: 106 MED. SHOT - THE ELEPHANT GRASS - WILLARD AND CHEF
text: Suddenly there is a RUSHING SOUND -- The grass folds
text: down quickly toward them -- willard plants his feet and
text: from the hip lets go FULL AUTOMATIC. The Chef retreats
text: FIRING short BURSTS into the grass -- the grass folds
text: almost to Willard -- then a huge tiger leaps out at
text: them; snarling magnificently. They FIRE wildly,
text: emptying their clips.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: It's a motherfucking tiger --
dialog: goddamn...
text: He turns and bolts through the jungle, as scared as a
dialog: man can be.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: (continuing; screaming)
dialog: Goddamn -- Jesus Christ tiger --
dialog: motherfucking tiger -- ohhhhhhhhh --
text: Willard jams another clip in his gun and backs out of
text: the clearing, covering the bushes and runs, scared
text: out of his head as well.
scene_heading: 107 FULL SHOT - THE BOAT - THE CREW
text: They all are armed -- Lance has the twin 50's pointed into
text: the jungle. Chef comes screaming out of the brush, throws
text: his rifle into the boat and dives headfirst after it.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: (hysterical)
dialog: Ohhhh -- tiger ! Oh goddamn !
dialog: It's a tiger ! Jesus Christ !
dialog: Goddamn, a tiger ! Ohhhhhhhh.
text: The Chief tries to grab him; takes his gun away, but is
text: unable to take a hold of the Chef, as he slithers around
text: the boat, trying to find safety. willard follows from the
text: jungle -- The Chef is moaning and stares off into the night.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: What's this tiger shit?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: No shit... I think I shot the
dialog: hell out of him.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: You think?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I wasn´t looking.. I was running.
speaker_heading: CLEAN
dialog: Was a big tiger -- no shit?
speaker_heading: WILLARD

dialog: you?
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Mangoes? There as a fucking

dialog: been eaten alive. I'm never
dialog: going into that jungle again.
dialog: I gotta remember never get out of
dialog: the boat; never get outta the boat.
text: They move off; swallowed by the darkness. The JUNGLE
text: NOISES remain, as OUR VIEW BEGINS a MOVE INTO the jungle.
speaker_heading: WILLARD (V.O.)
dialog: He was right, the Chef -- never
dialog: go into the jungle, unless you're

speaker_heading: WILLARD (V.O.)
dialog: What was in the jungle? What was
dialog: there, waiting for me?

text: him; a maturity, a cool inner peace.
speaker_heading: WILLARD (V.O.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ... Kurtz was in there. Or was he;
dialog: was it Kurtz? He was just a name

speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: What is this bridge?
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: It's of strategic importance for

text: He points to the men getting ready to work.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT

text: from a sandbagged emplacement.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER (O.S.)
dialog: Get your asses down, buddy.
text: They drop and crawl to the slit trench and run up to the

speaker_heading: VOICE

speaker_heading: LANCE

speaker_heading: VOICE

dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: What're you shooting at, soldier?
speaker_heading: GUNNER
dialog: Gooks.
text: He turns and sees it's an officer.
speaker_heading: GUNNER

speaker_heading: WILLARD

speaker_heading: GUNNER
dialog: They were tryin' to cut through
dialog: the wire -- I got 'em all I think.
speaker_heading: OTHER SOLDIER
dialog: Oh yeah -- listen.
text: There is a low moaning SCREAM from out in the wire -- it
text: stops for aminute then continues hideously.
speaker_heading: GUNNER
dialog: He's trying to call his friends --
text: send up a flare.
text: The Spotter does, it arcs up, then bathes them in eerie
text: light. The Gunner FIRES a long BURST.
speaker_heading: SPOTTER
dialog: Those are all dead, stupid, he's
dialog: obviously underneath 'em --
text: They think about this as the flare goes out. The SCREAMING
text: gets more intense.
speaker_heading: GUNNER
dialog: Wake up the Roach.
text: The Spotter moves down to where a tall lanky SOLDIER is
text: leaned up against the trench. He kicks him hard several
text: times. Roach wakes and just looks up. On his helmet are
text: the words: "GOD BLESS DOW."
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: Yeah, man.
speaker_heading: SPOTTER
text: Slope in the wire -- hear him.
text: He listens, he does, he nods.
speaker_heading: SPOTTER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Bust him.
text: Roach gets up somewhat annoyed but very cool. He saunters
text: up the machine gun dragging his M-79 which has paisley
text: designs all over it.
speaker_heading: GUNNER
dialog: Hear him?
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: Sure , yeah.
speaker_heading: GUNNER
dialog: You need a flare --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: No, it´s cool.
text: He opens the breech of his shotgun-like weapon and plunks
text: the big slug into it. He snaps it closed then rests it
text: across his forearm over the trench -- he listens to the
text: SCREAM, calculating.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: He's close -- real close.
text: He adjusts his sights so that the gun is aimed high into
text: the air. He listens again then FIRES. The GRENADE
text: WHISTLES off into the night. There is a sharp EXPLOSION
text: that cuts off the scream. Then the THUD of bodies or
text: pieces of bodies coming down around them.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Muhhh Fuhhh ...

speaker_heading: SOLDIER

speaker_heading: CLEAN
dialog: Yeah, it still runs.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER

speaker_heading: CLEAN

speaker_heading: SOLDIER

speaker_heading: SOLDIER

dialog: to tell 'em how much I enjoyed
dialog: knowing 'em -- it's been a great
dialog: twenty years. I gotta let 'em

speaker_heading: CLEAN
dialog: What're you askin' me for -- put

speaker_heading: SOLDIER

speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Spooky.
speaker_heading: CLEAN
dialog: Charlie?
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: No, it'd be spooky without the war

speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Maybe you shouldn't say we're

text: Willard stares at the dock and building, trying to figure
dialog: it out.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Chef, try your French.
text: Chief hands the loud-hailer to Chef, who shrugs and shouts:
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Nous sommes Americains --
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: CHEF

scene_heading: 158 POV THROUGH THE GLASSES

text: on the dock.
speaker_heading: WILLARD (O.S.)
dialog: French Nationals -- they may not
dialog: be too friendly, though.
text: 159 BACK TO SCENE
text: We drift closer to the dock. The Chef starts enjoying
dialog: speaking French.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Nous sommes Americains -- nous
dialog: sommes des amis --
text: There is silence as the boat drifts closer. Then:
speaker_heading: FRENCHMAN
dialog: (shouting out)
dialog: Vous parlez Francais comme une vache
dialog: espanole.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: I thought it was pretty good,
dialog: myself.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: What'd he say?
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Said I speak French like a

speaker_heading: FRENCHMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Laisser tomber vos armes --
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Put the guns straight up -- stand
text: away from the mounts.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Do it.
dialog: They do.
speaker_heading: FRENCHMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Vous pouvez approcher mais
dialog: doucement --
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Take her in slow.
scene_heading: 160 FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - DOCK
text: The men on the dock move forward, cautiously. They are
text: a young man, PHILIPPE, about 25, strong and handsome, save
text: for a scar down on the side of his face and through his left
text: eye, which is covered by a patch. He is dressed in a
text: tiger suit and the red beret of the French colonial para-
text: troops. Also of the red beret are HENRY LeFEVRE, a bear-
text: ded, dark-looking man of 35, and TRAN VAN KAC, a middle-
text: aged half-breed slave. They all bear automatic weapons
text: and suspicious in their eyes. As the boat pulls up to the
text: dock, another Frenchman joins the group, obviously the
text: head man, GASTON De MARAIS, about fifty, small and deli-
text: cate, with a strength about him.
speaker_heading: PHILIPPE
text: Hands on the heads.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: I can't steer with my goddamn

speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Hey, they speak American.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Who is the commanding officer?
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: I --
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard.
dialog: This is Chief Warrant Officer
dialog: Phillips -- it's his boat. We
text: were shot up bad downriver and
dialog: need repairs and food -- we can
dialog: pay you in gold.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Philippe --

speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: I'll help you with --
speaker_heading: PHILIPPE
dialog: Do not move --
text: Gaston looks at the skyward pointed twin fifties admiringly.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: As I said, we can pay you in
dialog: gold.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Entirely unnecessary, Captain.
text: He puts down his gun -- the others do likewise --
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: We share a common enemy -- you
dialog: are our guests.
dialog: (he steps back)
dialog: I am Gaston de marais -- this is
dialog: my family's plantation. It has
dialog: been such for 121 years. It will
dialog: be such after I die.
dialog: This is my son, Philippe -- he
dialog: has fought in Algeria and held
dialog: the rank of Captain. And Henry
dialog: LeFevre -- a sergeant; he was
dialog: at Dien Bien Phu. My personal
dialog: servant, Tran Van Kac ---
text: Then he motions to the trees. A young man in a tiger suit
text: and three women come forward from different positions --
text: all wear bush clothing and bear weapons.
speaker_heading: GASTON

dialog: My youngest son -- Christian --
scene_heading: 161 CLOSE SHOT - CHRISTIAN

scene_heading: 162 CLOSE ON CLAUDINE

scene_heading: 163 FULL VIEW - P.B.R. - CREW, GASTON, OTHERS
text: They stand there, exhausted and amazed. Philippe yells
text: in Vietnamese -- about a dozen native men in tiger suits,
text: heavily armed, walk out of the trees from all around them.
text: They look the Americans over warily and assemble at
dialog: Philippe's command.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: American weapons?
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: We took them from the dead.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Now -- I assume you want to rest,
dialog: to shower. We'll attend to your
text: repairs after dinner.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Shower.
text: Willard's men look at one another, dazed.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: We don't want to bother you any,
dialog: we --
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: A man of war is never bothered to
dialog: aid an ally -- you will follow me,
dialog: Captain.
text: Willard steps off -- then stops, reaches back and picks
text: up his M-16 by the stock.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: A habit of men of war, sir --
dialog: you understand.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Of course, Captain -- an
dialog: unfortunate necessity.
text: The men are relieved. They pick up their weapons and
dialog: follow.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: What about the boat?
speaker_heading: PHILIPPE
dialog: My men will keep it for you --
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Yeah -- well, I'll stay with the
dialog: boat.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Chief.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Come with us.

text: and follows.
scene_heading: 164 FULL SHOT - PLANTATION - WILLARD, GASTON, OTHERS
text: Gaston stops, points to a guest house off the main struc-
text: ture which is a typical jungle plantation house, save the
text: many sandbagged gun emplacements and barbed wire.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: A suitable accomodation for
dialog: your men, captain -- you will,
dialog: of course, be quartered with us --
text: He indicates that the men should follow Philippe. The
text: Chief is hesitant.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Go ahead --
text: Philippe leads them on, muttering.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Captain, this way.
text: Willard follows -- they walk over past the house and toward
text: the jungle, approaching a huge crater, 100 feet across and
text: about thirty feet deep. The bottom is filled with water and
text: young French and Vietnamese children swim in it. On the
text: opposite rim, sit two men and a woman with machine guns.
text: Gaston strides up and looks down at the crater with pride.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Magnificent, eh, Captain?
text: Willard looks.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: It is very good -- there is no
dialog: current -- It is very good. I
dialog: have never seen one like it in
dialog: all Indochina. I was in Paris
dialog: when it arrived -- do you know
dialog: what might have caused --
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Looks like a two thousand pound
dialog: to me. Yeah, a two thousand
dialog: pound bomb.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: No, I've seen those in Normandy.
dialog: This is much better.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: My country -- my country could
dialog: never originate this. Magnificent.
text: Gaston stands in serious admiration for this feat; Willard
text: looks between him and this big hole in the ground in
dialog: amezement.
scene_heading: 165 INT. WORKMEN'S SHOWER - EVENING
text: A foreman's shower from the old plantation days. The
text: Chief steps out of it, refreshed, though still exhausted.
text: Lance stands there, about to step in, absolutely filthy,
text: caked with blood. His reaction is odd; rather than just
text: stepping into the shower, he seems almost frightened,
text: reluctant to step in. Chef is waiting behind him.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: A hot shower, hot damn.
text: He pushes him forward into the water. The dirt and
text: caked mud go swirling off his face and shoulders, and
text: he relaxes as though he suddenly remenbers what a
dialog: shower is.
scene_heading: 166 EXT. THE DOCK - P.B.R. - EVENING
text: battered and torn -- a few of Philippe's Vietnamese
text: guard at the boat.
scene_heading: 167 INT. WILLARD'S QUARTERS - EVENING
text: A beautiful European room with tall ceilings. Still
text: elegantly furnished, although old and decaying.
text: Willard sits in a comfortable chair in the corner of
text: the room, looking out over the carpet, the bed with
text: its elegant spread; the wash basin; the bidet. His
text: battle dress is black with muck, with bloodstaines and
dialog: burns.
text: He rises from the chair and steps to a dresser above
text: which is a large mirror. There is an album on the
text: marble top of the dresser. He turns to a page at random.
scene_heading: 168 VIEW ON WILLARD
text: haggard, looking down at the album.
speaker_heading: WILLARD (V.O.)
dialog: I wondered -- how long has this room
dialog: been like this; how long has the
dialog: furniture been standing in these
dialog: places?
text: 169 VIEW ON THE ALBUM
text: Some old photographs of people standing around a car
text: in the 20's in front of the plantation. Another picture
text: shows a child playing by the rubber trees near the
dialog: plantation.
speaker_heading: WILLARD (V.O.)
dialog: Was it like this sixty years ago?
dialog: Eighty years? But here, even
dialog: eighty years is nothing.
text: He turns the page,
text: The plantation being built. Pictures of the framing,
text: skeletal against the sky and jungle.

scene_heading: 172 CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD
text: He looks up and sees his own face, reflected in the garish
text: mirror. He barely recognizes himself.
speaker_heading: 173 MED. VIEW
text: Willard looks at himself in the mirror, in this odd, out-
dialog: of-time room.
scene_heading: 174 INT. DINING ROOM GROUP - TRACKING SHOT
text: TRACK DOWN the long table, covered with delicious food.
text: The P.B.R. crew sits with others of the De Marais group.
text: The table is headed by St. LeFevre. Chef's face lights
text: up as he regards the wonderful European-style food.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: This food is wonderful ! I can't
dialog: believe the chef is a slope.
dialog: (turning to Clean)
dialog: Some more?
text: Opposite the table, sitting next to the Chief, Lance

speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Hey -- Lance.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Huh? Oh. Um, wouldya ..
dialog: wouldya pass me the Rice-a-roni,
dialog: please.
text: And then he looks to his friends for approval.
text: Our VIEW REVEALS that behind a transparent silk curtain
text: there is another, more elaborate table, where the
text: De Marais family is dining with Willard. Our VIEW MOVES
text: through the curtain and settles in a MEDIUM VIEW of the
dialog: group.
text: The men rise as a very attractive woman enters the room.
text: Willard finally does as well, and she moves to the chair
text: next to him.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Roxanne, I hope you are feeling
dialog: better.
speaker_heading: ROXANNE
dialog: Je vais bien maintenant.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: May I present Captain Willard?
text: He is of a paratroop regiment.
dialog: You know the difference between a
text: paratrooper and a regular soldier,
dialog: don't you , my dear?
speaker_heading: ROXANNE
dialog: (smiling and taking
dialog: Willard's hand)
dialog: Yes, they come from the sky.
text: She sits -- there's an uneasy silence.
text: Willard is caught with this exotic woman on one side of
text: him, and the ongoing conversation on the other. He is
text: forced to face toward Gaston, and drawn to look at Roxanne.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I would like to know more about
dialog: the .. uh, plaque...
text: Philippe turns around, points to an elaborately scripted
text: wooden plaque with various tallies on it.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.
dialog: (hard)
dialog: This is only for this war, Captain.
dialog: Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese
dialog: regular forces -- 15; South
dialog: Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular
dialog: forces and otherwise.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Americain -- 6. Of course, they
dialog: were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Of course. I -- Once we make
dialog: our repairs, we could send word,
dialog: we could have you evacuated
dialog: from here.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Captain?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: You'll get blown outta here some
dialog: day.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: We will never 'evacuate', Captain
dialog: -- this is our home. Indochina is
dialog: ours; it has been so for a hundred
dialog: and twenty-one years, there is
dialog: something to say for that.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: The Vietnamese think it's theirs
dialog: -- I guess the Americans do,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: But we civilized it. A place
dialog: belongs to those who bring light
dialog: to it, don't you agree.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I always thought the French came
dialog: here to get the rubber.
speaker_heading: PHILIPPE
dialog: Excuse me, I must attend to my
dialog: men.
text: He gets up, and leaves abruptely -- followed by his wife.
speaker_heading: ROXANNE
dialog: May I ask where the Captain is
dialog: going in his little boat?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: We were going upriver when we
dialog: got caught in a storm, ma'am.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Upriver? Why upriver? There is
text: nothing there, only jungle.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Do you know that jungle?
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: When I was a boy, my father would
dialog: take me there, to hunt. There
dialog: are a few savages, but no man
dialog: can live there, no white man.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: What about an American named
dialog: Kurtz?
text: There is a pause.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: We have never heard of him.
text: Gaston rises, and takes Roxanne's hand.
speaker_heading: GASTON

dialog: Bon nuit, Roxanne -- bon nuit,

speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Good night.

speaker_heading: ROXANNE
dialog: You must realize, Captain -- we

speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I'm sorry to hear that.
speaker_heading: ROXANNE

dialog: Do you miss your home, Captain?
dialog: Have you someone there?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: No. Not really.
dialog:

text: darker and more twisted with ferns and creepers. Strange
text: birds fly out of the trees as the boat passes -- a huge
text: snake slips along an overheading limb. The depth of the
text: jungle is dark, ominous -- yet cool and strangely inviting.
scene_heading: 196 FULL SHOT - BOAT - JUNGLE
text: Suddenly the river widens, the trees give way to marsh
text: and as they emerge into the light a strange shadow falls
text: upon the boat. It is the shadow cast by an enormous
text: vertical tail section of a B-52 bomber thrusting out from
text: the mud. Pieces of aluminum hang loosely from it, oxi-
text: dizing in the sun. Creepers have already started to grow
text: up around its heights -- the jungle is claiming it. But
text: once under its shadow, they have passed a gateway. A
dialog: gateway to paradise.
text: The river widens and the trees at its edge are soft and
text: seductive. The hills beyond are purple and lush. Strange
text: orange colored water-fowl swim lazily out of their way.
text: The water itself is glass smooth and black as if there
text: were no bottom. The sun is warm and the breeze gentle
text: and laced with wild gardenians. It is indeed the most
text: peaceful valley in all the world and each man looks upon
dialog: it and has never known such a sense of peace and well-
dialog: being.
dialog: Each man in his heart feels a need to stay -- his soul
dialog: cries to stop -- stop their madness -- this spiral into
dialog: hell.
dialog: Here is all that can be had of earth. But no hand moves.
text: The boat drifts on its own toward a hole at the end of
text: the clearing. A hole into the jungle from which a
text: darkness permeats. The boat follows the river into this
dialog: hole.

text: The skull looms in the f.g. -- the P.B.R. is pulled back
text: about seventy yards -- Early morning mist still hangs on
text: the water -- as it clears, we SEE another post and skulls
text: on the opposite bank, It is strangely quiet.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: -- All right, Lance --
text: Lance's TWIN FIFTIES split the silence as they POUR into
text: the skulls on the opposite bank -- Suddenly there is a
text: tremendous EXPLOSION and SECONDARY ONES from the jungle

scene_heading: 198 EXT. THE RIVER - FOG - DAY
text: The P.B.R. pushed deeper into this mysterious area. Mist
text: swells in and around the river, as the boat moves into
text: an obscure fog. The Chief cuts the engine, and they coast.
speaker_heading: WILLARD (V.O.)
dialog: Toward the night of the fifth
dialog: day out of Do Lung Bridge, we
dialog: judged ourselves about eight
text: miles from Kurtz' base.
text: Everything was still, the trees,
dialog: the creepers, even the brush
dialog: seemed like it had been changed
dialog: into some kind of stone. It was
dialog: unnatural, like a trance. Not

speaker_heading: CHEF

speaker_heading: LANCE
text: Sounds like hundreds of them.
speaker_heading: WILLARD

speaker_heading: CHIEF

dialog: Chief, stay at the helm.
text: But Chief seems out of control -- he lets the clip of his
text: M-16 go. Then slowly lets the rifle fall out of his hands,
text: and falls to Willard's feet, a primitive spear having
text: caught him right through the ribs. Willard looks down in
dialog: horror.
speaker_heading: 210 VIEW ON CHIEF
text: laying at Willard's feet -- the long spear through him,

speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Chief's dead.

speaker_heading: WILLARD (V.O.)
dialog: It was the strangest thing --

text: don´t even make an effort to touch their weapons.
dialog: 214 WHAT THEY SEE
text: Hundreds and hundreds of Montagnard natives -- dressed
text: in the most ornate and primitive manner: feathers, parts
text: of birds and animals; cod-pieces -- all in body and face
dialog: paint of the most savage nature. But there is a purity
text: about them, men and boys, standing passively watching
text: the small Navy craft flying the strange flag of red,
text: white and blue.
text: 215 VIEW ON THE P.B.R.
dialog: The men of the crew are not the same men who began this
text: voyage. Their manner is lifeless as though in a trance.
text: The various decorations and paraphenelia that they have
text: picked up along the way seem oddly relevant to the
text: savages that stand before them. The Chef has made a
text: hat of birdfeathers; Lance's face has been painted with
text: mud under the eyes to block the glare of the sun. He
text: wears certain animal skins; trinkets; some animal teeth.
text: Their uniforms have been torn and patched throughout the
text: difficult journey. They start to move to their gun
dialog: positions.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Just stand here with me where
dialog: they can see us. Do nothing.
text: 216 VIEW FROM BEHIND THE P.B.R.
text: MOVING SLOWLY TOWARD the fantastic human wall of feathers
text: and war paint, standing on canoes across the river. The
text: men on the crew stand in a group, their hands visibly
text: without weapons. The natives standing across the river
text: make no hostile gestures as they approach. They accept
text: the small boat moving toward them with a sort of inevi-
text: tability. The boat moves closer, approaches the wall of
text: feathers -- which slowly and automatically gives away, in
text: almost a ritual of birth, undulating, allowing the little

scene_heading: 218 FULL VIEW ON THE RIVER
text: Hundreds of Montagnards who had been lining the river
text: now run, absolutely silently, along the banks, keeping

text: A thick greasy smoke hangs from fires that burn near the

dialog: Why didn't he shoot you?
speaker_heading: MOONBY
dialog: I've asked myself that question.
dialog: I said to myself, why didn't he
dialog: shoot me? He didn't shoot me,

text: They are mostly Montagnards, but far more savage looking
dialog: than any we've seen before. They wear only loinclothes
text: and bandoliers of ammunition. their bodies are painted
text: in strange patterns. They carry Army M-16's, Russian
text: AK-47's and a wide variety of knives and clubs. Women
text: emerge from the brush as well. they are armed and
text: equally primitive looking. Interspersed among them
text: are a few taller men with paler skins, with the remnants
text: of Army insignia on them. The paint on their bodies is,
text: if anything more bizarre. We CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS
text: the entire group up to the stone gates of the fort,
text: where thirty or so more are seen silhouetted against
text: the sky. Willard and his men look up at people more
dialog: primitive and more savage than any since the time
dialog: of Captain Cook.
text: They encounter, in the center of the group, what once
text: appears to have been an American. he is tall, gaunt,
text: wears a flak jacket, but is otherwise naked, save a
text: loincloth. His face is darkened from dirt, battle smoke,
text: strange camouflage patterns. His hair and beard are
text: long, matted with mud and grease. He carries an AK-47

dialog: should be made a General, don't
dialog: you think? A General? It's...
text: Suddenly, frightened, he stops. Without looking Willard
text: knows that Kurtz is standing behind him. He turns.
text: Kurtz has stepped out from his headquarters: He is
text: a powerful man, though obviously very ill. He slowly
text: attempts to pull the remnants of his uniform together,
text: though it is ripped and bloodied, and now combined with
text: primitive ornaments designating him a tribal chief, as
text: well as his U.S.A. Colonel's insignia. He is feverish,
text: with long blonde hair and beautiful features. His eyes

text: Kurtz reaches down; takes the .45 -- and without another
text: word or gesture, shoots and kills a man.
speaker_heading: KURTZ
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Do you know me ?
text: He throws the .45 back on the dirt. Rises, and walks
text: back into the cavernous headquarters behind the shrunken
text: heads. Moonby scampers off after him, a respectful
text: distance behind. Even Willard is stunned.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Holy shit.
scene_heading: 237 EXT. KURTZ'S OUTPOST - FULL VIEW - TWILIGHT
text: Dotted with campfires; Montagnard families -- it is like
text: a primitive civilization.
text: 238 VIEW BY THE TEMPLE WALL
text: Willard is alone by a campfire -- his M-16 leans by a wall
text: next to him. He is exhausted.
text: Lance sleeps by the fire, a little distance away. Chef
text: approaches, crouches down.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Captain -- they've been probed
dialog: all this week -- Cong and NVA
dialog: regulars. There's gonna be a
dialog: big offense any time.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I know.
text: Lance stirs; starts to wake up.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: What are we doing here?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him,
dialog: just like he said.
speaker_heading: KURTZ
dialog: Yeah, I can see that. He's
dialog: fuckin nuts --
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: He killed that guy without feeling
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Not a thing.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: When you kill Cong, don't you
dialog: feel something.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Sure.
dialog: (thinking)
dialog: Recoil... I feel the recoil of
dialog: my rifle.
text: Willard rises. Chef looks at him, confused and frightened.
scene_heading: 239 FULL SHOT - WALL - WILLARD, CHEF , LANCE
text: Willard walks along the top of a thick wall -- sandbagged
dialog: and dug out every so often for an M-60 or a mortar
text: emplacement.
text: Wild looking savages man these guns, and seem to bow
text: to Willard as he passes.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: This is good -- triple overlapping
text: fields of fire -- walls so thick
dialog: ordinary artillery just cleans
text: the moss off their surfaces.
text: A woman tentatively moves to Willard, bowing, and then
text: runs off to her bunker.
text: WE ARE TRACKING with them as they move past the groups
text: of people, huddled by their fires... men, women and
text: children. Skulls, shrunken and otherwise hang from
dialog: every hut -- adorn every sandbagged bunker -- dried
text: scalps hang from barbed wire. A child is chewing on
text: a big piece of almost raw meat.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I've done things, when I was
dialog: alone in the jungle -- that I
dialog: never told anyone about.
text: They continue past amount where the shattered wreck of
text: half a helicopter is laying. It has been altered and
text: fortified with sandbags and concertina wire. The wreck
text: lays on its side so that a 7.62 mini-gun that was mounted
text: there sticks up above the sandbags. The emplacement is
text: built on amound so the gun commands a clear field of
text: fire into the jungle beyond.
dialog: Some Americans, barely recognizible because of their
text: beards and savage manner, sit near the gun. Several
text: Montagnard children giggle at their feet and play with
text: bayonets.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: This is evil -- evil, Captain.
dialog: We're all gonna die here.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Yeah, I know.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: I don't get it -- You said your
dialog: mission was to kill him. Let's
dialog: do it, an' get our asses outta
dialog: here. This Kurtz is ruining the
dialog: war; I mean, this don't look
dialog: good for America !
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: (lost in his thoughts)
dialog: ... he's an amazing officer.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: You got to kill this sonuvabitch
dialog: -- Lance and me, we don'´t
dialog: understand none of this -- Jesus,
dialog: Captain -- I don't wanna die here
dialog: -- Do it quick.
text: Lance just stands there; his eyes vacant.. He sort of
text: nods, sucking a joint.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Yeah. I know.
dialog: He thinks.
scene_heading: 240 INT. KURTZ HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
text: VIEW FROM INSIDE -- Willard approaches the stakes with
text: the shrunken heads. Chef and Lance with him. Willard
text: steps in -- Lance and the Chef crouch outside, waiting.
speaker_heading: 241 WILLARD'S VIEW
text: An austere stone savern in the temple: Kurtz's head-
text: quarters. Electric lights hanging in odd contrast to the
text: ancient stone. We SEE what is left of the maps and other
text: military charts -- they had been tacked up on big boards,
text: but have now fallen into decayed disuse.
text: There are other indications of the modern headquarters
dialog: this had been. Now all those things are no longer impor-
text: tant. Kurtz sits alone, slumped back in a wicker chair.
text: There is a large wooden planning table next to him, with
text: maps, lamps and apile of debris that is practically
text: garbage. There are native decorations to ward off evil
text: spirits; and graffiti on the stone walls, things ranging
dialog: fromm "Viet Nam, love it or leave it" to quotes of Nietzsche
dialog: "Nothing is true -- everything is permitted."
text: Moonby, who had been crouching in a corner, moves to
dialog: Willard.
speaker_heading: MOONBY
dialog: He's asleep -- don't bother him.
speaker_heading: KURTZ
dialog: I'm awake.
text: Willard steps in closer. Kurtz looks to Moonby.
speaker_heading: KURTZ
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You. Get out.
text: Moonby hesitates -- not wanting to leave him alone with
dialog: Willard.
speaker_heading: KURTZ
dialog: (continuing; suddenly)
dialog: I said get the fuck out !
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: I'm going to kill the little
dialog: weirdo myself tomorrow.
dialog: (he shows some pain
dialog: when moving his
dialog: midsection)
dialog: He´s only stayed alive this long
dialog: because he's a good orderly and
dialog: medic. He knows how to use a
text: hypodermic.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: You're gonna get hit tonight,
dialog: bad -- a whole regiment of NVA
dialog: regulars.
speaker_heading: KURTZ
dialog: That's right, the little gook-
dialog: pricks. But they are noble
dialog: little gook-pricks, noble.
dialog: Because they fight with their
dialog: guts, like animals. And for an
dialog: idea ! That's rich. We fight
text: with ingenious machines and
dialog: fire, like Gods, and for nothing.
dialog: But I'll call in a major blotto
dialog: airstrike tonight. We'll have
dialog: ourselves a helluva airstrike
dialog: tonight, a lightshow. How do
dialog: you like The Doors': 'C'mon Baby
dialog: Light My Fire...'
text: Willard shrugs.
speaker_heading: KURTZ
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Yeah, I like it...
speaker_heading: KURTZ
dialog: I love it.
text: He rests back, grinning.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: You've gone crazy.
speaker_heading: KURTZ
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: No. My thinking is clear.
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: But my soul has gone mad.
text: Suddenly Kurtz is seized with a terrible pain from his
text: stomach wound. He groans horribly, clutching at it. He
text: literally falls from his chair onto the dirt floor.
speaker_heading: KURTZ
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: My gut -- Oh, Christ, my gut !
text: Willard leans over him; checking the seriousness of the
dialog: wound.
scene_heading: 242 EXT. THE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
text: Lance is crouching by the stone entrance -- Chef leans in,
text: witnessing the proceedings inside.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: (muttering)
dialog: Kill him -- come on, why don't
dialog: you kill him
scene_heading: 243 INT. THE HEADQUARTERS - MED, VIEW - KURTZ AND WILLARD -
speaker_heading: NIGHT
text: Willard examining the wound.
speaker_heading: KURTZ
dialog: (in pain)
text: Oh shit -- on the table; morphine.
text: Willard moves to the table, opens the medical packet. He
text: takes out a morphine capsule, leans over the writhing
text: Kurtz and injects him with the drug.
speaker_heading: KURTZ
dialog: (continuing; looking
dialog: up in pain)
dialog: You see how stupid it would have
dialog: been to blow out my brains? I'm
text: dying from the gut anyway.
text: Willard quickly prepares another shot. Kurtz, truly
text: frightened, holds up his hand.
speaker_heading: KURTZ
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: No -- I don't want to sleep.
dialog: I want to think. Water. Give
dialog: me water.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: You can't have water after
dialog: morphine.
speaker_heading: KURTZ
text: Still playing by the rules.
dialog: (almost
dialog: affectionately)
dialog: You're a damn good kiler.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: (still holding the
dialog: second morphine)
dialog: How's the pain?
speaker_heading: KURTZ
dialog: How's yours?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I can handle it.
speaker_heading: KURTZ
dialog: Pain is easy to handle -- but
dialog: nobility.. the nobility of a
dialog: man is judged by how much Truth
dialog: he can handle.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: What Truth?
speaker_heading: KURTZ
dialog: The truth that you were sent
dialog: here to murder me, ans so far
dialog: you haven't done it. And do
dialog: you know why?
dialog: (looks at him)
dialog: Yes, you know why.
dialog: (he looks)
dialog: Your mission makes about as much
dialog: sense as those idiots who sent
dialog: you on it. Asshole ! Schmuck !
dialog: How long does it take you to
dialog: figure out that nobody knows
dialog: what they're doing here.
dialog: (coldly)
dialog: Except me.
text: He rests back. The drug is beginning to take effect.
speaker_heading: KURTZ
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Gimme water.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: No water.
speaker_heading: KURTZ
dialog: You know what you're doing?
dialog: You are interfering with my
dialog: plans !
text: He crawls in pain toward the canteen Willard watches
text: him impassively.
speaker_heading: KURTZ
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: This water's got Moonby's acid
dialog: in it --
text: He drinks sloppily from the canteen, water spilling all
text: over. Then he throws the canteen to Willard.
speaker_heading: KURTZ
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Drink it -- drink it for tonight.
dialog: Think of it. A whole regiment
dialog: of those shitty little Cong --
dialog: War. Total war -- war like you've
dialog: never known it. It's beautiful
dialog: -- you'll love it. Trust me.
scene_heading: 244 EXT. THE HEADQUARTERS - MED. VIEW - LANCE AND CHEF - NIGHT
text: We can SEE into the headquarters: Kurtz offers the canteen
text: to Willard. Chef is terrified -- Lance is stoned out.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Lance -- the fucker's not gonna
dialog: do it.
speaker_heading: KURTZ
dialog: Goddamn -- You've gotta dig
dialog: napalm on Speed, too. It's
dialog: spectacular, you'll see.
text: Lance stands up holding his M-16, looks into the cavern
dialog: with Chef.
scene_heading: 245 INT. HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
text: Willard stands there, holding the morphine needle in his
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: KURTZ
dialog: Look into the jungle. You can't --
dialog: it's too terrible. You have to
dialog: smear yourself with warpaint to
dialog: look at it -- you have to be a
dialog: cannibal.
dialog: (whispered)
dialog: That's why warpaint was invented.
dialog: Then it becomes your jungle.
text: Willard shoots himself in the arm with the morphine.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: How did we get here?
speaker_heading: KURTZ
dialog: Because of all the things we do,
dialog: the thing we do best -- is lie.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I think think a lie stinks.
speaker_heading: KURTZ
dialog: Oh Captain, that is so true.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Stinks. I could never figure --
dialog: (he drinks from
dialog: the canteen)
dialog: I could never figure how they
dialog: can teach boys how to bomb villages
dialog: with napalm -- and not let them
dialog: write the word 'fuck' on their
dialog: airplanes.
text: Willard drinks more of the LSD water.
speaker_heading: KURTZ
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: You could never figure it because
text: it doesn't make sense.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Fuck no.
speaker_heading: KURTZ

dialog: Air strikes ! White Phosphorus !

speaker_heading: CHEF
