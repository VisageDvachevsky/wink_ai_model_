scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM, A RUSTIC CABIN - NIGHT 1
text: A pair of hands rifles through the pages of a book. Discards
text: it and grabs another. The process repeats until a folded up
text: ARTICLE is revealed, nestled within a hardback.
text: A slender yet handsome figure -- we don’t get a good look at
text: his face, but we’ll learn this is ALEX LINDEN (27) -- unfolds
text: and scans the pages. He stuffs them in his suit jacket, grabs
text: his cell phone and walks downstairs towards...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM, THE CABIN - CONTINUOUS 2
text: Alex gets in the tub, raising the steaming water to the brim.
text: Grabs his phone and scans Twitter (@AlexLinden). New messages
text: cascade down the screen. He types: Ask for me tomorrow, and
text: you shall find me a grave man. Clicks “Tweet.” His message
text: joins a rushing tide and tumbles down the page, out of sight.
text: He drops his phone in the bath, revealing his stricken face.

scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY - LATE AT NIGHT 3
text: An office building around midtown. A lonely figure is
text: illuminated at his desk by the glare of florescent light.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. A BUSTLING NEWSROOM - CONTINUOUS 4
text: Phones ring. Shouts reverberate across the open room. Middle-
text: aged men with stained shirts and considerable guts bluster
text: down aisles of desks holding mock-ups of tomorrow's paper.
text: BEN KAPLAN (27) -- tall and reedy, and more contemplative
text: than most -- takes a big gulp of coffee and hunches over his
text: computer. We GLIMPSE what looks like a fledgeling novel: The
text: words “Chapter Two” and a whole lot of white space.
speaker_heading: NIGHT EDITOR (0.C.)
dialog: Ben. Your pages set?
text: Ben CLICKS AWAY quickly to a newspaper layout. The NIGHT
text: EDITOR slows as he nears but doesn’t stop.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Yeah, yeah. Almost.
text: Ben turns to his computer. SCROLLS to reveal A PHOTO of a man
text: in a penis costume getting arrested. An empty headline field
dialog: waiting to be filled.
text: Ben’s cell phone RINGS, breaking his concentration.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Goddammit, Alex.
text: But Ben doesn’t recognize the number. Decides to answer it.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello? Yeah I’m at work so--
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Please tell me this is a sick joke.
text: Ben looks like he’s been hit by a ton of bricks. He CHECKS
text: HIS MISSED CALLS: It’s “Alex Linden” all the way down.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. A BROOKLYN LOFT - A LITTLE LATER 5
text: SIRI HOPKINS (26) -- beautiful, arty, ethereal -- turns an
text: opened envelope over and over in her hands. Reopens it:
dialog: “Dear Ms. Siri Hopkins: Congratulations! You have been named
dialog: a J. Liddle Urban Architectural Fellow for 2013...”
text: Siri refolds the letter. Feels a heady mix of elation and
text: dread. She hears KEYS JANGLING IN THE HALLWAY and loses her
text: nerve. Flicks off the bedside light and lies back in bed.
text: The DOOR OPENS and Ben appears, silhouetted by the hallway
text: fluorescents. He sheds his clothes while Siri feigns sleep.
text: Slips into bed and holds her from behind. Siri stirs.
speaker_heading: SIRI
dialog: Good day?
text: Ben buries his face in the nape of Siri’s neck.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Siri. It’s...
text: Siri opens her eyes and turns to fix Ben with her gaze.
speaker_heading: SIRI
dialog: Hey. What happened?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: It’s Alex.

scene_heading: INT. A MUSTY UNIVERSITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 7
text: JOSH LIPSCHITZ (27) -- a spectacled, ill-shaven mess -- is

text: cigarettes. He knocks them over while groping for his phone.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I had a freshman roommate named
dialog: Ben, but that ass wad hasn’t called
dialog: in ages.
dialog: (takes in the bad news)
dialog: Oh fuck. Fuck me! Well I’m not
dialog: going.
dialog: (listens)
dialog: Because I’m not, okay?
text: Josh hangs up and blinks his eyes silently for a moment.
text: Suddenly possessed, he gathers up his belongings. On his way
text: out, he slams a Post-it over the NAME PLATE on his door:
dialog: Office Hours Cancelled.

scene_heading: INT. A MANHATTAN LAW FIRM - MORNING 8
text: SARAH GALLO (26) -- pantsuit, plain, yet wholesomely pretty --

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Oh my God. Are you serious? Of
dialog: course you are. What a stupid
dialog: question. I'll... train up as soon
dialog: as I can, okay?
text: Sarah struggles to keep her emotions in check.
dialog: 10
text: A mountain of papers lands WITH A THUD on her desk. She ends
text: her call and looks up to see a SENIOR ASSOCIATE, smiling
text: cynically. Sarah smiles back, wiping away a stray tear. She

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. A HEDGE FUND OFFICE - MORNING 9
text: ISAAC SMITH (27) -- warm eyes, bespoke suit -- walks briskly

speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Sarah. Sarah! Calm down. Take a
dialog: breath. At least he’s alive, right?
text: He hears THE BEEP OF CALL WAITING. Sees a picture of KATE

speaker_heading: ISAAC (CONT'D)
dialog: Shoot. Hold on one second, okay?
dialog: (clicking over)
dialog: Hey baby. Yeah, I’m fine. I think
dialog: I’m just gonna book myself a flight
dialog: and leave the office now.
text: Isaac keeps one eye on the Dow and another on a travel
text: website. His face tells us he’s said the wrong thing.
speaker_heading: ISAAC (CONT'D)
dialog: Of course I want you there with me.
dialog: I just don’t want this to have to
dialog: be a big thing for you... Okay,

speaker_heading: SIRI 14
dialog: What does it say now?
speaker_heading: BEN
text: It’s “recalculating”...
speaker_heading: SIRI
dialog: Then what am I supposed to--
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I don’t know.
text: Siri turns right.
speaker_heading: SIRI
dialog: Do you know when he’1l be able to
dialog: be released?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I think tonight. Maybe tomorrow
dialog: morning. Keep going straight.
text: Siri absorbs Ben’s anxiety. Calculates whether this is the
dialog: best time to spill her secret. It’s not. But fuck it.
speaker_heading: SIRI
dialog: I got the fellowship.
text: Ben’s floored.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: SIRI
dialog: So...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: When were you planning on telling
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: SIRI
dialog: I’m doing it now.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: But how long have you known?
speaker_heading: SIRI
dialog: I found out yesterday but it didn’t
dialog: really... seem like the right time.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: So...
dialog: 15
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I’m really happy for you. It’s a
dialog: great opportunity.
speaker_heading: SIRI
dialog: I know. I meant about us. Moving
dialog: out there. Do I turn up here?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No. Go straight... Siri you know
dialog: I... I can’t just quit my job and
dialog: move to LA.
speaker_heading: SIRI
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Because newspapers aren’t hiring.
dialog: They're laying people off.
speaker_heading: SIRI
dialog: You don’t even like your job.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well I like not-liking it.
speaker_heading: SIRI
dialog: I can’t believe you're doing this
dialog: while we’re on our way up to--
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Hold on. Can we just... table this?
speaker_heading: SIRI
dialog: Table our relationship?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No. I mean. Press pause. Just focus
dialog: on Alex. Don’t let everyone in on
dialog: our own... stuff.
text: Siri looks at Ben. This is the opposite of how she hoped this
text: talk might go but she’s just as happy to drop it.
speaker_heading: SIRI
dialog: Yeah. Sure. Of course. I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. THE FRONT OF THE CABIN - AFTERNOON 15

text: and get out of the car. Ben tries breaking the tension.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Remember when we first came here?
text: Place looks worse than it did.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 16 INT. THE CABIN - CONTINUOUS 16
text: Ben and Siri wander, taking in the mess: bowls everywhere,

speaker_heading: SIRI
dialog: (checking her watch)
text: Sarah's train should be getting in.

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Sarah!
text: They hug awkwardly. Sarah’s a bit flustered by his presence.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I... It’s good to see you.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Yeah. Uh. You too.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Have you talked to Alex?
text: Josh walks. Sarah follows him with her rolling suitcase.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: No. But I can’t wait to ask the
dialog: fucker what the hell he was
dialog: thinking.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (horrified)
dialog: You're not actually going to do
dialog: that, right?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Because he’s obviously... fragile!
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: How do you know? When was the last
dialog: time you talked to him?
dialog: (OFF Sarah’s look)
dialog: Okay what do you propose? We all
dialog: just tiptoe around?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: How about we make him feel safe.
dialog: And loved. And--
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: In other words pretend like
dialog: nothing’s wrong. That’s bullshit
dialog: and he’1l smell it.
text: Sarah’s about to respond when...
speaker_heading: SIRI (0.C.)
dialog: Sarah! Josh!
text: They find Siri. She and Sarah hug like the old friends they
text: are. Siri looks at Josh.
speaker_heading: SIRI (CONT’D)
dialog: We weren’t sure whether to expect
dialog: you.
text: Josh nods. Keeps his distance.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: That jerk-off boyfriend of yours
dialog: still mad at me?
speaker_heading: SIRI
dialog: I think he thinks you’re mad at

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Jesus Christ how self-absorbed can
dialog: one man be?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Don’t worry. You're still ina

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Wait. Isaac is bringing a date?
speaker_heading: SIRI

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I didn’t know he was seeing anyone.
speaker_heading: SIRI
dialog: It’s recent.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (rubbing it in)
dialog: She's 22.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No she’s not.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: What? It’s not like she’s 12.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: One. You’re disgusting. Two. Why
dialog: does he think it’s at all
dialog: appropriate to bring her?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Why not? Young people are
dialog: incredibly comfortable with
dialog: voyeurism. Let’s just hope we can

dialog: Have you heard how he’s doing?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I don’t know. How do people
dialog: normally do after things like this?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: It depends. Most of the time they
dialog: say they regret it. But there’s
dialog: also a high rate of repeats.
text: Isaac processes this information. They wait together in a
text: moment of awkward silence.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s okay that I’m coming, right?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: You said you wanted to come and I
dialog: said it’s fine. So, it’s fine.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No no no. I said I wanted to be
dialog: there for you if you wanted me to

speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Of course you should be here.
dialog: Everyone’s excited to meet you.

text: Ben approaches the bathroom door. He’s armed with a sponge
text: and bleach and dreading what kind of scene Alex may have left
text: behind. He steels himself. Opens the door to reveal...
text: A QUICK YET DISTURBING GLIMPSE of dried blood in the bathtub,
text: clinging to the grout between the tiles. A bloody handprint.
text: Ben SLAMS the door shut. Before he can decide what to do he
text: hears Siri’s car PULL UP outside. Car doors OPEN AND SLAM.
speaker_heading: JOSH (0.C.)
dialog: I’m just saying, it’s an objective
dialog: truth: The Japanese are the most
dialog: whacked-out people on earth.
text: Josh and Sarah tumble in the dining room. Siri’s behind them
text: with a BAG OF GROCERIES. Ben collects himself before joining.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You're like an eight-year-old
dialog: racist.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Come on. Cram that many people on
dialog: an island and it’s like a
text: throbbing, inbred hothouse of
dialog: cultural miasma. Frankly, I’m
dialog: surprised they don’t have more
dialog: fetishes.
dialog: (noticing Ben)
dialog: Ben Ben.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You came.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Yeah against my better fucking
dialog: judgement.
text: Josh keeps his distance. There’s a split second of tension.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Get the fuck over here. 19A
text: Ben wraps Josh in a bear hug. Josh wrestles away.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Back me up here, Ben. We’re not
dialog: really going to just pretend with
dialog: Alex like nothing happened, right?
text: All the levity of their greeting quickly vanishes.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What are you supposed to say? “Hey
dialog: Alex. Interesting choice to commit
dialog: suicide.”
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Thank you, Ben. Hi, by the way.
text: Sarah and Ben hug.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I can’t believe you're on her side.
speaker_heading: SIRI
dialog: Hey. There are no sides. This is
dialog: about Alex, remember?
text: Everyone's momentarily chastened by Siri’s comment. Then they
dialog: start going at it again.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I think we should watch him.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: What? Like... set up a monitoring
dialog: system?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: It'd be casual. But yeah, tag in
dialog: and out. Have someone with him at
dialog: all times.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: We're his friends, not the Gestapo.
dialog: This is ridiculous.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No, it’s not. I googled it.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Case in point.
text: This conversation is making Ben more and more uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: BEN

scene_heading: 20 EXT. THE FRONT PORCH, THE CABIN - CONTINUOUS 20

text: realizes who it is. Ben, for his part, looks stricken.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You came!
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Course I did.

speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I’m good!
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Well, you know. Considering.
speaker_heading: BEN

dialog: disrupt the moment.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Don’t tell me we’re having a party
dialog: in honor of my suicide.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Jesus: attempt. If it were a
dialog: suicide we’d both be wearing suits.

speaker_heading: JOSH

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: SIRI

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Do you want to sit down? Can we get
dialog: you anything?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No, I’m good.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You sure?
text: It’s awkward. Alex is projecting equanimity but underneath he
text: just wants to get away from everyone’s cloying concern.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Actually, I’m gonna go upstairs and
dialog: get changed. Feel a little gross,
dialog: if you know what I mean.
text: Sarah shoots Ben a look. Ben realizes it’s his cue.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Here. Lemme come with.

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I don’t know. Acting thing was only

text: Alex removes his shirt. There are bandages on his wrists and
text: an intensity in his look that wasn’t there a minute ago.
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, shit. I was running out of

speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: Remember junior year when you had
dialog: that meeting with a publisher?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You were so late you had to run

speaker_heading: ISAAC

speaker_heading: JOSH

speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: SIRI

speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: ISAAC

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: JOSH

speaker_heading: JOSH

speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: That’s deep.
speaker_heading: SIRI
dialog: No. I’m serious!
speaker_heading: JOSH

speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: ISAAC

speaker_heading: ISAAC

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Oh, you know. Now and then I score

dialog: them out.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: By purchasing their prescription

speaker_heading: JOSH

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You didn’t pat your head and touch

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Hi, I’m Ben.
text: Ben and Alex hug. Ben reads warily from the card.

speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Suicide. Everyone must take turns

text: Everyone's silent. Sarah shoots Josh a look. Quickly writes
text: something on a card. Pats her head, rubs her stomach, and
text: lays it down. Isaac picks it up and turns to Josh.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Hi, I’m Isaac and I’m a Republican.
dialog: Play this card at any time to make
dialog: all of Josh’s rules invalid.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (to Sarah)
dialog: You can’t do that. You played out
dialog: of turn.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: The card said it could be played at
dialog: any time.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: But that’s violating the game's
dialog: underlying architecture of taking

speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Let me just add. Neither of you
dialog: introduced yourselves before

speaker_heading: SARAH JOSH
dialog: Neither did you! Neither the fuck did you!
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Okay, Josh. Let’s do it. But you
dialog: start.
text: Everyone's startled by Alex’s comment. It’s as if they’d
text: forgotten he was there in the room.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Okay. I get sadness, I get
dialog: depression, I get anxiety. I’m
dialog: pretty sure I’m experiencing at
dialog: least one of them at all times. But
dialog: I don’t understand suicide because
dialog: I’ve never once been not absolutely

speaker_heading: SARAH

dialog: anymore.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Why not? We’ve been dancing around

text: Literally, metaphorically. Pardon

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Josh. Stop!
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: No. Alex should give it to us
dialog: straight. Tell us how good a job we
dialog: all did in bucking him up when he
dialog: was down. How we noticed his
text: increasingly erratic Tweets and
dialog: status updates and thought enough
dialog: to do something about it. How this
dialog: group meant something more than our
dialog: own entertainment back in college.
dialog: How it still means something now.
text: Sarah jumps up and leaves the room, MUFFLING A SOB. Alex

speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: You're an asshole.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I’m a truth teller.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Fuck you. Alex always wrote crazy
dialog: shit on Twitter. How were we
dialog: supposed to know that this time--
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: What was it? Ask for me tomorrow,
dialog: and you shall find me a grave man?
text: Lot of ambiguity in that one.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Well then where the hell were you?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: That’s my fucking point! Where the
dialog: hell were any of us?
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (softly)
dialog: It was my fault.
text: Everyone looks at Ben. Confused by what he’s just said.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Alex called me that day. A few
dialog: times. I didn’t pick up.
dialog: (starts getting emotional)
dialog: I didn’t pick up even though I knew
dialog: he wasn’t doing well. I didn’t. I
dialog: was avoiding it. It’s my fault...
dialog: Fucking hell it’s my fault!
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No it’s not. I mean, yeah. I was
dialog: upset you weren’t answering. But
dialog: I... I didn’t want to die.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What? Then why’d you--
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I mean. I thought at one point I
dialog: did. But then I changed my mind. I
dialog: called the hospital myself. I
dialog: think... I think I just really
dialog: wanted to see you.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You wanted to see me.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yeah. You. Everyone.
text: All of Ben’s pent-up guilt and vulnerability starts evolving
text: into some serious anger.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You wanted to see me and this is
dialog: what you did?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I’m not trying to say it makes
dialog: sense. I just--
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Do you know what I’ve been feeling
dialog: since--
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yes. I do!
dialog: 69
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: And now you’re saying it’s cause
dialog: you fucking wanted to see me?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Well it’s not like any of the more
dialog: conventional options were working!
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I had shit to do. I was living my
dialog: life. I was busy.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Oh yeah? What was keeping you so
dialog: busy that you couldn’t find the
dialog: time? Clearly not your fucking

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I wasn’t joking about dinner, by

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I’m serious. You should open up

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yeah. I’m sure that would fly with

speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: What’s wrong with owning a

dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Nothing! It’s just... It would

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: SARAH (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Fuck. I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Don’t take it personally. It’s...

speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I just did the same thing to Josh.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: So what you’re saying is I’m the

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Isaac. Come on.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I just. I really thought this was

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I did! I do. I mean... for a long
dialog: time, I did.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: But...
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: But you don’t want this. Your shy,
dialog: nineteen-year-old self does. You
dialog: want closure. You want to express
dialog: your anxieties about how this thing
dialog: with Kate might be real. Because I
dialog: think it is real, and I think you
dialog: think it could be real.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: You want all those things, but not
dialog: me. Not really, at least. That’s
dialog: why.
text: Isaac processes this. As if on cue, THEY HEAR FOOTSTEPS and

speaker_heading: ISAAC

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: And I don’t even think I have blood

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: So what you’re saying is you’re

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Maybe it’s just a phase. I hear

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Not a phase. A symptom. Of

text: Ben motions for a cigarette. Josh obliges him.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JOSH

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.

text: comes next.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: And to think I’ve been jealous of

speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BEN
