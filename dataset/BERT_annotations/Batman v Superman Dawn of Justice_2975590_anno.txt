speaker_heading: MARTHA

scene_heading: INT. WGBS-TV STUDIO -- CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: And to her left is Morgan Edge, PR
dialog: executive to Metropolis' own
dialog: LexCorp. The world's leading
dialog: conglomerate and a virtual economy
dialog: all by itself. Lovely to have you
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: EDGE
dialog: Always a pleasure.
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: So Lois I'll start with you. It's
dialog: been almost a year since the attack
dialog: on Metropolis and in that time you
dialog: have been a very vocal proponent in
dialog: the media for the being known as
text: Kal El as an ally to Earth.
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: I believe Kal El is being portrayed
dialog: unfairly in the global media and as
dialog: a witness to what transpired before
dialog: and after the events in Metropolis
dialog: I have no doubt in my mind that Kal
dialog: El can and will aid humanity in
dialog: ways that I understand the
dialog: population are finding difficult to
dialog: accept right now.
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: Morgan, you and LexCorp have a
dialog: different view point.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: EDGE
dialog: We share the same view as the
dialog: majority of the world in that there
dialog: is no evidence that this 'Superman'
dialog: isn't a very real threat to the
dialog: safety of every single human life
dialog: on this planet.
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: I disagree. Just look at the good
dialog: works he's done not just in the U.S
dialog: but around the world in the last
dialog: year.
speaker_heading: EDGE
dialog: By good works do you mean breaking
dialog: international law and causing
dialog: incident after incident. Cat, just

scene_heading: INT. WGBS-TV STUDIO -- CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: EDGE
dialog: (to Cat)
text: The Russian President is furious.
dialog: As long as we harbor Kal El it
dialog: looks like we are condoning his
text: actions. While he's flying around
text: dishing out his own brand truth and
dialog: justice the Russian government is
dialog: accusing us of aiding terrorists.
dialog: But Ms Lane would have you believe
dialog: that he's a hero.
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: (to Cat)
dialog: The United States government
dialog: conceded that Kal El not only saved
dialog: millions of lives here in
dialog: Metropolis but also the entire
dialog: planet.
speaker_heading: EDGE
dialog: Yet Ms Lane he couldn't save the
dialog: 5,000 people that lost their lives
dialog: right here in our city. A death
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: EDGE (cont'd)
dialog: toll that would have been much
dialog: larger had it not been for the
dialog: efforts of the city's police and
dialog: emergency workers. And what part is
dialog: Kal El playing in the
dialog: reconstruction of the city? None.
dialog: It is LexCorp that is fixing that
dialog: damage that he ultimately caused.

speaker_heading: FEDEROV

speaker_heading: HARPER
dialog: Not always Guy. It just sticks in

speaker_heading: GARDNER
dialog: He's put a lot of money into

speaker_heading: HARPER
dialog: Considering how much he's taken out

dialog: know how he came by all that cash?
speaker_heading: GARDNER
dialog: Sure I could use a few pointers.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: HARPER
dialog: When he was just some brat on the
dialog: street him and his punks ran a

dialog: Bed good folks dry. He takes that
text: cash and uses it to make a computer
dialog: program then sells it to big firm

text: Gardner WHISTLES at the number.
speaker_heading: HARPER(CON'T)
text: It gets better. He then uses that

dialog: makes the one he made first look
dialog: like a calculator. Turns that
dialog: billion into billions.
speaker_heading: GARDNER
dialog: Sounds like good business.
speaker_heading: HARPER
dialog: That's not the point. Point is he
dialog: got his start by taking out of the

speaker_heading: GARDNER
dialog: He's rebuilding th city after those

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Superman isn't the reason for my

speaker_heading: LUTHOR
dialog: Your reason being Metropolis
dialog: itself.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I can't help but take an interest

speaker_heading: LUTHOR
dialog: (half smiles)
dialog: And profitable circumstances.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Neither of us would have gotten to

speaker_heading: LUTHOR
dialog: I got to where I am through hard
dialog: work and innovation. You by
dialog: accident of birth. I assure you we
dialog: view our bottom lines very
dialog: differently.
text: He HOPS of his desk and walks past Wayne to a BAR near the

speaker_heading: LUTHOR(CON'T)
dialog: (cracks open the can)
dialog: I'd offer you a drink but I don't
dialog: have any gingerale.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: We both want the same thing Lex. To

dialog: way of that.
speaker_heading: LUTHOR
dialog: (takes a gulp)
dialog: Past differences? As I recall you
dialog: called me an amoral, arrogant brat.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Yes on the very same day you

speaker_heading: WAYNE(CON'T)

speaker_heading: LUTHOR
text: (smirks and leans back
dialog: against the Bar)
dialog: Coincidence Wayne. The world is

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Apparently so. Took us quite a

speaker_heading: LUTHOR
dialog: I liked that satellite. It was
dialog: quaint. Whatever happened to it?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
text: An alien in a black onesie kicked

speaker_heading: LUTHOR
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Ouch.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I'm here to help. The rebuilding of
dialog: Metropolis is my main priority.
dialog: Pooling our resources would better
dialog: serve it's citizens. I'm willing to
dialog: let bygones be bygones. If you are?
speaker_heading: LUTHOR
text: An alien spacecraft blasted a hole

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I'm glad we can put it aside. I

speaker_heading: LUTHOR
dialog: (dismissive)
dialog: Wayne enterprises is a powerful
dialog: company but not enough to challenge

dialog: Those contracts are mine. But

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: What would you suggest?
speaker_heading: LUTHOR
dialog: When a dog bites a man we put it
dialog: down. Because we understand what
dialog: it's capable of. That thing isn't
dialog: one of us and doesn't deserve the
dialog: understanding that the government
dialog: is affording it.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: You sound like you want to kill

speaker_heading: LUTHOR
dialog: There comes a time when even a god
dialog: must die.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: You've seen what he... 'It' can do.
dialog: All that power. All that strength.
speaker_heading: LUTHOR
dialog: It might be hard for someone like
dialog: you born with the silveriest of
dialog: spoons to understand. I spent my
dialog: childhood on the streets. I joined
dialog: a gang. It's survival. I didn't
dialog: have much of a choice. I learned
dialog: there that there was always someone
text: bigger, stronger but never smarter.
dialog: By the time I was 15 that gang
dialog: answered to me. Strength is nothing
dialog: Wayne. Resolve is everything.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Then why not use that resolve to
dialog: find a peaceful solution.
speaker_heading: LUTHOR
dialog: There is no peaceful solution with

speaker_heading: WAYNE

dialog: you going toe to toe with a god.
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: LUTHOR
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Toe to toe? I don't go toe to toe
dialog: with anybody. You don't become the

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Too smart for that?
text: Luthor raises and eyebrow and smiles.
speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: LUTHOR

speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: (dismissive)
dialog: Unless it's the oath of allegiance
dialog: I'm not interested.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I think there's more at stake here

speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Look around you Wayne. Everybody

dialog: consistently interfere with world
dialog: affairs with no regard to the
dialog: consequences or legal ramifications
dialog: of your actions.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: I help where I can. I'm here to
dialog: save lives. I can't afford to stop
dialog: and consider what politicians will
dialog: be inconvenienced by my actions.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT NELSON
dialog: And as noble as your motives may or
dialog: may not be. You cannot expect us as
dialog: a species to simply sit back and
dialog: allow you to dictate the course of
dialog: our history without our consent.
dialog: Where is your authority?
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: Honestly I have none. I am not here
dialog: to be a dictator. I'm here to serve
dialog: the people of this planet in any
dialog: way I can.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT NELSON
dialog: And therein lies the problem. who
dialog: do you really serve? At the end of

dialog: institutions.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: That is something I cannot do.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT NELSON
dialog: Can't or won't.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: I am here to serve all humanity
dialog: regardless of their allegiance.
dialog: What you are asking my to do is
dialog: take orders and eventually take
dialog: sides.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT NELSON
dialog: Then I do not see how we can allow
dialog: you to enforce your will on our way
dialog: of life, regardless of your
dialog: intentions. You're not leaving us
dialog: much in the way of options.

speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: But I will not be a prisoner or a
dialog: pawn for government interests and
dialog: that at the end of the day is what
dialog: the Bill means. It's submission to
dialog: an authority that I cannot
dialog: recognize because it prevents me
dialog: from serving all the people of the
dialog: world. I will pledge myself to
dialog: humanity but not to it's leaders.
dialog: I'm sorry Mrs President.
