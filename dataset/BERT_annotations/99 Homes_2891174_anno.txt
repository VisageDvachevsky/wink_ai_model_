scene_heading: I/E. EVICTION HOME - DAY
text: A blood-stained wall near family photos. POLICEMEN take flash
text: photos of the DEAD HOMEOWNER, gun in his lifeless hand.
text: OFFICER DUDURA questions two SHERIFFS (30s-50s) but tries to
text: get the attention of an impeccably dressed RICK CARVER (40s),
text: talking on the phone. He’s a smart, ambitious real estate
text: broker, with a mean-streak.
speaker_heading: OFFICER DUDURA
dialog: Rick?... Mr. Carver?...
speaker_heading: RICK CARVER
dialog: I‘1l be with you in a second.
text: He continues his call; wants to look away from the dead
dialog: homeowner, but can’t.
speaker_heading: RICK CARVER (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Remove the power meter, turn off
dialog: their water, and let ‘em sweat a
dialog: couple days, then ride up on your
dialog: white fucking horse and tell them
dialog: you have an interested cash-buyer
dialog: and that Rick Carver can get the
dialog: short-sale approved... Jesus, do I
dialog: have to hold your hand while you
dialog: give them a hand job, Bill? Get me
dialog: that property.
text: He smokes an electronic cigarette.
speaker_heading: RICK CARVER
dialog: Yes, John - Officer Dudura - you
dialog: have my court order signed by the
dialog: Judge. What else can I do for you?
speaker_heading: OFFICER DUDURA
dialog: You’re the bank’s realtor for the
dialog: eviction today. I need an official
dialog: statement. What happened? Why?
text: Rick walks though the house; Dudura and Sheriffs follow.
speaker_heading: RICK CARVER
dialog: Well, Dudura, it’s a real shame,
dialog: because we arrived here with two
dialog: pizzas for Mr. Kadwell, the
dialog: property owner, but he didn’t want
dialog: the anchovies, so he went into the
text: house, pulled out a gun, and blew
dialog: his brains out.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE HOME
text: NEIGHBORS have gathered. POLICEMEN, EMTs, NEWS TEAMS. A

dialog: That set off Mrs. Kadwell, who was
dialog: expecting Chinese for dinner.
text: Dudura looks disgusted; Sheriff #1 snickers.
speaker_heading: OFFICER DUDURA
dialog: You’re talking about someone who
dialog: just killed himself.
speaker_heading: RICK CARVER
dialog: I’m the last man who knocked on
dialog: Patrick Kadwell’s door - in his
dialog: life. That’s his wife of twelve
dialog: years, Samantha, and son, Dylan -
dialog: eight - and daughter, Paige -
dialog: eleven. What official statement is
dialog: going to encapsulate the tragic
dialog: absurdity of this fucked up
dialog: situation, Dudura? I can’t bring
dialog: him back to life, so please stop
dialog: wasting my time.
text: He walks away and answers his RINGING phone.
speaker_heading: RICK CARVER (INTO PHONE)

speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: What does that mean in terms of
dialog: payment?
speaker_heading: CREW LEADER

speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Did you fail to make three
dialog: payments, Mr. Nash?
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Yes, sir - but I was told to, it
dialog: was two departments of the same
dialog: bank telling me the opposite thing
dialog: and then just recently I got this
dialog: final notice for eviction -
speaker_heading: FREEMAN LAWYER
dialog: Your Honor, you already entered
dialog: summary judgement here. We’d like
text: to close by the end of the month.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I see no reason to hold up the sale
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Hold on a minute - they told me not
dialog: to pay, that’s why I’m behind, they
dialog: told me - it was two departments of
dialog: the same bank, telling me different
dialog: things your Honor.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: While I’m sympathetic to your
dialog: situation, I have 40,000 cases like
dialog: this backed up behind yours. Final
dialog: judgement granted. I’m ordered you
dialog: to vacate the premises.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: That's my family home, your Honor.
dialog: I was born and raised in that home.
dialog: So was my son, Connor. Please don’t
dialog: do this. We’ve lived there our
dialog: whole lives, my mom runs her
dialog: business out of that home. That’s
dialog: our second source of income.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: This is your son?
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Yes, that’s my son.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Then he should be in school, not

speaker_heading: DENNIS

speaker_heading: CONNOR
dialog: How do you know? The cops aren’t
dialog: coming back? I just wanna know how
dialog: you’re gonna pay for it.
speaker_heading: DENNIS

text: parents. Family photos line the wall, including Dennis’ dad.
dialog: The family has lived here over 40 years. It feels like it.)
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: I’m just trying to figure out what
dialog: this 30-day thing means; he said
dialog: we've got 30 days to file an
dialog: appeal, but does that mean the
dialog: eviction’s not happening tomorrow?
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: But the judge told you 30 days.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: I know, the judge said we got 30
dialog: days to file for an appeal -

speaker_heading: RICK CARVER
dialog: I appreciate this is a difficult

speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Sir, this is our home, so, we just

dialog: There are two ways that we can do

dialog: what you’re told. Or the hard way,

speaker_heading: RICK CARVER
dialog: Sir, the two minutes is a courtesy.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: The two minutes is what?
speaker_heading: RICK CARVER

speaker_heading: RICK CARVER
dialog: My advice would be to get a moving

dialog: How’s that?
speaker_heading: RICK CARVER
dialog: He got this place back in ‘05 for

dialog: he took a home equity loan and got
dialog: another $200,000 that he used to
dialog: buy that sweet little Yellowfin for

dialog: Hester to Tahiti. By the time this
dialog: home was worth half what he’d
dialog: borrowed, he just quit paying.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: You can’t just quit paying.
speaker_heading: RICK CARVER
dialog: Sure you can. He hired himself a
dialog: lawyer - not to win - but to tie up
dialog: his case for three years. Guess how
dialog: Many mortgage payments he made
dialog: during those three years?
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: None. But he owes money.
speaker_heading: RICK CARVER
dialog: Lawyer got a short sale approved,
dialog: and the bank wiped out his debt.
dialog: It's called, “strategic default.”

speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: All that in here now?
speaker_heading: RICK CARVER

speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RICK CARVER
dialog: So who just paid me $33,000 to buy

speaker_heading: DENNIS

dialog: money you just gave me. Feels a bit
dialog: like trouble.
speaker_heading: RICK CARVER
dialog: You did honest work building homes
dialog: your whole life. What did it get
dialog: you but me knocking on your door?
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Is this stealing?
speaker_heading: RICK CARVER
dialog: In 2006, you borrowed $85,000
dialog: against your home and never paid it
dialog: back, Nash. You’re telling me
dialog: that’s not stealing?
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: No, it’s not stealing. I was given
dialog: a loan. That’s me working my ass
dialog: off trying to pay back that loan -
speaker_heading: RICK CARVER
dialog: That’s not how the banks see it. Or
dialog: the tax-payers paying for this
dialog: bailout.
text: Rick picks up overturned chairs by the pool. Dennis follows.
speaker_heading: DENNIS

speaker_heading: RICK CARVER
dialog: Well I can. I’m a fucking Doppler

dialog: don’t want to admit it. Or the
dialog: banks cheated you, take your pick.
speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: RICK CARVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Either way you’ve lost. But I made
dialog: even more money in the crash than

dialog: need to stop lying to yourself and
dialog: ask: What have you been doing wrong
dialog: that your family lives in a motel?
text: Dennis considers, then picks up the last overturned chair.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: I‘1l do it. But I want you to help
dialog: me get my home back. - And this is
dialog: my first payment.
text: He hands Rick the envelope, but Rick refuses.
speaker_heading: RICK CARVER
dialog: Don’t get emotional about real
dialog: estate.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: That's my family home, my boy's
dialog: school. I want it back.
speaker_heading: RICK CARVER
dialog: Not enough money here. Put that
dialog: under your mattress because putting
dialog: it in the bank only makes them
dialog: money. When you have more, I’‘1l

speaker_heading: RICK CARVER
dialog: You’re kidding me?
speaker_heading: KHANNA
dialog: That’s $150,000 hit. Hidden

dialog: not interested anymore.
speaker_heading: RICK CARVER
dialog: This Bank of Santa Fe deal is like

dialog: do to get Vesic back into those
dialog: homes?
speaker_heading: KHANNA
dialog: I just don’t think it’s possible.
speaker_heading: RICK CARVER
dialog: How about this: I’1l put appliances

dialog: Santa Fe from Ortiz over to me.
text: Khanna smiles. Rick is uncertain why...
speaker_heading: KHANNA
dialog: Tell you what. Put brand spanking

speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Appliances, yes. ACs and water

speaker_heading: RICK CARVER
dialog: Just pick another one. You got the

dialog: There's plenty of homes in the sea.
dialog: Like I said, don’t get emotional
dialog: about real estate, Nash! They’re
dialog: boxes. You listening? Big boxes,
dialog: small boxes. What matters is how
dialog: Many you got. You’re gonna have
dialog: more properties than women to fill

speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: You sold our house?
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: There is no more home. We couldn’t

dialog: this. I had to get us out of that
dialog: motel so Connor wouldn’t get
dialog: killed, so I wouldn’t get killed -
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Who gave you this home? How did you
dialog: get it? By kicking people out of

speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: I didn't kick anybody out of this

speaker_heading: LYNN
