scene_heading: EXT. MIAMI STREET - MOVEMENT - NIGHT (1964)
dialog: 
text: in the dark. Coming toward us. Up and down in sync to an
text: INSTRUMENTAL LEAD-IN from somewhere. A slip of light. A
text: glimpse of somebody in shadow under a sweatshirt hood,
text: staring at us, in and out of the dark as...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE STAGE, HAMPTON HOUSE CLUB - EMPTY FRAME - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A man walks into the shot, grabs a microphone, slips out of
text: his jacket and looks at us. He wants to tell us something.
text: He's in a lavender light. This is SAM COOKE. What he calls
dialog: out...a throaty mixture of gospel, soul and sex...is "Let me
text: hear it!" And WOMEN SHRIEK. He says, "Yeah!" They answer,
text: shrieking, "Oh, yeah!"...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MIAMI STREET - HOODED MAN'S FACE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: up and down, running along a dark road in the dead of night,
text: passing vacant lots with debris amid trees and faded
text: buildings. He is CASSIUS CLAY. He runs in construction
text: boots. His eyes stare from under the hood. He passes the
text: husk of an abandoned car, a pastel storefront. We're in
text: Overtown, Miami's inner-city black neighborhood.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE STAGE, HAMPTON HOUSE CLUB (MIAMI) - SAM COOKE
dialog: 
text: shouts, "Don't fight it! We gonna feel it!" The women in
dialog: the audience answer: "Gotta feel it!"
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MIAMI STREET - CASSIUS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: now runs diagonally across NW 7th INTERCUT with Cooke
dialog: shouting, "Yeah!"
scene_heading: EXT. MACARTHUR CAUSEWAY - CASSIUS - NIGHT
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM COOKE'S AUDIENCE (O.S.)
dialog: Oh, yeah!
dialog: 
text: Cassius runs toward us. Off to the side in the black-
text: mirrored water of Biscayne Bay, leaden clouds in a black sky.
dialog: And now Sam Cooke SINGS "...because you make me wanna
text: mooove...!" and breaks into the first verse of "Feel It."
text: But we see Cassius' eyes are FOCUSED, CONCENTRATED,
dialog: ELSEWHERE. To where is this man running? Why is his
text: expression so distant? A WHITE LIGHT suddenly hits him from
text: behind. He looks over at...
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
scene_heading: WIDE FROM THE FRONT: CASSIUS + A METRO-DADE POLICE CAR
dialog: 
text: that's slowed, clocking the suspicious, running black man.
text: The driver starts to pull over, to hassle Cassius. Then,
text: the cop riding shotgun gets a radio call. He taps the
text: driver's shoulder. They take off, the driver laughing.
text: Cassius looks after the white cops. He is neither relieved
text: nor angry. He's dismissive. And, instead, he sees
dialog: something else...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. A BOARD ROOM - GORDON DAVIDSON - DAY
dialog: 
dialog: and six other patrician, white business-people of Louisville
text: in their green baize and wood-paneled Luxo boardroom. They
text: speak soundlessly and patronizingly to Cassius Clay, Sr.,
text: seated at the foot of the table. It relates to the stack of
text: contracts in front of him. He is in a suit and tie, his
text: hair and moustache are dapper. His tie's a little loud. He
text: has his hands folded deferentially in front of him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LSG BOARD MEMBER
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "...the successor trustee shall be
dialog: fully authorized to pay or disperse
dialog: such sums from the income or
dialog: principal as may be required."
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Do you understand so far, Mr. Clay?
dialog: 
scene_heading: CASSIUS CLAY, SR.
dialog: Uh, yes, I do.
dialog: 
dialog: We get the impression that, if he doesn't understand what
text: he's being told, he's faking it. He is conforming,
dialog: delivering socially mandated deference...
dialog: 
scene_heading: FRONTAL: CASSIUS, SR.
dialog: 
text: and BEYOND HIM, seated against the wall, is Cassius, Jr. in
text: sport jacket and tie. Right now he looks to his left and to
text: the right, and only then do we notice the entire wall he's
text: against is covered with pictures of thoroughbreds and studs
dialog: this Louisville Sponsoring Group owns as well. He is one
text: among their sporting possessions. He doesn't like it. He
text: looks at the back of his father listening.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LSG BOARD MEMBER
dialog: Are you sure, sir?
dialog: 
scene_heading: CASSIUS CLAY, SR.
dialog: Yeah. I follow you.
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LSG BOARD MEMBER
dialog: Okay. 'Cause I'd be happy to
dialog: explain any of these terms.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CASSIUS CLAY, SR.
dialog: No, thank you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LSG BOARD MEMBER
dialog: Thank you, sir.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MACARTHUR CAUSEWAY - CLOSER: CASSIUS' EYES - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: back here, now, crossing through black night and over black
text: water of the MacArthur Causeway. We start to HEAR pop pop
text: pop pop pop pop POP over Sam Cooke's music, and Sam Cooke's
text: image SUPERIMPOSES as he segues from "Feelin'" to "Bring It
dialog: On Home." And the pop pop pop pop pop carries us into...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE FIFTH STREET GYM, (MIAMI) - SPEED BAG - DAWN
dialog: 
text: Cassius' fists fly in a reeling motion, hitting the speed
text: bag. But it's his eyes that arrest us...focused, concentrated.
dialog: 
scene_heading: OVER CASSIUS' SHOULDER: BROWN SPEED BAG
dialog: 
text: is a blur. And it SLOWS and becomes a brown boxing glove
text: driving in a SLOWED straight line right at us like a piston.
text: OVER the glove, pushing the fist at us is SONNY LISTON. The
text: brown glove hits...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RING - A BOXER (N.D. BOXER)
dialog: 
text: in a linear left jab. These punches are watched by Cassius'
text: eyes in the Fifth Street Gym...studiously studying Liston's
text: feet...straight-line movement...the jab, linear and straight
text: at us. But it SLAMS into the Boxer, not Cassius. Down he
text: goes. He's out. The referee pulls out his mouthpiece.
text: It's a bloody mess. Teeth have been knocked out with it, so
text: devastating is Sonny Liston... A distant crowd ROARS.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RING - CASSIUS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: VERY CLOSE, climbs into the crush with other contenders.
text: Victorious, Liston, being escorted out, passes very close to
dialog: him on purpose to say...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SONNY LISTON
dialog: (whispers; low)
dialog: Gonna fuck you up. Gonna beat you
dialog: like I's your daddy...
dialog: 
dialog: To Cassius, boxing is dangerous athletics, but Liston's
text: malevolence is straight from the street.
dialog: 
dialog: 4.

scene_heading: INT. FIFTH STREET GYM - CASSIUS' EYES
dialog: 
dialog: SEE...

scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - THE BACK OF HIS FATHER'S HEAD
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. A CITY BUS - WATCHING - DAY
text: the back of his own head moving through a tunnel of white
text: faces, holding his mother's hand, passing the balloon faces
text: of nice white passengers, teenagers in athletic sweaters
text: going to high school, some children, all seated. MOVING
text: through to the rear of the bus where, standing, are black
text: women, heavyset with heavy legs, and middle-aged black men
text: with large, rough hands, crowded on their way to the day's
text: labor or domestic jobs in the back of the bus.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 12-YEAR-OLD CASSIUS LOOKS
dialog: 
text: at a newspaper being refolded by one man in front of his face...
dialog: 
scene_heading: CASSIUS' POV: LOUISVILLE COURIER: EMMETT TILL
dialog: 
text: Published nationwide, it shows his gouged-out eye, the
text: barbed wire noose around his neck, the mutilation to his
text: face because at 14 years old he winked at a white girl in
dialog: Alabama.
speaker_heading: CASSIUS, JR.
dialog: 
text: is frozen by the image. It will haunt him for most of his
text: life. The man holding the paper sees the boy's fear and
text: pushes the paper out at him as a rough joke. Cassius reacts.
text: Then, the man rises and offers his seat to Odessa. Then
text: someone shouts...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGELO DUNDEE
speaker_heading: TIME!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FIFTH STREET GYM - CASSIUS
dialog: 
text: PAST him a short man in a white shirt, ANGELO DUNDEE, has
text: entered with a folded newspaper under his arm.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: And Cassius -- elsewhere -- SLAMS the speed bag with a right
text: hook, and the bag becomes...

text: Malcolm X sees him, nods...the casualness attests their
dialog: familiarity is close and extensive...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM X (CONT'D)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: 'Cause we don't teach you to turn
dialog: the other cheek. We don't teach
dialog: you to turn the other cheek in the

scene_heading: INT. FIFTH STREET GYM - LUMINOUS HOOP - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Whopwhopwhopwhopwhop...as first rays of golden light
text: illuminate the jump rope spinning effortlessly over his head
text: in a blur. Dust dances in light through the two dirty
text: windows with boxing gloves and "Fifth Street Gym" painted on
dialog: them. It's that time of day Jack Johnson called the
dialog: "fighter's hour," "...between the night and the light..."
dialog: ...whopwhopwhopwhopwhop... And Angelo Dundee puts on a pot
text: of coffee. He washes his hands in a dirty sink, thoroughly
text: drying them. Alert and clean, he's old school. He goes
text: back to the edge of the ring, reading his newspaper. Now,
text: crossing past the white windows is DREW "BUNDINI" BROWN. He
text: takes an orange out of his pocket, sitting on a bench,
text: silently peels it... As Cassius "walks" the rope, jumping
text: up and back.
speaker_heading: ANGELO DUNDEE
dialog: (approving; past newspaper)
dialog: Yeah. Like that, Daddy. Don't
dialog: jump in one place. Bad for the
dialog: heart. That's the most important
dialog: thing.
dialog: (without looking)
speaker_heading: TIME!
dialog: 
text: Cassius drops the rope where he stands, and walks off as Sam
dialog: Cooke...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE HAMPTON HOUSE CLUB - SAM COOKE
dialog: 
text: segues into "Bring It On Home" and women in the front row
text: reach out for him. The heat between Cooke and them is
text: palpable. The first row is going crazy as...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FIFTH STREET GYM - CASSIUS
text: sits into our frame, glistening with sweat, directed through
text: tortuous calisthenics by the hands of Luis Sarria.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGELO DUNDEE
dialog: TIME!!!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HAMPTON HOUSE CLUB - HIGH + WIDE FRONTAL: SAM COOKE'S
dialog: 
text: sweating. The place is rocking as...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE RING, FIFTH STREET GYM - CASSIUS' EYES - DAY
dialog: 
text: alive, sparring. But Cassius never throws a punch... He
text: jerks back, sliding away, an inch away from being hit. He
text: circles in a movement that seems off-balance and then
dialog: becomes fluid and changes rate, faking out where you think
text: he'll be. His sparring partner throws a jab that misses and
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
text: follows with a hook. Cassius slips it by an inch. Entering
text: the gym, now, is gregarious DR. FERDIE PACHECO with a young,
text: afro'd HOWARD BINGHAM, who starts photographing while LUIS
text: SARRIA looks at us. None of the gathered crowd, the
text: greatest "corner" in boxing, breaks his concentration. He's
text: in his zone. We're in the ring. Cassius, trance-like,
text: hands down, circles and slips in no predictable way as...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. A LIMOUSINE - NOW CASSIUS IS - DAY
dialog: 
text: zenned out in SLO-MO on the way somewhere in a suit and tie.
text: People on the Miami streets drift by. The slow-moving limo

dialog: Miami. While Sam Cooke...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HAMPTON HOUSE CLUB - SAM COOKE
text: drives to the big climax of "Bring It On Home To Me...!"
text: counter to the limo's EXTREME CALM as Sam Cooke's medley
dialog: ends and...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. A HALLWAY, THE MIAMI CONVENTION CENTER - CASSIUS - DAY
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. MIAMI RENTAL HOUSE - PACHECO
dialog: 
text: The blur of Pacheco taking his blood pressure. Now Cassius

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PACHECO
dialog: 120 over 80?

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MIAMI CONVENTION CENTER, A DRESSING ROOM - HANDS -
speaker_heading: EARLY EVENING
dialog: 
text: being wrapped. Cassius' shirt is off, sitting on a bench in
dialog: the dressing room...the ritualistic tradition, having his
text: hands taped. Dundee expertly does it. In the background,
text: Bundini, Pacheco, Bingham, Rudy and Two Men in dark suits,
dialog: someone from Liston's camp, and a State Boxing Inspector
text: watch. Then, the door opens for Malcolm X, in a dark suit,
text: thin tie. Cassius lights up. Dundee is done. The Boxing
text: Inspector signs the tape. Then, Dundee puts on gloves and

scene_heading: INT. A CORRIDOR, CASSIUS - NIGHT

text: And they seem distant to Cassius. They reach the end of the
text: corridor, and against the wall stand three or four older bad
text: cigar guys. A curtain...the sounds from the arena drift
text: into the hallway. Cassius is on his toes now, dancing,
text: dancing. And as if being drawn by a force we can't see, he
text: just goes...his entourage, as if holding on, carried along
dialog: by him...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE MIAMI CONVENTION CENTER - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: He comes into the hall...there are shouts, some scattered
text: applause, some booing, growing; and the sound moves through
dialog: the arena...the sounds of expectations, ridicule, potential
dialog: 
dialog: 14.
dialog: 
text: violence. But past the faces and the press, what's arrested
text: Cassius' attention and makes him oblivious in his solitude
text: to all else is the bright 20-by-20-foot place he wants to be
dialog: most in all the world: the ring.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE RING - CASSIUS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: is struck by the brilliance. Illuminated, ready to go...
text: dancing...warming up. Counter to an expectation of anxiety,
dialog: Cassius can't wait to get this on. Other sounds
dialog: happen...irrelevant to him...and now the distant sound of
text: Liston coming into the ring...his bulked-up presence, the
text: roar he inspires, somewhere over there. And all of a sudden,
text: Cassius turns to face the angry man who wishes him death.
text: Cassius rocks left and right, like a tough kid on a corner
text: ready to rumble. The hysteria act is gone; so is the
text: boasting. Instead, there is only Cassius' stare. The
dialog: effect is enigmatic: what is going on here? A Referee,
text: like a distant bird, says something we don't hear...
dialog: 
text: In the corner, his feet float, waiting. There's the BELL
speaker_heading: for ROUND ONE.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RING - ROUND ONE - WIDE
dialog: 
text: It starts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LISTON
dialog: 
text: right away throws a left that misses and attacks Cassius,
dialog: throwing seven more that Cassius with extreme, awkward
text: caution evades.
dialog: 
text: He is fearful of the monster whose punches he has yet to
dialog: feel. Nevertheless, he does his job: measure Liston's
text: range and speed. Then, a body shot catches him above the
dialog: heart. Cassius feels the real power of Liston. It could
dialog: stop your heart's beating. He survives. Then...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIUS
dialog: 
text: throws his long left jab. It keeps Liston at a set distance.
text: He has Liston's range, now, and he dances away from Liston's
text: charges. Then, halfway through the round, Cassius' eyes
text: have hunted out an opportunity, and he throws his first
text: combination with a few hard shots that, to Liston's surprise,
text: rock Liston's head back. And, then, Cassius easily evades...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LISTON'S
dialog: 
text: furious big misses to the left and right.
dialog: 
dialog: 15.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIUS
dialog: 
text: keeps tagging Liston with his long left. And, now,
text: infuriates Liston even more by merely walking away from
text: Liston's big misses, provoking even wilder and more
dialog: inaccurate Liston assaults. (We're aware that any Liston
dialog: shot could knock out Cassius if it connected.) Then Cassius
text: soaks up a couple of body shots, most flicks his jab, slides,
text: dances, clinches, circles away...UNTIL...
dialog: 
text: AT THE END OF THE ROUND
dialog: 
text: Cassius launches a second combination, slams a couple of big
text: lefts Liston's way that rock his head back two times.
text: Liston's so furious, he flips, charging Cassius, who hits
text: and ducks at the same time. The BELL RINGS THREE TIMES
text: before they stop.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLAY'S CORNER - CASSIUS
dialog: 
dialog: breathes hard. Dundee works. Cassius says something we
dialog: can't hear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIUS
dialog: He was supposed to kill me. Well,
dialog: I'm still alive.
dialog: 
text: Angelo is talking to Clay a mile a minute, while Clay MUGS
text: an open mouth...to the press, ridiculing their accusation he
dialog: was all talk. It's clear he controlled Round One to
dialog: everyone's surprise.
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE BELL. INT. RING, ROUND TWO - CASSIUS + LISTON
dialog: 
text: We see press with typewriters, ribbon, microphones, note
text: pads; massive TV cameras hang on platforms over two of the
text: corners. It's a desultory, lower-key version of Round One.
dialog: And...
dialog: 
scene_heading: BIRD'S NEST TV CAMERA + MEDIA
dialog: 
text: Coverage segues to Liston, who throws and misses a few lefts.
text: Cassius tags him with a few rights.
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE BELL. CASSIUS
dialog: 
text: literally ambles into the corner.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SONNY'S CORNER: HIS TWO TRAINERS
dialog: 
text: Liston's getting a lot of strident advice. THE BELL.
dialog: 
dialog: 16.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RING, ROUND THREE
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LISTON'S LEFT
dialog: 
text: comes in like a freight train. Cassius merely leans away to
text: avoid Liston, circles and now snaps off a flurry and OPENS A
text: CUT UNDER SONNY'S LEFT EYE. Then, he splits out of there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: (at ringside, on radio)
text: He's opened a cut on Liston.
dialog: Liston's never been cut!
dialog: 
text: And Cassius, seizing opportunity, hits Liston with more
dialog: combinations. If Cassius won Round One, probably but not
dialog: certainly won Round Two, he now demonstrates he OWNS Round
text: Three. It's a symphony of classical Cassius Clay footwork,
text: flicked jabs that confuse, and, then, hard-hitting
text: combinations that rock the presumably immovable Liston. No
dialog: one told Sonny that Cassius could hit. And, at 210 pounds,
text: he hits HARD. Liston, angered, panicked, knows he's losing
text: and goes after Cassius and misses wildly as the BELL ends
dialog: Round Three...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CLAY'S CORNER - CLAY
dialog: 
text: stands a moment before he sits.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXTREMELY CLOSE: CASSIUS CLAY
dialog: 
text: breathing heavily, ignoring the stool and Dundee and Bundini,
text: looks around. THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE 22, TO BE
text: CASSIUS CLAY, TO BE ON TOP OF YOUR GAME AND TO BE ABOUT TO
text: OWN THE WORLD. He looks over the crowd. Only then, turns
dialog: and sits...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIUS
dialog: (to Dundee)
dialog: He's nothin' to me...
dialog: 
dialog: The genius of Cassius...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIUS (CONT'D)
dialog: And he knows it...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LISTON'S CORNER - CORNERMAN
dialog: 
text: slips a vial of some medicant from his pocket and rubs it
text: into Liston's shoulder.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RING - ROUND FOUR
dialog: 
text: The BELL RINGS. Clay peppers Liston with jabs. Liston
text: pokes his left at Cassius, trying to reach him. They feint,
dialog: 
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
text: circle. Liston gets his left into Cassius' face. It's more
text: a poke than a shot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE: CASSIUS
dialog: 
text: blinks back something...we're not sure what. It seems to go
text: away. Then it's back. The fight continues...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WIDER: CASSIUS
dialog: 
text: dominating. They clinch. They break. This time Cassius
text: violently blinks his eyes! Something's wrong!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIUS
dialog: ...my eyes!
dialog: 
text: A knife-like pain. He can't see. He's getting beaten up.
text: He's in trouble. The BELL.

scene_heading: INT. RING, CASSIUS' CORNER - CASSIUS
dialog: 
dialog: sits.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIUS
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: My eyes! I can't see...somethin'

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ARENA
dialog:

text: Now Cassius stands, saying...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASSIUS
dialog: (his gloves)
dialog: Cut 'em off! Cut 'em! I'm blind.
dialog: 
text: The BELL. Dundee's still in the ring.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGELO DUNDEE
dialog: No. You quit, it's over! Get out
dialog: there. Be a yardstick. This is
dialog: the big one, daddy. Get out there
dialog: and run!
dialog: 
text: He literally pushes Cassius into the ring.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RING - ROUND FIVE - LISTON
dialog: 
text: rushes Clay. He knows this is his chance. Cassius tries to
text: tie Liston up by holding onto the back of his neck, but
dialog: 
dialog: 18.
dialog: 
text: Liston pounds left and right hooks. If anybody wondered if
dialog: Clay could take punishment, this answers that. WHAM-WHAM-
text: WHAM-WHAM-WHAM...five huge hooks.
dialog: 
text: Liston is desperate to end it while Cassius is in trouble.
text: Haymaker after haymaker; some connect, others are blocked
text: but knock Clay sideways. Clay, still blind, keeps backing
dialog: and dancing.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSER: CASSIUS' EYES
dialog: 
text: With a minute left, now, he sees better. Liston throws him
text: into a corner, still trying to put him away. But, he can't,
text: and Liston's energy seems to deflate once he knows that.
speaker_heading: The BELL.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RING, CASSIUS' CORNER - CASSIUS'
dialog: 
text: eyes are clear. In 60 seconds he recovers his energy. He's
text: ready. BELL.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RING - ROUND SIX - CASSIUS
dialog: 
text: can't wait to get out. He shuffles. He circles. He fires
text: combinations. In the early rounds, provoked by Cassius,
text: Liston's anger caused him to abandon his fight plan. Now,
text: having been proven futile, Liston's confidence is gone.
text: He's left with nothing. Psychologically and athletically,
text: Liston is defeated. The BELL. Liston's eyes contemplate
dialog: the inevitable: face nine more rounds of this.

dialog: familiarity, so we understand Cassius is family and has been

text: Quarry over his right eye with a jab thrown while going

dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUARRY
dialog: 
text: shakes it off. Reorganizes. Throws two jabs, a right to

text: ties him up. The ref separates them. Quarry comes in again.
text: Ali throws a left cross over Quarry's right, which Ali
text: leaned away from, and adds two rapid, glancing jabs to the
text: same spot. And Ali OPENS A CUT. The BELL sounds, ending
dialog: Round Two.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: 
dialog: goes nuts, that part that's pro-Ali: Atlanta's black elite

dialog: 
scene_heading: VERY LOW: FRAZIER + ALI
dialog: 
text: The referee separates them. Both men throw and miss...Ali
text: on the right, Frazier on the left. Ali throws a hard left

text: connects with a wild left hook into Ali's cheekbone. THE
scene_heading: UNTHINKABLE HAPPENS...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OVERHEAD: ALI
dialog: 
text: is knocked down onto his knee. Ruled a slip, he stands

speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Hook's comin'. Lean back, man!
dialog: Move back! WORK LEGS...!
dialog: 
text: But Ali's legs DON'T work fast enough. Frazier's hook
text: CRASHES into Ali's face. Ali goes rubbery as he backs to
text: the rope. Ali comes out and backs to the rope on the other
text: side, with cartoon rubbery legs. But the mimicry is
text: camouflage. He really is wobbling. The crowd is going wild.
dialog: We HEAR everything, now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRAZIER
dialog: 
text: is wary. He doesn't trust Ali. He walks across the ring,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOWARD COSELL (V.O.)

text: is swollen like a balloon. They resume...
dialog: 
scene_heading: OVERHEAD: ANOTHER CLINCH

dialog: name I given it.
dialog: 
dialog: 100.
dialog: 
text: Ali and Don King hold court with the press. Also there is
text: George Foreman and his trainer, Dick Sadler, and his manager,
dialog: Nilon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON KING (CONT'D)
dialog: A historical happening. This event
dialog: will show that the black man has
text: arrived on the world stage.
dialog: Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in
dialog: Kinshasa, Zaire.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRESS REACTIONS:
dialog: 
dialog: where's Zaire?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTERS
dialog: Don. Zaire? Why not Antarctica?
dialog: What's wrong with New York City?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON KING
dialog: Because you miss the significance.
dialog: I dream, as Martin Luther King once
dialog: dreamt, that a man could be judged
dialog: by the content of his mind. This
dialog: is about black men helping black
dialog: men, overcoming four hundred years
dialog: of racial depression to the dawn of
dialog: a new day of liberation...financial
dialog: and otherwise.
dialog: 
dialog: King getting really evangelistic...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON KING (CONT'D)
dialog: It will raise up the spirit of our
dialog: inner cities. It will rise up and
dialog: fill with hope the souls, the
dialog: unrequited needs of the black
dialog: proletariat, that is, the
text: discouraged, dispirited, denigrated,
dialog: denizens of the demimonde, that is
dialog: called...the ghetto.
dialog: 
text: Ali's looking at him in amazement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Man, you crazy.
dialog: 
text: Don King laughs. As the press digs King...MOVE ONTO Foreman,
dialog: and here's what's wrong with all of this...we SEE that
text: Foreman, eight years younger, two inches taller, almost as
text: fast and seemingly twice as strong, is not beatable by
dialog: Muhammad Ali. Foreman just doesn't hurt you, Foreman can
dialog: kill you. How is Ali not going to get killed by this man
dialog: 
dialog: 101.
dialog: 
text: with death in his eyes and indifference on his face?
dialog: Meanwhile...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON KING
dialog: Ten million dollars. With one
dialog: stroke of the pen, you split the
dialog: world's biggest emolumation of the
dialog: history of sports!
dialog: 
text: Ali signs a contract; then Foreman. Flashbulbs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON KING (CONT'D)
dialog: The "Rumble in the Jungle"!

scene_heading: EXT. KINSHASA AIRPORT, TARMAC - ROOF - PAST HEADS - DAY
dialog: 
text: PUSH THROUGH people and SEE an Air Zaire DC-10 pulling in.
text: A ramp is wheeled up. The plane stops taxiing. Zairian
text: officials in safari suits, paratroopers with white helmets,
text: LT. NSAKALA and hundreds of African, European and American
text: media with cameras and lights approach. The hatch opens. A
text: ROAR emerges from the right and left. We don't see the source.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AIR ZAIRE DC-10'S - ALI
dialog: 
text: Belinda's behind him. Bingham's there, Bundini, Angelo
text: Dundee, Sarria. As they crowd to the door, we're shooting
text: OVER ALI starting down the ramp. He looks up. We don't see
text: what he sees. We see only the crowd of people at the foot
text: of the ramp, including Don King in a dashiki and the crowd
text: on the tarmac.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRONTAL: ALI
dialog: 
text: looking ABOVE the receiving party. The ROAR again. He
text: looks side to side, almost distracted from King and the
text: officials. He waves. Distant CROWD ROAR increases.
text: They're chanting something. We don't understand the words.
dialog: It contains his name. Now...
dialog: 
scene_heading: PAST ALI: REVEAL A THOUSAND PEOPLE
dialog: 
text: are beyond the receiving party. They're on the roof of the
text: airport. They're sitting on balconies and fences. They're
text: waving their arms. They're on every possible horizontal
text: surface that can support weight. They're shouting in unison,
text: a syncopated ROAR...his name and something else. Ali moves
text: through the receiving party, as if in a trance, to get
text: through the airport to the other side. Security tries to
dialog: keep up...
dialog: 
dialog: 102.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. AIRPORT ENTRANCE + STREET - ALI
dialog: 
text: emerges and reacts. He's electrified. Dundee, Bingham, and
text: a few cops are with him. Everybody else got left behind.
text: REVEAL 10,000 people are OUTSIDE the airport, cheering his
text: arrival. Their cheer is thunder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: (to Zairian Official;
dialog: shouts)
dialog: What are they saying, man?!!! Why
dialog: they saying that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZAIRIAN OFFICIAL #1
dialog: They say, "Ali, boma ye. Ali, boma
dialog: ye."
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: What's that mean?! I don't understand!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZAIRIAN OFFICIAL #1
dialog: It mean...!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: (can't hear)
dialog: What?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZAIRIAN OFFICIAL #1
dialog: (has to shout)
dialog: It mean..."Ali, kill him! Ali,
dialog: kill him!"
dialog: 
text: Ali moves forward. The Zairian Official and four cops fade
text: back, nervous about being in so large a crowd. The crowd's
text: a tidal wave, carrying Ali forward, supporting, never
text: mobbing him.
speaker_heading: MUHAMMAD ALI
dialog: 
text: is overcome. This is all for him. He is their hero. He
dialog: defied the world's powerful. They tried and could not
dialog: destroy him. His defiance made him their champion. And now
dialog: he has come to contest his rightful title against the numb
text: instrument of the all-powerful. He raises his arm, too, and
dialog: shouts...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Ali, boma ye!
dialog: 
text: Ten thousand voices carry it on the wind and take away Ali's
dialog: breath.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MATCH.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CUT TO: INT. AIR ZAIRE DC-10 - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A towering man in denims with sequins blocks our view of the
text: door as he walks out onto the ramp. Only now do we see
text: BEYOND HIM a small welcoming party. Native African dancers,
text: a big banner that proclaims, "Welcome, George Foreman," the
text: Zairian paratroopers, media and a few dozen of the curious.
dialog: 
scene_heading: FRONTAL: GEORGE FOREMAN
dialog: 
text: looks like "Superfly" on steroids. His entourage follows
text: him down the ramp. DICK SADLER, tough and smart, is the
text: Louis Armstrong of trainers. ARCHIE MOORE, crafty and wise,
text: wears a blue shirt and blue pea-cap.
dialog: 
text: If George Foreman wonders at the paucity of his reception,
text: he doesn't let on.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ALI'S HOUSE, N'SELE - ALI - MORNING
dialog: 
text: sits in EXTREME CLOSE-UP drinking coffee...lost in thought.
text: He's somewhere else, puzzled, alone in his thoughts. He
text: wears grey sweatpants, a thin-rubber long-sleeved T-shirt
text: under his grey sweatshirt. He's oblivious to the Euro-
text: modern furnishings. Then it's time, and he leaves...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. N'SELE COMPOUND - WIDE: ALI
dialog: 
text: enters from his bungalow. We SEE we're in a compound. They
text: are white and severely truncated houses linked by sidewalks
text: and too many large street lamps. As Ali starts to jog
text: through this imitation of suburbia with the scale all wrong.
dialog: It's like a Gulag in reverse for the rich and powerful to be
text: within while keeping the rest of the country out. As Ali
text: passes, REVEAL we are at the bank of the Congo River. As
text: Ali starts his predawn run, across the river the first band
text: of magenta tints the horizon and reflects molten on the water.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TRACKING SHOT: ALI + DUNDEE, SARRIA IN A PICKUP TRUCK - RED

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: (to himself)
text: Fast. Six left jabs flash from his

dialog: right hook and left and right
text: uppercuts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Back up, maaan...
dialog: (weaves suddenly;

dialog: ...you fast!
dialog: 
text: Ali slides to the right and throws a left jab and hooks off
dialog: the jab.
scene_heading: EXT. KINSHASA ROAD - EMPTY ROAD - MORNING LIGHT
dialog: 
text: Ali ENTERS, running. The road is lined with Mobutu's green
text: billboards in French and English, proclaiming Zaire
text: wonderful. A few kids emerge from behind the signs, coming
text: out from between...and they trail Ali.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIDS
dialog: Ali, boma ye!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: (repeating)
dialog: Ali, boma ye George Foreman!
dialog: 
text: And he throws a couple at an imaginary George Foreman.
text: There are 15 to 16 kids, now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: You out, sucker!
text: Curious, Ali runs behind the green signs from where the kids
dialog: came.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI'S
dialog: 
text: still jogging. Behind the signs, he becomes a magnetic
text: attraction. People are surprised to see Ali. He's making
text: their day. Euphoric kids parallel him, run with him, follow
dialog: him...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAST ALI:
dialog: 
text: the concrete-and-cinder-block walls to the dusty, bare
text: ground are chromatic. Primary colors. Ethnographically
dialog: interesting.
dialog: 
dialog: 105.
dialog: 
text: ALI SEES interiors. Broken walls. No roof. No plumbing.
text: People come from a ditch with a shower curtain for privacy,
text: surprised to see Ali. Faces indifferent to squalor. This
dialog: is the ethnographically "interesting" surface of what, in
dialog: fact, is civic disintegration starting to occur... It is
text: the human concomitant to 13 years of Mobutu kleptocracy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: 
text: looks at the backs of the signs. He and we realize the
text: signs' purpose: to hide the makeshift plastic walls and
text: rooms made from cardboard containers and oil drums from the
text: foreigners traveling the road to Kinshasa. One TEENAGER
text: WITH A WITHERED ARM and a big smile runs up...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEENAGER
dialog: (broken English)
dialog: You beat them, Ali!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Foreman? I kill him!
dialog: 
text: He mimes knocking out Foreman. Something powerful is
text: affecting Ali. We don't know what it is. Ali slows down...
dialog: 
text: ...throws two lightning jabs and a hook. Ali reaches to the
text: kid's head and pulls a coin. He flips it to another kid and
text: walks on. A SECOND TEENAGER comes out and wants Ali to look
text: at something around the back. He takes Ali's hand...and
text: holds it. Ali complies. The entourage follows...
dialog: 
scene_heading: AROUND CORNER: KIDS' PAINTING ON WALL
dialog: 
text: It's an imitation fight poster. Childlike caricatures in
text: Basquiat-like brush strokes. Foreman's got crosses for eyes.
text: He's out! Ali is victorious! His fist is raised. His
text: cartoon face shouts his victory...the people's champion.
text: There's more. There's knocked-out white policemen, knocked-
text: out black soldiers, knocked-out landlords, knocked-out South
text: Africa, knocked-out planes and tanks, knocked-out tse-tse
dialog: flies...everything!
dialog: 
dialog: So much, it means "ALL"...all expectation. This childish
text: painting powerfully affects Ali. The kids look at him.
text: It's still. Some kids in the back leap up in the air to see
text: over taller heads what Ali's doing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: 
text: looks at individual faces. A grinning OLDER MAN with a blue
text: transistor radio (we'll see him later). A smiling kid. A
text: girl with no shoes. A teenage kid jumping up and down...all
text: looking at him. Ali makes four pieces of rope appear. He
dialog: rubs them together...
dialog: 
dialog: 106.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: Shazaam!!!
dialog: 
text: They become one. Everybody goes nuts. As Ali leaves, his
text: eyes go back to the people and the painting...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. KINSHASA ROAD - ECU: ALI'S FACE - MORNING (GREEN SCREEN)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: ...even if I die here. If it kill
dialog: me, no matter what...I gotta win.
dialog: 
text: Concentration has taken him into the athlete's zone, the
dialog: state of unified awareness wherein dwells his total self-
dialog: knowledge. And he knows the transaction: what they give
text: him with their adoration, which he converts to power, is in
dialog: exchange for what he means to them. And what he means to
dialog: them is specific: he represents them in defying power and
text: vanquishing what oppresses. He validates the existence of
dialog: expectation, that struggle is possible...George Foreman,
text: mute and unknowingly, represents disinterested power. Ali
text: doesn't "accept" his obligation; he embraces it. It is his
text: purpose, revealed. And he will never waver from it.

dialog: what it can't see. I'm fast!
dialog: Gonna dance. Be all over George.
dialog: George is gonna feel he surrounded.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And I done somethin' new for this
dialog: fight; I done rassled with an
dialog: alligator.
dialog: Anticipatory laughter. They've had twelve years' experience
dialog: of Ali's stand-up and know when a new routine's starting...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: That's right!
dialog: (laughter again;
dialog: Ali almost loses it)
dialog: I have rassled with an alligator.
dialog: I done tussled with a whale. I
text: done handcuffed lightning, thrown
dialog: thunder in jail. That's bad! Only

speaker_heading: HOWARD COSELL
dialog: Muhammad, I'm sorry. I have to ask.
dialog: (he hesitates; he's
dialog: sorry, but)
dialog: Are you really fast enough, anymore?
dialog: To beat George Foreman? Many
dialog: people believe you don't have the
dialog: same skills, that you are not the
dialog: same man you used to be ten years ago.
dialog: 
text: There it is. Has doubt, spoken truthfully in the open,
dialog: closed the mouth of Muhammad Ali? A beat. Then...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Howard. I didn't want to talk
dialog: about this, especially in front of
dialog: everybody. But I talked to your
dialog: wife! And she told me you're not

dialog: 
text: The assembled media crack up. Ali's eyes are wide in mock
dialog: amazement.

speaker_heading: CLOSE: COSELL
dialog: 
text: A bittersweet smile and the eye contact with Ali. Cosell
dialog: knows...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GYM FLOOR - HEAVY BAG - LATE AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: is slammed by a massive fist. It leaves a dent the size of
text: a deflated basketball. The fist is George Foreman's.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DICK SADLER
dialog: 
text: holds the bag. Foreman throws hooks, one after the other.
text: Each blow rocks Sadler. George is literally punching a hole
dialog: in the bag. These blows would mash an opponent's liver,
dialog: break ribs, destroy kidneys. This man can do more than hurt
dialog: you. This man can kill you.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RING - FOREMAN + SPARRING PARTNER - LATER
dialog: 
text: Foreman is boxing a middleweight. He is smaller than
dialog: Foreman and, therefore, faster. And, that's the point. The
text: partner tries to circle, slide, dance away, and Foreman cuts
text: him off and drives him to the ropes where he tags him. He
dialog: doesn't put a lot behind it. Partner slides...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOREMAN
dialog: 
text: darts left and jars him with three left jabs, keeping him on
text: the rope. Foreman's training to defeat Ali's dancing, his
dialog: "float + sting" tactics.

dialog: Salaam Alaikum, brothers!

scene_heading: SIDE ANGLE: THE TWO ENTOURAGES
dialog:

text: dense of bone. He's taller. His chest seems deeper and his
text: shoulders wider.
dialog: 
scene_heading: AND FOREMAN'S EXPRESSION
dialog: 
text: is casual, unrattled by Ali's antics. He is menacing in his
dialog: indifference. It means he's ALSO immune to getting psyched
dialog: out by Ali.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RING - CROWD - LATER
dialog: 
text: Bundini's in Ali's corner. Ali's sparring partner is Larry
text: Holmes. Ali's hands are at his side. He dances, bicycles,
text: shuffles, dances, dodges, doesn't throw anything, his elbows
text: at his side. Ali is training to DANCE from Foreman. He's
text: fast, but not seemingly suspended in air as he was 10 long

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: That's right. He did three rounds.
dialog: Knew he was gonna lose to Muhammad
dialog: Ali and knocked hisself out. And I
dialog: predict that whenever the fight is

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON KING
dialog: (double entendre)

speaker_heading: ALI

speaker_heading: DON KING

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)

dialog: when he was training.

speaker_heading: DON KING
dialog: (laughs to dismiss

dialog: We will reschedule the fight, and

speaker_heading: REPORTER

speaker_heading: DON KING
dialog: That would go off as planned on

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: (skeptical)
dialog: Uh-huh. I want all helicopters
dialog: guarded! Private boats. Private
dialog: jets. I want the airport -- I'm
dialog: serious -- I want President Mobutu
text: and all his paratroopers. Mobutu
dialog: and all his paratroopers. I want
dialog: all of you "Zaireans" to be on
dialog: guard! Watch all strange boats

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGELO DUNDEE
dialog: The bus station.
text: It's Ali kidding on the square. A serious point delivered

speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Yeah. Watch the bus station.
dialog: Watch everything! Elephant

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't talk to Angelo like that!
dialog: Don't you talk to him like that
dialog: ever again!!!
dialog: 
dialog: Ali ain't fucking around. Ali has reasons for working with
text: Don. Belittling Angelo cuts across all that. Danger's in
text: the air. Dundee puts his hands up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: You think you're callin' these

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: (mock demagoguery)
dialog: They know I'm ready! I see fear in
dialog: the eyes of his followers! I see
dialog: fear! This is the fight that

dialog: ended. The myth of Muhammad was
dialog: supposed to fall!
text: (hits the table with
text: his fist; glares at
dialog: King)
dialog: Supposed to be my destruction!
dialog: (French voices and
dialog: laughter, understated)
text: They miscalculated. They misjudged.
dialog: They got it...wrong.
dialog: 
dialog: Ali's served notice to anyone with ears to hear it: he's
dialog: multidimensional, strategic and dangerous as hell. A taste
dialog: of what's to come.

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VERANDA - ALI, BUNDINI, BINGHAM + ANGELO - DAY
dialog: 
text: Waiters scurry. Ali talks to a blonde reporter from France
text: and settles next to Lloyd Price, without a shirt. Everyone
text: crowds around their table. A ZAIRIAN INTERPRETER and
text: Lieutenant Nsakala are present. Ali disregards their
dialog: presence because his attention tracks...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI'S POV: VERONICA
dialog: 
text: seen over the heads of Zairians. She's 5 feet 10 inches
text: tall. Without acknowledging she's the object of Ali's
text: attention, her radar tells her she's the object of Ali's
dialog: attention.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI (V.O.)
dialog: Say, girl...!
dialog: 
text: Veronica turns, sees Ali. Lights up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)

dialog: 118.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Don brought me here, but I'm not
dialog: "with"...anybody.
dialog: 
text: The others are paying them no attention. Bundini stands to
dialog: talk to Howard Cosell. There's an ocean of side
dialog: conversations. Ali's presentation to Veronica is natural,
dialog: open admiring. It is not seduction. It's more seductive
dialog: than seduction. She feels from Ali nothing predatory or
text: exploitative...only the warm rays of the sun from his open
text: face and appreciating eyes. Still holding her hand...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Where you from?
dialog:

speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Ali, boma ye.
dialog: 
text: Meanwhile, 15 Chinese and some Vietnamese approach and wait
text: patiently. Ali has to force his attention away from
text: Veronica to respond... They all bow. He bows.
dialog: 
dialog: The Zairian Interpreter translates English to French to
text: another Zairian, who speaks Mandarin. It all gets lost in
text: chaos while Bingham shoots pictures and a Plimpton type
text: explains pedantically to Bundini...

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLIMPTON TYPE
dialog: ...she's an African "succubus."

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: 
text: shows the scarf, pushes back his cuffs so that he can't hide
text: anything up his sleeves. His wrists are bare. He shows
text: both sides. Now, he takes the scarf and pushes with his

text: He looks up wide-eyed at everybody. Then, he opens his
dialog: fingers and the scarf is not there!

speaker_heading: ALI + VERONICA

speaker_heading: BUNDINI

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGELO DUNDEE
text: George is playing prima donna. He
dialog: wants to make you wait.
dialog: 
dialog: Ali laughs. You won't psyche out Muhammad Ali with that
text: stuff. Instead, Ali uses the time. He tests the ropes. He
text: gets the feel of the distance between the center and the corner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSER: ALI
dialog: 
text: circles the ring. He looks at the crowd from different

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI'S FEET
dialog: 
text: do a shuffle. He feels the canvas. He feels the soft spots.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog:

speaker_heading: ALI

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: OVERHEAD: ALI + FOREMAN'S
dialog: 
text: corners are clear. Ali is facing his corner, praying to
text: Allah. Foreman is bent over at the waist, flexing and
text: releasing the last tension in his huge shoulders, as the
text: bell for ROUND ONE clangs...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE RING - BOTH
dialog: 
text: charge out and stop as if they ran into a brick wall five
text: feet from each other. Then Ali dips, throws a left, which
text: George takes on the shoulder...a BIG RIGHT HAND to George's
text: head. The crowd goes nuts. George clinches, picks up Ali
text: and swings him through 180 degrees with his power. As he
text: puts Ali down, Ali pushes George's head down and away and
text: Ali clocks him with ANOTHER RIGHT. Foreman clinches and
text: drives Ali back to the rope. Ali throws ANOTHER RIGHT that
text: lands. Ali dances, circles, stays out of Foreman's way.
text: Then he slams him again with a right.
dialog: 
dialog: 134.
dialog: 
text: Foreman gets Ali in the corner, throws vicious combinations
text: and a hook that nails Ali in the body and a wild shot hits
text: Ali on the side of the head. CLOSER ON ALI...stunned, his
text: eyes clear. He's just taken a Foreman shot. He pushes
text: Foreman, the stronger man, out of the way and dances and
text: circles. Foreman ties him up again. Ali pushes out, dances
text: and hits HIM with a RIGHT. Ali ties him up, and there's the
speaker_heading: BELL.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI'S CORNER: ALI
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: (to himself)
text: Legs heavy...air's heavy...like sand...
dialog: 
text: SLOWLY MOVE IN ON ALI
text: as Angelo and Bundini's talk fades away. We see Ali's
text: awareness in a deep concentration. He is holding counsel
text: with himself. Ali stares into space across the diagonal to
text: the other corner, but not really at Foreman. Ali is
text: weighing something. A gamble. He blinks, and whatever it
text: is, he's decided it NOW. AMBIENT SOUND starts to come back
text: as Ali's attention returns to the present and he ignores...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGELO DUNDEE
dialog: ...keep moving. Don't let him put
dialog: you into the corner. Stay off the
dialog: rope!
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE BELL FOR ROUND TWO
dialog: 
text: Ali charges into the center of the ring, provoking Foreman
text: to chase him, and Ali immediately BACKS TO THE ROPE. And
text: stays there! Seizing opportunity, Foreman throws big hooks.
text: ALI IS DOING EXACTLY WHAT HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO DO. He gets
text: off the rope and backs to the rope on the other side. Most
text: of the shots are blocked by the gloves of both men. No
text: damage. Then George throws a left, which Ali blocks, and a
dialog: big right hook.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: 
text: turns away. Nevertheless, it crashes into his jaw.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACRO ALI
dialog: 
text: TIME SLOWS. He ties up George. We SEE Ali's hurt. Dazed.
text: But he must make George believe he's unhurt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: That all you got...? That it?
dialog: 
dialog: 135.
dialog: 
text: Foreman reacts. Ali takes vicious hooks to the midsection,
text: hangs on and goes right back onto the ropes, tying Foreman up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOW ANGLE
dialog: 
text: George's shots are taken on Ali's elbows and gloves. But
dialog: for every four that are thrown, one or two tremendous hooks
text: get through to Ali's ribs, his side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI'S FACE
dialog: 
text: reveals impact, but nothing diminishes the TERRIBLE
text: FORTITUDE with which he endures. Now, he ties up George.
text: Now, George drives Ali into the corner and pummels him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGELO + BUNDINI
dialog: going crazy in the corner!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGELO DUNDEE
dialog: Get off the ropes! Get off the
dialog: ropes! Get off the ropes! Dance!
dialog: 
text: Ali blocking, getting hit. WORRIED FACES in the crowd. One
text: woman looks away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI'S EYES
dialog: 
text: alive, more than alert, the sharpest eyes in boxing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOREMAN'S LEFT JAB
dialog: 
text: coming in. Ali feints, shifts. It misses by a quarter of
dialog: an inch.
dialog: 
scene_heading: FOREMAN HOOKS OFF HIS JAB
text: Ali leans back on the top rope. Foreman's punch falls short
dialog: and connects with little effect. That's how good is Ali.
text: The techniques BECOME CLEAR.
dialog: 
text: Foreman goes upstairs, throws three hooks, all get taken on
text: Ali's gloves. Foreman slams a hook that began in Cape Town
text: and ends up in Zaire, into Ali's abdomen. And another. Ali
text: takes the shots, hangs on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI'S EYES
dialog: 
text: are bright like stars. His white mouth guard shines. A
dialog: grimace? A grin?
dialog: 
dialog: 136.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: There is nothin'... Nothin'!
dialog: (another Foreman
dialog: hook lands)
dialog: ...I cannot take.
dialog: 
text: Ali pushes Foreman off and Ali connects with a left and a
text: straight right to the jaw. They pound but don't stop George.
text: Ali ties him up. Ali's jabs end the round. Nothing
text: effective, but Ali shakes his head, disapprovingly, puts his
text: hand on the back of George's neck, and as the BELL sounds...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: Thought you was bad!
dialog: 
text: George laughs. He won the round overwhelmingly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI'S CORNER
dialog: 
dialog: is apoplectic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUNDINI
dialog: Dance, dance!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUNDEE
dialog: Get off the ropes! What are you
dialog: doin'?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: (it gets quiet; to
dialog: himself:)
dialog: Here come George's "murder" round.
dialog: (refers to Round Three)
dialog: 
text: Ali pushes away from his handlers and rises. He opens his
text: arms to the crowd. We hear a massive "ALI, BOMA YE" start up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSER: ALI
dialog: 
text: opens his arms as if the roar of 65,000 voices is sunlight.
text: By opening his arms, his skin soaks it in and converts it to
text: power. And the BELL STARTS ROUND THREE.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE RING
dialog: 
text: They trade. Nothing. Foreman advances, Ali backs to the
text: ropes, tags Foreman with a couple of harmless left jabs.
text: Now Foreman opens up with heavy artillery. Ali gets in a
text: couple of shots, but for the center of the round he's
text: pummeled by Foreman. Midway through...
dialog: 
text: FOREMAN accepts a left jab, and while Ali's left arm is out
text: with it, Foreman hammers a right into the exposed lower
dialog: 
dialog: 137.
dialog: 
text: midsection of Ali and then follows it with six tremendous
text: hooks to Ali's abdomen. Ali pushes him away. Foreman comes
text: in again. Foreman gets him on the rope again, and a
text: surprising right on the left side of Ali's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: 
text: ties up Foreman's left in the crook of his elbow, and they
text: stagger, married, awkwardly, into the center of ring. The
text: referee separates them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE: FOREMAN
dialog: 
text: charging and throwing heavy shots. Ali takes some on his
text: elbows, arms, biceps and shoulders. NOW we see Ali lean
text: BACK. WAY BACK. 45 degrees back... We start to hear the
text: TWANG of the rope. We get it. Ali is using the rope as a
text: shock absorber. Some Foreman punches get through, but the
text: rope TWANGS and Foreman's hitting a trampoline with a hammer.
text: Between deflection and being ring-wise, Ali dilutes much of
text: what George throws. Then Foreman drives three powerful
text: hooks into Ali's side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI'S BODY SPASMS
dialog: 
dialog: But, as if inconsequential...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: George! Show me something.
dialog: 
text: Ali -- insulting, taunting -- snaps jabs into George's face,
text: talking through his mouthpiece...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: Where's your punch, man?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUNDINI/DUNDEE (O.S.)
dialog: Ali, get off the ropes! Stick 'em!
dialog: Jab! Off the ropes!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UP CLOSER: ALI
dialog: 
text: blocks a rage of Foreman head shots with his fists, the
text: abdominal shots within his elbows. Each Foreman punch is a
dialog: haymaker.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOREMAN
dialog: 
text: suddenly switches.
dialog: 
scene_heading: FROM THE FLOOR: FOREMAN'S UPPERCUT
dialog: 
text: comes from camera and slams right through Ali's guard, right

speaker_heading: ALI'S
dialog: 
text: hurt! He holds on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUNDEE/BUNDINI (OVER)
dialog: Off the ropes! Dance, champ, dance!
dialog: 
text: Ali's pushed back like a rag doll.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOREMAN

text: throws a right hand. It, too, slams through Ali's guard.
dialog: He's in trouble.

speaker_heading: ALI'S EYES

dialog: Open the door, Richard...outta this

dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE RING: FOREMAN

scene_heading: EXT. RING, ROUND FOUR, FIVE, SIX - FOREMAN BARRAGE

speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: 
text: covers with gloves at his head. Elbows at his ribs. When
text: head shots come in, Ali slips them the right or left, or

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: 
text: covering, taking the most powerful hooks Foreman's thrown in
text: the fight, one after the other to the body.
dialog: 
dialog: 140.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Take it! Terrify him with what you
dialog: can take...
dialog: 
text: Ali's eyes are stars. He sees everything. He sees things
text: no one else can see in the quantum physics of deflecting the
text: force of Foreman's blows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOREMAN
dialog: 
text: desperate, pounds a left to Ali's side, a blocked left to
dialog: the head, three lefts to the belly, which get through!
text: Ali's left arm convulses downwards, involuntarily, with the
text: blows. What Ali's not ready for and doesn't block is the
text: right hand that follows. This shot is jarring and concussive.
text: He grabs Foreman's neck and has to hold on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: The BELL.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RING - ALI - MID-ROUND SEVEN
dialog: 
text: leaning way back at impossible angles -- soaking up George's

speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: (hisses to George)
dialog: Eight more rounds... You runnin'
dialog: outta gas?
dialog: 
text: Then...Ali comes out from under.
dialog: 
scene_heading: WHAM. WHAM. WHAM. WHAM. WHAM.
dialog: 
text: Five hard shots are followed into Foreman's puffed face.
text: They surprise and enrage him.
speaker_heading: WIDER: GEORGE
dialog: 
text: drives Ali with his 220 pounds...George's arms and fists now
text: SWING HEAVILY. Some get through. Ali's right eye is puffy.

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RING - ALI'S CORNER
dialog:

text: A tall African Girl walks by with the number "8." As she

text: brightens right up! THE BELL RINGS.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RING - ALI
dialog: 
text: goes to the ropes, throws a couple and, now, comes off the
text: ropes. He's in the center of the ring. HE'S HUNTING. A
text: couple of lefts from Ali. Foreman throws a haymaker and
text: almost falls out of the ring. Ali's in the corner, having
dialog: avoided the shot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOREMAN
dialog: 
text: gets in a couple of lefts that Ali deflects. Ali takes
text: another on the cheek, leans way back again. Suddenly, he
text: seems tired, as is Foreman. Tied up, they go diagonally to
text: the other corner of the ring, both fighters exhausted,
text: leaning against each other. Resting. BUT...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXTREMELY CLOSE: WE SEE ALI'S EYES ARE DEAD SHARP
dialog: 
text: He's faking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOREMAN
dialog: 
text: backs Ali into the corner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: 
text: hits Foreman with a left. Foreman launches a short left
text: that Ali counters with a BIG RIGHT CROSS that connects.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOREMAN'S
dialog: 
text: head snaps around. Sweat sprays in a parabola of light.
text: Crowd ROARS with expectation. George Foreman tries a right
text: uppercut, fails as Ali circles, guiding Foreman onto the

dialog: 
dialog: 142.

speaker_heading: ALI

speaker_heading: ALI'S

speaker_heading: CLOSER: FOREMAN

speaker_heading: ALI'S RIGHT HOOK
dialog: 
text: slams his head down and sideways. And Foreman charges into Ali.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE SLO-MO: ALI
dialog:

speaker_heading: ALI (CONT'D)
dialog: (to himself)
speaker_heading: RIGHT NOW!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOREMAN
dialog:
