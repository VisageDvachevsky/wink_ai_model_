dialog: Harry Hey there, what can I do for you?
dialog: Greenpeace Leader This is an official protest.
dialog: Harry 'Course it is. I love you guys. You like dolphins and

dialog: Greenpeace Leader How can you wake up every day and look at
dialog: yourself in the mirror?
dialog: Harry The same way you did when you blow-dried your hair this
dialog: morning. And you used a curling iron, I betcha. Did you know
dialog: most electricity's from burning oil? I'' stop drillin' when the
dialog: world - stops usin' it. Bennie, start 'er up!
dialog: Greenpeace Leader Wait........
dialog: Harry Can't wait! I'm a businessman! Those goons over there gave

dialog: A.J. Harry, we've hit pressure. We gotta bleed it off. e go any
dialog: deeper, we'll blow the rig.
dialog: Harry Thanks for that opinion. Chick, full speed!
dialog: A.J. The bit's five thousand feet down! Full speed'll rip the
dialog: pipe apart!
dialog: Harry You learn all this in college? I been doing this thirty
dialog: years, kid. Get on the controls.
text: A.J. moves reluctantly to the DRILLING CONTROLS. Chick nods to
text: A.J., who engages the gears. The PIPE STRING turns at FULL
text: SPEED. The new drill pipe descends ten feet into the hole,
dialog: then....
text: The torque rips the NEWLY ATTACHED PIPE from the drilling string.
text: The drill spins freely.
text: A.J. hits the "stop! lever and stares at Harry.

dialog: Grace Never do that again!
text: CLOSE ON A.J. - he's looking back at the DRILL HOLE, panting,

dialog: A.J. You know how I told you there were two obstacles? I didn't
dialog: do the first,'cause he's tough...but I did the second...!
dialog: (pulls out case; opens it)
dialog: I got it at uhm..Tiffany's. I can't give it to you until I talk

scene_heading: EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE
text: ANOTHER TEMBLOR hits, the worst yet, 9.7 on Earth. Watts falls,

text: DEVICE lurches sideways off the gurney and rolls away from the
dialog: drilling hole......
text: The NUCLEAR DEVICE slides off the gurney....
scene_heading: INT. DRILLING HOLE
text: A.J. experiences the DEEPEST, MOST SINISTER RUMBLE YET, emanating
text: form the asteroid's core, something from hell. There's a
text: horrendous WHOOSHING SOUND.
text: A WINDSTORM OF PEBBLE, like a blowing tornado, whooshes up from
text: the hole, smashing into A.J.'S FACESHIELD.
scene_heading: EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE
text: Everyone whirls around in the sound's direction as --
text: ACROSS THE VALLEY FLOOR - A 100 FOOT METHANE GEYSER erupts,
text: spewing a PLUME OF HIDEOUS GREENISH GAS into space. Then another
text: 200 FEET HIGH! Another 500 FEET HIGH! The ASTEROID has become
text: alive. The geyser's eruptions loosen the asteroid's surface
dialog: material and --
scene_heading: INT. DRILLING HOLE
text: A.J. THIS SUCKS....
text: A.J. is whooshed violently out of the hole.
scene_heading: EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE
text: PEBBLES AND HOT STEAM BLASTS from the drilling hole. Everyone
text: recoils....
dialog: Harry Get back!!
text: A.J. shoots out of the pipe, tethering the SAFETY LINE behind
text: him, blowing into space. The safety tether snaps and RIPS off.
text: A.J. is 70 feet off the surface. Harry dives for his ripped
text: tether. Catching it, inches before A.J.'s thrown into space.
text: Harry and Bear grab A.J.'s safety tether and begin to pull him
text: down. Chick stares at something O.S., his jaw drops.
dialog: Chick This thing definitely doesn't like us.
text: CHUNKS OF THE ASTEROID, some as big as trucks, others as big as
text: houses, dislodge from the ASTEROID SURFACE and, slowly at first,
text: but with terrifyingly increasing speed and momentum.....
text: .... they start rolling.
text: HARRY AND THE GUYS just stand there, disbelieving what they're
dialog: seeing.
text: On come the ROCKS and ICE CHUNKS, rolling. As they hit smaller
text: surface rocks, they take little hops, and bigger hops, until
text: they are BOUNDING across the surface. Harry lashes A.J.'s tether
dialog: to the Armadillo.
text: Harry and the guys run for their lives.
dialog: In the midst of this --
text: -- A 500 FOOT HIGH GEYSER erupts next to the drilling hole. Pitts
text: gets blasted by the geyser, which blows him across the asteroid
text: floor, SLAMMING him into the parked Armadillo. A BOULDER rolls
text: at Pitts and squashes him against the ARMADILLO , killing him.
text: A 20 FOOT ICE BOULDER rolls toward A.J.'s SAFETY TETHER.
text: A.J., suspended 70 feet off the asteroid surface, looks down at
text: the ONCOMING ICE BOULDER. A.J., terrified, tries to unbuckle the
text: tether, but he can't in time.
text: The boulder hits A.J.'s tether, rolling over it, flattening it to
dialog: the asteroid surface, which causes --
text: --A.J., with a JOLT, to be yanked toward the surface. A.J.
text: scrambles with his safety harness.
text: Chick, next to the Armadillo, sees A.J.'s plight. He dives
text: inside, engages the gears. The Armadillo ROARS toward the
text: oncoming ICE BOULDER.
text: A.J., terrified, continues to descend as --
text: Chick, driving the Armadillo, rams the ICE BOULDER just as it's
text: about to roll over A.J. The boulder hops up, SMASHES down on the
text: Armadillo's hood, CRUSHING the steel compartment around Chick,
text: and gently rolls over onto --
text: A.J., who log-rolls under the Armadillo, as the ice boulder
text: WHOMPS down and keeps rolling.
text: THE NUCLEAR DEVICE is rolling across the asteroid's surface.
text: Pebbles and debris CLANGING off the device's REMOTE
text: DETONATOR.....
text: Harry bounds toward the Armadillo. THE LARGEST, JAGGED ROCK rolls
text: at the vehicle. Harry's caught. There's no place to turn. The
text: rocks rolls straight at him. Twenty feet....10 feet....Harry
text: FALLS heavily to the ground.
text: Harry gets up and dives down inside a fox-hoe-sized INDENTATION
dialog: in the asteroid surface....
text: The BOULDER rolls right over him.
text: Finally the quake stops. The situation stabilises. Everyone gets
text: to their feet. Harry and A.J. get up. They look off at --
text: The MASSIVE BOULDERS rolling away in the distance, smashing into
text: other rock formations.
text: Harry picks up a DIAMOND. It SPARKLES in the light. Chick grabs
text: one. Holds it up, marvelling at it. The MASSIVE BOULDERS rolling
text: away in the distance, smashing into other rock formations.
text: Harry picks up a DIAMOND. It SPARKLES in the light. Chick grabs
text: one. Holds it up, marvelling at it.
text: Sharp, with bruises on his face, looks through his cracked
text: faceshield down at Pitt's corpse.
dialog: Sharp He's dead.
dialog: Harry Put it down, Chick.
text: Chick tosses down the diamond and follows Harry. Everyone checks
text: themselves. Looks at others. There's no talk, no time to lose.
text: They reconvene, by the NUCLEAR DEVICE. It's dented. The
text: alumniium gurney is smashed, mangled.
dialog: Sharp Three on that side, the rest over here.
text: They hoist the nuclear device and carry it to the drilling hole.
text: They plug one end of the nuke in the drilling hole and lift the
text: other. The NUKE begins to insert down the hole. Suddenly Sharp
text: tries to grab a TUBULAR PIECE OF ALUMINIUM from the broken
dialog: gurney.
dialog: Sharp
dialog: (cont'd)
dialog: Stop...!
text: -- rams it into the wheels of the NUKE'S RATCHET-WHEEL DELIVERY

dialog: (stoically)
dialog: I'd trade places with any one of you. But we need two people to

text: Sharp raises a BUNDLE OF ELECTRICAL WIRES in his hand. The crew's
text: going to draw straws. The highest tension yet. No one breathes,
text: no one moves.
dialog: Sharp Who's first?
dialog: (no response)
dialog: Clockwise then.
text: Sharp holds the WIRE STRAND BUNDLE in front of Lev.
text: Lev stares at it. He smiles nervously and reaches...and draws.
text: The strand is LONG. Lev exhales. Next...
text: Chick, Chick stares at the bundle, sweating. He grabs a strand.
text: Pulls slowly. LONG. He exhales. Next...
text: Bear. He stares at the bundle, thinking, choosing. He grabs and
text: pulls quickly, decisively. LONG. Two strands remain, and two
text: men, Harry and A.J. It's A.J.'s turn....
text: A.J. stares at the wire strands - not a bundle now. A.J. shifts

text: looks at Harry. They lock eyes.
dialog: Harry Your turn.
dialog: A.J. I ain't gonna draw against you Harry.

dialog: Harry Draw.
text: A.J. stares at the two strands. Gets used to the idea. He reaches
text: and begins to pull. Stops. Chooses the other strand. And pulls.
text: It is SHORT. A.J. stares at the SHORT STRAND OF WIRE in his
text: hand. We see a fear on his face that gets covered by a small
dialog: smile.
dialog: A.J. Well, I guess I won. Now I'm the guy who gets to save the
dialog: Earth.
text: A.J. takes off the half medallion. Harry takes off his half
dialog: medallion.
