scene_heading: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - KNIGHT’S RIDGE, MA - NIGHT

text: At one time, he commanded the night brigade. Now he plows.
text: He rolls with
speaker_heading: KEV
text: 29. Apple-pie face. The thick Wade Boggs moustache does no
text: good - Kev still looks 10 years younger than he really is.
text: Kev is Copperfield to Birdman’s J. Steerforth...
text: Kev hops from the truck and begins to shovel the walk, as
text: Birdman plows the driveway of
scene_heading: EXT. TUDOR HOUSE - NIGHT
text: A beautiful house. Christmas lights still dangle... Birdman
text: Plows with great care... He leaves no crumbs... He studies
text: the windows of the Tudor, looking for signs of life...
text: They finish quickly... Kev hops back into the truck. He
text: picks up a clipboard, crosses off one last name.
speaker_heading: KEV
dialog: That’s it --
text: Birdman nods. He looks back at the house. Sighs, Puts the
text: truck in reverse. As it skirts the end of the driveway, an
text: OUTSIDE LIGHT flicks on...
text: A hint of a smile crosses Birdman’s face. It is not lost on
text: Kev, who snorts...
speaker_heading: KEV (CONT.)
dialog: Aw, shit --
text: The Tudor's front door OPENS... A LITTLE GIRL, KRISTEN, 3,

dialog: pewter MUGS of coffee...
text: She walks precariously, balancing the mugs, negotiating her
text: way across Kev’s freshly-cleared walkway...
text: Birdman opens the truck door... Leans down to the little girl
dialog: and takes the coffees...
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN
dialog: Thanks, Kristen. How are you tonight?
text: Kristen merely stares at him. Her expression an admixture of
dialog: terror and confusion...
text: Birdman hands Kev a mug. Kev slurps at it... Frowns.
speaker_heading: KEV
dialog: No ‘buca --
text: Birdman doesn’t hear him. For the front door has opened

speaker_heading: DARIAN SMALLS
text: 28, in ski parka, leggings and Timberlands, walks to the

speaker_heading: KEV
dialog: The thing with the Styrofoam really
dialog: creases me...
speaker_heading: BIRDMAN

speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: ... You know how it is - the beginnings.
dialog: When you first fall in love. Can’t eat,

speaker_heading: ANDERA
dialog: It is awesome --
speaker_heading: WILLIE
text: But inevitably, it goes away. It quiets
