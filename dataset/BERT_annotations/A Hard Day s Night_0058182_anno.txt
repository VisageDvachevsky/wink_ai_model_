scene_heading: EXTERIOR STREETS OUTSIDE RAILWAY TERMINAL DAY
dialog: 
text: The film opens with crowds of girls, shot in a sequence of CLOSE-UPS,
text: chasing after GEORGE, JOHN and RINGO. The boys hare off just ahead of
text: them. They take a turn down a back alley way and the crowds of
text: screaming girls are after them.
scene_heading: EXT, TERMINAL
text: They rush on through the narrow cobbled passageway and into the main
text: station, quickly show their tickets at the barrier for the London
text: train, and get onto the platform as hordes of yelling and screaming
text: girls reach the closed gates.
scene_heading: EXT. TERMINAL PLATFORM
text: We see the fans rushing to the few platform ticket machines, and
text: endless pennies being dropped and tickets torn out in their haste to
text: get onto the platform to see the boys.
text: NORM has been waiting for the boys and he hurries them to where all
text: their baggage, instruments and the drums are waiting, piled up to be
text: put into the guards' van. The boys turn and see the oncoming stream of
text: girls pushing through the barriers and descending on them with yells
text: and shouts. They grab their instruments, RINGO makes for the drums.
text: NORM plugs into a handy transformer and using their instruments like a
text: gun volley to stop the onrush of females, the boys blast fire into a
text: number and start to sing. This stops the girls in their tracks and
text: settle down on whatever they can to listen to them playing.
text: As the boys are playing, we CUT BACK into the crowds. In the centre we
text: see PAUL struggling and pulling to fight his way through the girls to
text: join the other boys. He is dragging a very reluctant old man behind
text: him. The old man seems most disgruntled and we can see by his gestures
text: how unwilling he is to be pulled and pushed forward through all the
dialog: girls.
text: At last PAUL reaches the other boys. He sits the old man down on a
text: of cases and joins in the number to the squeals of delight from the
text: fans. The old man sits aloof and proud ignoring the whole proceedings.
text: JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO look enquiringly at PAUL who gives a
text: noncommittal shrug of the shoulders as if to say, "it's not my fault"
dialog: and the number proceeds.
text: SHOT of sudden horror on JOHN's face. PAUL follows his eye line only
text: see the old man has doffed his cap and is busily collecting money from
text: a disconcerted crowd. PAUL dives hastily into the crowd, and with
text: suitable apologies extracts the old man and with a long suffering sigh
text: drags him back to the group. GEORGE and PAUL hold him firmly as they
text: finish the number, the old man standing there between them.
dialog: the
text: As the number finishes and the girls scream and shout with delight,
text: guard blows his whistle. NORM and SHAKE grab the instruments and the
text: drums, and with the rest piles the lot into the guards’ van. The BOYS
text: head into their reserved compartment pursued by the fans but the train
text: moves off. They have successfully repelled all extra boarders.
text: THE BOYS stand and wave to the fans until out of sight line ... the
text: girls running along to the end of the platform waving and calling out.
scene_heading: INTERIOR RESERVED COMPARTMENT IN THE TRAIN
dialog: 
text: The boys relax, sitting down on one side of the compartment. They are
text: about to settle down and make themselves at home when first RINGO
text: nudges GEORGE who in turn nudges JOHN. Opposite them is sitting the
text: LITTLE OLD MAN. He is holding himself stiff, erect and very aloof.
text: The three boys look at him enquiringly but with an elaborate sniff he
text: looks away from them and out of the window.
text: PAUL catches his eye and winks at the LITTLE OLD MAN. He winks back at
text: PAUL, scowls at the other three then looks firmly out of the window
dialog: again.
text: The boys turn on PAUL crowding around him.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Eh ... pardon me for asking but who's that
dialog: little old man?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What little old man?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: That little old man.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: That's not your Grandfather.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It is, y'know.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've
dialog: seen him.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh, that's me other Grandfather, but this one's
dialog: me Grandfather and all.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: How d'you reckon that one out?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't
dialog: they, and this is me other one.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (long suffering)
dialog: Well we know that but what's he doing here?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him
dialog: good.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: How's that?
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
text: The lads all look intently at the GRANDFATHER.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Aah ... the poor old thing.
text: He leans across to GRANDFATHER.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Eh, Mister... are you nursing a broken heart
dialog: then?
text: The GRANDFATHER nods soulfully glares at him, in a way that
dialog: yes.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: You see, he was going to get married but she
text: threw him over for a butcher.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: A butcher?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah, she was fickle.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Aye and fond of fresh meat and all.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (seriously)
dialog: No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead
dialog: kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother
dialog: thought it'ud give him a change of scenery,
dialog: like.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Oh, I see.
dialog: indicates
text: He inspects GRANDFATHER carefully.
speaker_heading: JOHN
speaker_heading: (to PAUL)
dialog: Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
text: They all agree with PAUL.
text: JOHN has been examining GRANDFATHER. He now leans forward to him.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (in an over-friendly voice)
dialog: Hello, Grandfather!
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (delightedly)
dialog: He can talk then?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (indignantly)
dialog: Course he can talk. He's a human being, like.
dialog: Isn't he?
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
text: The lads all laugh.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: And we're looking after him, are we?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: I'll look after meself.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: He's got you worried, then?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Him, he costs you a fortune in breach of
dialog: promise cases. He's a villain and a right mixer
dialog: as well.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (disbelieving)
dialog: Gerron.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No, straight up.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: The lad's given you the simple truth. I'm
dialog: cursed wid irresistible charm, I'm too
text: attractive to be let loose.
text: At this moment, SHAKE, a tall man who works with the BOYS,
text: the door of the compartment.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: You got on all right then?
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: Hi, Shake.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: We're here. Norm'll be along in a mo' with the
dialog: tickets.
text: He sees GRANDFATHER.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: Morning!
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Who's that little old man?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It's Paul's grandfather.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: Oh aye, but I thought ...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (cutting in)
dialog: No, that's his other one.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: That's all right then.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (displaying Grandfather)
dialog: Clean though, isn't he?
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: Oh yes, he's clean all right.
text: NORM the road manager appears behind SHAKE.
speaker_heading: NORM
text: Morning, lads.
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: Morning ... Hi, Norm.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: (checking them quickly)
dialog: pulls open
dialog: Well, thank God you're all got here. Now,
dialog: listen, I've had this marvellous idea ...
dialog: now just for a change, let's all behave like
dialog: ordinary responsible citizens. Let's not cause
dialog: any trouble, pull any strokes or do anything
dialog: I'm going to be sorry for, especially
text: tomorrow at the television theatre,
dialog: because ...
text: He looks sharply at JOHN who is polishing his nails.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Are you listening to me, Lennon?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (off-hand)
dialog: You're a swine, isn't he George?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (disinterested)
dialog: Yeah ... a swine.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: (just as indifferent)
dialog: Thanks...
text: He sees the GRANDFATHER.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Eh ...
scene_heading: BOYS IN CHORUS
dialog: ... Who's that little old man?
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Well, who is he?
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: He belongs to Paul.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: (accepting the situation)
dialog: Ah well, there you go. Look, I'm going down the
dialog: diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: We'll follow you down.
text: GRANDFATHER rises.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: I want me coffee.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: He can come with Shake and me if you like.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well, look after him. I don't want to find
dialog: you've lost him.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with
dialog: promises. Come on, Grandad.
text: GRANDFATHER joins SHAKE and NORM.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: (over Grandfather's head)
dialog: He's very clean, isn't he?
text: SHAKE and NORM collect GRANDFATHER and are in the process of leaving
text: the compartment when a fat upper class city Englishman, JOHNSON,
text: attempts to enter. There is a bit of confusion and they get tangled up
dialog: with each other.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Make up your minds, will you!
text: At last SHAKE, NORM and GRANDFATHER sort themselves out and JOHNSON
text: enters with his case. The other three go to coffee.
text: JOHNSON puts his case up on the luggage rack, then sits down. All his
text: movements are disgruntled ... he finally picks up his copy of the
text: Financial Times and burying himself behind it, starts to read. After a
text: moment he looks up, notices the compartment window is open. He gets up
text: and without so much as a "by your leave" he closes it, glares at the
text: BOYS and sits down again.
text: The boys exchange looks as if to say ... “Hello, Saucy!!"
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (politely)
dialog: Do you mind if we have it opened?
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: (briefly)
dialog: Yes, I do.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Yeah, but there are four of us, like, and we'd
dialog: like it open, if it's all the same to you, that
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: (rudely)
dialog: Well, it isn't. I travel on this train
dialog: regularly twice a week, so I suppose I've some
dialog: rights.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Aye, well, so have we.
text: He disappears behind his paper before the BOYS can say another word.
text: RINGO pulls a face at the raised paper and switches on his portable
text: radio. A pop number is playing.
text: JOHNSON puts down his paper firmly.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: And we'll have that thing off as well, thank
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: But I...
text: JOHNSON leans over and switches it off.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: An elementary knowledge of the Railway Acts
dialog: would tell you I'm perfectly within my rights.
text: He smiles frostily.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah, but we want to hear it and there's more
dialog: of us than you. We're a community, like, a
dialog: majority vote. Up the workers and all that
dialog: stuff!
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Then I suggest you take that damned thing into
text: the corridor or some other part of the train
dialog: where you obviously belong.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (leaning forward to him)
dialog: Gie's a kiss!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats
dialog: too, you know.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: I travel on this train regularly, twice a week.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Knock it off, Paul, y' can't win with his sort.
dialog: After all, it's his train, isn't it, Mister?
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: And don't you take that tone with me, young
dialog: man!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: (accusingly)
dialog: I fought the war for your sort.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Bet you're sorry you won!
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: I'll call the guard!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Aye ... but what? They don't take kindly to
dialog: insults you know. Ah, come on, you lot. Let's
text: get a cup of coffee and leave Toby the manger.
text: The boys troop out of the door into the corridor. JOHNSON smiles
text: triumphantly. He is about to settle down to his paper when there is a
text: tap on the corridor window. He looks up and we see pressed against the
text: window a collection of hideous Beatle faces.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Eh, Mister ... can we have our ball back!
text: The man jumps to his feet.
scene_heading: INTERIOR OF THE CORRIDOR
text: The boys run away like a pack of school boys and disappear round the
dialog: corner.
scene_heading: INTERIOR OF THE TRAIN CORRIDOR
text: From the P.O.V. of the door leading to the restaurant car.
text: The boys come down the corridor in full flight, laughing away like
text: happy idiots. GEORGE and PAUL pull open the sliding doors. The boys
dialog: look inside.
scene_heading: INTERIOR RESTAURANT CAR
text: From their P.0.V. we see the car is half empty and at a table in the
text: centre SHAKE and NORM and GRANDFATHER are sitting. On the table is a
text: pile of photos of the boys. NORM and SHAKE are arguing. NORM is being
text: very aggressive, much to SHAKE's discomfort.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Yeah, you want to watch it.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: (unhappily)
dialog: It's not my fault.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Well, you stick to that story, son.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (To NORM slyly)
dialog: They always say that.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Yeah, well I got me eye on you.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: I'm sorry Norm, but I can't help being taller
dialog: than you.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Well, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've
dialog: a good mind to ...
text: (he is about to thump SHAKE.)
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (enjoying himself)
dialog: If you're going to have a barney I'll hold
dialog: your coats.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: He started it.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: No, I didn't you did...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, what happened?
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: The old fella wanted these pictures and Norm
dialog: said he couldn't have ‘em, all I said was
dialog: ‘aw go on, be big about it.'
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always
dialog: being taller than me just to spite me.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I knew it, he started it, I should have known.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Y'what?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You two have never had a quarrel in your life
dialog: and in two minutes flat he's got you at it.
text: He's a king mixer. Adam and Eve, meet the
dialog: serpent. Anthony and Cleopatra, there's your
dialog: asp. Divide and Conquer, that's this one's
dialog: motto. He hates group unity so he gets
text: everyone at it.
text: The BOYS, i.e., JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO, look at each other then at
speaker_heading: PAUL.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I suggest you just give him the photos and have
dialog: done with it.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: You're right. Here you are, old devil.
text: SHAKE and NORM leave. GRANDFATHER grins triumphantly and collects
dialog: them,
text: then with a sweet smile he turns to PAUL.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Would you ever sign this one for us, Pauly?
text: PAUL does so automatically but in the middle of signing he gets
text: suspicious. GRANDFATHER smiles at him charmingly so PAUL finishes
dialog: signing.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Come on let's get this coffee.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn
dialog: you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul
dialog: have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do
dialog: he won't respect you!
text: JOHN, RINGO and GEORGE take this up straight away. They all pretend to
text: be girls, RINGO jumps into PAUL's arms.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (coyly)
dialog: Oh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!!
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: (invitingly, in a Marlene Dietrich
dialog: voice)
dialog: If I let you have your own way, you little
dialog: rascal, will you respect me?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (choked)
dialog: I'll murder you, Grandfather!
text: JOHN waltzes PAUL down to an empty table and the lads sit down.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Eh, look at that talent.
text: They all gaze across the aisle. From their P.O.V. we see two very
text: attractive young girls, RITA and JEAN, having coffee.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Give 'em a pull.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Shall I?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate
dialog: jumps and over sort of stuff.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Now what's that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: I don't really know, but it sounded
dialog: distinguished, like, didn't it?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: George Harrison, The Scouse of Distinction.
text: We follow PAUL as he crosses over to the two girls. He places a bowler
text: on his head.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (in posh accent)
dialog: Excuse me, but these young men I'm sitting with
dialog: wondered if two of us could join you; I'd ask
dialog: you meself only I'm shy.
text: The two girls giggle together.
text: JOHN and GEORGE are about to move over when GRANDFATHER suddenly
text: appears by their sides.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (sternly)
dialog: I'm sorry, miss, but you mustn't fraternise
dialog: with my prisoners.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Prisoners!!
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
text: Convicts in transit to Wormwood Scrubs. Typical
dialog: old lags, the lot of ‘em.
speaker_heading: THE BOYS
dialog: Y'what!!!
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Quiet, you lot, or I'll give you a touch of me
text: truncheon.
dialog: (He points at Ringo)
dialog: That little one's the worst. If we don't keep
text: him on tablets he has fits.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: (protesting)
dialog: Now look here!!
text: GRANDFATHER grabs two lumps of sugar from the table and forces them
text: into RINGO'S mouth.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Get out while you can, ladies, his time's
text: coming round for one of his turns.
text: The frightened girls scurry out of the restaurant car. The boys look
dialog: in
text: amazement and horror at GRANDFATHER. They are completely
text: flabbergasted.
text: GRANDFATHER smiles at them benignly.
scene_heading: 8. INTERIOR OF RAILWAY COMPARTMENT
text: SHAKE and NORM are seated. SHAKE is buried in a science fiction book
text: NORM looks at his watch, slightly worried.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: He's been gone a long time.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: (without looking up)
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Paul's grandfather.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Down the ... er ...
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: Oh, down the ... er ...?
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Yeah, down the ... er ...
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: Well, give a couple of minutes ...
text: He resumes reading. But NORM goes on worrying.
scene_heading: 9. INTERIOR OF ANOTHER RAILWAY COMPARTMENT
text: Grandfather is in full flight of conversation with a charming elderly
text: lady, AUDREY, who is listening intently.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (proudly)
dialog: Yes, I'm their manager, I discovered them.
speaker_heading: LADY AUDREY
dialog: Did you indeed, Mr. McCartney?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Now, Audrey, I told you, the name's John. We
dialog: show biz people are a friendly lot.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Of course, John.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
text: Yes, they were playing the queues outside the
text: picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young
text: lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll.
dialog: Orphans, every Paddy's son of ‘em. I saw
dialog: their potential at once although I had me
dialog: doubts about the little fella, a savage
dialog: primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what
text: gave in first. He picked up a brick and
dialog: heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one
dialog: fierce flash of me eyes. "Mister, can you
dialog: spare us a copper?" he said. I was disarmed by
dialog: the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I
dialog: took them under me managerial banner.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: The usual ten per cent?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five;
dialog: sure aren't there four of them?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: (her eyes lighting up)
dialog: How fascinating. Do go on ...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: .+. John.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: -+. Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ...
dialog: Well, I let...
scene_heading: INTERIOR CORRIDOR OF TRAIN
text: NORM and SHAKE meet with the BOYS as they are returning from coffee.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Of course, he's concealed about me person.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: No ... he's must have slipped off somewhere.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (accusingly)
dialog: Have you lost him?
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Don't exaggerate.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You've lost him.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: Put it this way, he's mislaid him.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if
dialog: you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
text: He can't be far.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I hope he fell off.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (mildly)
dialog: Don't be callous.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's
dialog: ‘cos I'm little.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Yeah, I know, that's why I took up the drums.
dialog: It's me active compensatory factor.
text: JOHN and PAUL run down the corridor. SHAKE and NORM turn from the door
text: and go in the opposite direction, GEORGE and RINGO follow after the
dialog: other two boys.
scene_heading: INTERIOR CORRIDOR OF TRAIN
text: PAUL and JOHN look into various compartments. CLOSE SHOT of RINGO
text: looking into compartments in the manner of Groucho Marx. In one of the
text: compartments we see from RINGO'S P.O.V. the occupant, a glamorous
text: woman, TANIA, with a small lap dog.
text: She is beautifully and most expensively dressed. She looks up and sees
speaker_heading: RINGO.
text: RINGO smiles at her and she smiles back. She then beckons him to join
dialog: her.
text: He looks around to see if she means someone else. She nods a negative.
text: RINGO looks back enquiringly then points at himself as if to say:
dialog: “Who,
dialog: me?"
text: TANIA smiles enthusiastically.
text: GEORGE has been watching all this.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Are you going in?
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll
dialog: be frustrated.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You never know, you might be lucky this time.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: No, I know the psychological pattern and it
dialog: plays hell with me drum skins.
text: He blows the glamorous lady a kiss, then moves sadly on.
scene_heading: 12. INTERIOR FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR
text: PAUL enters a compartment followed by JOHN. The TWO GIRLS, RITA and
text: JEAN, from the restaurant car are sitting there.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Excuse me but have you seen that little old
dialog: man we were with?
text: The girls jump up, surprised.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We've broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it
dialog: all!
text: (he extends his hands
text: as if handcuffed)
dialog: Eh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs
dialog: are killing me. I was framed. I was innocent.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Will you stop it! Sorry to disturb you, miss...
text: He starts to drag JOHN after him.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I was innocent. I was framed. I won't go back.
text: JOHN is now by the door; he leers at the girls horribly.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I bet you can guess what I was in for.
text: He cackles like a maniac before disappearing, the door closing after
dialog: 13.
dialog: him.
text: A waiter carrying a tray with champagne and glasses on it passes into
text: one of the compartments with the blinds down.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: How about that one?
text: He moves towards the compartment.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (to Ringo and George)
dialog: Did you look in here?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or
dialog: a company director or something.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well, let's broaden our outlook.
text: PAUL opens the door of the compartment.
scene_heading: INTERIOR OF COMPARTMENT
text: From the BOYS' P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER and the elderly lady, AUDREY,
text: sipping champagne and nibbling caviar on toast.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: Congratulate me, boys, I'm engaged.
text: PAUL enters and crosses over to him.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this
dialog: time ... and who's paying for all this?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh, well that's all right.
dialog: (realising)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Young man, kindly moderate your tone when you
dialog: address my fiance.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm sorry, Missus, but the betrothal's off.
dialog: (He grabs GRANDFATHER
dialog: by the arm.)
dialog: I'll refuse me consent, he's over-age!
text: AUDREY grabs GRANDFATHER's other arm and pulls back.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Leave him alone, after all he's done for you is
dialog: this the way you repay him?
text: A tug of war now starts between PAUL and AUDREY.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (pulling)
dialog: Him? he's never done anything for anybody in
dialog: his life.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: (pulling)
dialog: You dare to say that when even those ridiculous
dialog: clothes you are wearing were bought when you
dialog: forced him to sell out his gilt edged
dialog: Indomitables!!
text: JOHN and GEORGE jump on the seat egging PAUL and AUDREY on.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
text: RINGO attempts to interfere.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Look, Missus, this is all a misunderstanding,
dialog: you see, he's ...
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Keep away from me, you depraved lout, I know
dialog: all about your terrible past.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Y'what?
text: She hits RINGO with her handbag and continues struggling with PAUL for
text: GRANDFATHER. RINGO grabs her handbag to stop her hitting him.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: He's given me a bad character, blackguarding me
dialog: name to all and sundry. He's got to be stopped.
dialog: It's not fair.
text: RINGO pushes out into the corridor, forgetting that he is holding the
text: woman's handbag.
text: A voice shouts off from outside.
speaker_heading: VOICE OFF
dialog: That's one of them ... stop thief!
scene_heading: INTERIOR CORRIDOR
text: From Ringo's P.O.V. we see down to the right the city man, JOHNSON,
text: approaching with a GUARD. RINGO turns the other way to the left when
dialog: he
text: is joined by [the] three other boys. From their P.O.V. down the
text: corridor we see the two girls, autograph books in hand, followed by
dialog: ten
text: girls from the same school.
text: Both groups are closing in on the BOYS. There's no escape.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: (looking down at the
dialog: handbag in his hand)
dialog: Oh Mother! !
scene_heading: 15. INTERIOR LUGGAGE VAN
text: Very dark, and behind bars we see GRANDFATHER. He is sitting crouched
text: up on a wooden box tea chest and looks pretty miserable. He turns
text: towards the CAMERA; in the foreground of the SHOT we see PAUL
dialog: standing.
text: In the background an impassive GUARD is reading a paper which he does
text: throughout the scene.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: And to think me own grandson would have let
dialog: them put me behind bars!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Don't dramatise.
text: The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see GRANDFATHER in the luggage
dialog: compartment
text: of the guards' van. In with him are a crate of chickens and a dog. The
text: chickens peck at him; GRANDFATHER moves listlessly away.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Let's face it, you're lucky to be here. If
dialog: they'd have had their way you'd have been
text: dropped off at Stafford already.
text: GRANDFATHER proudly turns away from PAUL who dodges round so he can
text: still see his face.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well, you've got to admit you've upset a lot of
dialog: people. At least I can keep my eye on you while
dialog: you're stuck in here.
text: GRANDFATHER turns away again.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's
dialog: very upset, you know ... and as far as your
dialog: girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's
text: finished with men for the rest of her natural,
dialog: and another thing ...
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have
dialog: any sense of humour left these days.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls
dialog: were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I
dialog: mean, why do you do these things?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (cutting in)
dialog: You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah ... so what?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Why do you always use your left hand?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got
dialog: to.
text: PAUL grins. After a moment of looking at him, PAUL opens the door of
text: the luggage compartment and joins GRANDFATHER on a box.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Shove up!
text: GRANDFATHER produces a penny.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Odds or evens?
text: PAUL sighs.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Odds.
text: GRANDFATHER flips the coin.
text: The guards' van door opens and JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO come in, with
text: them are the girls, RITA and JEAN.
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: (as he sees PAUL behind the bars)
dialog: Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best
dialog: lawyer trading stamps can buy.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.
dialog: 16.
dialog: nearer
dialog: 17.
dialog: 18.
dialog: (to Ringo)
dialog: Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Me? Why?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Bag-snatcher.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas
dialog: corpus.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (casually)
dialog: Every morning.
text: JOHN has been looking around the guards' van.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it?
dialog: Funny...
dialog: (he pats the dog)
dialog: ‘cos they usually reckon dogs more than people
dialog: in England, don't they? You'd expect something
text: a little more palatial.
dialog: (he shudders)
dialog: Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do
dialog: something, then.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Well, I've got me gob stopper.
dialog: (he produces his mouth organ.)
text: Look, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at
dialog: Dagenham.
text: And to RINGO's beat on a tea chest they are off, PAUL and GEORGE
text: improvising other sounds, much to the GIRLS' delight. During the
text: number, GRANDFATHER quietly lets the latch off the chicken crate and
text: chickens begin to wander through the scene.
scene_heading: EXTERIOR TRAIN IN MOTION FROM ABOVE (NIGHT)
dialog: 
text: While the number is progressing, the train is getting nearer and
dialog: to London.
scene_heading: EXTERIOR PLATFORM TERMINUS (NIGHT)
text: SHOTS of the station full of GIRLS waiting for the BOYS.
scene_heading: INTERIOR GUARDS VAN
text: By the time the number finishes the train pulls up with a sharp halt
dialog: 19.
dialog: 20.
text: that sends them all sprawling, BOYS and GIRLS.
text: NORM enters the guards' van.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out
text: there. The whole place is surging with girls.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Please, can I have one to surge with?
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Ah, go on, you swine.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: No, you can't. Look, as soon as I tell you, run
dialog: through this door here and into the big car
dialog: that's waiting.
text: He points and we see a big car parked across the road.
text: The BOYS prepare to depart, lining up with GRANDFATHER at the door
scene_heading: EXTERIOR PLATFORM TERMINUS
text: Just as they are ready to go, a line of taxis draws up parallel to the
text: train and now separates them from the big car waiting for them.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Oh no!
text: GRANDFATHER pushes past the BOYS, holding his coat closed.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: All right, lads, follow me.
text: And before NORM can stop him, he darts out of the door, PAUL after
text: The fans further down the platform see PAUL and charge forward ... in
text: panic NORM and the others follow, JOHN just having time to kiss both
dialog: the girls.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Vive l'amour!
text: NORM drags him away.
scene_heading: EXTERIOR RAILWAY STATION
text: The BOYS manage to follow GRANDFATHER by leaping onto a motorized
text: luggage carrier, GEORGE driving and the other three posing as a frozen
text: tableau on the back. GRANDFATHER has arrived at a taxi door. He flings
text: it open and runs through, opening the other door, thus making a safe
dialog: 21.
dialog: 22.
dialog: off.
dialog: hotel
dialog: 23.
dialog: is
dialog: room.
dialog: the
text: bridge to the car.
text: The BOYS follow and manage to make it to the big car safely. They run
text: towards grandfather's taxi. The FANS have followed the BOYS and we see
text: streams of GIRLS piling through all the taxis one of which contains
text: JOHNSON the city man, opening and shutting the doors to get through,
text: much to the indignation of the TAXI DRIVERS.
scene_heading: INTERIOR BIG CAR
text: NORM is sitting in front with the driver, FRANK. The four BOYS and
text: GRANDFATHER are squashed together in the back.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: (to the driver)
dialog: Go like the clappers, son!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (smoothly)
dialog: That was my entire intention, sir.
scene_heading: EXTERIOR STATION
text: The car moves off surrounded by the FANS; from a height we see them
text: converge on the car but it moves forcefully out of the station and
text: It moves into the traffic in the main road and the journey to the
text: begins.
scene_heading: INTERIOR HOTEL SUITE NIGHT
text: There is a reception room and off it lead rooms that are presumably
text: bedrooms, bathroom, etc. JOHN is lying sprawled out on a settee
text: listening to a transistor radio, demolishing a basket of fruit. PAUL
text: sitting at an upright piano and GRANDFATHER is mooching about the
text: One of the doors opens and GEORGE enters followed by RINGO, none of
text: BOYS are wearing coats.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: I don't snore.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You do - repeatedly.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: (to John)
dialog: Do I snore?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (eating a banana)
dialog: You're a window rattler, son.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore,
dialog: Paul?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (stopping playing)
dialog: With a trombone hooter like yours it'd be
dialog: unnatural if you didn't.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Well, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He
dialog: can't help having a horrible great nose, it's
dialog: the only one he's got. And his poor little
text: head's trembling under the weight of it.
text: NORM enters with three piles of fan mail and places them in front of
text: JOHN on a table. RINGO is almost in tears, examining his nose in a
dialog: mirror.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Paul, John, George - get at it.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Hello the income tax have caught up with us at
dialog: last.
text: PAUL and GEORGE gather round the low table. RINGO is left out of it.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: None for me, then?
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Sorry.
text: John hands RINGO a single envelope.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That'll keep you busy.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: It's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way.
dialog: Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a
dialog: nose...
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: You go and pick on your own.
text: SHAKE enters with a stack of mail about three times larger than all
dialog: the
text: others put together.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Is that yours?
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: For Ringo.
text: He dumps it in Ringo's arms who staggers into an armchair. The BOYS
dialog: send him up.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That must have cost you a fortune in stamps,
dialog: Ringo.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: He comes from a large family.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: (dumping the letters)
dialog: Well.
text: RINGO opens his letter and reads it. It contains a large embossed
dialog: card.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Eh, what's Boyd's Club?
text: The lads gather round him and PAUL takes the card from him and reads.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: “The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in
dialog: requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey
dialog: that's you, in their recently refinished gaming
text: rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and
dialog: Champagne Buffet." Blimey!
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: And they want me?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: (snatching the card
dialog: Well you're not going.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Ah.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (taking card from Norm)
dialog: Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of
dialog: easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches
dialog: and cornets of caviar, disgusting!
text: He pockets the card himself.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: That's mine.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Have done, and you lot get your pens out.
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: It's homework time for all you college
dialog: puddings. I want this lot
dialog: (he indicates the fan letters
dialog: all answered tonight.
text: The BOYS all protest.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: I'll brook no denial!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen
dialog: in your foot, you swine.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Come on, Shake, we'll leave ‘em to their
dialog: penmanship.
text: He goes followed by SHAKE.
text: There is a pause and JOHN deliberately rises slowly and crosses to his
text: coat. He puts it on and walks to the door.
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: While the swine's away the piglets can play.
dialog: Well, come on, what are we waiting for?
text: With a whoop PAUL, GEORGE and RINGO collect their coats and head for
text: the door.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: What about all these letters?
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: Read ‘em!
text: They disappear. After a moment GRANDFATHER takes out Ringo's card.
scene_heading: C.U. GRANDFATHER
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: And a free champagne buffet.
text: He grins to himself. At this moment a WAITER enters with a tray. He is
text: clad in tails and GRANDFATHER eyes them longingly, measuring himself
text: the while alongside the startled waiter. He leaves us with no doubt in
dialog: our minds what he wants, i.e., the waiter's suit
scene_heading: 24. INTERIOR DANCING CLUB NIGHT
text: The club is the latest in modern decor and full of teenagers all
text: enjoying themselves. The CAMERA wanders around the club till it
dialog: finally
text: picks out JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE and RINGO all crowded around one small
text: table. The music is blaring away from a juke box and the BOYS join the
text: dancers. They are recognised and given smiles and nods of
dialog: encouragement
dialog: by all the other customers. During this scene we
speaker_heading: CUT AWAY
scene_heading: 25. INTERIOR BOYD'S CLUB NIGHT
text: The whole atmosphere is of quiet elegance and loud wealth. Around the
text: baccarat table the rich, bored customers sit barely moving a face
text: muscle as they languidly murmur "suivez" and "banco" to the dealer as
text: he operates the shoe. The manager of the club is beaming with
text: satisfaction as he surveys his customers. One of these customers is
text: clad in evening dress and he has his back to us. The rest of the
text: players (male) are in suits. By each of them is standing a lush lady
text: with a bored sophisticated face that looks as if it has been painted
text: on. From the REVERSE of the LAST SHOT we now see the solitary evening
text: dress player is GRANDFATHER. He looks around him and wipes off his
dialog: look
text: of enjoyment and elaborately out-bores everyone in the room.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: Alors, M'sieur?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (nonchalant)
dialog: Souflée.
text: He turns to the buxom BLONDE, who is dripping over him.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: I bet you're a great swimmer. My turn? Bingo!
speaker_heading: CROUPIER
dialog: Pas "Bingo," M'sieur... Banco.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (taking)
dialog: I'll take the little darlings anyway.
text: He takes up the cards and can't understand that they are unnumbered.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Two and one is three, carry one is four.
text: The buxom BLONDE leans over him.
speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: Lay them down.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (disturbed by his eyeline)
dialog: Eh?
speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: Lay them down.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: We'd be thrown out.
speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: Your cards... lay them down... face up.
text: He does so.
speaker_heading: CROUPIER
dialog: Huit a la pointe... et sept.
text: (He pushes chips and box to Grandfather.)
speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: You had a lovely little pair, y'see.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: I dia?
text: CROUPIER taps impatiently on box (shoe).
speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: They're yours.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: They are?
speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: The cards... you're bank.
scene_heading: 26. INTERIOR DANCING CLUB
text: The BOYS are having a rare old time and the place is really moving.
scene_heading: 27. INTERIOR BOYD'S CLUB
text: GRANDFATHER is playing and a waiter is checking the requirements of

dialog: rest.
text: A little light refreshment.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (lordly)
text: A glass of the old chablis to wash down a
dialog: gesture of giblets wouldn't go amiss.
text: (He resumes his game.)
dialog: Souflée, chop chop.
text: The CROUPIER uses the spatula to pick up a card. GRANDFATHER grabs it
text: and scoops some sandwiches off a passing tray.
scene_heading: INTERIOR DANCING CLUB
text: The BOYS are at their table again laughing and enjoying themselves,
text: when suddenly their faces freeze.
text: From their P.0.V. we see NORM standing glowering down at them. With
text: is SHAKE. Reluctantly the BOYS arise and follow NORM out.
scene_heading: INTERIOR BOYD'S
text: GRANDFATHER is looking worried at the call of the card he loses and we
text: see that all his chips have gone. He notices the waiter delivering
text: snacks and champagne to a couple, so quick as a flash, he places a
text: handkerchief over his arm and writing a bill out on a piece of paper,
text: presents it to the couple and collects payment in chips. He then
text: resumes playing.
scene_heading: INTERIOR HOTEL ROOM
text: Waiter is sitting on chair in underclothes, reading. He hears a noise,
text: says "The manager!" and hides in outer clothes closet. NORM and the
dialog: BOYS enter saying:
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Now get on with it.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We were going to do it.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Aye, well, now!
dialog: (He goes through bedroom.)
text: RINGO goes to hang up coat in closet. He does so, then crosses to
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Any of you lot put a man in that cupboard?
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: A man? No.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Well somebody did.
text: GEORGE goes to cupboard. We see the WAITER from his P.O.V. He closes
text: door, returns to group.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: He's right, y'know.
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: (disinterested)
dialog: Ah well, there you go.
text: SHAKE enters front door, goes to hang up coat and drags WAITER out.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: Eh, what's all this?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh, him... He's been lurking.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Aye, he looks a right lurker.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: (to WAITER)
dialog: You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: The old gentlemen borrowed them to go gambling
dialog: at Boyd's.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (turning on Ringo)
dialog: Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to
text: gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of
text: an orgy by now.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Well, what are we waiting for?
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours
dialog: is worse than any of you lot.
scene_heading: 31. INTERIOR BOYD'S
text: GRANDFATHER is drinking champagne in locked arms with BLONDE.
speaker_heading: WAITER

speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Yes, and I'll have some more champagne as well.

speaker_heading: MANAGER

dialog: Lord John McCartney, he's the millionaire Irish
dialog: Peer, filthy rich of course.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: Oh I don't know, looks rather clean to me.

dialog: Play is about to resume, m'lord.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (handing him a chip)
dialog: Lead me to it, I've a winning itch that only
dialog: success can pacify.

text: moves away from the table towards the club reception desk.
scene_heading: 32. INTERIOR RECEPTION DESK BOYD'S CLUB
text: JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO, NORM and SHAKE are trying to gain entrance.

scene_heading: PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO, JOHN
dialog: I've got to get in.
dialog: It's urgent and important.
dialog: I've had an invite.
dialog: Take me to your leader.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Shurrup.
text: The BOYS do and meanwhile the MANAGER has walked into SHOT. He
text: recognises the BOYS and welcomes them with false enthusiasm. They all
text: start to enter the main room.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: All we want to know is have you got a little

speaker_heading: MANAGER

speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them
dialog: before in my life! ... (etc.)
text: They grab the protesting GRANDFATHER and drag him into the reception
text: area. He keeps trying to return to BLONDE and table. GEORGE and RINGO
text: each take an end of the velvet cord hanging between the two
text: stanchions.
text: They exchange ends and re-hook it, thus encircling GRANDFATHER by the
text: entrance desk. They then go to settle up.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: (with false charm)
dialog: Before you go, gentlemen, there's the small
dialog: matter of the bill.
text: He snaps his fingers and a waiter hands him the bill.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: (taking it)
dialog: I'll settle that.
text: He glances at it.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: A hundred and eighty pounds!
speaker_heading: MANAGER

text: At that moment a WAITER appears with a tray full of pound notes.
speaker_heading: WAITER

dialog: Aah, shurrup, misery!
text: JOHN slouches forward.
speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Sorry?

speaker_heading: GEORGE

text: RINGO and PAUL jump out of the car. RINGO takes two drumsticks from

text: into the radiator grill (V.0. "Ole" from the BOYS). PAUL, then, using
text: his coat as a matador's cloak, does a butterfly pass at the car which
text: has just started up, narrowly missing him, but he keeps in the matador
dialog: position.
speaker_heading: INTERIOR CAR
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of
dialog: 36.
dialog: 37.
dialog: 38.
dialog: school kids. I knew this was going to happen
dialog: one day.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (as Ringo and Paul climb in)
dialog: Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your
dialog: breakfast, you cannibal.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (to Norm)
dialog: We're nearly there, sir.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough
text: delusions of power as it is.
text: CLOSE SHOT of a long suffering NORM.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: And I was happy in the bakery. I'll never know
dialog: why I left.
scene_heading: EXTERIOR OF AN OLD VICTORIAN MUSIC HALL THEATRE
dialog: 
text: Which has been converted to the T.V. studios.
dialog: 
text: There are a few groups of GIRL FANS standing outside the front of the
text: theatre, but against the kerb of the pavement is a night-watchman's
text: canvas hut and brazier.
text: The car approaches.
scene_heading: INTERIOR OF THE CAR
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Get ready John, open the door and as it draws
dialog: up, out you go and straight in.
text: JOHN nods and opens the door. The FANS start to swarm ‘round them. To
text: escape, the BOYS dash into the night-watchman's canvas hut, pick it up
text: and run with it to the stage door, revealing the night-watchman,
text: staring in astonishment.
text: At the door the BOYS put the hut down and enter the theatre.
scene_heading: INTERIOR STAGE DOOR ENTRANCE
text: As the BOYS enter, two P.R.O. men in dark suits, stiff white collars
text: and old school ties step forward and smile menacingly.
scene_heading: FIRST P.R.O. MAN
dialog: (menacingly)
dialog: Press conference, they're waiting for you.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: (jovially)
dialog: Give us a couple of shakes to get our breath.
dialog: 39.
dialog: and
dialog: of
dialog: is
scene_heading: FIRST P.R.O. MAN
dialog: (more menacingly)
dialog: They're waiting now!
text: And without more ado they grab an arm each and march the protesting
text: NORM towards the stairs that lead to the dress circle.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Eh this lot means it. They're even taking
dialog: hostages.
text: The BOYS, SHAKE and GRANDFATHER rush after the rapidly disappearing
text: NORM, who by now is half way up the stairs.
scene_heading: INTERIOR OF DRESS CIRCLE LOUNGE BALLROOM
dialog: 
text: It is empty except for two barmaids poised ready to serve, standing
text: behind trestle tables full of drinks and sandwiches. The dark suited
text: MEN enter with NORM and close behind them follow GRANDFATHER, SHAKE
text: the boys. The group arrives at the centre of the lounge and have time
text: to look about and see the food but before they can get to it, from all
text: directions NEWSPAPERMEN and PHOTOGRAPHERS converge upon them.
text: Now begins an elaborate tug-of-war between various PHOTOGRAPHERS using
text: their flash attachments and REPORTERS to capture a Beatle and in the
text: midst of this running battle a man with a portable recorder is trying
text: to interview them. Together and singly the BOYS are pushed about the
text: room and while this goes on a hard core of NEWSPAPERMEN are busily
text: devouring sandwiches and pouring themselves drinks, to the annoyance
text: the BARMAIDS.
text: Every time one of the BOYS attempts to get a sandwich or a drink, it
text: either too late, the plate is empty, or they are intercepted. The
text: single and constant thing we see in the scene is the pushing and
dialog: pulling, heavy impersonal handling, the boys are just things to be
text: placed like still life in one advantageous position after another.
text: During the scene these individual exchanges take place:
speaker_heading: SOUND REPORTER
dialog: What's your philosophy of life?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I'm torn between Zen and I'm all right, Jack.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Has success changed your life?
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Do you like playing the guitar?
dialog: out
dialog: 40.
dialog: put
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: Next to kissing girls it's favourites.
text: PAUL is surrounded by newspapermen.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No, actually, we're just good friends.
text: HIGH SHOT of the press reception and we see the BOYS ease their way
text: until they get to the curtained entrance to the dress circle;
text: completely unnoticed, they slip through.
scene_heading: INTERIOR THEATRE DRESS CIRCLE
text: The BOYS come up the stairs into the Dress Circle proper. GRANDFATHER
text: and SHAKE are sitting there having a picnic of beer and sandwiches.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (ironically)
dialog: Anything to spare?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write
dialog: us your John Henry on this picture.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Sure.
dialog: (He does so).
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Ah well. Eh, look!
text: He points, and from PAUL'S P.O.V. we see on stage, the setting up of
text: the show, scenery and lights, cameras and sound equipment are being
text: into position by a small army of studio staff. DANCERS and SINGERS are
text: milling about as well.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Let's go and muck in.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Aye, before anyone stops us.
text: They exit to rows of the dress circle and go through the entrance down
text: the narrow stairs to the stalls and on to the stage that is built and
text: extended right into the stalls, which are partly covered up.
scene_heading: INTERIOR STAGE
text: Everyone is so busy that they hardly notice the BOYS, who wander about
text: and examine the studio equipment. A load of three drum sets are being
text: brought on stage and a voice shouts out:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Here, what about these electric guitars?
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: Where are they?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Back here, mate.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: (going towards the voice)
dialog: I'm coming.
text: RINGO is busy setting up his drums, and men are setting up the other
text: sets. He drops a stick and the FLOOR MANAGER retrieves it and is about
text: to tap the drum. The FLOOR MANAGER is a languid young man.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Leave them drums alone.
speaker_heading: FLOOR MANAGER
dialog: Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm
text: out on strike.
speaker_heading: FLOOR MANAGER
dialog: Aren't you being rather arbitrary?
speaker_heading: RINGO
text: That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of
dialog: bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing
dialog: about with your ear-phones, do 1?
speaker_heading: FLOOR MANAGER
dialog: Spoil sport!
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Well!
text: RINGO fusses like a mother hen clucking over his drums. The FLOOR
text: MANAGER is furious.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: He's very touchy about those his drums, they
text: loom large in his legend.
text: RINGO gives his drums a defiant crash and JOHN and PAUL stop whatever
text: they are up to and hurry over.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What's up?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (pointing)
text: He's sulking again.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: are
dialog: 42.
dialog: the
dialog: I'll show him.
text: He picks up a set of drum sticks and bashes back at RINGO, who does a
text: more complicated drum roll. GEORGE now joins in and to PAUL'S
text: encouragement a drum duel starts completely naturally and improvised.
text: During this encounter the work proceeds around them and the guitars
text: brought on and SHAKE sets them to working order. PAUL first, then JOHN
text: and GEORGE take up their own instruments and out of the drum duel
text: emerges one of their numbers.
speaker_heading: INTERIOR RAMP
text: As the number finishes a baldheaded man (he is the T.V. director)
text: storms down the ramp that leads from the control box under the dress
dialog: circle.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: (with over-exaggerated calm)
dialog: All right I'm sorry and let's hear no more about
dialog: it. If that's your opinion, you're probably
dialog: right. Look, if you think I'm unsuitable let's
dialog: have it out in the open, I can't stand these
dialog: back-stage politics.
text: By the end of this speech he is standing in front of JOHN who takes
text: scene in his stride.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Aren't you tending to black and white this
dialog: whole situation?
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Well, quite honestly I wasn't expecting "a
dialog: musical arranger" who would question my
dialog: ability ... picture-wise.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: I could listen to him for hours.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Heave to, what's all this about a musical
dialog: arranger?
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Mr. McCartney Senior!
text: The BOYS have a giggle at the very idea and at this moment GRANDFATHER
text: appears from behind the DIRECTOR.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Hey Pauly, they're trying to fob you off wid
dialog: this musical charlatan but I've given him the
dialog: test.
dialog: away
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: (bravely)
dialog: I'm quite happy to be replaced.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (indicating the director)
dialog: He's a typical buck-passer.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: I won an award.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: A likely story.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
text: It's on the wall in my office.
text: At this moment NORM comes on the stage, confident, cigar in mouth and
text: serene.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Hello our lot, everyone happy?
text: The BOYS, the DIRECTOR, FLOOR MANAGER and GRANDFATHER turn on him and
text: stare silently.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: All right, all right. If you don't need this
dialog: lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till
dialog: you do.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen
dialog: minutes. Thank you.
text: He glares at GRANDFATHER who glares right back. The DIRECTOR walks
text: with the FLOOR MANAGER pacifying him.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Give me a bottle of milk and a packet of
dialog: Oblivion. Oh, it's a plot, I see it now, it's
text: all a plot.
text: They go left towards the back-stage.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: (producing key)
dialog: Now, come on, I've got the key.
text: He leads the lads off right. RINGO is last as he is putting his drum
text: sticks down safely.
text: NORM and the BOYS turn on him.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Let's have you.
dialog: sound
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Come on speedy!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Ringo!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Wake up!
text: RINGO glares at them and follows quickly. As the BOYS move off after
text: NORM, they pass the next act waiting for rehearsal. It is an elegant
text: man in full-tail suit meticulously adjusting his cuff-links. Beside
text: is a free-standing sign reading "Leslie Jackson and his ten
text: disappearing doves." The BOYS pass him and go through the door.
text: GRANDFATHER stops and looks at the performer with respect.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed your act.
text: He slaps the man on the back with happy camaraderie. There is the
text: of a dove, a few feathers fall out of the sleeve of the man's coat and
text: he and GRANDFATHER look down at the floor. The man glares at
text: GRANDFATHER, takes out a pen from his pocket, crosses out "10" on his
text: sign, and writes "9" in its place, puts the pen back in his pocket and
text: starts towards the centre stage putting on a false performer's smile
dialog: 
dialog: he does.
scene_heading: INTERIOR THEATRE BACK-STAGE CORRIDOR
text: The BOYS move down the narrow stairs, and out of the ground floor
text: dressing rooms stream a steady flow of costumed actors and actresses.
text: They engulf the lads and force them against the wall -- the actors are
text: all making for the stage door. As the actors push past the boys we see
text: the boys' excited faces, their mouths watering for the costumes. JOHN
text: touches the costume on one actor.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (to actor)
dialog: Gear costume!
speaker_heading: ACTOR
dialog: (eyeing him)
dialog: Swap?
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Right, first floor and no messing about.
text: NORM, leading the way, goes up the stairs but as they turn the first
text: corner they are confronted by a group of girls, a game of manners
text: starts, "after you," "No, after you." NORM who is ahead of the group
text: looks down on them in disgust.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: 44,
dialog: looking
dialog: 45.
dialog: shows.
dialog: step
dialog: out
dialog: Lennon, leave them girls alone or I'll report
dialog: you.
text: The BOYS let the GIRLS pass and resume the journey, always surrounded
dialog: by people.
scene_heading: INTERIOR DRESSING ROOM AND CORRIDOR
text: RINGO'S attention is caught by a door. He crosses and opens it,
text: out to a fire escape. The others join him and the four boys step
text: through the door and onto the fire escape.
scene_heading: EXTERIOR TOP OF FIRE ESCAPE
text: From the BOYS' P.O.V. we see down below into the property yard behind
text: the theatre. It is a long narrow yard full of old coaches, motor cars
text: and all the general debris of hundreds of sets from past theatre
text: Through the piles of heaped high junk there are a couple of narrow
text: alleyways.
text: The BOYS scamper down the fire escape.
text: When they reach the bottom of the alleyways, there is a large door.
text: They open it and look through.
text: From their P.0.V. we see a large green field quite empty. The boys
text: through the doorway into the field. We now see from a HELICOPTER SHOT
text: the four BOYS standing together surrounded by space.
text: It is the first time they have been alone and unconfined all day.
text: They look at each other and grin ... then first GEORGE and PAUL let
text: a whoop and run towards the centre of the field, after a moment JOHN
text: and RINGO follow them. The BOYS pick up some loose straw and insert it
text: under JOHN'S cap and sleeves, turning him into a scarecrow.
text: The four BOYS dash about madly calling out to one another and
dialog: generally
dialog: them.
text: horsing around. Out of this emerges an imaginary game of soccer and
text: although there is no ball the game is fast and furious. After a few
text: moments the long shadow of a man falls across the grass.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: (off)
dialog: I suppose you know this is private property.
text: The boys freeze.
text: From their P.0.V. we see a big burly middle-aged man glowering at
text: The boys exchange rueful glances and, under the big man's eye, mooch
text: back towards the gateway they came in by. JOHN is the last to go
text: through. He turns to the man.
dialog: 46.
dialog: 47.
dialog: someone
dialog: 48.
dialog: each
dialog: leading
dialog: 48a.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Sorry if we hurt your field, Mister.
scene_heading: INTERIOR CORRIDOR BACK-STAGE
text: GRANDFATHER is sneaking down the corridor, a pile of photos under his
dialog: arm.
scene_heading: INTERIOR T.V. THEATRE UNDERNEATH THE STAGE
dialog: 
text: Under the stage the usual set of wooden columns that support the stage
text: with lots of furniture and a single light is on; it is placed by the
text: orchestra's entrance to the orchestra pit. GRANDFATHER comes down the
text: stairs and winds his way through the columns until he finds himself a
text: safe little cubby hole and settles himself under the light. He spreads
text: the signed photos of the BOYS in front of him and, adjusting an old-
text: fashioned pair of glasses, ball-point pen in hand begins to copy the
text: BOYS' signatures on to the fresh photos, tutting at his failures and
text: chuckling at his successes. After a moment, there is a sound of
text: coming down the stairs. GRANDFATHER darts into a dark patch out of
dialog: sight.
text: The menacing shadows appear on the stairway.
speaker_heading: NORM (voice off)
dialog: There's no one here.
dialog: SHAKE (voice off)
dialog: This is the only way they could have gone.
text: We now see GRANDFATHER holding himself stiffly in, he is on some sort
text: of raised platform and he fidgets and in doing so he knocks a lever of
text: some sort. Slowly GRANDFATHER ascends out of shot with a light that
text: grows bigger above him.
scene_heading: INTERIOR T.V. THEATRE STAGE
text: A rehearsal of the toast scene from a Strauss Operetta. The entire
text: stage is full of SINGERS, glasses in hand they are singing away at
text: other but in true opera tradition they are addressing out to the
text: audience. Slowly in-between the leading man and leading woman, who are
text: about to embrace, a stage trap opens and a blinking, surprised,
text: GRANDFATHER appears. Here we INTERCUT to the T.V. Control Room for
text: amazed reaction shots of the DIRECTOR and control room CREW.
text: Back now on the stage the toast song reaches its climax and the
text: man and woman rush into each other's arms, GRANDFATHER sandwiched
dialog: between them.
text: INTERIOR CORRIDOR AS BOYS PASS THRU ON WAY TO DRESSING ROOM
dialog: 
text: JOHN is behind them. JOHN, BOYS and MILLIE are walking towards each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: (as all pass)
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (stopping... the boys
text: carry on past, not noticing
dialog: her)
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: No, not me.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: (insistently)
dialog: Oh you are, I know you are.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: No, I'm not.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: You are.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I'm not, no.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Well, you look like him.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Oh you do, look.
text: JOHN looks at himself in the mirror.
text: JOHN examines himself in the mirror carefully.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: My eyes are lighter.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: (agreeing)
dialog: Oh yes.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: And my nose...
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Well, yes your nose is. Very.
dialog: 49,
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Is it?
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: I would have said so.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Aye, but you know him well.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: (indignantly)
dialog: No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (knowingly)
dialog: That's what you tell me.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: (suspiciously)
dialog: What have you heard?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (blandly)
dialog: It's all over the place, everyone knows.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Is it? Is it really?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't
dialog: have it.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: I knew I could rely on you.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (modestly)
dialog: Thanks.
text: MILLIE touches his arm then walks away. After a moment she turns.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: You don't look like him at all.
text: JOHN winks at her and she winks back.
scene_heading: INTERIOR DRESSING ROOM
text: NORM and SHAKE enter the room. The BOYS' TAILOR is there waiting for
speaker_heading: the BOYS.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: Oh they've probably gone to the canteen, cup
dialog: of tea, like.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: That's too easy for Lennon.
text: He crosses to door leading to fire escape.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: (dramatically)
text: He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just
dialog: to upset me.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: You're imagining it. You're letting things
dialog: prey on your mind.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between
dialog: John and me.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: But John hasn't got any.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: Nerves.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: I know, that's the trouble.
text: He puffs nervously at his cigarette.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Oh, I've toyed with the idea of a ball and
dialog: chain but he'd only rattle them at me... and
dialog: in public and all. Sometimes I think he enjoys
dialog: seeing me suffer.
text: He hears something.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Get behind that door, they're coming. Someone's
dialog: coming. Quick, hide!
text: The two men hide behind the door. The boys enter the room,
text: last he shuts the door and faces SHAKE and NORM.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What are you doing there?
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: Hiding.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I think you're soft or something.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: We weren't hiding.
speaker_heading: as JOHN is
speaker_heading: TAILOR
dialog: Now?
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Now. We were trying to catch you redhanded. I
dialog: thought I told you lot to stay here?
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Well ...
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: When I tell you to stay put, stay put.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (down on his knees)
dialog: Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting
dialog: for you in the studio.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Good lad, Ringo.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You crawler.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: He's betrayed the class.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Oh, leave off!!!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Temper! Temper!
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Well ...
text: CLOSE-UP on NORM's long suffering face.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Will you all get a move on! They're waiting for
dialog: you!
text: By this time the TAILOR has his tape stretched between his hands to
text: measure GEORGE's shoulders. But since GEORGE has moved away, he is
text: measuring space. JOHN takes up his scissors and cuts the tape.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: 50.
dialog: towards
dialog: still
speaker_heading: THREE
dialog: 51.
dialog: I now declare this bridge open.
text: The BOYS run out the door.
scene_heading: INTERIOR BACKSTAGE AREA
text: Five beautiful MODELS are standing about in costume. One is knitting a
text: loose wool sweater which is almost completed. There is the sound of a
text: juggling act's music off and a few of the girls are looking off
text: the centre stage. At the edge of frame is a collapsible table covered
text: with green baize. On it are three spaced white plates.
text: From the door off stage, above which is a sign "To Canteen and
text: Production Offices", GRANDFATHER enters eating a plate of spaghetti on
text: toast. The knitting GIRL sees him and, in mime, asks him to stand
text: so that she can measure the sweater against him. GRANDFATHER, eager to
text: help, puts his plate of food on the green table between plates two and
text: three. He goes to be measured with the sweater.
text: From the onstage area, a juggler's ASSISTANT (pretty girl) in costume
text: backs up and with the usual theatrical flourishes picks up, without
text: looking, plate number ONE and throws it off screen towards centre
text: stage. There is a drum roll from orchestra. She then throws plate
text: number TWO. We CUT on stage to the JUGGLER now balancing the two
text: spinning plates on two poles, one in each hand. He has another pole in
text: his mouth and nods to his ASSISTANT, asking for the THIRD plate.
text: We CUT BACK to the ASSISTANT who, still not looking, throws plate
text: which is GRANDFATHER's. There is the sound of an orchestra raggedly
text: stopping and all the hangers-on in the scene look off interestedly.
text: We hear the DIRECTOR's voice.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR (V.0.)
dialog: All right, hold it, hold it... O.K. John, wipe
dialog: him down and we'll carry on with the next act.
dialog: We
speaker_heading: CUT TO
text: centre stage. The JUGGLER is as before but the spaghetti is covering
text: his head, having slipped off the third plate.
text: The FLOOR MANAGER is bustling around, trying to help.
text: We CUT BACK to back-stage. GRANDFATHER has finished being measured and
text: goes to the green table where he put his plate down. He picks up the
text: only remaining plate, looks at it, wondering where his food has gone,
text: shrugs and heads back towards the exit door as we hear the DIRECTOR's
speaker_heading: VOICE.
scene_heading: INTERIOR T.V. STUDIO FLOOR
dialog: mutter
text: CLOSE-UP on the distraught DIRECTOR.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Where are they? I said, where are they? Where
dialog: are they?
speaker_heading: FLOOR MANAGER
dialog: (placating)
dialog: They're coming, I promise you.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: (fiercely)
dialog: Now look, if they're not here on this floor in
dialog: thirty seconds there's going to be trouble ...
dialog: understand me ... trouble!!!
text: Two STAGE HANDS are walking disinterestedly past, they look at the
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR.
speaker_heading: lst STAGE HAND
dialog: What's he on about, Taff?
scene_heading: WELSH STAGE HAND
dialog: Well ... he's being the director. Of course, he
text: lives in a world of his own, mind.
text: At this moment the boys, NORM, SHAKE and GRANDFATHER appear. The BOYS
text: grab their instruments and prepare to play.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (to the director)
dialog: Standing about, eh? Some people have it dead
dialog: easy, don't they?
text: The director is about to blow his top but manages to hold on and
text: to the heavens.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Of course, once you're over thirty, you're
dialog: finished. It's a young man's medium and I just
dialog: can't take the pace.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Are you as young as that, then?
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: Shurrup!
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little
dialog: fellas.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (to Shake)
text: Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room
dialog: 52.
dialog: or something and keep your eye on him, will
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (threateningly)
dialog: I'll set John on you!
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: (hastily)
dialog: Oh, anything you say, Paul.
text: He leads GRANDFATHER away.
text: The BOYS are placed in position, instruments ready. The boom moves in
text: near them. There is a mike hovering just over JOHN'S head. JOHN starts
text: attacking it.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR'S VOICE (over Tannoy
text: Run through the number and try not to jiggle
dialog: out of your positions.
text: The BOYS start the number, as the stage hands adjust their settings.
text: When they've finished, they stand about spare.
scene_heading: INTERIOR T.V. CONTROL ROOM
text: The room is crowded with the usual personnel, P.A., elecs, racks,
dialog: etc.... make-up supervisor and wardrobe mistress.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: That was more or less all right for me. I'll give
text: them one more run through then leave them alone

dialog: (to make-up woman)
dialog: Oh how about make-up?
speaker_heading: MAKE-UP WOMAN
dialog: Not really, they don't need it any. We'll just
dialog: powder them off for shine.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Good. Norm, get them along to make-up will you?
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: (rising)
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: (looking into the monitor)
dialog: And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
text: From the director's P.0.V. we see into the monitor. The boys crowding

dialog: (to Ringo)
dialog: What's the matter with you? You were bashing
text: away like a madman.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: (briefly)
dialog: You were twanging too loud.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: How'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving
dialog: you a clout right in the middle of your solo?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You're getting out of hand. I don't know what's
dialog: come over you today.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: That's right. It's always me, isn't it?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Since you ask, yes.
dialog: (he laughs)
dialog: Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.
text: He puts his arm around Ringo's shoulder.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Well!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: He'll get over it.
text: NORM appears down the ramp speaking as he approaches.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: All right, our lot, make-up.]
scene_heading: INTERIOR MAKE UP ROOM
text: A smallish room with a line of chairs facing a wall mirror and a long
text: table. Each place is clearly marked and above each mirror a girl's
dialog: name: Betty, Angela, Deirdre, Jenny.
text: SHAKE and GRANDFATHER are sitting in splendid isolation. They are
text: staring each other out.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: You blinked!
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: I never did, you did.
text: The BOYS enter.
dialog: boys
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a
text: sulk.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the
dialog: champ here.
text: He indicates RINGO who ignores him.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Stop picking on him.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Sit down, the lot of you.
text: At this moment several actors come into the room. They are all dressed
text: in the uniform of officers in Wellington's army. Together with the
text: they sit down, Beatles and soldiers all mixed up.
text: Now a group of several pretty make-up girls make an entrance and the
text: boys herald their arrival with a chorus of “aye aye's" and wolf
text: whistles. JOHN meanwhile has helped himself to a big beard and the
text: other lads are generally messing about with assorted make-up things.
text: HEAD MAKE UP GIRL
dialog: Oh, this is impossible! We'll never get you
dialog: all done in time.
speaker_heading: ACTOR
dialog: Well, you'll just have to do us first... It
dialog: makes no difference to them whether they're
dialog: made up or not.
dialog: (sees John with beard)
dialog: And who's me, then?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (charmingly)
dialog: My name's Betty...
dialog: (pointing to the name
dialog: on the mirror)
dialog: Do you want a punch up your frogged tunic?
text: NORM fights his way to JOHN.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Now listen, John, behave yourself or I'll
dialog: murder you and, Shake, take that wig off, it
dialog: suits you.
dialog: girls,
text: SHAKE has a long blond girl's wig on. With the assistance of the
text: NORM gets the boys seated into the chairs nearest the door. For some
text: reason RINGO now has a Guardsman's busby wedged down almost over his
text: eyes and is sitting with it under a hair drier, reading a copy of
dialog: "Queen" Magazine.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: (to Ringo)
dialog: What do you think are you're up to?
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Someone put it on me.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Excuses, that's all we get and you know you
dialog: fancy yourself in the Coldstreams.
text: The GIRLS now move in and put make up bibs on the BOYS and start to
dialog: powder them off.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You won't interfere with the basic rugged
dialog: concept of my personality, will you, girl?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Eh, don't take out me lines.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah, they give him that "Je ne sais quoi"
dialog: rakish air.
text: The lads laugh with pleasure.
text: RINGO decides to try a little joke.
speaker_heading: RINGO
text: (indicating the busby he is still
dialog: wearing)
dialog: Short back and sides, please.
text: The other look at him with mock disgust.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Behave...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Foreign devil ...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Control yourself...
text: GRANDFATHER has been watching the powdering process.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: In my considered opinion you're a bunch of
dialog: sissies.
text: JOHN grabs a powder puff from his girl.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You know you're only jealous!
text: And dabs the old man liberally with the powder much to GRANDFATHER's
dialog: annoyance.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all
dialog: the truth about you.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You wouldn't!
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: I would though.
text: NORM goes out.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What's he know?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give
dialog: me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but
dialog: a clever swine, mind.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (impatiently)
dialog: Lookit, I thought I was supposed to be getting
dialog: a change of scenery and so far I've seen a
text: train and a room, a car and a room and a room
dialog: and a room. Well, that's maybe all right for a
dialog: bunch of powdered gee-gaws like you lot but I'm
text: feeling decidedly strait-jacketed. This is no
dialog: life for a free-booting agent of my stamp. I'm
text: a frustrated man and that class of McCartney is
dialog: a dangerous McCartney.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (admiringly)
dialog: What a clean old man.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (touchingly)
dialog: You're too young for a fella of my
dialog: cosmopolitan tastes, so don't press your luck.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: He's sex-obsessed, the older generation are
dialog: leading this country to galloping ruin.
text: NORM returns leaving the door open, the boys hear the sound of music
text: coming from the studio.
dialog: 55.
dialog: on
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: They're nearly ready for you. They're just
text: finishing the band call.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (jumping from his seat)
dialog: Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a
dialog: dance.
speaker_heading: JOHN'S GIRL
dialog: I don't think its allowed.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Well ... it wouldn't be any fun if it was!
text: The BOYS drag the make-up GIRLS out of the room and into the studio.
text: The GIRLS are still trying to finish making the BOYS up.
text: As the BOYS and MAKE-UP GIRLS dance past, we see one of the "Strauss"
text: singers combing his long hair straight back. Two STAGE HANDS swing a
text: wind machine past him and his hair is blown straight forward into a
dialog: Beatle cut.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (passing him)
dialog: Never.
text: During dance, GEORGE takes off wig and places it on dummy, revealing
text: identical hair underneath.
scene_heading: INTERIOR T.V. STUDIO FLOOR
text: The work is still going on and the music is up full blast, the BOYS
text: enter and with the GIRLS [and] they start a wild dance, hippy, shake,
text: zulu, blue beat, the lot. LIONEL and DANCERS are doing their routine
text: one side of the stage ... it becomes a challenge dance between both
text: groups. JOHN swings his GIRL onto the motorized CAMERA, Western style,
text: and starts to track through the GROUP. GEORGE is on another CAMERA.
scene_heading: INTERIOR CONTROL ROOM
text: The whole control room crew are watching the dance on all the
dialog: monitors.
dialog: him,
dialog: it
text: The DIRECTOR is about to stop the boys but his GIRL P.A. glares at
text: with a shrug he lets the dance go on.
text: We now cut between the dancers on the monitors and the boys actual
text: dancing down on the studio floor. When the recorded music stops, they
text: grab their instruments and go into a number.
dialog: So we can watch every aspect of their work and with so many monitors
text: gives the impression that there are many more boys than just four.
text: When the number finally ends we are back in the studio on the floor.
scene_heading: 57. INTERIOR T.V. STUDIO FLOOR
scene_heading: DIRECTOR'S VOICE OVER TANNOY
dialog: Thank you gentlemen, you can break now while we
text: push on with the show.
text: The boys acknowledge this with a quaver of guitar chords and a drum
dialog: roll.
text: NORM is on them at once.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: That was great, you've got about an hour but
dialog: don't leave the theatre.
text: JOHN grabs the arm of a sexy girl dancer.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: She's going to show me her stamp collection.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (grabs a showgirl)
dialog: So's mine.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: John, I'm talking to you. This final run
dialog: through is important. Understand? Important.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (like a pig)
dialog: Oink! Oink!
text: They dash off with the two beauties.
text: GRANDFATHER is hovering in the background with SHAKE.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: I want me cup of tea.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Shake.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
text: I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Clever.
dialog: (he turns)
dialog: George.
text: But GEORGE is disappearing out of the door.
text: NORM turns to RINGO.
speaker_heading: NORM
speaker_heading: STA.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: He
dialog: comes
dialog: Look after him.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Do I have to raise me voice?
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: (choked)
dialog: Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
text: And the two of them walk off, Ringo leading.
scene_heading: INTERIOR BACKSTAGE
text: A man, whose act is playing tunes by hitting himself on the head, is
text: swallowing a handful of aspirin tablets. He starts rehearsing his act,
text: which consists of throwing his head back and slapping his cheeks. Next
text: to him, a JUGGLER is practising with four table tennis balls.
text: GRANDFATHER passes him and bumps his arm slightly. Only 3 balls come
text: down. There is the sound of coughing off.
dialog: We
speaker_heading: CUT TO
text: THE HEAD-PLAYER being patted on the back. The ball drops out of his
text: mouth and bounces slowly on the studio floor.
scene_heading: INTERIOR T.V. STUDIO CANTEEN
text: The canteen is about half full of actors many of which are dressed as
text: Nazi soldiers, with mock blood bandages and arm bands. Also there are
text: sprinkling of T.V. people. At a table sits GRANDFATHER and RINGO.
text: is deeply engrossed in a book and GRANDFATHER has a near empty cup of
text: tea in front of him. The old man is bored and looks about him slyly.
text: then looks at Ringo who is innocently occupied, a malicious gleam
text: into GRANDFATHER's eye. He decides to have a go at RINGO and sits
text: staring at him. RINGO gradually becomes aware of the stare and shifts
text: uncomfortably then tries to continue reading his book.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (disgustedly to no one
dialog: in particular)
dialog: Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid
dialog: his hooter scraping away at that book!
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Well ... what's the matter with that?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (taking the book from him)
dialog: Have you no natural resources of your own? Have
dialog: they even robbed you of that?
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: (snatching back his book)
dialog: You can learn from books.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn
dialog: more by getting out there and living.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Out where?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Any old where ... but not our little Richard
dialog: ++. oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan
dialog: skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that
dialog: rubbish!
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: (defiantly)
dialog: Books are good!
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (countering)
dialog: Parading's better!
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Parading?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (marching up and down the canteen)
dialog: That's it, parading the streets ... trailing
dialog: your coat ... bowling along ... living!
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Well, I am living, aren't I?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: You're living, are you? When was the last time
dialog: you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did
dialog: you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool
dialog: appraising stare?
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat,
dialog: aren't you?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: At least I've a backlog of memories, but all
dialog: you've got is that book!
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as
text: the rest of them.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: So you are a man after all.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: What's that mean?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think
dialog: I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor
dialog: unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into
dialog: books by their cruel, unnatural treatment,
dialog: exploiting your good nature.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: (not too sure)
dialog: Oh ... I dunno.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (confidingly)
dialog: And that lot's never happier than when they're
dialog: jeering at you ... and where would they be
dialog: without the steady support of your drum beat,
dialog: I'd like to know.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Yeah ... that's right.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: And what's it all come to in the end?
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: (defensively)
dialog: Yeah ... what's in it for me?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: A book!
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
text: He throws the book down.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: When you could be out there betraying a rich
dialog: American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti
dialog: before you're too old like me. A fine neat and
dialog: trim lad the class of you should be helping
dialog: himself to life's goodies before the sands run
dialog: out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible
dialog: drag on a man and every second you waste is
dialog: bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the
dialog: Post Office.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought
text: of it but being middle-aged and old takes up
dialog: most of your time, doesn't it?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: You're only right.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: (nodding back)
dialog: I'm not wrong.
text: There is a pause, then RINGO rises and crosses to the door.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Where are you off to?
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: I'm going parading before it's too late!
text: RINGO leaves and GRANDFATHER laughs at what he has done, then realizes
text: its full meaning and looks worried.
scene_heading: 59. INTERIOR CORRIDOR and STAIRWAY
text: RINGO comes along the corridor then down the narrow stairs. Half-way
text: down he comes face to face with GEORGE who is coming up the stairs.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: (passing him)
dialog: No. I don't.
text: As he goes round the corner RINGO turns on the surprised GEORGE.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: You want to stop being so scornful, it's
dialog: twisting your face.
scene_heading: 60. INTERIOR T.V. THEATRE NEAR STAGE DOORMAN'S OFFICE
text: JOHN and PAUL are chatting up a couple of girls, when they see RINGO
text: approaching they break off the conversation.
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: Here he is, the middle-aged boy wonder.
text: RINGO looks at JOHN hard.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Eh. I thought you were looking after the old
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: (with simple dignity)
dialog: Get knotted!
text: PAUL and JOHN gape at him. For good measure Ringo takes a quick
text: photograph of them before he leaves them flabbergasted and walks off
text: into the street.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: We've got only half an hour till the final
text: run-through. He can't walk out on us.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Can't he? He's done it, son!
text: GEORGE runs towards them.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: We do.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: He hasn't.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yes, he's filled his head with notions
text: seemingly.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him
dialog: right.
text: The three of them go into the street.
scene_heading: 61. EXTERIOR T.V. THEATRE STAGE DOOR ENTRANCE
dialog: 
text: The boys look up and down but RINGO has completely disappeared.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: We'll split up and search for him, he can't be
dialog: far.
text: They now all start to go off in the same direction, they pause, there
text: are three roads they can take but each time they begin to move they
dialog: all
dialog: go the same way.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It's happened at last, we've become a limited
dialog: company.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'll look in here again.
text: PAUL gives him a push to the left and GEORGE to the right and going
text: straight ahead himself they part and go their separate ways.
dialog: 62.
scene_heading: EXTERIOR STREET
text: RINGO is walking along taking photographs with his camera when some
text: girls recognise him and start to follow him. They quicken their pace
text: and RINGO runs ahead of them. He turns and comes into another street.
text: He sees a second-hand clothes shop with a sign saying "We Buy
dialog: Anything"
dialog: moment
dialog: the
dialog: 63.
dialog: to
dialog: tyre
text: and enters the shop just before the pursuing girls come round the
text: corner. The girls stand about looking in all directions. After a
text: RINGO comes out of the shop. He is wearing a long mackintosh and a
text: natty cap pulled well down. He is ignored by the girls who don't
text: recognise him. Realising this he goes back and ogles one of them. She
text: glares at him.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Get out of it, short house!
text: CLOSE-UP on Ringo's secret but happy smile as he walks briskly down
dialog: road.
scene_heading: EXTERIOR TOW PATH CANAL
text: RINGO kicks at a brick. He kicks stylishly but misses so tries again,
text: misses again, but finally kicks the stone which doesn't budge so he
text: bends down and pulls it out of the ground. It is quite big. Three
text: quarters of it being below the surface. Having got it he now decides
text: throw it away. As he does so the same POLICEMAN rides past on a
dialog: bicycle.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Ain't you got no more bleeding sense than to go
text: round chucking bricks about.
text: Before RINGO has time to answer the man has disappeared.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: (shouting after him)
dialog: Southerner!
text: He looks at the canal water moodily; at this moment a large lorry tyre
text: rolls down the incline and bashes him slap in the back, sprawling him
text: on the path, the tyre on top of him. A small boy appears after the
text: and stands over the prostrate RINGO.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon.
dialog: Have you got a licence for it?
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Oh don't be so stroppy!
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: Well! A boy of your age bowling "hoop" at
dialog: people. How old are you anyway?
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: (aggressively)
dialog: Nine.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Bet you're only eight and a half.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: (countering swiftly)
dialog: Eight and two thirds.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Well, there you are and watch it with that
dialog: hoop.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Gerron out of it, you're only jealous ‘cause
dialog: you're old.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Shurrup!
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: I bet you're
dialog: (searching for an age)
dialog: -- sixteen!
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Well --
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: All right, take your hoop and bowl.
text: He moves off and the BOY follows.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it
dialog: depresses me.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Y'what?
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: You heard, it gets on my wick.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another
dialog: thing, why aren't you at school?
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: I'm a deserter.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: (smiling in spite of himself)
dialog: Are you now?
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Yeah, I've blown school out.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Just you?
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come
dialog: with us but they chickened.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Not much cop without 'em, is it?
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: (defensively)
dialog: Oh, it's all right.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: (disbelievingly)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: What they like?
text: BOY is glad to have something to talk about.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: (enthusiastically)
dialog: Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and
text: Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: How about Ding Dong?
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: He's a big head and he fancies himself with it
dialog: but you know it's all right ‘cos he's one of
dialog: the gang.
text: RINGO nods his head understandingly and they mooch on together.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Why aren't you at work?
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: I'm a deserter, too.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Oh.
text: At this moment a child's voice shouts out "Charley" and from RINGO'S
text: P.O.V. we see three kids. RINGO turns to the BOY and looks at them
text: enquiringly.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: (to Ringo)
dialog: See you.
text: The BOY runs off to join his mates. As he joins them they punch and
text: scuffle together. They are obviously a gang. RINGO is left alone.
scene_heading: 64. INTERIOR CORRIDOR T.V. THEATRE
text: GEORGE comes round the corner, looking for RINGO, then grins and walks
text: past a sign saying "Canteen and Production Office Opposite." He comes
text: to the exit door, crosses to a modern building across from the
dialog: theatre.
dialog: He enters [the] building.
scene_heading: 65. INTERIOR OFFICE
text: It is the reception room that leads to an inner office. Behind a desk
text: sits a smart young woman typing busily as GEORGE enters. He is
text: surprised when he sees the girl; she looks up and speaks to him at
dialog: once.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Oh, there you are!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: (tartly)
dialog: You haven't, you're just late.
dialog: 66.
dialog: (She rises and crossing
text: over to him examines
dialog: him critically.)
dialog: Oh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Is he?
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Yes, you're quite a feather in the cap.
dialog: (She crosses to the
text: desk and picks up the
dialog: inter-office phone.)
dialog: Hello, I've got one ... oh, I think so ... yes,
dialog: he can talk ... Well ... I think you ought to
dialog: see him.
dialog: (she smiles)
dialog: Of course, right away.
text: She crosses to the inter-office door. On the door is written SIMON
text: MARSHAL ... she opens it.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Well ... come on.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Sorry.
text: He follows her quickly in.
scene_heading: INTERIOR THE INNER OFFICE
text: A large room, part production office with models and sets, drawing
text: board with ground plans, the other part of the room a mixture of Pop
text: and Queen's magazine decor.
text: Behind a large desk sits SIMON MARSHAL, a bland but slightly irritable
text: young man of about thirty-five. He is wearing the ultimate in the
text: current smart set fashion. He is attended by a couple of underlings
text: ADRIAN and TONY and behind him on the wall is a poster of a girl.
text: Across the poster is printed, "Way Out, your own T.V. Special
dialog: with Susan Campey. Director, Simon Marshal."
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: (proudly)
dialog: Will this do, Simon?
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: (looking at George)
dialog: Not bad, dolly, not really bad.
dialog: (he motions to George)
dialog: Turn around, chicky baby.
text: GEORGE does so.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Oh yes, a definite poss. He'll look good
text: alongside Susan.
dialog: (he indicates the girl on the poster)
dialog: All right, Sunny Jim, this is all going to be
dialog: quite painless. Don't breathe on me, Adrian.
text: ADRIAN has recognised GEORGE and is trying to stop SIMON.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Look, I'm terribly sorry but I'm afraid there's
dialog: been some sort of a misunderstanding.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have
dialog: to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry
dialog: on for our benefit.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm afraid I don't understand.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Oh, my God, he's a natural.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY (anxiously)
dialog: Well, I did tell them not to send us any more
dialog: real ones.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: They ought to know by now the phonies are much
dialog: easier to handle. Still he's a good type.
text: He now speaks to GEORGE in the loud voice that the English reserve for
dialog: foreigners and village idiots.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: We want you to give us your opinion on some
dialog: clothes for teenagers.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for
dialog: that eventuality.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll
dialog: be written out and you'll learn it.
dialog: (to secretary)
dialog: Can he read?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Of course I can.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'll have a bash.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink,
dialog: a cokearama?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Ta.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Well, at least he's polite. Tony Show him the
dialog: shirts, Adrian.
text: A collection of shirts are produced and GEORGE looks at them. While he
text: is doing this SIMON briefs him.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Now, you'll like these. You really "dig" them.
dialog: They're "fab" and all the other pimply
text: hyperboles.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead
text: grotty.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Grotty?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah, grotesque.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: (to secretary)
dialog: Make a note of that word and give it to Susan.
dialog: I think it's rather touching really. Here's
dialog: this kid trying to give me his utterly
dialog: valueless opinion when I know for a fact within
dialog: four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent
dialog: inferiority complex and loss of status if he
dialog: isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of
dialog: course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's
dialog: why they were designed, but that's what you'll
dialog: want.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: But I won't.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I don't care.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new
dialog: thing is to care passionately, and be right
dialog: wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't
dialog: cooperate.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: And who's this Susan when she's at home?
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: (playing his ace)
dialog: Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager.
dialog: You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets
dialog: everything wrong?
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the
text: T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we
dialog: even all sat down and wrote these letters
dialog: saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: She's a trend setter. It's her profession!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the
text: sound down on her and say rude things.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Get him out of here!!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (genuinely surprised)
dialog: Have I said something amiss?
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Get him out of here. He's knocking the
dialog: programme's image!!
text: The underlings hustle GEORGE to the door.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Sorry about the shirts.
text: He is ejected through the door.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Get him out.
text: (he stops in mid-shout)
dialog: You don't think he's a new phenomenon, do you?
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: You mean an early clue to the new direction?
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: 67.
dialog: 68.
dialog: 69.
dialog: (rummaging in his desk)
dialog: Where's the calendar?
dialog: (he finds it)
dialog: No, he's just a trouble maker. The change isn't
text: due for three weeks. All the same, make a note
dialog: not to extend Susan's contract. Let's not take
dialog: any unnecessary chances!
scene_heading: EXTERIOR STREET PUB ON THE CORNER
text: The sign on the pub is Liverpool Arms. RINGO is standing looking up at
text: it. He decides to go in and does so.
scene_heading: INTERIOR T.V. CONTROL ROOM
text: The atmosphere is tense. GRANDFATHER is standing miserable in front of
text: the DIRECTOR, the criminal confronted by the judge. SHAKE and NORM are
text: flanking him grimly.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: I'm sorry lads, I didn't mean it, honest.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: If he says that again, I'll strike him.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: (unconvincingly)
dialog: They'll be back, they're good lads, they'll be
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: (disgusted)
dialog: Yes? Well they've got only ten minutes to the
text: final run-through.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: I meant no harm. I was only trying to encourage
dialog: little Ringo to enjoy himself.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: (grimly, C.U.)
dialog: God knows what you've unleashed on the
dialog: unsuspecting South. It'll be wine, women and
dialog: song all the way with Ringo once he's got the
dialog: taste for it.
scene_heading: INT. PUB PUBLIC BAR
text: CLOSE-UP on RINGO. He is eating a bone dry sandwich that curls up at
text: the end. He puts it down with disgust. He has a lager glass in his
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: BARMAID
dialog: (accusingly)
dialog: That was fresh this morning.
text: We now see the pub is full of enormous cockney workmen downing pints.
text: RINGO is very much alone. He moves away from the bar towards a group
text: that is standing together, they've an average height of over six-foot.
text: There is a group at a dart board. Another group is playing bar
dialog: skittles
text: and a third group is around a pin-ball table.
text: Near the bar is a shove-halfpenny board with two players. There is a
text: caged parrot nearby.
speaker_heading: BARMAID
dialog: (to Ringo)
dialog: That'll be two and nine...
text: RINGO fumbles some change out of his pocket. A few coppers fall from
text: his hand on to the shove-halfpenny board just as the crucial point has
text: been made. The men glare at him. Embarrassed, he moves away and
dialog: without
text: looking, places his glass on the skittles table just as a player
dialog: swings
text: the string, which hits Ringo's glass. More embarrassed, RINGO backs
text: away, unfortunately into the pin-table just as a winning score is
dialog: about
text: to be reached. He bumps it very slightly, but enough to cause it to
text: TILT. He then moves to the dart board. By this time most of the pub is
text: staring at him. With great style he takes the darts. The first throw
text: goes into a cheese sandwich which a man is pointing in demonstration.
text: The second we see arrive into a pint of bitter and then we see RINGO
text: shoot the third dart and hear the sound of the parrot shouting
dialog: angrily,
text: off. The BARMAID has had enough.
speaker_heading: BARMAID
dialog: Right ... On your way!
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Y'what?
speaker_heading: BARMAID
dialog: You heard, on your way, troublemaker!
text: Now the centre of attention, RINGO backs out of the pub, followed by
text: every eye in the place, the BARMAID and a few players following him to
dialog: the door
scene_heading: 70. EXTERIOR STREET OUTSIDE PUB
text: RINGO comes out and crosses road, watched by the POLICEMAN who is now
dialog: quite suspicious.
scene_heading: 71. EXTERIOR STREET
text: PAUL comes down the street looking about him for RINGO. In the street
text: is an old building, the sort of place that is highly favoured for TV
text: rehearsals. There is a sign on the door, "TV Rehearsal Room." As PAUL
text: draws near, a load of actors and extras, etc. are leaving, they are in
text: costume, they are the ones who earlier had been going to a word
text: rehearsal. When PAUL gets near the entrance he decides to go inside.
dialog: 72.
dialog: 73.
scene_heading: INTERIOR HALL
text: PAUL enters and wanders about. He reaches a door, pushes it open and
text: looks in. He sees a GIRL clad in period costume. She is moving around
text: the room and obviously acting. PAUL watches her for a moment and then
text: decides to go in.
scene_heading: INTERIOR REHEARSAL ROOM
text: PAUL goes into the room. The GIRL is in mid-flight. She is very young
text: and lovely and completely engrossed in what she is doing. The room is
text: absolutely empty except for PAUL and herself. She is acting in the
dialog: manner of an eighteenth-century coquette, or, to be precise, the voice
dialog: English actresses use when they think they are being true to the
dialog: costume period ... her youth however makes it all very charming.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: If I believed you, sir, I might do those things
dialog: and walk those ways only to find myself on
dialog: Problem's Path. But I cannot believe you, and
dialog: all those urgings serve only as a proof that you
dialog: will lie and lie again to gain your purpose with
dialog: me.
text: She dances lightly away from an imaginary lover and as she turns she
text: sees PAUL who is as engrossed in the scene as she was.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: oh!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (enthusiastically)
dialog: Well ... go ‘head, do the next bit.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Go away! You've spoilt it.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh, sorry I spoke.
text: He makes no attempt to go. He simply continues to look steadily at the
text: girl; then he smiles at her. She is undecided what to do next.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Are you supposed to be here?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I've got you worried, haven't I?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at
dialog: all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you
dialog: .».. that's all but if it worries you ...
dialog: well ...
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (ironically)
dialog: How'd you guess?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (seriously)
dialog: Oh, it's the way you talk.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (innocently)
dialog: Is it ... is it, really?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (suspiciously)
dialog: Are you pulling my leg?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (looking her straight in the eye)
dialog: Something like that.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (unsure)
dialog: I see.
dialog: (airily)
dialog: Do you like the play?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at
dialog: school but I only ever heard boys and masters
dialog: saying those lines, like, sounds different on a
dialog: girl.
dialog: (smiles to himself)
dialog: Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Gear?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a
dialog: few more lines, like?
text: GIRL pouts.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You don't half slam the door in people's faces,
dialog: do you? I mean, what about when you're playing
dialog: the part, like, hundreds of people'll see you
dialog: and...
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (cutting in)
dialog: I'm not ...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: No.
dialog: (aggressively)
dialog: I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just
dialog: felt like doing those lines.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Aye, I knew you were.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: What's that mean?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well, the way you were spouting, like ....
dialog: (he imitates her)
dialog: "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that.
dialog: Yeah, it was gear.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (dryly)
dialog: The big hammer?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Oh aye, a sledge.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: But the way you did it then sounded so phony.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No ... I wouldn't say that ... just like an
dialog: actress ... you know.
text: He moves and stands about like an actress.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: But that's not like a real person at all.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Aye well, actresses aren't like real people,
dialog: are they?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: They ought to be.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are,
dialog: are they?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (teasingly)
dialog: What are you?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of
dialog: us, we play and sing.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: I bet you don't sound like real people.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball.
dialog: It's fab.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Is it really fab or are you just saying that to
dialog: convince yourself?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was.
dialog: I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing
dialog: something I love doing.
text: He laughs and with a gesture takes in the whole studio
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: -+. all this and a jam butty too!!
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when
text: other people are let in.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Why selfish?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well, you've got to have people to taste your
dialog: treacle toffee.
text: She looks at him in surprise.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when
dialog: I was little me mother let me make some treacle
dialog: toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd
dialog: done she said to me, "Go and give some to the
dialog: other kids." So, I said I would but I thought
dialog: to meself, "She must think I'm soft." Anyroad,
dialog: I was eating away there but I wanted somebody
dialog: else to know how good it was so in the end I
dialog: wound up giving it all away ... but I didn't
dialog: mind, mind, ‘cos I'd made the stuff in the
dialog: first place. Well ... that's why you need
dialog: other people... an audience ... to taste your
dialog: treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound
dialog: as thickheaded to you as it does to me?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker.
dialog: How would you do those lines of mine?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you
dialog: come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit
dialog: of a scrubber, isn't she?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Is she?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool
dialog: scrubber ...
dialog: (Paul starts acting a Liverpool girl,
text: he minces about then turns, extending
dialog: his leg)
dialog: Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other
text: one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off
dialog: it... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes
text: and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and
dialog: suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an
dialog: empty shop doorway. You're just after me body
dialog: and y'can't have it ... so there!!
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (shattered)
dialog: And you honestly think that's what she meant?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she's
text: trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't
dialog: want ... well ... I don't reckon any fella's
dialog: ever wanted to get married. But girls are
dialog: like that, clever and cunning. You've got to
dialog: laugh.
text: He laughs.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: And cunning.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: And what do you do about it?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always
dialog: running about with the lads ... no, we don't
dialog: have the time.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Pity.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (not noticing the invitation)
dialog: Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's
dialog: all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's
dialog: when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better
dialog: get back.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (going)
dialog: See you.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Of course.
text: PAUL stands at the doorway, shrugs then goes out.
scene_heading: 74. EXTERIOR STREET
text: In the street, workmen are collecting shovels, drinking tea and doing
text: all the things people do around building sites. RINGO mooches around.
text: In the road is a hole with a diameter of about 3 feet, and at least 6
text: feet deep. RINGO looks down and a man is busily working at the bottom
text: of the hole. He glares at RINGO. After a moment RINGO turns away. We
text: now see a very elegant young lady coming towards RINGO. She is
dialog: daintily
text: avoiding a series of puddles. RINGO has an idea and does a Sir Walter
text: Raleigh with his large Mac spreading it over one of the puddles. The
text: girl walks across it smiling graciously. RINGO proceeds with the coat
text: to the next puddle and to the next backing gradually towards the hole.
text: At last he spreads the coat, without noticing what he is doing, over
text: the hole. The girl steps onto the coat and disappears sharply. RINGO
text: looks down the hole where the girl is held in the workman's arms. The
text: workman rises out of the manhole until he is waist height. At this
text: point an elegantly dressed gentleman appears (the girl's husband) he
text: looks at his wife in the workman's arms and hits the workman. RINGO
text: backs away through the puddles, and is nicked by the POLICEMAN.

text: The DIRECTOR is pacing up and down the corridor. NORM is also walking

speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Worry, will you!
text: SHAKE adjusts his features to a worrying expression.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: Well, that's it, two minutes to the final

speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: I'll murder that Lennon.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR

speaker_heading: SHAKE

text: The horrible prospect hits the DIRECTOR.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: You don't think...
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: (reassuring him)
dialog: They'll be here.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Oh now, they can't do that to me.
dialog: (turning on Norm)
dialog: It's all your fault.
dialog: (overriding Norm)
dialog: Oh yes it is and if they don't turn up I

speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: Of course.
text: At this moment JOHN, GEORGE and PAUL enter from the stage door. They

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Our lot!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (mildly)

speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: (beaming with delight)
dialog: I could eat the lot of you.

speaker_heading: DIRECTOR

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: Eh, there's only three of them.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Aye, we were looking for Ringo. But we realised

speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Do you realise we are on the air, live, in

speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Here they are, personally signed and
dialog: handwritten by your own sweet boys. The chance
dialog: of a lifetime. Be the envy of your less
dialog: fortunate sisters!
text: The CAMERA PULLS back and we see GRANDFATHER is surrounded by girls
text: have broken from the queue and are doing a brisk trade with the old
text: man. He has a large sign on which is written: "Get your genuine
text: autographed Beatles photographs." On the edge of the crowd two
text: POLICEMEN are trying to force the girls back into the queue. Finally
text: they wade through the girls and confront GRANDFATHER. They look at the
text: old man quizzically; he stares back coldly. They indicate he should
text: it and quick but GRANDFATHER defiantly glares back at them. So with a
text: sigh, they grab an arm each and escort the old man off.
scene_heading: INTERIOR POLICE STATION
text: It is the reception desk and behind it is the DESK SERGEANT. After a
text: moment RINGO is dragged in by the POLICEMAN we saw him with before.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Look, I'm Ringo Starr... I've got a show to do
dialog: in a few minutes you've got to let me go... I'm

speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Sure, they all say that these days ... Anyway
dialog: ++. I don't care who you are... you can save

speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: What is he?
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: (reeling off the list)
dialog: I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad.
text: Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner.
dialog: Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace.
dialog: You name it, he's done it.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Oh, a little savage, is he?
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: A proper Aborigine.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: (on his dignity)
dialog: I demand to see me solicitor.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: What's his name?
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Oh, well if you're going to get technical --
text: At that moment there is a loud series of noises off camera, furious
text: shouting and dull crashes of wood.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Hello, it's going to be one of those nights, is
dialog: it?
dialog: (to policeman)
dialog: sit Charley Peace down over there.
text: The POLICEMAN takes RINGO to a bench and sits him down as GRANDFATHER
text: and the two POLICEMEN who were with him enter. The sign is
text: and is being lugged after them.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll
dialog: take one of you with me.
dialog: (kicks the nearest policeman)
dialog: Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room
dialog: and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you
dialog: still.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Is there a fire, then?
text: GRANDFATHER leans across the desk and hisses at the SERGEANT.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism

speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Eh?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper.

dialog: again.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: (to policemen)
dialog: Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic
dialog: in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
text: The POLICEMEN hurtle GRANDFATHER firmly but gently over to the bench
text: which RINGO is sitting and then return to the desk for a whispered
text: conference with the SERGEANT. Meanwhile in full conspiratorial fashion
text: GRANDFATHER talks to RINGO out of the side of his mouth.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for
dialog: the iron too, did they?
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you,
dialog: just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate
text: crew of drippings and they've fists like
text: matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: (disturbed)
dialog: Have they?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: That sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I
dialog: measured one. One of us has got to escape. I'll
dialog: get the boys. Hold on son, I'll be back for you.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: (horrified)
dialog: Me !
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: And if they get you on the floor watch out for
dialog: your brisket.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: (hopefully)
dialog: Oh, they seem all right to me.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: That's what they want you to think. All coppers

dialog: You see, sly villains.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: (miserable)
dialog: No thanks, Mr. Sergeant, sir.
text: We now have a CLOSE SHOT of POLICEMEN around the sergeant's desk.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: So you just brought the old chap out of the
dialog: crowd for his own good.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the
dialog: station.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Well, he can't stop here.
text: Shot of GRANDFATHER watching POLICEMEN intently and muttering words as
dialog: he does.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
text: Lip reading.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: What are they saying?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Nothing good.
text: The POLICEMEN make a move towards GRANDFATHER and RINGO.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Well son, it's now or never.
text: He jumps to his feet and scurries towards the door.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: All right, you paid assassins. Johnny
dialog: McCartney'll give you a run for your threepence
dialog: ha'penny.
text: He dashes out of the door followed by the POLICEMAN who has his pile
dialog: of
dialog: photos.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Now, what's he up to?
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: He's allergic to Bobbies, especially English
dialog: Bobbies.
text: The POLICEMAN with the photos returns.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: (Irish accent)
text: Your man disappeared like a leveret over a hill.
speaker_heading: RINGO
dialog: Turncoat!
text: The POLICEMEN turn on RINGO and walk towards him.

dialog: Mother!
scene_heading: 80. EXTERIOR STREET
text: GRANDFATHER is running at top speed down the street. He is breathing
text: heavily and runs as if pursued by the hounds of hell. The street
text: however is entirely empty and no one is even in sight. As he reaches
text: the top of the street he pauses and turning, looks around him. From
dialog: his
text: P.O.V. we see just how empty the street is and heaving a sigh of
dialog: relief
text: GRANDFATHER cackles to himself. His triumph is short lived. At this
text: precise moment down the street comes a parade of police vehicles, a
text: Black Maria, an escorting police motor bike patrol and an ordinary
text: squad car. The procession draws up and the street is full of policemen
text: getting out of the Black Maria and squad car and off motor bikes.
text: CLOSE-UP GRANDFATHER's horrified face.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Be God, they've called up reinforcements, the
dialog: dragnet's out!
text: He dashes off wildly in the general direction of the theatre. He has
text: been completely unnoticed by the policemen who are lining up for a
dialog: last
text: minute inspection by the inspector in charge. The inspector is like a
text: commander-in-chief of a spear-head attack force.
text: They smartly march off in the direction taken by GRANDFATHER.

speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: (watching the clock)
dialog: Only half an hour and you're on!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Can I say something?
text: The director clutches at any straw.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: (hopefully)
dialog: Yes, anything.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (earnestly)
dialog: It's highly unlikely we'll be on... I mean the
dialog: law of averages are against you and it seems
dialog: that, etc., etc....
text: But his speech is drowned by the pitiful moans of the DIRECTOR.
scene_heading: 82. EXTERIOR T.V. THEATRE STAGE DOOR
text: The four little boys from the canal are being driven away by the
text: security guard.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: (going back into theatre)
dialog: I'll have the hides off of you lot.
text: The kids retreat as GRANDFATHER pants into shot, ignoring the kids he
text: enters the stage door but in a second he is out again, grasped firmly
text: by the collar by the security guard.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Go home!
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: I must see Pauly.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Go home then and see him on the telly.
text: The GUARD re-enters the stage door.
text: GRANDFATHER looks around him and sees the four kids. He hustles over
text: and after a whispered conference we hear his offer.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Can you fix him for me?
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Sixpence.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Each?
text: GRANDFATHER is about to argue.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Oh, all right.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: And in advance.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (disgusted)
dialog: Mercenary!
text: But he hands over the money. The kids rush in the stage door and after
text: a moment the furious GUARD chases them out and down the alley.
text: GRANDFATHER, chuckling, nips in the door.
scene_heading: 83. INTERIOR T.V. CONTROL ROOM ON STAGE
text: GRANDFATHER is being chased by several studio attendants; he is
dialog: dodging
text: behind equipment. He finally gets on a sound boom trolley and uses it
text: as a weapon to keep his pursuers at bay.
scene_heading: 84. INTERIOR T.V. CONTROL ROOM
text: The DIRECTOR, BOYS, and NORM and SHAKE see GRANDFATHER on the
dialog: monitors.
text: They dash out of the room and on to the stage.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: It's all right, leave him alone.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Grandad, where's Ringo?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: The police have the poor unfortunate lad in the

speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: We've only got twenty minutes.
scene_heading: EXTERIOR STREET OUTSIDE POLICE STATION
text: PAUL, JOHN and GEORGE come running down the street in single file,
text: their knees high in the air, they skid to a halt at the police
text: and without pausing they dash inside. After a moment they reappear --
text: only this time RINGO is behind them. They dash off down the street.
text: They are followed at once by ten POLICEMEN also in single file. They
text: are also pounding along knees high in the air. The BOYS and the
text: disappear around the corner. At once, they reappear from the other
text: direction, then run down the street still followed by the policemen.
text: When they reach the police station another group of police bars their
text: way so they are forced to run up the stairs and inside.
scene_heading: INTERIOR POLICE STATION
text: The DESK SERGEANT is standing behind his desk looking very surprised.
text: At this moment the boys run in and stand panting in front of the desk.
text: Before the SERGEANT can start speaking the pursuing POLICEMEN arrive.
text: They, too, are out of breath.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: What is all this?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (heaving and panting)
dialog: Hold on until we get our breath.
text: The BOYS and POLICEMEN pant on until JOHN seems to have recovered.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: All right now?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Sure.
dialog: (to boys)
dialog: Ready?
text: The BOYS nod and without further ado they turn and run through the
text: surprised rank of POLICEMEN and out into the street.
scene_heading: EXTERIOR STREET
text: THE CHASE CARRIES ON.
text: Shots of BOYS being pursued (still in single file) by police,
dialog: including
text: the sergeant with one shot where the BOYS are chasing the POLICEMEN.
text: Finally, as they approach the theatre, they are seen by the girl fans
text: who swarm around the police, over running them. The boys grin to each
text: other and are about to make off when from their P.O.V. we see the
text: INSPECTOR and POLICEMEN blocking it.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Ah well, it was worth a try.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: (calling to Sergeant)
dialog: What do you think you're up to?
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Arrest those boys, sir.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: That's all we need to start a real riot!
dialog: (to Boys)
dialog: Come on lads, they're waiting for you.
scene_heading: Het INTERIOR THEATRE BACKSTAGE
text: The Inspector now hustles the BOYS through the crowds and in through
text: the main entrance of the theatre where SHAKE and NORM are waiting.
speaker_heading: NORM
text: looks suspiciously at RINGO who is still wearing his cap. RINGO whips
text: it off and NORM delightedly hugs him. The BOYS dash through the stalls
text: entrance and on stage. The DIRECTOR sees them and bursts into tears
text: with relief. NORM hustles the lads into the wings to be changed into
text: their show costumes. All around them last-minute preparations are
dialog: going
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If
dialog: you hadn't come back it would have been the
dialog: epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
text: The DIRECTOR gives NORM a final glare and dashes off.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: And another thing, where's that old mixer?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Here, Pauly.
text: And sitting on a box sadly chastened sits GRANDFATHER.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well, I got a few things to say to you,
text: two-faced John McCartney.
dialog: old
dialog: 88.
dialog: of
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he?
dialog: And it's not his fault he's old.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (hotly)
dialog: What's old got to do with it?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You needn't bother.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Y'what?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Practising to be thick-headed, you're there
dialog: already.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That's right, but he's only asking us to pay
dialog: attention to him, aren't you?
text: From JOHN's P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER. He looks what he is, a tired
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You see.
dialog: (to Grandad)
dialog: You know your trouble -- you should have gone
dialog: West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior
dialog: Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong
dialog: turning and what happened, you're a lonely old
dialog: man from Liverpool.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (fighting back)
dialog: But I'm clean.
text: The BOYS giggle and slap him on the back.
scene_heading: INTERIOR TV THEATRE AUDITORIUM
text: We see the audience of girls streaming in and settling down in their
text: places for the show. There is the usual business of getting the show
text: ready and we see SHOTS of the girls' faces, then JOHN, PAUL, RINGO and
text: GEORGE looking at them. At last on cue from the floor manager the BOYS
text: start their act to the audience's screams. During the number we
text: constantly CUT away to the audience with various SHOTS of the ecstatic
text: girls. In the middle of these shots we see NORM standing at the side
dialog: and
dialog: spite
dialog: medley
dialog: of
dialog: finish
dialog: 89.
text: the audience his face glowing with satisfaction. We follow his gaze
text: from NORM'S P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER handcuffed to SHAKE, but in
text: of this, the old man is enjoying himself. The BOYS now perform a
dialog: of numbers, i.e., a little of all the songs we have heard during the
text: story. This gives the impression of a full set and we finish after
text: their bows. While they are doing so they look again in the general
text: direction of SHAKE and GRANDFATHER and from their P.O.V., we see SHAKE
text: is beating time to the music but from his wrist dangles an empty set
text: handcuffs. GRANDFATHER has gone again. As the BOYS are reacting to
text: GRANDFATHER's disappearance once again, the trap door on the stage
text: opens and GRANDFATHER appears in the centre of the group as they
text: their act and take their final bows.
scene_heading: INTERIOR STUDIO CORRIDOR
text: NORM is waiting for the boys. With him are two studio attendants
text: carrying the boys' luggage. As the BOYS excitedly appear he speaks to
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: I've got the stuff. Come here.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Aren't we ...
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: No, we're not!
text: He hurries them along.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: The office was on the phone, they think it'd be
dialog: better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Tonight? We can't make it ...
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: You've got a midnight matinee.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Now, look here, Norm...
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to
dialog: say to you.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: You're a swine. So hurry up ... we're
dialog: travelling!
text: NORM turns down a side exit where the door is open to the field. In it
text: is an eight-passenger helicopter.
scene_heading: 90. EXTERIOR STAGE DOOR T.V. THEATRE
text: The BOYS and NORM come out of the building and start to run towards
dialog: the helicopter.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (looking behind him)
dialog: Where's my grandfather?
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: (arriving at helicopter door)
dialog: Don't start. Look.
text: The boys look in the passenger bay and there is GRANDFATHER. He is
text: still handcuffed to SHAKE but clutching his pile of photos.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (beckoning them in with his
dialog: free hand which holds the photos)
dialog: Come on, you're hanging up the parade.
dialog: The boys shout “Get rid of those things, etc."
scene_heading: 91. EXTERIOR FIELD
text: The final shot is of the helicopter rising up (SHOT FROM BELOW). As it
text: disappears, a shower of photos come from its window.
text: We cut to a CLOSE-UP of one signed photo as it hits the ground and
