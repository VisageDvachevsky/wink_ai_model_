dialog: 
text: This story takes place during a World Series between the
text: Mets and the A's. Canseco plays for Oakland, and Strawberry
dialog: is still with New York.
speaker_heading: DAY ONE:
scene_heading: GAME THREE: LT WINS
scene_heading: EXT: EARLY MORNING - LT'S HOME - QUEENS
text: This typical QUEENS HOUSE is sandwiched between other
text: neighboring, nearly identical HOUSES.
text: The MORNING SOUNDS Of FAMILY BICKERING, LAWN MOWERS, and
text: SHOUTED GOOD-BYES are heard coming from many HOUSES on this
text: close-knit block. A NEW BABY can be heard BAWLING inside
speaker_heading: LT'S HOUSE.
text: LT, hurried and harried, stumbles out his FRONT DOOR. He
text: heads for his CAR, parked askew in the DRIVEWAY.
text: LT is some 40 years old. His natural swagger makes up for
text: his lack of conventional good looks. He is obviously hung-
dialog: over.
text: LT squints, pained by the SUN. He fumbles with his SHADES,
text: puts them on.
text: LT's TWIN EIGHT YEAR-OLD SONS trundle out the FRONT DOOR of
text: the HOUSE, bickering as they run to catch up with their Daddy.
text: The hefty TWINS wear ill-fitting PAROCHIAL SCHOOL UNIFORMS.
text: Their oversize PAROCHIAL SCHOOL BRIEFCASES threaten to trip
dialog: them up.
text: LT's WIFE, BABE in arms, comes out to watch LT's lovely SEVEN
text: YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER head off toward her school on foot. Many
text: other members of LT's EXTENDED FAMILY hang out on the STOOP
speaker_heading: and the LAWN.
text: As the TWINS cross the LAWN, the bickering turns physical.
text: They start whacking each other with the BRIEFCASES. The TWINS
text: pile into LT'S CAR.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT: MORNING - LT'S CAR - EN ROUTE TO/AT PAROCHIAL SCHOOL
text: The CAR is obviously LT's home away from home. FOOD DEBRIS,
text: BEER CANS, VODKA BOTTLES and other garbage litter the
dialog: interior.
text: An impressive HAND-GUN is visible between the seats.
text: An old ICON of MOTHER MARY rides on the DASHBOARD.
text: As the TWINS get in, LT tries to hide the GUN and the illicit
dialog: detritus.
text: To little avail. The TWINS pay no mind to his machinations;
text: they have evidently seen it all before.
text: As LT drives the TWINS to SCHOOL, the three play wild rough-
dialog: house.
text: The CAR swerves crazily.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: How many times are you gonna miss
dialog: the bus? Huh? All the other kids can
dialog: get up in the morning, but you guys
dialog: wanna be driven around like the
dialog: fucking President. I'm your goddamn
dialog: chauffeur!
speaker_heading: TWINS
dialog: (each taking alternate,
dialog: overlapping lines)
dialog: Shit, man. It wasn't our fault! --
dialog: You think Sis is so perfect, well,
dialog: if she hadn't hogged the fucking
dialog: bathroom, maybe we -- I thought Aunt
dialog: Lu was dead! She was in there so
dialog: long...
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Shut up! Listen!
text: ON RADIO: Chatter about Mets winning last night's game. It
dialog: was the THIRD GAME straight that they've won so far. One
dialog: more game -- set for tomorrow afternoon -- and the Mets will
dialog: sweep the World Series. All listen.
speaker_heading: TWIN
dialog: They're gonna win the Series in four!
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: All the way with Strawberry!
speaker_heading: TWINS
dialog: (in unison)
dialog: Strawberry!
text: The TWINS whoop and shout, celebrating LT's -- and their own --
dialog: favorite player.
text: They pass the PAROCHIAL SCHOOL BUS. It has stopped for a
text: moment taking on KIDS. LT cuts off the TWINS' tirade.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Shit, man -- there's your fucking
dialog: bus I oughtta make you late! Make
dialog: the nuns whack the shit outa ya both.
text: LT and the TWINS banter back and forth, poke each other and
text: box around. The apparent hostility of their words is balanced
text: by the laughter and gung-ho play of the rough-housing. The
text: TWINS yell cat-calls as they drive past a BLONDE PEDESTRIAN.
text: LT joins in.
text: ANGLE - Through the WINDSHIELD, the PAROCHIAL SCHOOL comes
text: into view. A CROWD of UNIFORMED KIDS is gathered outside.
text: SEVERAL NUNS turn the CROWD into two neat rows, and usher
text: the KIDS inside.
scene_heading: POV LT - THE NUNS
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Get going.
text: The TWINS get out. Join the line of students entering the
speaker_heading: SCHOOL.
text: The instant the KIDS have left the CAR -- LT takes out some
text: COKE. Snorts it. He takes his GUN out of hiding.
text: LT steers with his knees as he drives off toward the City.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT: AFTERNOON - QUEENS - CRIME SCENE
text: ANGLE - A CAR WINDSHIELD. Blood-spattered and shot up. The
text: DEAD BODIES of TWO GIRLS are in the front seat.
text: LT gets out of his CAR and makes his way through the COPS
text: and GAWKERS.
text: The BET COP comes up to LT.
speaker_heading: BET COP
text: Two Black kids came up out of nowhere
dialog: and shot those chicks. Then they
text: laughed as they walked away. The
dialog: Press is gonna call it the "Giggling
dialog: Man Murders." I'll tell ya. What a
dialog: world.
text: LT gives a cursory glance to the crime scene. A couple of
text: COPS greet him; LT keeps walking.
text: The BET COP digs his attitude.
speaker_heading: BET COP
dialog: But hey -- we make the best of it,
dialog: man, don't we? Huh? How about them
dialog: Mets!
text: FOLLOW LT - over to a GROUP of COPS. They greet him and
text: everyone immediately crams into a parked CAR. The CAR stays
text: parked for the duration of their meeting.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT: AFTERNOON - UNMARKED COP CAR (PARKED) - QUEENS
text: Now that LT, the BET COP and the OTHER COPS are inside the
text: CAR, they can do business. LT pays several COPS their WINNINGS
text: for last night's game. CASH and congratulatory banter is
dialog: exchanged.
dialog: Now LT has to take their BETS for tomorrow afternoon's GAME,
text: the FOURTH GAME of the World Series. LT urges the COPS to
dialog: bet against the Mets.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: No fucking way they're gonna do it
dialog: in four games straight.
speaker_heading: COP ONE
dialog: You serious, man? I wanna go Mets
dialog: all the way!
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Go ahead, man.If you've got shit for
dialog: brains. But if you wanna win the
dialog: bucks, go with Oakland.
speaker_heading: COP TWO
dialog: I thought Strawberry was gonna --
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: I know that nigger like he's my
dialog: brother. He ain't gonna let us off
dialog: so easy. He'll make us sweat first.
dialog: This game's going to Oakland. Not a
dialog: doubt in my mind, man.
text: Silence. The COPS think about it for a moment.
text: BET COP speaks up first; hands LT some CASH. When he talks
text: to LT, his fawning posture is obvious.
speaker_heading: BET COP
dialog: I'm in. Here.
text: COP ONE SHRUGS his assent, gives CASH to LT. The OTHER COPS
text: follow his example, place their BETS on OAKLAND.
text: The COP BETS total $800 -- on OAKLAND. LT has obviously been
text: the bookie for this precinct for a long time. He takes care
dialog: of a lot of action and has these guy's faith.
text: LT nods a goodbye, quickly gets out of the CAR. The BET COP
text: and the OTHER COPS remain inside.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT: AFTERNOON - PAY PHONE - MIDTOWN - 38TH STREET &amp; 3RD
speaker_heading: AVENUE
text: LT pulls up alone beside a PHONE BOOTH and phones in the
text: COPS' bets and his own to LITE. More than an anonymous
text: connection to the BOOKIE, LITE is obviously LT's old friend --
text: and a hustler just like himself.
text: LT shouts into the PHONE and holds it close to his ear. The
text: TRAFFIC NOISE is loud and irritating.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: I got them all going for Oakland.
dialog: With bullshit money. We'll cover the
dialog: $800.
speaker_heading: LITE
speaker_heading: (OC)
dialog: All right. What are you gonna do?
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: I want 15 on the Mets.
speaker_heading: LITE
speaker_heading: (OC)
dialog: How about 7 1/2?
text: ACROSS THE STREET - TWO GUYS approach a BUSINESSMAN in a
text: raincoat and flash a KNIFE. The BUSINESSMAN gives up his
text: WALLET and his WATCH.
text: LT pays no mind to the robbery.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit.
dialog: Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are
dialog: a fucking lock. I wanna make some
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: LITE
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Yeah. I'm sure.
text: LT hangs up the PHONE, heads back toward his parked CAR.
text: By this time, the BUSINESSMAN is running into the street,
text: waving his arms and screaming.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: Police! Police! Help me! Police!
text: LT enters his car, drives off.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT: EVENING - CRACK CITY
text: LT arrives, leading a BUST. Lots of COPS. LT chases a handsome
text: young COKE DEALER, JC, cornering him a couple flights up a
text: staircase. Now they're alone and the phony pantomime is over.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Hey, man, gimme something cooked!
text: JC gives it to him with a PIPE. LT takes a drag of CRACK.
text: Then LT gives JC a large BAG of COKE, labelled "Exhibit A".
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: It's good shit. From when they busted
dialog: those Columbians uptown. You can cut
dialog: it in half.
text: JC nods, bemused by LT's manic behavior. JC, in contrast, is
text: mellow and in control. LT smokes; JC doesn't.
text: LT COUGHS and SMOKES as he shouts to COPS downstairs (OFF).
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: I got this guy. But there's someone
dialog: across the street on the roof!
text: The COPS (OFF) rush out of the building.
text: JC watches LT smoking like a fiend.
speaker_heading: JC
dialog: That stuff'll kill you quick, man.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: What the fuck are you? A drug
dialog: counselor or a drug dealer? And you
dialog: don't even do your own product! What
dialog: kind of businessman are you?
speaker_heading: JC
dialog: The rich kind.
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Jeez, man. The way you smoke that
dialog: shit is suicide.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Fuck you.
dialog: (takes a deep hit)
dialog: Just give me back a little something
dialog: for the road.
text: LT takes a handful of the COKE and puts it in a DOLLAR BILL;
dialog: pockets it.
speaker_heading: JC
dialog: See you in a coupla days. Have the
dialog: cash ready.
text: JC splits, runs up the stairs.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT: NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM
dialog: Religious/hip artifacts abound. It's a nice, if messy
dialog: apartment.
dialog: However, it is definitely not large enough to merit the $3,500
dialog: that ARIANE quotes as her rent.
dialog: ARIANE is LT's mistress.
text: BOWTAY, her girlfriend, lounges on the COUCH. BOWTAY plays
text: the third when LT is in the mood for a menage a trois. She's
text: around a lot.
text: BOWTAY is already zonked out on something. Maybe LUDES.
speaker_heading: ARIANE
dialog: Got something good for us?
text: LT gives her the COKE. ARIANE takes some immediately. BOWTAY
text: sloppily partakes.
text: Before LT can even sit down, the GIRLS start bitching.
speaker_heading: ARIANE
dialog: I'm gonna need some bread, man. This
dialog: ain't fair. I'm always here for you,
dialog: and you can't even take decent care
dialog: of me. My landlord is bitching like
dialog: a motherfucker! You're two months
dialog: behind on the rent, Lieutenant!
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Didya ever think of moving to a
dialog: cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is
dialog: crazy, man!
speaker_heading: ARIANE
dialog: It's nothing. This is New York, man...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Oh -- I forgot. Bowtay needs some
dialog: cash to buy her new acting headshots
dialog: out of the developers. It's a good
dialog: investment, man. She could make
dialog: serious money!
text: ANGLE - BOWTAY on the COUCH. It's obvious that she's going
text: nowhere. And fast.
speaker_heading: ARIANE
text: We've been rehearsing a new monologue.
dialog: From Shad's Saint Joan, you know?
dialog: Bowtay does it wonderfully well.
text: LT breaks out more COKE and some GRASS.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: All right, Bowtay. Show us your stuff.
text: ARIANE lifts BOWTAY to her feet. BOWTAY staggers into the
text: center of the room, then falls back down on her knees. It
dialog: happens to be appropriate for the scene.
text: BOWTAY begins to recite the monologue from the very end of
dialog: the play. "When will the world be ready to receive thy
dialog: saints?", etc.
text: BOWTAY messes up a line; ARIANE lashes her with a BELT.
text: BOWTAY doesn't move, continues reciting. ARIANE joins in
dialog: from time to time.
text: LT is turned on.
text: He begins KISSING ARIANE, then goes down onto the floor.
text: BOWTAY is there already.

text: opens the REFRIGERATOR.
scene_heading: POV LT - CU - The REFRIGERATOR is entirely empty, save for a
text: few suspect and peculiar items. There is nothing in liquid
dialog: form.
text: LT hears ARIANE calling to him from the LIVING ROOM.
speaker_heading: ARIANE
dialog: (OC - calling to LT)
dialog: There's nothing!
text: It's clear from the SEX SOUNDS (OC), that ARIANE and BOWTAY
dialog: are still going at it.
speaker_heading: ARIANE
dialog: (OC - calling to LT)
dialog: Go out and get some Diet Cokes.
text: LT obeys. He leaves the KITCHEN.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT: NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM
text: LT passes through the LIVING ROOM, putting on his CLOTHING
text: as he heads for the DOOR to OUTSIDE.

scene_heading: EXT/INT: LATE NIGHT - KOREAN DELI

speaker_heading: COKES.
text: A display of FRESH FRUITS &amp; VEGETABLES extends onto the
dialog: sidewalk.
text: LT notices a SQUAD CAR, parked in front of the MARKET. LT
text: picks up his pace.
text: Closer now, LT sees a YOUNG UNIFORMED COP outside, standing
text: with the KOREAN OWNER, an elderly man who doesn't speak much
text: English. The OWNER is agitated and out of breath. He argues
text: fiercely with TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS.
text: A SQUAD CAR is parked in front of the MARKET.
text: LT gets an idea. He takes command.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: (to Cop)
dialog: What's going on?
text: The UNIFORMED COP is a timid rookie.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Uh, Lieutenant, Sir -- The owner
dialog: says they stole cash from the
text: register. He was chasing them down
dialog: the block when I caught up with them.
text: The KOREAN OWNER is still agitated. He tries to give his
text: side of the story, mixing English and Korean. At the same
dialog: time --
text: The TWO BLACK KIDS plead their case. They try to drown out
text: the OWNER. It all gets rather noisy.
scene_heading: YOUNG BLACK KID
dialog: We didn't do nothing, man !
text: LT shouts in the YOUNG BLACK KID'S FACE. It's shockingly
dialog: loud.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Shut the fuck up!
text: LT turns to the UNIFORMED COP.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: (to Cop)
dialog: Go get me a Bud. A High Boy. And
dialog: make sure it's fucking cold.
dialog: (indicates the
dialog: situation at hand)
dialog: I'll straighten this out.
text: The UNIFORMED COP looks at LT for a moment, then goes.
text: LT is now alone with the KOREAN OWNER and the TWO YOUNG BLACK
speaker_heading: KIDS.
text: LT turns to the OWNER.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: How much did they take?
speaker_heading: KOREAN OWNER
dialog: Five hundred dollars cash.
text: The TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS continue protesting their innocence.
scene_heading: YOUNG BLACK KID
dialog: We didn't --
text: LT whips out his GUN and shoots a deafening BLAST between
text: the TWO KIDS' heads.It almost takes off the left ear of one
text: and the right ear of the other.
text: The TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS are stunned. Speechless.
text: The YOUNG UNIFORMED COP rushes out of the MARKET, GUN raised
text: in one hand, BEER CAN in the other. He's relieved that a cop
text: wasn't shot, but the whole situation makes him uneasy.
text: LT grabs the BEER, points to the KOREAN OWNER.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: (orders the Cop)
dialog: Take this guy down to the Precinct.
dialog: I need to talk to him.
text: The OWNER protests wildly in Korean as the flustered COP
text: ushers him into a waiting SQUAD CAR. They drive off.
text: Now LT is alone with the TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS.
text: LT takes the KIDS inside at gunpoint.
text: INT: The store appears to be deserted.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Gimme the money! Now!
text: The TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS have regained some of their cool.
text: They are still belligerent.
scene_heading: YOUNG BLACK KID
dialog: We told you, man. We didn't take no --
text: LT jams his GUN down the PANTS of one of the KIDS. At the
text: same time, he whips out his BADGE and thrusts it into the
text: other KID'S FACE.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Give me the fucking money, assholes!
text: They give LT the CASH. The KIDS stand there.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: What the fuck are ya standing there
dialog: for? Be gone!
text: The KIDS, stunned, split.
text: LT swaggers around the store, GUN in hand, drinking the BEER,
text: assessing the inventory with a proprietary air. He pretends
text: to SHOOT at various products. Plays around.
text: In the back aisle, LT aims his GUN at a BIG BOX of TOILET
speaker_heading: PAPER.
text: While he holds the TOILET PAPER at bay, a THIRTEEN YEAR-OLD
text: KOREAN KID rises up from behind it, his hands up, terrified.
text: LT LAUGHS, then puts the GUN away.

speaker_heading: ARIANE
dialog: I got you a present. Better shit

text: inhale the PLUME OF SMOKE in time.
text: He gets a nice, deep hit.
text: ARIANE gracefully takes a hit of her own.
text: They are both very high, already. Beginning to NOD OUT.
text: ARIANE goes back to the IMPLEMENTS and prepares another hit.
text: This time she catches the SMOKE in a SHERRY GOBLET and LT
dialog: drinks it.
text: LT is very high now. A meditative, hallucinatory state.
text: ARIANE takes a DIET COKE and lies down on the BED.

text: Around him, POLICE TECHNICIAN-TYPES are busy lifting
text: fingerprints and analyzing the CAR and WILLIE -- to no
dialog: apparent avail.
text: LT uses his Lieutenants' privilege to enter the MURDER CAR
text: and begin his own investigation.
text: TIRE TRACKS are discovered nearby. The OTHER COPS are
text: distracted.
text: LT takes his shot. He reaches for and finds the KI of COCAINE

text: from the MURDER CAR.
text: Outside the MURDER CAR, LT makes to stand up. In the act, he --
dialog: DROPS the BAG of COKE!
text: LT is stunned. He can't believe the KI is actually in the
text: shitty, gutter water, in plain view of the other COPS.
text: The COPS spot the KILO of COKE. Even those COPS that were

text: itself rises in the background. It looks like a prison.
text: LT leaves his CAR, heads for the GROUP of COPS. He joins
text: them, sits down on the HOOD of a nearby CAR. The COPS are
text: all DRINKING heavily.
text: Present are the BET COP, and several other FAMILIAR COPS
dialog: from previous scenes.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: FIRST COP
text: They raped a nun and tore up the
dialog: church -- they even took a crap on
text: the altar. Up in Spanish Harlem.
speaker_heading: SECOND COP
dialog: She was only seventeen...
text: A COP opens his TRUNK -- he has a BAR inside. The COPS,
text: including LT, respond enthusiastically. DRINK UP.
speaker_heading: FIRST COP
dialog: Who the fuck could do this?!
speaker_heading: OLD IRISH COP
dialog: The young nun's just a kid from
dialog: Ireland. Imagine having to come here
dialog: to have that happen!
speaker_heading: SECOND COP
dialog: Jesus... What's she gonna tell her
dialog: mother?
speaker_heading: OLD IRISH COP
dialog: I'm gonna kill those motherfuckers.
text: The COPS keep DRINKING. All of them lounging around on or
text: beside the CARS.
text: LT watches quietly, taking it all in. As if following the
text: motto: "He who defines himself, confines himself."
speaker_heading: THIRD COP
dialog: The Church already put up a $50,000
dialog: reward!
speaker_heading: FIRST COP
dialog: Well, one of us is gonna get it. I
dialog: mean -- get them.
text: The FIRST COP raises a TOAST.
speaker_heading: FIRST COP
dialog: Here's to payback for the nuns!
text: The COPS all whoop and cheer.
speaker_heading: SECOND COP
dialog: Anyone got any leads, at all?
speaker_heading: FIRST COP
dialog: We got shit to go on. Only that list
dialog: of inventory -- what they stole from
dialog: the church.
speaker_heading: THIRD COP
dialog: Y'know they actually stole those
dialog: wacky purple robes? And they took
text: the chalice -- with the Host still
dialog: inside!
speaker_heading: SECOND COP
dialog: What did they want with the Host?
speaker_heading: THIRD COP
dialog: They were hungry. I dunno. They didn't
dialog: want to hock the Host, they wanted
dialog: to hock that golden chalice.
text: COPS avoid each others' eyes. Competition has begun. No one
text: shares information, each after the reward for himself.
text: LT bursts out, swings into high gear.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Leave it to the Catholic Church,
dialog: man. Girls get raped everyday, and
dialog: now they're gonna pay 50 G just
dialog: because these chicks wore penguin
dialog: suits!
text: Some of the COPS laugh, others are offended.
speaker_heading: OLD IRISH COP
dialog: (to LT)
dialog: What's your fucking problem?!
speaker_heading: LT
text: The Church is a racket.
speaker_heading: OLD IRISH COP
dialog: So what. Are you a Catholic?
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Sure!
speaker_heading: OLD IRISH COP
dialog: Do you believe in God?
text: LT doesn't reply. He's thinking.
text: The BET COP and a couple of OTHER, FAMILIAR GAMBLER COPS
dialog: move in. They've got nothing on their minds but the World
dialog: Series.
speaker_heading: BET COP
dialog: (to LT)
dialog: To Hell with this God stuff. How's
dialog: that Strawberry? He does what ever
dialog: you want him to, huh Lieutenant?
dialog: Even strike out!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I bet you won a shitload on Oakland.
dialog: How much, huh?
text: LT comes down off the CAR HOOD. Now he has to feign pride in
text: his supposed big bet on OAKLAND.
text: LT has to convince the COPS to keep betting -- he can't afford
dialog: to pay them all off. Unfortunately, the COPS all think LT
dialog: just scored big, himself.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: More than you did.
speaker_heading: GAMBLER COP TWO
dialog: Well, let's see some green!
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: If you know what's good for you,
dialog: you'll keep staying on Oakland!
speaker_heading: BET COP
dialog: Oakland? Is that how you're going?
text: LT nods "yes." An outright lie.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Yeah. Sure. Don't you get it? The
dialog: series has gotta last seven games.
dialog: The last two did, didn't they? It's
dialog: a racket. Do you have any idea how
dialog: much money they make selling
dialog: television-time for commercials during
dialog: the series? Especially if it's a New
dialog: York team? They won't close the gold
dialog: mine after only four games. It'll
dialog: last a full seven. Too many people
dialog: wanna milk it for what it's worth.
dialog: You'll see!
speaker_heading: BET COP
dialog: All right... I'm in. After all, you're
dialog: the expert. Ain't that right, LT?
text: SEVERAL COPS, including some of the COPS who have been hanging
text: out in front of the HOSPITAL, go double or nothing on OAKLAND.
text: LT takes their BET MONEY -- $900.
text: One COP doesn't go along with the deal. LT painfully pays
dialog: him off.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: You'll be sorry, man. But if you
dialog: wanna be a sissy, here's your bread.
text: LT sits back on top of his CAR, DRINKING heavily. He toasts
text: STRAWBERRY. The others are uneasy. Why toast STRAWBERRY?
speaker_heading: COP ONE
dialog: Strawberry? I thought we were going
dialog: with Oakland.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: We are, man! That's the point! If
dialog: the Mets win, it's thanks to
dialog: Strawberry. If Oakland wins, it's
dialog: thanks to Strawberry. Nothing can
dialog: happen out there on the field that
dialog: don't gotta do with Strawberry. So
dialog: here's to Strawberry!
text: The others join in the TOAST, but are uneasy.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT: LATE NIGHT - CORRIDORS OF A CITY HOSPITAL - HUNTING FOR
speaker_heading: THE NUN
text: The HOSPITAL is an inferno. LT exploits his cop privileges;
text: shows his BADGE to the GUARDS.
text: He wants to get into the inner sanctum. Beyond where even
text: COPS were allowed to go. He wants to get to the NUN.
text: A sexy NURSE stops him.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Can I help you?
text: LT can't help but check her out and flirt.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: I'm in charge of the investigation.
dialog: Just checking security.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: (Suspicious)
dialog: Security?
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Do you want those guys coming back?
dialog: For the nun? Or for you?
text: The NURSE looks at him, unsure, then walks off down the
speaker_heading: CORRIDOR.
text: LT continues his hunt.
text: He comes upon a DOOR that is plastered with "QUARANTINE"
text: SIGNS. One too many, perhaps. LT senses the NUN is inside.
text: He has to open the DOOR, but hopes he won't get a blast of
text: disease in his face. He CROSSES himself -- wearing a smirk,
text: but nonetheless. Going on instinct, LT opens the door a crack.
text: He's right. It's the NUN. He positions himself outside the
text: DOOR, keeping it open a few inches. He peeks inside without
dialog: being seen.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT: LATE NIGHT - THE NUN'S HOSPITAL EXAMINING ROOM
text: From just outside the door, LT peep-toms on the NUN while
text: she is being examined. He sees her stark naked, laid out on
text: a table, her legs spread wide apart.
text: The DOCTORS, NURSES, COUNSELORS work on the NUN as if they
text: are automatons. They don't grasp either the humanity or the
text: trotitism of the scene. LT does. The image of The Alabaster
text: Nun turns him on no end. Yet there is also a deeper pathos
text: to the scene.
text: And the NUN is spectacularly beautiful. She doesn't speak.
dialog: Looks like a Pieta.
text: A DOCTOR in a WHITE-COAT reads the MEDICAL REPORT to a FEMALE
text: COP. The FEMALE COP writes down the details on a hard-backed
text: pad. As if it's a parking ticket.
text: The moving contrast between the words and the image seems to
text: be apparent to LT -- and the NUN -- alone.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (to Female Cop)
dialog: They inserted a crucifix eleven
text: centimeters into her vaginal aperture,
text: breaking the hymen membrane. Then
dialog: they pursued the same course with
dialog: their natural organs of sexual
text: penetration. They used a sharp object,
text: probably a hunting knife with a curved
dialog: blade, to carve a cross between her
text: shoulder blades, entering the flesh
dialog: an average of nearly one centimeter
text: throughout the area of the wound.
dialog: They --
text: Finally, as if she knew he was there all along, the NUN looks
text: up at where LT is hiding and boldly meets his eyes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT: VERY LATE NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT
text: LT has been there for some time. They are alone. They've
text: both been DRINKING and COKING.
text: LT is carrying on about the NUN. As he speaks about various
text: subjects, his tone changes radically. From contempt and
text: cynicism to profound reverence. From decadence -- to awe.
text: ARIANE, too, manages to switch from one attitude to the other.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Have you ever seen a naked nun? I
dialog: tell you, man, I went to school with
dialog: the nuns, I've seen hundreds since
dialog: then and I've never even seen a nun's
dialog: belly button, you understand? But
dialog: this nun, let me tell you. What a
dialog: beautiful lady...
dialog: (snaps out of his awe)
dialog: And where'd the Church get the 50 G
dialog: in the first place? The fucking Church
dialog: is the biggest scam going. You know
dialog: what's the real killer? It costs
dialog: $8,000 per kid for them to go to
dialog: parochial school. I've got three
text: kids in there already, with two on
dialog: the way! Christ. That fucking reward
dialog: is my money, man! But that's Church
dialog: policy. The Pope is the world's
dialog: biggest bookie. Makes people bet on
dialog: their own salvation! Double or nothing
dialog: on Heaven. You go to Hell -- then go
dialog: to Hell. In the beginning was the
dialog: Word, and the Word was bullshit.
text: ARIANE can't stop thinking about the rape.
speaker_heading: ARIANE
dialog: I can't get over what those guys did
dialog: to her. I just can't.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: They're alive, aren't they? Come on,
dialog: man! Everyone's making such a fucking
dialog: fuss, just because she's a nun. Just
text: because she wears a penguin suit,
dialog: the church puts up 50 G for the guys
dialog: who dared to rape her. Do you think
dialog: they'd put up a dime if you got raped?
dialog: Of course not. Or even for your little
dialog: sister? The virgin? Like shit they
dialog: would.
speaker_heading: ARIANE
dialog: Susie's not a virgin anymore.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: She's fucking nine years old! Jesus
dialog: Christ.
text: ARIANE suddenly starts up.
speaker_heading: ARIANE
dialog: And the nun's not a virgin anymore,
dialog: either. Will they make her leave the
dialog: convent?
text: LT thinks for a moment.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Who knows? Who knows what their policy
dialog: is.
dialog: (sudden dreamy
dialog: reverence)
dialog: But I'll tell you, man, that nun...
dialog: She was beautiful. Just beautiful...
dialog: Tall... Real tall... I've never seen
dialog: anything like it...
text: LT snaps out once again, grabs the TELEPHONE. He dials LITE.
text: He's not in. LT leaves ARIANE'S NUMBER on LIMELITE'S BEEPER.
text: Hangs up.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Lite, man... Where the fuck are you?
text: ARIANE can't get the image of the rape out of her mind.
speaker_heading: ARIANE
dialog: It's horrible. They burned her breasts
dialog: with cigarettes. Christ.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Yeah? At least she's alive! I see
dialog: people get killed every day! Worse
dialog: yet, tortured first and then killed!
text: The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette
text: burns. Everyone's all upset about
dialog: fucking cigarette burns. I'll show
dialog: you cigarette burns!
text: LT stubs out his CIGARETTE on the back of his hand. He does
text: the move with intensity and bravado.
text: ARIANE responds by calmly doing the same. But she does it
text: entirely impassively, and rubs the CIGARETTE into her flesh
dialog: longer than LT did.
text: ARIANE comes over to LT and starts kissing and licking his
speaker_heading: CHEST.
speaker_heading: ARIANE
dialog: Do you believe in God? Do you believe
dialog: that Jesus Christ is the Son of God?.
text: LT hesitates.
text: ARIANE kneels down in front of LT. As if in prayer.
text: She starts giving him head.
text: Before he can answer The Question, he is saved by the bell.
text: The PHONE RINGS. LT picks up immediately. It's LITE.
text: As LT speaks to LITE, ARIANE continues to give him head.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: (to LITE; over the
dialog: phone)
dialog: Yeah, I know, I know all about it.
dialog: Enough already about the fucking
dialog: nuns. Yeah. Yeah. So just take the
dialog: bet. Don't give me any hassles, man.
dialog: Just put in my bet. 30 G's. Yeah.
dialog: And I got $900 from the cops on
dialog: Oakland. Yeah. Right. Strawberry's
dialog: gonna knock em dead. Of course he
dialog: is! You know that! Yeah. Yeah. Have
dialog: faith, man! OK. Right.
text: LT hangs up, thinks ARIANE won't resurface the God Question.
text: ARIANE does, even as she gives him head. Every time she
text: speaks, she pulls away and it frustrates him. This dialectic
text: continues throughout the scene.
speaker_heading: ARIANE
dialog: Do you believe in God?
text: LT thinks about it, even as ARIANE gets him hotter and hotter.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: The Church is a fucking racket. I
dialog: know how they operate. I've been
dialog: part of the racket since the first
dialog: time some faggot priest spilt water
dialog: on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was
dialog: crying all the way through. Yeah, I
dialog: know their game inside out. Now I'm
dialog: free of it and I'm gonna stay that
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: ARIANE
dialog: I'm not talking about the fucking
dialog: Church. Fuck the Church. But tell
dialog: me. Do you believe in God?
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: What's to believe?
speaker_heading: ARIANE
dialog: That Jesus Christ was the Son of God
dialog: and he came to die for your sins.
text: LT can't respond. He's distracted by his own pleasure.
text: ARIANE does something OC that causes LT sudden pain.
text: LT cries out. Snaps to attention. Looks at ARIANE.
speaker_heading: ARIANE
dialog: Your sins, Lieutenant!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And look around you! Where do you
dialog: think all this shit came from?
text: ARIANE gives him head again. LT is more excited now than
text: before she hurt him.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: People.
speaker_heading: ARIANE
dialog: You believe that man is the be-all
dialog: and end-all?
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ARIANE
dialog: OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe
dialog: in God?
text: As if in answer. LT begins to RECITE THE ACT OF CONTRITION
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: I believe in God the Father Almighty,
dialog: Creator of Heaven and Earth...
text: This turns on ARIANE. She stops talking. Writhes and grapples
dialog: him.
text: LT is reaching climax. When describing Jesus rising again --
text: LT has an orgasm.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT INT: VERY LATE NIGHT - LT'S CAR
text: LT drives, DRUNK and fired-up. He has a BOTTLE of VODKA in
speaker_heading: the CAR.
scene_heading: POV LT - A CAR with only one TAILLIGHT. A Cyclops in the
text: darkness. Under a STREETLIGHT, JERSEY PLATES are visible. So
text: are the two inebriated, leather-clad GIRLS inside. LT pulls
dialog: them over.
text: LT comes on to them. He's way out there. The GIRLS are
dialog: smashed.
text: LT notes their "Heavy Metal" CROSSES, and questions them.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: You wouldn't put some religious trip
dialog: on me, would you?
speaker_heading: JERSEY GIRL
dialog: Uh-uh... What?
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Good. Show me your papers.
text: LT looks at their PAPERS. Points to the name to which the
speaker_heading: CAR is registered.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Who's this person? It ain't you, and
dialog: it ain't you, so who is it?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: My Aunt.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: So you took the car from you Aunt.
dialog: Stole it. Am I right?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: We were gonna give it back! We're on
dialog: our way home, now!
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Yeah, yeah.
text: LT gets into the CAR, looks around. He finds a BAG OF POT.
text: LT waves the POT in front of the GIRLS.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Now why don't I just call up your
dialog: Aunt right now and tell her what's
dialog: gone down. How about that?
text: The GIRLS are petrified.
text: LT grins. He takes out his own ROLLING PAPER, starts to ROLL
text: a JOINT with their POT.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Well, I'm sure we could arrange
dialog: something... Unless you fancy a few
dialog: days in jail...
text: He blackmails them into humiliating sex scenes. On a side
text: street off Eleventh Avenue, LT plays it out until dawn.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: DAY THREE:
scene_heading: GAME FIVE: LT LOSES $30,000
scene_heading: EXT INT: DAWN - THE CHURCH/CONVENT
text: LT drives up erratically and parks his CAR in front of the
scene_heading: CHURCH/CONVENT.
text: LT stumbles into the CHURCH. Alone now, he notes various
text: aspects of the DESECRATION, but can't see much because he's
text: blind drunk.
text: The enormous, graphically bloody CRUCIFIX confronts him.
text: He collapses immediately into a PEW. Sleeps.
speaker_heading: TIME PASSES
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT: MORNING - CHURCH/CONVENT
text: LT wakes up. Ruckus all around him. The COPS are there in
text: force -- including some of the guys from the BAR, the UPTOWN
text: MURDER and the HOSPITAL PARKING LOT. They are privately
text: checking out the Scene of the Crime, looking for leads that
dialog: will give them an advantage. Everyone wants the TWO NUNS to
text: talk. The NUNS are in a circle of interrogators. At first,
text: LT can't even see them.
text: The ELDERLY NUN was attacked but not raped. They carved
text: crosses on her.
text: In the background, the questioning has already begun. The
text: interrogators become increasingly frustrated. It can be heard
text: in their voices. They want the reward, and -- despite a
text: certain constipated "respect" in their attitude -- the COPS
dialog: are willing to browbeat the NUNS to get it.
text: LT silently bums a COFFEE off a COP and staggers into the
dialog: ring.
text: LT hangs back in the crowd, staring at the YOUNG NUN as the
text: COPS interrogate both NUNS.
speaker_heading: COP 1
dialog: Can't you tell us anything? Sisters?
dialog: Anything at all?
text: The ELDERLY NUN speaks up.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY NUN
dialog: They broke my glasses. I didn't see
dialog: anything, but I did hear them. They
dialog: were young. And there were two of
dialog: them. They spoke Spanish. One of
dialog: them was named Julio.
text: LT, on the sidelines, turns to an OLDER COP. LT mutters his
dialog: commentary
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: (to Older Cop)
dialog: Julio. Great. There are 20,000 spics
dialog: named "Julio".
text: The ELDERLY NUN lowers her head. Shamed.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY NUN
dialog: I would tell you more if I could. I
dialog: am so sorry, Officers.
text: Now the COPS are magnetized by the YOUNG NUN. She does not
text: appear to need GLASSES. Evidently, she could give the COPS
dialog: what they want.
speaker_heading: COP 2
dialog: What about you, Sister? Won't you
dialog: tell us anything?
text: LT watches the YOUNG NUN as --
text: POV LT - The YOUNG NUN smiles a quiet, intractable smile.
text: COP 2 is screaming mad, but tries to hide it.
dialog: LT has observed their interaction. Though he would have loved
dialog: to have heard some information from the YOUNG NUN, her
text: defiance gives him even more pleasure.
text: The MONSIGNOR comes forward to "translate" the NUNS' stubborn
text: silence. He is possessed by a conventional sort of ambition --
dialog: this is his big chance. He would like to be Cardinal some
dialog: day, but never will be. He enjoys the spotlight as he
text: pontificates.
speaker_heading: MONSIGNOR
dialog: Listen. One nun is nearly 80 years
dialog: old. I'm not from this Church, of
dialog: course, but I assume they'll be
text: getting her a new pair of glasses.
text: Apparently she's legally blind without
dialog: them. The Sister who suffered a rape
dialog: is just 17. She arrived from Ireland
dialog: only a couple of months ago. This --
dialog: event -- is just too much for them
dialog: to take!
text: The MONSIGNOR clears his throat demonstratively, takes a
text: dicitous tone.
speaker_heading: MONSIGNOR
dialog: Listen. The Church would like to
dialog: know who did it just as much as the
dialog: NYPD. These arrant criminals broke
dialog: the laws of man, and the laws of
dialog: God. The Church wants nothing more
dialog: than to see them behind bars. That's
dialog: why we're offering the $50,000 reward
dialog: to whomever brings them in. I'm sure
dialog: our hero will be one of New York's
dialog: Finest.
text: The YOUNG NUN shoots the MONSIGNOR an offended look.
text: It appears for a moment as if the YOUNG NUN makes eye contact
text: with LT. But he can't be sure.
text: LT leaves the crowd, disappears out the DOOR.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT: LATE AFTERNOON - RUSH HOUR - LT'S CAR - 54TH STREET AT

text: GAME FIVE is close, and features STRAWBERRY. As LT listens,
text: he reacts physically to the changing status of the game.
text: He drives crazy through the streets, pounds the ceiling.
text: He's so COKED, he's bouncing out of his skin. LT drinks VODKA
text: out of a PINT BOTTLE in his COAT.
text: STRAWBERRY overthrows a sacrifice fly from Canseco and the
text: A's WIN.
text: LT shoots out the CAR RADIO. LT LOSES! He's $30,000 down.
text: Covering himself, he puts the LIGHTS on top of his CAR. Turns

text: While the rest of the attendant EXTENDED FAMILY, FRIENDS,

speaker_heading: HARD CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT: AFTERNOON  THE CHURCH/CONVENT
text: The interior of the CHURCH/CONVENT is still desecrated. In
text: stark contrast to the "White Church" (above, Scene 22).
text: POLICE ROPES have cordoned off certain desecrated areas of
text: the CHURCH. In other places, MOPS and SLOPPY BUCKETS of SHIT-
text: WATER wait for someone to finish cleaning up.
text: LT appears to be entirely alone in the CHURCH. He is desperate
text: for clues. He searches for leads and perhaps, for something
dialog: else...
text: CU - He lights a CANDLE, gives a QUARTER --
text: Then LT lights his CRACKPIPE ever the FLAME.
text: Suddenly the NUN appears.
text: LT hides, watches as the NUN enters the CONFESSIONAL Once
text: she is ensconced inside, LT stealthly approaches the
text: CONFESSIONAL and from right outside -- a tantalizing proximity --
text: he listens as she confesses to the PRIEST. (This is an elderly
text: PRIEST with a striking, unusual voice. Not the MONSIGNOR
text: from the COPS' interrogation of the NUNS. Scene 20.)
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.
dialog: It has been two days since my last
dialog: confession. Father, my sin is a
dialog: terrible sin. A sin of omission.
dialog: There was another sin that happened
dialog: at the same time, and in the same
dialog: place, but my sin I think was graver
dialog: stil.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Sister, we all know what happened to
dialog: you yesterday morning. I expected
dialog: that you would want to speak to me
dialog: about it. But you could have come to
dialog: my office. Your being here, in the
dialog: confessional, implies that you,
dialog: Sister, have done something wrong.
dialog: You haven't. I assure you. I feared
dialog: you might have misplaced feelings of
dialog: guilt. If you condemn yourself because
dialog: you experienced feelings of...
dialog: curiosity or even... pleasure, you
dialog: mustn't --
text: The NUN LAUGHS. At first, it sounds like crying. But it is a
text: strange, low laughter.
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: Father, if it was so trivial, so
dialog: natural, so -- No. I have sinned.
dialog: And you must listen if you are to
dialog: prescribe an appropriate act of
dialog: contrition, and to absolve me. Father,
dialog: what would you do if you had but one
dialog: day in which to use your arms to
dialog: serve God?
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: It's funny, you knew. But the first
dialog: thing I think of is kneading the
dialog: bread that I help bake for the soup
dialog: kitchen. Maybe that's because my the
text: muscles in my arms still hurt.
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: I also thought of that bread, Father.
dialog: And of that night six days ago when
dialog: the Mother Superior died, and I kept
text: the cool, damp cloth on her forehead
dialog: freshly moist. Father, what would
dialog: you do if you had but one day in
dialog: which to use your legs to serve God?
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: I think of running for help, and
text: falling to my knees in prayer.
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: As I have prayed day and night since
dialog: the desecration of this church
dialog: yesterday morning -- and my sin. You
dialog: see, Father --
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Yes, Sister?
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: Yesterday morning, God gave me but
dialog: one chance to use something else to
dialog: serve Him. Not my arms or my legs,
dialog: but something I used for the first
dialog: time, for the last time, and will
dialog: never use again. My vagina.
text: Outside the CONFESSIONAL. LT reacts to the explicit word.
text: Shock. Titillation and fascination.
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: Those boys, those sad, raging boys...
dialog: They came to me as the needy do. And
dialog: like many of the needy, they were
dialog: rude. Like all the needy, they took.
dialog: And like all the needy, they needed.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Father. I knew them; They learn in
dialog: our school. And play in our
dialog: schoolyard. And they are good boys.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: You knew them?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Who were they, Sister? Who are these
dialog: boys? What are the names of these --
dialog: good boys you knew?
text: Outside the CONFESSIONAL, LT stiffens. This could be the
text: clue he needs to solve the case.
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: I could tell you their names now,
dialog: and I know you'd be bound by a sacred
dialog: vow to keep my secret. But I cannot
dialog: tell you their names. For I, too, am
dialog: bound. As I am bound now to confess
dialog: my sins. So listen, Father Listen.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I am a nun. What did I give those
dialog: boys that they could not have found
dialog: elsewhere? Nothing. Nothing at all.
dialog: There were always two of us in the
dialog: act. The act was half my own. It
dialog: does not seem to me the act was half
dialog: the act of a once of Christ.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It is the lost chance that will remain
dialog: on the ledger of my sins. Not the
dialog: loss of my virginity. The rape forced
dialog: upon me a choice. As a vessel of the
dialog: spirit. I could have imbued my vagina
dialog: with God. Or, I could have turned
dialog: away from God and voided my body of
dialog: spirit, so that all that was left
dialog: for those boys was a lump of flesh.
dialog: I chose the second path. The easier,
dialog: path. The path of the material world.
dialog: The path no nun has the right to
dialog: take. And so, I sinned.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: My vagina spread, but spread no word.
text: It opened, on nothingness. It gave
dialog: nothing at all and left nothing
dialog: behind. No trace of my act, yes my
dialog: act. For I was there, too, remains
text: in the landscape of God.
text: The NUN'S description of the RAPE is both a turn on for LT
text: and a matter of profound curiosity. Something divine. His
text: silent reactions embody both decadence and awe. This apparent
text: paradox can find unified expression in his character, though
text: at other moments it threatens to tear him apart. The tension
text: between the two polarities will propel him toward his destiny.
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: Jesus turned water to wine. I ought
dialog: to have turned bitter semen to fertile
dialog: sperm -- hatred to love. And maybe
dialog: to have saved their souls. They did
dialog: not love me. I ought to have loved
dialog: them. As Jesus loved those who reviled
dialog: him. I ought to have surprised those
dialog: boys. Instead, they surprised me,
dialog: and got no surprise at all. No, they
dialog: did not rape a nun. But a nun has
dialog: been raped. And the nun must now
dialog: atone for her sin. For a God-given
text: part of her was wasted. A part which
dialog: other women use for procreation, for
dialog: conjugal fulfillment, for expressions
dialog: of love. I had but one chance. And I
dialog: did nothing but react in pain.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: When those boys placed their hands
dialog: upon my breasts, they had nothing
text: but an assortment of skin cells in
dialog: their grasp. They ought to have felt,
dialog: through me. The bosom of their
dialog: Redeemer. When they lay on top of me
dialog: and looked down into my eyes, they
dialog: saw fear. They should have met the
dialog: eyes of a lover, And felt the presence
dialog: of the Prince of Peace...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: My vagina. I shall never have again.
dialog: And never again shall I encounter
dialog: two boys whose prayer was more
text: legible, more poignant, more
text: anguished. Two young men who threw
text: themselves upon the altar and took
dialog: me with them. And I did nothing for
dialog: them. I can only hope that someone
dialog: will.
text: LT can't help but start up. As if, telepathically, the NUN
dialog: knew he was there and cried out to him. Asked him to complete
dialog: her mission.
text: LT senses the confession is over. As the PRIEST begins to
text: speak again, LT snaps to and returns to his original hiding
text: place, near the CANDLES.
text: LT watches as the NUN exits the CONFESSIONAL, KNEELS, holds
text: her ROSARY BEADS, and begins to whisper the ACT OF CONTRITION --
text: what LT recited as ARIANE gave him head.
text: The NUN does penance. LT watches her, still hidden, and
text: transfixed.
dialog: Cut from THE NUN to --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT: EVENING - ARIANE'S APARTMENT
text: CU - LT fucking a NUN.
speaker_heading: Its ARIANE.
dialog: This time LT doesn't rebel against the religious import of
text: these last days. Rather, he incorporates it into their sex.
text: He has dressed ARIANE as a NUN. Now it is silent pantomime
text: that expresses both decadence and awe.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT: LATE NIGHT  LT'S HOME  QUEENS

text: LT sits down in the KITCHEN. All is silent, peaceful.
text: A moment passes.
text: LT stands up and goes over to the REFRIGERATOR. He takes out
text: a CARTON OF MILK.
text: Sits back down. DRINKS the MILK.
text: LT calmly looks at what's on the KITCHEN TABLE.
text: A PILE OF BILLS, note attached from his WIFE: "Pay These."
text: A GROUP OF PHOTOS from the COMMUNION, already quickie
text: developed. They are spread out all over the TABLE.
text: A MORNING TABLOID NEWSPAPER, STRAWBERRY featured on the COVER.

speaker_heading: WORLD SERIES
text: The MASSIVE CROWD ROARS.
text: The STADIUM is decked out in the RED, WHITE, and BLUE BUNTING

dialog: the front row. Among them --
text: LT. He watches STRAWBERRY as --
text: With winning runs on, STRAWBERRY takes strike three, to lose
dialog: the game.
text: As STRAWBERRY walks off the field, he and LT face off.
dialog: One on one.
text: LT has lost the $60,000 bet. He knows how heavy this is.
text: That his life is new in danger.
text: The CROWD vents its rage. The deafening SOUND takes on a

text: From EXTREME CU - the BLACK FACE OF STRAWBERRY, we --
text: FADE TO BLACK;
speaker_heading: FADE UP TO:
scene_heading: INT: EVENING - LIMELIGHT NIGHTCLUB
text: Half-nude DANCERS whirling in and out of sight, round and
text: round in the strobe-flashed darkness.
text: The DANCE MUSIC steals ones senses, makes conversation nearly
text: impossible. People communicate in pantomime.
text: LT pushes his way through the CROWD He cranes his neck,
text: desperately searching for someone. At last, he spots his
dialog: target.
text: POV LT - A RESIDENT COKE DEALER. His FACE is visible, floating
text: above the writhing crowd.
text: LT pursues him. Finally catches him.
text: They mime the deal. LT buys some COKE for immediate use.
text: LT does the COKE off his wrist as he moves through the CROWD.
text: LT trembles, frantic and manic-high, as he goes to his meeting
text: with LITE. LT plows his way through the CROWD, heading toward
text: the back of the club and the entrance to the V.I.P ROOM.
text: Even this state, when he sights ACQUAINTANCES. LT turns on
text: the charm and works the room.
text: LT nears the V.I.P. ROOM.
text: POV LT - The entrance to the V.I.P. ROOM is guarded by a
text: PURPLE VELVET ROPE and an effete DOORMAN.

text: respectfully at the habitual patron.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT: EVENING - LIMELIGHT NIGHTCLUB - THE V.I.P. ROOM
text: LT arrives.
text: The V.I.P. ROOM is more laid-back, less populous than the
text: throng-filled cave outside. The MUSIC is muted here, and
dialog: more interesting.
text: PARTIERS sit at the BAR, or at COCKTAIL TABLES. CHIC WAITRONS
scene_heading: serve the clientele: HOTSHOT BOHEMIAN REGULARS, DRUG DEALERS
text: and HOPEFUL RICH ADDICTS. In the privacy of the V.I.P.ROOM,
text: drug use is hardly concealed.
text: LT sashays over to LITE'S table, sits down. LT has taken on
text: an attitude of false bravado. He greets LITE with a crazy
text: grin. LITE is grim, doesn't respond in kind. He's not amused.
text: LT orders a VODKA.
speaker_heading: LITE
dialog: Do you have the money?
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: (giggles)
dialog: What money?
speaker_heading: LITE
dialog: Don't bullshit me.

text: LT can't seem to wipe the smile off his face.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: I don't got it. Not tonight. You
dialog: can't get blood from a stone.
speaker_heading: LITE
dialog: This psycho can.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just
dialog: put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
speaker_heading: LITE
dialog: (laughs in his face)
dialog: You're a fucking joke, you know that?
dialog: (turns grim)
dialog: He's been waiting for the money since

dialog: it. Listen up. You're gonna get us
dialog: both fucking killed. You know that!
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Uh-uh. I'm gonna win. Just make sure
text: the bet gets in.
text: A COCKTAIL WAITRESS delivers LT's VODKA. LT orders another
text: one, flirts with her -- she's gone in a flash. LT downs the
text: VODKA in one shot.
speaker_heading: LITE
dialog: You do know that he's gonna blow up
dialog: your house, kill your wife and kids --
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand
dialog: for his trouble. I hate that
dialog: motherfucking house and --
speaker_heading: LITE
dialog: He's gonna kill you, man. Do you
dialog: hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead.
dialog: Get it?
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: I've been dodging bullets since I
dialog: was fourteen. No one can kill me.
dialog: I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking
dialog: Catholic.
text: This breaks LT up. He laughs until he cries. LITE watches
text: the spectacle. Falls silent. They sit quietly for a moment.
text: LT, impatient with the delivery of his second VODKA, takes a
text: bottle cut of his COAT and re-fills his GLASS. DRINKS it
dialog: down.
text: LITE tries changing the subject.
speaker_heading: LITE
dialog: How's the case going?
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: What case?
speaker_heading: LITE
dialog: The fucking rapists, man. The punks
dialog: who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward
dialog: from the Church! Remember?
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime.
dialog: Lots of leads. You bet.
speaker_heading: LITE
dialog: That 50 G could help you --
text: LT looks as LITE as if he's crazy. He shakes his head. Sing-
text: songs at him as if trying to teach an impaired student.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: The Mets are gonna win the Series.
dialog: They're a lock.
text: A change comes over LT. He leans in, gets seriously excited.
text: LT is possessed by his memory of this afternoon's game.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Get this, man. I was at the game
dialog: today. Face to fucking face with
dialog: Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him
dialog: strikeout. And you know what? He
dialog: looked at me, and I looked at him,
dialog: and he laughed and I laughed and it
dialog: was like we were all alone in that
dialog: whole stadium and only we understood
dialog: that it was all a racket, that he
dialog: struck out on purpose, and that he's
dialog: saving it up for the Big One.
dialog: Tomorrow. Today I understood for the
dialog: very first time that --
speaker_heading: LITE
dialog: You've really got a problem.
text: LT shakes his head. Repeats himself in that sing-song,
dialog: didactic way.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: -- that there was never any other
dialog: way it could have gone.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Never any other way. So you had better
dialog: just put in my fucking bet. $120,000
dialog: on the last game. The Big One. Come
dialog: on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking
dialog: what?
speaker_heading: LITE
dialog: Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's
dialog: number You call him yourself and
dialog: tell him wnat you want.
text: LITE stands up. He writes the BOOKIE'S NUMBER on a MATCHBOOK
dialog: and gives it to LT.
text: LITE leans over and gives LT a final warning.
speaker_heading: LITE
dialog: You couldn't pay 60. You lose, you'll
dialog: be in for 180. To a guy who kills
dialog: people for nothing.
text: LT LAUGHS. He's already onto the next thing. He checks out
text: the GIRLS at the other TABLES.
text: LITE takes to go. Then decides to try once more to get LT's
dialog: attention.
speaker_heading: LITE
dialog: I was supposed to meet him at midnight
text: with the 60. It's already 1:00 AM.
dialog: Be careful. I mean it.
text: LT is still laughing as LITE leaves the V.I.P ROOM.
text: Before going out the door, LITE turns to look one more time
text: at his friend.
text: POV LITE - LT is engaged in a clumsy come-on. Oblivious. The
text: last thing LITE sees is LT grabbing a COCKTAIL WAITRESS' LEG
text: and falling out of his chair. LT LAUGHS all the way to the
speaker_heading: FLOOR.
text: LITE lowers his head and exits.
text: LT gets up a moment later, brushes himself off, and swaggers
text: out of the V.I.P. ROOM.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT: NIGHT - THE LIMELIGHT CLUB
text: LT is in the throng again. The MUSIC blasts, the PARTIERS
dialog: push and shove...
text: LT elbows his way through the crowd.
text: He makes moves on GIRLS. Banters with PATRONS. At the DOOR,
text: he hesitates before going out, dallies with the BOUNCER.
text: LT felt safe in the CLUB. New he's gotta go OUTSIDE. He's
dialog: shit-scared.

scene_heading: INT: NIGHT - STAIRWELL OF J.C.'S APARTMENT BUILDING
text: LT enters an APARTMENT BUILDING, faces a dark and sinister
dialog: staircase.
text: STRANGE NOISES come from the APARTMENTS ABOVE.
text: LT climbs. He hugs the wall, GUN at the ready. To LT, it
text: seems some gothic horror may await him at any turn.
text: On one landing, he comes upon a PIT-BULL. A GRANDMOTHER pulls
text: him back inside an APARTMENT by the LEASH.
text: On another landing, he sees a JUNKIE SHOOTING UP in the
text: shadows. On another landing, a BIG GUY comes barreling out
text: of his APARTMENT and down the stairs, almost bringing LT
text: down with him.
text: On another landing, a guy is taking out very PECULIAR GARBAGE.
text: It might be body parts to an active imagination. At last, he
text: reaches the DOOR to the APARTMENT for which he's been looking.
speaker_heading: HARD CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT: NIGHT - J.C.'S STRAIGHT PUERTO RICAN APARTMENT
text: A cheerful apartment. Quite different in atmosphere from the
text: STAIRWELL, above.
text: A large, multi-generation PUERTO RICAN FAMILY sits around
text: the dinner table, eating CHICKEN ON RICE AND BEANS. JC is at
dialog: the table.
text: RELIGIOUS ARTIFACTS abound.
text: A CODED KNOCK on the DOOR.
text: JC jumps up to answer it.
dialog: It's LT. (The hideous stairs led here.)
text: JC lets him in.
speaker_heading: JC
dialog: How are you doing, man?
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Very good. Very good. The Mets are
dialog: gonna win tomorrow.
text: JC notes LT's bizarre manner. Decides to humor his paranoid
dialog: catatonia.
speaker_heading: JC
dialog: I know. Here. Just a moment.
text: JC reaches into a bookcase, looking for something.
text: Meanwhile, LT looks around the room.
text: POV LT - A SHRINE is in the corner. CANDLES are lit before
text: PLASTER SAINTS, AFRICAN DEITIES, other icons abstruse and
text: exotic. A large "MADONNA AND CHILD", painted on black velvet,
text: hangs above the SHRINE. The MADONNA AND CHILD are BLACK.
text: LT takes this all in. JC startles him.
text: JC is holding a CIGAR BOX. He opens it. It's full of CASH.
text: JC hands it to LT.
speaker_heading: JC
dialog: This should be it. Oh, wait.
dialog: (to an old woman at
dialog: the table)
dialog: Mamacita?
text: MAMACITA takes some VIALS of CRACK out of her APRON.
text: SMILES. JC takes them from her, give them to LT.
speaker_heading: JC
dialog: There. Now you've got your profit
dialog: and more. You'll have more product
dialog: day after tomorrow, right?
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: (very spaced)
dialog: Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna

speaker_heading: JC
dialog: I know.
dialog: (beat - looks at LT
dialog: with concern)
dialog: Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be
dialog: cool.
text: LT nods, puts MAMACITA'S CRACK VIALS in his pocket. He notices
dialog: that --
scene_heading: POV LT - CU - The CIGAR BOX is inlaid with a CROSS, made of
text: costume jewels. Other strange symbols surround it. It could
dialog: be cursed -- or blessed.
text: LT turns to go. The DOOR closes behind him. He's gone.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT: NIGHT - STREET NEAR ARIANE'S APARTMENT
text: LT walks through the streets on the way to ARIANE'S. He
text: carries the CIGAR BOX.
text: Suddenly, a SHOT rings out.
text: ZOOM IN ON - CU LT Horror. Doubtless it was meant for him.
text: LT panics. Freezes. As in a dream, he cannot run.
scene_heading: POV LT - RAPID. ERRATIC. HAND HELD - LT looks for SNIPERS in
text: the anonymous dark WINDOWS on the anonymous darks walls that
text: create the mescarole canyon of the STREET.
text: LT is entirely alone. He is stock-still, victim of his own
dialog: terror.
text: Suddenly. LT can move. He takes out his GUN, presses himself
text: against the nearest WALL. From that position, he hears --
text: A BRASH FEMALE VOICE, coming from somewhere in the darkness.
text: It is almost as loud as the "SHOT".
speaker_heading: BRASH FEMALE VOICE
speaker_heading: (OC)
dialog: Hey motherfucker! Take that backfire
dialog: up the ass!
dialog: LT can't believe that there is no "SNIPER", there was never
dialog: any SHOT. It was a BACKFIRE!
text: ANGLE - The CAR in question passes by. It HONKS, defiantly.
text: Evidently, it is the CAR that had BACKFIRED.
speaker_heading: BRASH FEMALE VOICE
speaker_heading: (OC)

speaker_heading: ARIANE
dialog: Sure, baby Sure And you don't do
dialog: cocaine, either.

speaker_heading: LT

dialog: You gotta believe me!
speaker_heading: ARIANE

speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Just kick back, baby. Make yourself
text: at home.
dialog: (suddenly pissed)
dialog: But of course it won't be nobody's
dialog: home, if you don't come through with
dialog: the fucking rent!
text: LT lays his COAT down on the BED. Puts the CIGAR BOX of MONEY
text: under it.
text: LT sits down near the PHONE. He lights his CRACKPIPE with a
text: MATCH from the MATCHBOOK on which LITE wrote the BOOKIE'S
text: NUMBER. Then he tries to reach the BOOKIE. Some sort of wacky
text: Mob joint answers.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Hello? Is LARGE there?
speaker_heading: MOB VOICE
speaker_heading: (OC)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Look, man. Lite gave ne this number.

speaker_heading: MOB VOICE

speaker_heading: LT REDIALS.

speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Christ! Shit! I could kill them all

speaker_heading: ARIANE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Those fucking Mob assholes.
text: LT makes the strangulation gesture again. ARIANE laughs at

speaker_heading: ARIANE
dialog: C'mere. You got some good blow, right?
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ARIANE
dialog: Then c'mere. I got something for
dialog: you.
text: ARIANE pulls out a pristine NEEDLE. LT comes but flinches
text: at the sight.
text: Apparently BOWTAY overheard that drugs are on the way. BOWTAY
text: appears out of the KITCHEN.
text: BOWTAY sits down near by, awaiting her DOSE.
text: ARIANE starts preparing the DOSE. She's got all the
text: paraphernalia: SPOON. COTTON, a CANDLE FLAME, etc.
speaker_heading: ARIANE
dialog: First I'll put your Uptown in the
dialog: spoon, then, to make it more exciting,
dialog: I'm gonna add some Downtown. They
dialog: call this thing a speedball, honey,
dialog: but then you must know that...
dialog: (beat -- she leans in)
dialog: First time shooting up?
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Nah...
speaker_heading: ARIANE
dialog: Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just
dialog: like that nun. And I'm gonna rape
dialog: you.
text: That decides it for LT. He sits down like a little boy and
text: lets ARIANE shoot him up with the potent mixture of COCAINE
text: and HEROIN.
text: ARIANE shoots up BOWTAY, next.
dialog: They do it on the BED, exploiting all possible erotic
dialog: connotations.
text: When LT rushes, he gets totally paranoid. Jumps at sounds,
text: sneaks to the WINDOW, hears noises that aren't there.
text: Then he flips, and becomes crazy-bold. Opens the DRAPES.
text: Sticks his head out the WINDOW, waves his GUN at specters.
text: Then he becomes shit-scared, again. His behavior is lunatic.
text: ARIANE LAUGHS at his antics.
text: Finally LT becomes wildly sensual. Revealing himself with
text: total abandon. Dances. In the midst of this --
text: The PHONE RINGS LT is seriously startled. Then he realizes
text: who it may be. He slowly answers the phone.
text: LT can hardly speak. He is NUDE, and communicating from
dialog: another world syllable by syllable.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Large?
speaker_heading: LARGE
speaker_heading: (OC)
dialog: All right, cop. I want my money.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: It's still my money. If you want to
dialog: have a chance at any part of it,
dialog: shithead, you will take my $120,000
dialog: and bet on tomorrow's game.
speaker_heading: LARGE
speaker_heading: (OC)
dialog: What about the money you owe me on
dialog: yesterday's game?
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Fuck yesterday's game. The World
dialog: Series is seven games not six. Put
dialog: in my bet.
speaker_heading: LARGE
speaker_heading: (OC)
dialog: Let me think about it.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: There's nothing to think about. Either

dialog: nothing.
text: BIG SILENCE on the PHONE.
speaker_heading: LARGE
dialog: (CO -- lethal)
dialog: Oh, really?
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole,
dialog: man. I'm a fucking cop!
speaker_heading: LARGE
speaker_heading: (OC)
dialog: OK, cop. I want you to give yourself
dialog: and your friends on the force a
dialog: message. Tell them I've got my own
dialog: reasons to be very interested in
dialog: whomever did the job on the nuns.
dialog: I'll double the Church reward if you

dialog: G cash. Get it?
text: LT absorbs this, then bursts out.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Fuck the nuns, man! I'm talking about

speaker_heading: LARGE
speaker_heading: (OC)
dialog: Here's the deal: You meet me tonight

speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
text: LT HANGS UP, turns to ARIANE.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Can you believe the nerve of this
dialog: fucking guy? He kills people for
dialog: fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to
dialog: bring in some guys who raped a nun.
dialog: What a sick fuck. Man...
speaker_heading: ARIANE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: A wiseguy. Paying 100 Grand for the

dialog: to him.
text: ARIANE'S eyes light up.
speaker_heading: ARIANE
dialog: But you could do it, baby. We could
dialog: use the bread...

dialog: twister perfect.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: I got it, man! I will find those
dialog: kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the
dialog: Church! Then the kids'll go to jail.
dialog: I'll be in charge, of course. After
dialog: a little while, I'll break the fuckers
dialog: out -- and I'll turn them in to
dialog: shithead I was just talking to. And
dialog: pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him
dialog: up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it --
dialog: 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of
dialog: course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna
dialog: pick up on the Game tonight -- when
dialog: the Strawberries win!
speaker_heading: ARIANE
dialog: "The Strawberries"?
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: The Mets. So anyway, chalk up another
dialog: 180 G for the Game. Jesus Christ!
dialog: That's almost half a million dollars.
dialog: Ariane! Wait. That's not good enough,
dialog: I'll ask the shithead for 280 G for
dialog: the kids. Then it'll be a perfect
dialog: 500 thousand. Yeah. Perfect. 280 G
dialog: for the kids. Yeah, it's good I
dialog: prepared, or I wouldn't have thought
dialog: to --

speaker_heading: ARIANE

text: He sits down in the same EASY CHAIR in which he nodded out
dialog: the morning of the desecration.

scene_heading: TIME PASSES.

scene_heading: TIME PASSES.
text: VARIOUS ANGLES. High Noon. The NUN is still lying cross.
dialog: Suddenly --
text: LT appears in the doorway, a black silhouette against the
text: white light of noon. For a moment, he watches her from a
dialog: distance.
text: The NUN knows he is there. After a time, she gets up, goes
text: to the altar, kneels. As if waiting for him.
text: LT staggers down the center aisle. He's carrying the CIGAR
text: BOX.
text: LT joins the NUN, kneeling next to her at the altar.
text: ANGLE - The CHALICE is still missing.
text: They are all alone. At the ALTAR, before the CRUCIFIX, LT
text: confronts the NUN face to face. The NUN holds her ROSARY
speaker_heading: BEADS.
text: LT finally speaks. He thinks she'll be turned on by his offer
dialog: of "help".
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Listen to me, Sister, listen to me
dialog: good. The other cops'll just put the
dialog: guys through the system. They're

dialog: I'll beat the system and do justice.
dialog: Real justice. For you.
text: The NUN turns to run.
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: I have already forgiven them.
text: LT is desperate. He lunges forward. Pleads with her.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Come on lady! They put out cigarettes
dialog: on your tits, man! Get with the
dialog: program! Don't you want them behind
dialog: bars? Or away from the world for
dialog: good? How could you forgive these
dialog: motherfu -- excuse me. These guys.
dialog: How could you? Deep down, don't you
dialog: want them to pay for what they did
dialog: to you? Don't you want the crime
dialog: avenged?
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: I have forgiven them.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Nun! These boys still have their
dialog: weapons, Sister. Your forgiveness
dialog: will leave blood in its wake. What
dialog: if they do it to other nuns? Other
dialog: virgins? Old women who die from the
dialog: shock? Do you have the rights let
dialog: these boys go free? Can you bear the
dialog: burden. Sister?
text: The NUN turns to him, simple and pure, pure and simple.
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: I have prayed for days, Lieutenant.
dialog: I have prayed for the souls of the
dialog: boys who raped me. And I have prayed
dialog: for my own soul, too. I know what I
dialog: must do. And I know what I must not
dialog: do.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But you -- you -- it is you who needs
dialog: to pray. Now, why do you want to
dialog: kill these boys? Why -- really?
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: (takes yet another
dialog: tack)
dialog: Look. Sister. No one has to get
dialog: killed. We can solve this together.
dialog: You and me -- as one. These boys are
dialog: lost sheep. Both Catholic -- did you
dialog: know that? And they're sick, Sister.
dialog: With a stress of the mind and of the
dialog: soul. They need help. Not just jail.
dialog: Not just psychiatry. They need the
dialog: help that only the Church can give.
dialog: Please help me to help them. Help me
text: find them before the others do. The
text: night is full of evil men, chasing
dialog: these boys with guns and clubs. We
dialog: have charity and love on our side. I
dialog: know that together, we could find
dialog: them first, even in the dark...
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: The good reasons are not always the
dialog: real reasons. Talk to Jesus,
dialog: Lieutenant. Pray.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You do you believe in God -- don't
dialog: you? That Jesus Christ died for your
dialog: sins?
text: This blows him away. He has nothing to say to that.
text: The NUN has finished her morning prayers.
text: For a moment, she looks deep into LT's eyes.
text: Then she gets up and leaves LT alone in the CHURCH.
text: LT comes face to face with the mammoth CRUCIFIX. He is
text: transfixed.
scene_heading: POV - LT - JESUS on the CROSS.
text: Soon, LT hears a VOICE.
text: LT is not shocked or even surprised. He speaks to JESUS as

speaker_heading: JESUS
speaker_heading: (OC)
dialog: I forgive you.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: JESUS
speaker_heading: (OC)

speaker_heading: JESUS
dialog: I forgive you.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Please. Please don't forgive me.
dialog: I've always hated you for that.
text: POV LT - The CRUCIFIX takes on an hallucinatory radiance.
text: Taking that aura with him, JESUS comes down off the CROSS,
text: and moves toward LT, who is still kneeling at the ALTAR.
speaker_heading: JESUS
dialog: I forgive you.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me!
dialog: Please! Help me!
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
speaker_heading: JESUS
dialog: I forgive you.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash
dialog: the ashes from my forehead, year
dialog: after year after year? And why am I
dialog: still drunk on your blood, the taste
dialog: of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of
dialog: all, why can't I feel the nails in
text: my palms, the spear in my side, the
dialog: crown of thorns round my head? Why
dialog: do I have to know, over and over,
dialog: that it was you. You who died; died

text: JESUS kneels down, knee to knee, face to face with LT.
speaker_heading: JESUS

text: LT averts his eyes. When he looks up again --
text: JESUS is back on the CROSS. Inert, and yet --
text: LT rises, moves around the interior of the CHURCH. He
text: stumbles, struggles, pleads. Falls, rises, falls and rises
text: again -- as if wrestling with an invisible assailant.
text: He collapses in a corner.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to

scene_heading: EPIPHANY. BLOODY CHRIST ON THE CROSS. HALLELUJAH!
text: In the aftermath of his revelation, he notices, cleanly, a

speaker_heading: ALTAR.
text: He staggers toward her. Yes. The ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN has the
speaker_heading: CHALICE!
text: LT grabs the CHALICE. The ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN doesn't let
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: The chalice. Tell me! Who gave it to
dialog: you! Tell me where the fuck you got
dialog: it! Take me there! Now!
text: At first, she doesn't speak at all. LT begins to CRY. Begs
text: her to tell him. Then he wields his PISTOL, repeats his plea.
text: Then breaks into TEARS.
text: She speaks at last.
scene_heading: ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
dialog: I can't tell you.
text: Gun in hand, LT gets down on his knees.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: In the name of God, you must.
scene_heading: ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
dialog: My husband will give me Hell, Mister.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: We've already got Hell, Sister.
text: She meets LT's eyes, seems to understand something. Calmly,
text: she tells him what he needs to know.
scene_heading: ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
dialog: It's very hard. He's a -- you're not
dialog: a cop, are you?
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: No. Not a cop.
scene_heading: ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
dialog: My husband is a fence. He got this
dialog: chalice from a couple of kids. Just
dialog: yesterday, I think. I stole it out
dialog: of his shop so as to return it to
dialog: where it ought to be. It's a holy
dialog: thing, you know. A holy thing.
text: The ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN lets go of the CHALICE. Now LT holds
text: ten CHALICE in his hands, alone. He speaks as if entranced.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: A holy thing.
dialog: (beat -- snaps to)
dialog: Let's go.
text: Suddenly purposive, LT grabs the ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN by the
text: arm. Starts pulling her out of the CHURCH. He holds the
text: CHALICE with the other arm, picks up the CIGAR BOX on his
text: way out. Manages to carry both items.
text: When LT and the ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN reach the door to outside,
text: they both pause to GENUFLECT.
text: Then LT grabs her again and they rush out.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT: AFTERNOON - BARRIO STREETS - EN ROUTE TO THE FENCE
text: LT walks the ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN swiftly through the streets
text: toward the FENCE'S SHOP.
text: He still holds the CHALICE and the CIGAR BOX.
text: PEOPLE watch them pass and make way. As if they realize that
text: something is happening -- on several levels at once. The

text: both English and Spanish. Slowly but surely, the Mets are
dialog: losing.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT: LATE AFTERNOON - THE FENCE'S SHOP

text: POV LT - The GAME is playing on a couple dozen TV's in the
dialog: FENCE'S SHOP' The Mets are still losing!
text: The FENCE, and elderly Black man, is sitting in one of many

speaker_heading: FENCE
dialog: You took the chalice.
scene_heading: ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: FENCE
dialog: You brought it back to the Church.

scene_heading: ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
dialog: Yes.
text: Th» FENCE bursts out LAUGHING.
scene_heading: ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
dialog: Are you all right, honey?
speaker_heading: FENCE
dialog: I was gonna bring it back myself.
text: The ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN is obviously relieved.
speaker_heading: FENCE
dialog: Jesus, woman! What did you think?
dialog: You thought I'd get mad like I did
dialog: that time you took that set of pots
dialog: and pans? That was twenty years ago.
dialog: And how do you compare pots and pans
dialog: and a chalice?
text: LT speaks up suddenly.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: They both hold stuff you eat.
text: After a beat, the FENCE and his WIFE start LAUGHING. LT joins
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: FENCE
dialog: (to LT)
dialog: So what are you doing here?
scene_heading: ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
dialog: He wants to know who brought in the
dialog: chalice.
speaker_heading: FENCE
dialog: That's no mystery. Julio and Paolo
dialog: brought it in,
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You don't want to hurt those boys,
dialog: do you? I mean, they sure as Hell
dialog: have got something coming, but it
dialog: ain't what the Law wants to give

dialog: (beat -- shakes his

dialog: No. How could you understand.
text: The FENCE seems to study LT.
scene_heading: POV FENCE - LT. Wretched.
text: The FENCE thinks again.
speaker_heading: FENCE
dialog: Well -- maybe you do. But I don't
dialog: know where those boys are at right
dialog: now. You'll have to ask around. Those
dialog: boys on the corner'll know. You'll
dialog: have to get it out of them. But they
dialog: know.
text: POV LT - Through the WINDOW of the FENCE'S SHOP, a busy DRUG
speaker_heading: CORNER is visible.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: (spaced)
dialog: Thank you. And I'll make sure the

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT: LATE AFTERNOON - THE STREETS IN THE BARRIO - MONTAGE
text: LT stumbles through the streets, questioning people about
text: "JULIO and PAOLO". No one knows anything. LT stops people at
text: random, getting really desperate. He shows people the CHALICE,
text: asks them if they've seen it before. No one has.
text: LT plays both ADDICT and COP as it suits his needs. By now,
text: he looks more like a homeless man than anything else. But
text: none of his play-acting or lethal threats get him anywhere.
text: The GAME is everywhere, and the Mets are still losing.
text: Finally, LT approaches a hustling STREET DEALER. He cops.
text: The STREET DEALER is wearing a WALKMAN, so the deal goes
text: down in mime.
text: Now, LT speaks and wants to be heard.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Hey -- Have you seen Paolo or Julio
dialog: around?
text: The STREET DEALER uses his WALKMAN and the resulting
text: "deafness" to excuse his total lack of response.
text: LT starts MOUTHING WORDS silently at the STREET DEALER. No
text: response. Then, he -- silently -- begins to shout.
text: The STREET DEALER's alarmed that he seemingly can't hear at
text: all above the WALKMAN music. He moves the WALKMAN away from
text: his ears but doesn't take it off.
speaker_heading: STREET DEALER
dialog: What the fuck you want.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: You know, my Uncle used to wear a
dialog: walkman all the time. The walkman
dialog: looked just like yours. And you look
dialog: something like my Uncle. But one day
text: he was standing in a puddle -- the
dialog: puddle locked just like that one --
text: LT points to a PUDDLE in which the STREET DEALER is now
dialog: Standing.
speaker_heading: STREET DEALER
dialog: And what?
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: And he got electrocuted.
text: The STREET DEALER tries to consider what this crazy guy has
text: just told him, but before the STREET DEALER can even react.
text: LT leans in on him, shows his GUN and then his BADGE.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Look -- I don't know you, and you
dialog: don't know me, but I'm really in the
dialog: mood to kill someone today and you
dialog: are at the end of my gun.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Have you ever had days like that?
dialog: Yeah, you have, so now you understand
dialog: where I'm coming from.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Tell me! Where is Julio and Paolo ?
text: The STREET DEALER answers with absolute ease. That was all
dialog: it was about? No problem.
speaker_heading: STREET DEALER
dialog: They were at that abandoned building
dialog: last night. Second floor. They're
text: probably still there now. It's next
text: to the old Convent. Downtown a ways.
dialog: You know the place...
text: CU. LT - It hits him. The CRACKHOUSE where the kids hang out
text: has always been right next to the CHURCH/CONVENT where it an
text: began! It suddenly makes sense to him.
text: LT completes re transaction, pays the STREET DEALER for the
text: DRUG BAGS. He takes the CASH out of the CIGAR BOX, revealing
text: dozens of thousands of dollars.
text: The STREET DEALER stares at the wretched man with a box full
dialog: of cash.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT: EVENING - EN ROUTE TO THE CRACKHOUSE
text: LT, carrying the CHALICE and the CIGAR BOX, heads back
text: Downtown toward the CRACKHOUSE -- and the CHURCH/CONVENT.
text: In BARS, TV STORE WINDOWS, in snatches of strangers'
text: conversation, the FINAL GAME IS EVERYWHERE. The whole city
text: has stopped to watch it. LT is practically the only person
text: in the street.
text: Worst of all, the Mets are seriously behind. They are
text: definitely LOSING.
text: LT drags himself onward.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT INT: EVENING - THE CRACKHOUSE

text: The other CRACKHEADS race out.
text: There is even a TV in the CRACKHOUSE -- playing the GAME!
dialog: The SOUND is Off. The Mets keep losing. If anything will

dialog: would seem to be it.
speaker_heading: JULIO
dialog: Who the fu--
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Shut up. Let's watch the game.
text: LT sits down next to the KIDS. SMOKES with them, watches the
text: Game. LT must hold the PIPE for them, as they are HANDCUFFED.
text: LT gets them super-high, and himself likewise. He still holds
dialog: his GUN.
text: The KIDS go along with it. Taking it moment to moment.
text: All three, despite the situation, are heavily into the Game.
speaker_heading: LT
dialog: Strawberry...
speaker_heading: PAOLO
dialog: Yeah...

text: The FINAL GAME (SEVEN) is on the RADIO. LT is listening, but
text: also not listening.
text: LT talks wildly about Jesus Christ. And about the misery
text: they pass in the street. He waves his GUN wildly, punctuating
text: his speech with potentially lethal gestures. He aims the GUN

text: then at the KIDS, again.
