speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I don't answer questions, I ask
dialog: 'em...
text: A moment as she continues to stare at his pistol.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I don't think your gun's loaded...
speaker_heading: CATES
text: This is a .44 Magnum, the most
dialog: powerful handgun in the world. You
dialog: gotta ask yourself just one

speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I still don't think it's loaded.

dialog: Then I tried to deck the sucker.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I guess he got the message...
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Then I sit back and I think, I
dialog: mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb
dialog: bitch. I work in a bar, right?
dialog: I can't read a list of my academic

speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Aren't you the one that thinks all

speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I do think all psychotherapy is
dialog: bullshit. But just because I think

dialog: know something about it.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: If this is your idea of

speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Hey, you know what I really think?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I think you're ashamed to tend bar

text: picks up a robe as Elaine gets out of bed on the opposite

speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: You know, if you let me come over
dialog: to your place once in a while, you
dialog: could put on a clean shirt in the

speaker_heading: ELAINE

speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I'm here. And I've been coming

text: She pours some coffee, hands him a cup and saucer... Cates
text: pours some whiskey into it from a flask.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: That's a fairly crummy way to

speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Maybe I got a fairly crummy day
dialog: ahead.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Maybe you don't know what the hell
dialog: you're talking about.
text: Cates picks his holstered .44 off a chair back and begins
text: strapping it on.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: When you start with that
dialog: attitude... it's like I don't know
dialog: who you are.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: What do you want to know? What
dialog: difference does it make? I'm the
dialog: guy in your bed the last three
dialog: months. I make you feel good. You
dialog: make me feel good. What the hell
dialog: else do you want from a guy?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I wish you'd stop trying to make
dialog: me mad so I won't care for you...
dialog: I wish you'd give me a little more
dialog: of a chance.
text: He turns away, moves into the corridor near the stairwell.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I don't have time for this. I
dialog: gotta go to work.

speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Look, I'm glad I'm in your life...

dialog: I figure anything might be
dialog: possible.

text: approaches...
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: You know something, Jack, you
dialog: really are hopeless.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: That's the way I see it, too.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Call me later.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: You sure you want me to?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
text: He moves closer, kisses her..
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Thanks for the coffee.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I think you forgot this. Hands him
dialog: his wallet and badge...
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Guess people ought to know who I
dialog: am...
text: He turns to go down the stairwell...
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Jack, wait. Here...
text: She puts a scarf around his neck.
speaker_heading: ELAINE

dialog: It's cold as hell out these
dialog: mornings, and you know what the

dialog: What the hell's wrong? I didn't
dialog: do anything.
text: Another knock. Ganz makes her move to the door.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What do you want? What's goin' on?
speaker_heading: GANZ
dialog: Shut up.
text: She grabs her dress and tries to pull it on.
speaker_heading: GANZ
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Now ask who it is.
text: Shoves harder with the pistol.
speaker_heading: GANZ
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Come on, ask.
text: She calls out.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: CORRIDOR
text: Vanzant and Algren stand back from the door. Guns held ready.
speaker_heading: ALGREN
text: Police... open up.
speaker_heading: R00M
text: Lisa looks from the door back to Ganz. Then at the gun held
text: against her. She's petrified.
speaker_heading: GANZ
dialog: Stall.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: VANZANT
dialog: Police business. Come on, open up.
text: A smile on Ganz' face. Almost as if he's enjoying the moment.
speaker_heading: GANZ
dialog: Keep stallin'.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
dialog: I'll just be a minute.
speaker_heading: CORRIDOR
text: Vanzant and Algren waiting. Sounds of movement from within
dialog: the room.
speaker_heading: LOBBY
text: Cates moves toward the foot of the stairwell. Looks across at
text: mirror on the wall opposite. The entire lobby covered from
text: this spot. Every angle, including Frizzy.
speaker_heading: ROOM
text: Ganz gestures to Lisa.
speaker_heading: LISA
text: Just a second.
text: Ganz belts her with his gun; she falls..Ganz goes through the
text: connecting door. Slips into the adjacent room.
scene_heading: BILLY'S ROOM
text: Another Hooker cowers in the corner, pulling on her clothes.
text: She's a Mexican girl in a ridiculous 'Indian' outfit.
speaker_heading: MEXICAN GIRL
dialog: Que paso? Que esta pasando? No
dialog: entiendo...
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Shut up.
text: Billy goes to where Rosalie is awkwardlytied to a chair with
text: an electric dord. He pulls her to her feet as Ganz moves by.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: When I say jump, girl, you better
dialog: jump.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (continuing)
speaker_heading: CORRIDOR
text: Vanzant reaches down, tries the knob. Locked. Algren moves
text: back, preparing to kick the door down.
scene_heading: ADJACENT ROOM
text: Ganz opens the door behind the two cops. Raises his pistol
text: and fires. Billy's shots follow immediately. Hits Vanzant.
text: Algren rolls just as Ganz fires again. Wounded, he gets off
text: three shots, then moves inside Ganz' room. Ganz and Billy run
text: for the elevator... Exchange two more shots with Algren. The
text: Mexican Girl begins screaming in Spanish...
speaker_heading: LOBBY
text: Cates draws his .44. Races up the stairs three at a time.
text: Frizzy starts to frantically call the police.
speaker_heading: CORRIDOR
text: Cates stops at the landing. Vanzant's body sprawled across
text: the hallway. Algren back in the corridor, still losing
text: blood... Leans against the wall for support... Lisa staggers
text: out of the room, screams. Algren points the gun toward the
text: elevator. Indicating where Ganz and Billy have just fled.
text: Cates starts back down toward the lobby.
speaker_heading: ELEVATOR
text: Ganz and Billy, guns ready as the carriage jolts downward.
text: Rosalie is terrified, sobbing...
speaker_heading: CATES
text: Arrives at the halfway turn of the second staircase. He takes
text: the next flight in two jumps.
speaker_heading: ELEVATOR
text: As the doors open, Ganz gestures for Billy and Rosalie to
text: wait as he heads for the lobby.
speaker_heading: LOBBY
text: Cates literally flies into the lobby just as Ganz appears. He
text: slams Ganz against a column, belts him across the neck with
text: his pistol. Ganz screams with pain, drops his gun... Cates
text: again slams him with his pistol, felling him...
speaker_heading: GANZ
text: Slides across the floor.
text: CATES Senses something ... moves just as Billy appears behind
text: and fires at him. The bullet takes out a window. Cates dives
text: over the desk. Another bullet chews up the wood.
speaker_heading: LOBBY
text: Frizzy has been standing beside her desk, screaming... Cates'
text: move and the accompanying bulletspanic her. She dashes for
text: safety... Cates gets to his feet behind cover. Sees Billy
text: holding Rosalie by the throat. Frizzy begins to scream.
speaker_heading: GANZ
dialog: He'll blow her goddamn head off.
text: Cates doesn't miss a beat. He slowly levels his .44. Takes
text: careful aim and starts to fire at Billy.
speaker_heading: ROSALIE
dialog: No. No.
text: Cates' shot narrowly misses Rosalie. The bullet smashes into
text: a mirror above Billy's head. Cates keeps moving closer, gun
text: pointed straight ahead. Billy pushes the pistol against
text: Rosalie'temple. For the first time, Cates hesitates. They
text: face each other across the length of the lobby.
speaker_heading: ALGREN
text: Struggles down the remaining steps into the lobby. He still
text: holds his revolver. Dares not raise it towards Billy and
dialog: Rosalie.
speaker_heading: BILLY BEAR
text: Covers Algren from near the entrance. He's confused, doesn't
text: know what to do... He keeps hold of Rosalie.
speaker_heading: GANZ
text: His eyes catch Algren's...
speaker_heading: GANZ
dialog: You. Drop it and we won't kill
dialog: her.
text: Algren tosses his gun to the floor.
speaker_heading: GANZ
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Now, tell him to drop his Goddamn
dialog: piece.
speaker_heading: ALGREN
dialog: Do it, Cates.
dialog: No response.
speaker_heading: ALGREN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Do it, Cates. Goddamn it, do it.
text: Cates lowers his gun. Finally lets it drop to the floor.
speaker_heading: GANZ
dialog: Kick it over here.
text: Cates does; Ganz picks it up, smiles, looks at Billy.
speaker_heading: GANZ
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Get the car.
text: Then back to Cates as Billy runs out the entrance with
dialog: Rosalie.
speaker_heading: GANZ
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Your gun's just like mine.
text: He's going to kill Cates. But first be glances at Algren.
text: Then, almost casually, shoots him twice with Cates' .44.
text: Algren staggers back. Dead before he hits the floor. Cates
text: twists sideways just as Ganz fires. The bullet misses. Again
text: Frizzy starts screaming and struggling. Ganz swipes the woman
text: across the head with the gun. Her body slumps to the floor.
text: Police sirens can be heard in the distance. Cates makes an
text: attempt for Algren's gun. A bullet splatters against the
text: floor only inches from his outstretched fingers. The gun
text: skitters out of reach.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: You lying son of a bitch...
speaker_heading: GANZ
dialog: What are you talking about? We
dialog: didn't kill her ...
text: Ganz smiles.
text: With your own gun, cop. How does it feel? Cates leaps into a
text: wooden phone booth. Ganz leisurely blasts away at the booth
text: with both his and Cates' gun. Two bullets crash into the
text: booth. Ganz moves to check inside the booth but sirens are
text: ominously near. Ganz finally retreats out the entrance.
speaker_heading: STREET
text: Billy and Rosalie weave their way across street to the
text: Cougar. They make a U-turn. Ganz runs out. Car pulls out,
text: then the police cars and vans begin to arrive.
speaker_heading: PHONE BOOTH
text: Chunks of wood on the floor. Shafts of light through a dozen
text: bullet holes. Shattered receiver dangling from a cord. Cates,
text: wedged tight into the very top of the cubicle. He drops to
dialog: the floor.
speaker_heading: LOBBY
text: The police arrive. Swarm into the hotel. All eyes on Cates as
text: he rushes to Algren. Too late... Cates realizes Algren is
text: dead. He cradles Algren's head as he stares at the arriving
text: TAC Squad and Patrolmen.
scene_heading: TRANSITION.
scene_heading: SQUAD ROOM DAY
text: Cates walks in. Several Detectives gather around him.
speaker_heading: FAT COP
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Read the report.
speaker_heading: OLD COP
text: Two cops blown away by a credit
dialog: card booster... that don't figure.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: No shit.
speaker_heading: FAT COP
dialog: They were good cops.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: They were good cops who fucked up
dialog: and got careless.
text: A snotty YOUNG COP paces.
speaker_heading: YOUNG COP
dialog: That's what you say, Cates...
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: YOUNG COP
dialog: But that's what you say about all
dialog: of us all the tine ... we're
dialog: always the ones fucking up when
dialog: you tell it...
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
text: Cates looks at the Old Cop.
speaker_heading: OLD COP
dialog: It don't figure.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I need to borrow a piece.
text: The OLD COP shrugs... looks in his desk...
speaker_heading: YOUNG COP
dialog: Somebody steals your gun, you're
dialog: supposed to file a report.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Are you gonna tell me about police
dialog: procedure? Do me a favor, don't
dialog: give me a bunch of crap.
speaker_heading: YOUNG COP
dialog: I guess when two cops die on
dialog: account of your fuck up you want
dialog: to keep it as quiet as possible...
text: Cates loses it for a second, lands on him with both hands,
text: pushes him against a wall... The room goes quiet. Cates cools
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Just shut the fuck up.
text: The other cops don't intervene. They just watch. Cates cools
text: down, straightens up. HADEN walks by, or, rather, speeds by.
speaker_heading: HADEN
dialog: Cates, I'll need to see you in
text: five minutes, exactly five.
text: The Old Cop hands Cates a gun, a traditional Army .45...
speaker_heading: OLD COP
dialog: Best I can do.
speaker_heading: HADEN
dialog: D'you read me, Cates...
text: Haden continues moving away.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Five minutes. I heard you, your
text: voice carries...
text: As Cates is examining the gun, RUTH, a lab technician, enters
text: and drops three 8 x 10's on the desk near Cates.
speaker_heading: RUTH
text: They're still wet.
text: Cates lifts the blow-ups, each one showing a different aspect
text: of a spent bullet.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Lots of people getting shot with
dialog: .44's lately ... Last year, it was
dialog: Saturday Night Specials..now it's
dialog: heavy stuff. People must be
dialog: getting madder about something.
text: Cates starts pinning the blow-ups onto a large bulletin board
text: on the wall. Nearby, at the same time (within Cates' line of
text: sight, within earshot), Lisa, the Hooker, is being
text: interrogated by a POLICE-WOMAN who pulls the statement off
text: the typewriter. Nearby, the Indian Hooker is being
text: interrogated in Spanish.
speaker_heading: POLICEWOMAN
dialog: You're an accessory to Murder One,
dialog: so you're going to have to do a
dialog: whole lot better than what we got
dialog: down here, honey...
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Gimme a break, huh? ... Look, I
dialog: got there. He was a trick just
dialog: like any other for all I knew.
dialog: That's all there is. He didn't
dialog: feel like sitting and talking. He
dialog: was in a big hurry to get laid.
dialog: I was with him about an hour...
dialog: Cates has gotten interested in the last part of this ...
text: drifts toward her... A DETECTIVE comes through, begins
text: distributing I.B.M. printouts to Cates, the other nearby
dialog: officers..
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: We got a print from the hotel
dialog: room. Guy's real name is Ganz,
text: Albert Ganz. A hitter from back
dialog: East but he worked out here a few
dialog: years back. Armed robbery. Broke
dialog: out of prison two days ago and
text: capped two of the guards. A real
dialog: animal. Wait'll you see this...
text: Cates reads the printout, then smoothly,imperiously, he takes
text: over the questioning of Lisa.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Did he give you a return match?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: He wasn't interested.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Maybe he didn't like your
dialog: performance.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Fuck you.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I'll take a raincheck...
text: From the side, Ruth is pointing at the photos...
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: This'll interest you, Jack...we've
dialog: got something here from your
dialog: gun... and these are from the
dialog: first weapon Ganz used...
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I don't get it.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Here.
speaker_heading: CATES
text: She turns, produces the third photo. Pins it beside the one
dialog: from the Walden Hotel.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: A perfect match for the markings
dialog: from the first gun he used... but
dialog: not from the Walden Hotel... fired
dialog: at least six hours earlier...at
dialog: point blank range... right between
text: the eyes. Found him on a park
dialog: bench...
text: She shows him two more pictures. Police forensics shots of
text: Henry Wong ... very dead on the park bench...
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Ya know, there are some very bad
dialog: people out there in the world.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Look at it this way, Ruth. If
dialog: there weren't, what would there be
dialog: for us to do?
text: Lisa continues with the Policewoman.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Anyway... so I got there and took
text: him down. He started watching
dialog: television and then you
dialog: sensational people started banging
dialog: on the door... that's all...
dialog: except ... he's gonna give you
dialog: guys a hard time.
speaker_heading: CATES
text: Cates looks up as he hears that remark. Notices KEHOE,
text: another Detective, entering with a long suitcase.
speaker_heading: POLICEWOMAN
dialog: What makes you think so?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: I think he liked shooting cops a
dialog: lot more than getting laid.
text: Cates watches Kehoe unpack the box.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Is that what this guy Ganz had in
dialog: the hotel?
speaker_heading: KEHOE
dialog: Every last bit of it. The big
text: guy's room was empty.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I'll help you out.
text: Cates and Kehoe start going through the suitcase. Kehoe
text: produces a speed loader for a .44...
speaker_heading: KEHOE
dialog: This guy must have had a .44 like
dialog: yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Shit.
text: Kehoe next produces several boxes of shells.
speaker_heading: KEHOE
dialog: This cat was real serious about
text: his artillery.
text: An Attendant comes through, hands Kehoe a file. He opens it,
text: shows the file to Cates who reads the name under the mug shot.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Billy Bear...
speaker_heading: KEHOE
text: Backup man from the East Bay.
dialog: Worked with Ganz a few years ago
text: and sprung him from the road gang.
text: Kehoe opens the second file. Four mug shots are inside.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Who are all these?
speaker_heading: KEHOE
dialog: They all pulled a bunch of jobs
dialog: with Ganz about four years ago.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Wait a minute, wait a minute...
dialog: who's this?
speaker_heading: KEHOE
dialog: Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong. He was
dialog: in on the same job.
text: Cates spins the file around so that both Ruth an Kehoe can
text: see it, throws the forensic shots down beside it.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Tell me that's not the same guy.
speaker_heading: KEHOE
dialog: Hey ... Dick Tracy.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Did Ganz have a grudge against his
dialog: old friends?
text: Haden comes out of his office.
speaker_heading: HADEN
dialog: Get in here, Cates.
text: Cates ignores him.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I think I wanna have a discussion
dialog: about it with any of the ones
dialog: still walking. Can we find them?
speaker_heading: KEHOE
dialog: Here's the file. Cates checks the
dialog: file.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: One of em's in the slam.
speaker_heading: HADEN
dialog: Damn you, Cates ... Get in here.
text: Cates walks into Haden's cubicle.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I want to be left alone on this
dialog: one. Algren was killed with my gun.
speaker_heading: HADEN
dialog: Yeah, I read the report...
text: Haden shuffles some papers, seems to ignore Cates.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Hey, the bastard's got my gun. I
dialog: want it back.
speaker_heading: HADEN
dialog: Jack, come on, there is an
dialog: official department policy about
dialog: cop killings. Cop killers
dialog: represent a special priority
dialog: because any man crazy enough to
dialog: kill a cop is a greater threat to
text: an unarmed civilian... In other
dialog: words, we can't seen like we're in
dialog: the revenge business... I know, we
dialog: all know the truth's a little
dialog: different.
text: Cates almost smiles at Haden.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: HADEN
dialog: Anthing botherin' you besides
dialog: losin' your gun?
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Yeah. It bothers me when cops get
dialog: hurt while I'm makin' a play. I
dialog: don't like it.
speaker_heading: HADEN
dialog: You might be more of a team player
text: and a little less of a hot dog on
dialog: this one, Jack.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Being a hot dog's worked pretty
dialog: well for me so far... Besides, I
dialog: got a lead...
speaker_heading: HADEN
dialog: Okay. You're not a team player.
dialog: You gotta do things your own way.
dialog: Fine. Nail this guy and make us
dialog: all look good. But you better
dialog: watch your ass. If you screw up,
dialog: I can promise you, you're goin'
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: You really know how to send a guy
dialog: out with a great attitude. He
text: starts to go.
speaker_heading: HADEN
dialog: Jack?
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: HADEN
dialog: Try not to get your ass shot to
dialog: pieces. We got enough dead cops on
dialog: this one.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I'll keep it in mind.
text: Leaves.
scene_heading: TRANSITION.
scene_heading: CITY STREET
text: Heavy vehicle and pedestrian traffic. Cates stands near a hot
text: dog stand. Elaine joins him. Cates is eating a hot dog and
text: studying a police file.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Great place for lunch.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Yeah, one of my favorites.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: You made the front page.
text: He hands her a dog.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Yeah, Guess it must have been a
dialog: slow news day...
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Jack, are you okay?
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Sure, okay, fine, no problem...
dialog: See, there's this kid in jail ...
dialog: First thing I got to do is go up
dialog: and see what he knows ...
text: He points to the file.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I thought you might come over to
dialog: my place to recuperate. I don't
dialog: have to go to work until the day
dialog: after tomorrow.
text: They begin to stroll down the street.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I got nothing to recuperate from.
dialog: There's a guy out there with my
dialog: gun, and I want it back.
text: She's not happy with this attitude.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Look, spare me the macho bullshit
dialog: about your gun...
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Bullshit? I'll tell you about
dialog: bullshit. My gun's a real weapon
text: in the hands of a real maniac who
dialog: knows how to use it. It isn't my
dialog: macho bullshit that's killing
dialog: people, my gun is ...
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Look, Jack, if you make everything
dialog: your personal responsibility,
dialog: you'll turn into a bad cop. It's
dialog: not a practical way to function...
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I didn't get burned, two cops did.
dialog: Listen, I'll tell you about
dialog: personnel responsibility. I like
dialog: to get the job done right. And if
dialog: I don't get my job done right...
dialog: I'm for shit.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Here it comes again ... the sacred
dialog: job...
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: That's right. I'm not like you.
dialog: I'm not gonna sit on my ass
dialog: wondering what's right and what's
dialog: wrong... There's a psycho out
dialog: there killing people with my gun
dialog: and I'm gonna get him. Because
dialog: it's my job. And if you don't get
dialog: that...
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I get that. The job first.
dialog: Everything else, especially me,
dialog: second. I get it. I don't like it.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: No one asked you to like it... But
dialog: that's the way it is.
scene_heading: TRANSITION.
scene_heading: PRISON CELL BLOCK - DAY
text: Cates and a GUARD on the upper deck approaching the door to
text: the cell block... The Guard shouts upward.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Open Nine.
text: With a huge metal clatters the door to the cell block opens.
scene_heading: CELL BLOCK - NEAR ENTRANCE
text: Cates and the Guard go through the door.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Close Nine.
text: They move forward together.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: It's Number Twenty-two... You want
dialog: company?
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: No, no thanks.
text: The Guard shrugs, stays by the door.
speaker_heading: CATES
text: He walks down the cell block. Inmates stare at him from
text: inside the stark cells. They don't know who he is, but they
text: can smell a cop. Cates stops at Twenty-two, looks inside...
text: a bit startled. Obviously, Reggie Hammond has connections and
text: taste. The paint is fresh; there's framed prints on the wall
text: instead of pin-ups, and the overall feeling is that of a
text: graduate school dorm rather than a prison. Cates turns, nods
text: to the Guard at the end of the cell block. He throws a switch
text: and the door opens.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND'S CELL
text: Cates steps inside. Hammond is at a table wearing a Sony
text: Walkman and writing in some detailed ledgers with a fountain
text: pen. He's boogeying in his seat to the music. Sprawled on a
text: bunk nearby is LEROY, another black inmate close to Hammond's
text: age. Leroy is leafing through a copy of a skin magazine. He
text: doesn't even look at Cates.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Hammond.
text: Cates steps inside the cell.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Hammond!
text: No answer. Cates leans over, hits the override button on the
dialog: Sony.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Hammond!
text: Hammond jumps, grabs his ears in pain ... He pulls the
text: headset off and glares at Cates.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: You got a name, cop?
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Try Cates. And let's talk in
dialog: private, okay?
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Sure, anything you want.
text: He tosses the Walkman to Leroy who dutifully puts it on.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Look, convict, I know all about
dialog: you. Single. No fixed address. No
dialog: known relatives.
dialog: One previous conviction. Armed
dialog: robbery... six months to go on a
dialog: three-year sentence.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: You here to write my life story?
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Not likely, Reggie. Maybe I just
dialog: need some help.
text: Cates takes the forensic photo out of his pocket, passes it
text: across the table to Hammond. He looks at it, hardly reacts.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Henry Wong... My old pal. He's
dialog: looked better...
text: He passes the photo back.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Look, I got just six months before
dialog: gettin' out of here. Six months
dialog: between me and freedom after bein'
dialog: here three years... And I'm not
dialog: gonna do anything to screw it up,
text: includin' pee in the prison yard,
dialog: knock up the Warden's daughter or
dialog: rat on my old partners...
text: Cates swings the cell door back open.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Too bad, Reggie. I thought maybe
dialog: you were a smart boy. But I guess
dialog: if you were real smart you
dialog: wouldn't be a convict.
text: He smiles, decides to play his card.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I can see a second-rater like you
dialog: wouldn't be any help at all goin'
dialog: up against a real hard case like
dialog: Ganz.
text: Hammond jerks his head around.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Ganz?
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Ganz the one who shot Henry?
dialog: Cates, I asked you a question...
text: Cates smiles.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Yeah, I noticed...
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Ganz is in jail. He's gonna be
dialog: there two years after I'm on the
dialog: street.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Didn't work out that way. He
text: busted out with a big Indian.
text: They capped two guards on a road
dialog: gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
text: He turns, goes out. The door clangs behind him. Hammond jumps
text: up and bangs on the bars, shouts at Cates' back...
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Cates, Come back here.
text: Cates turns, saunters back, leans against the door.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: I can deliver Ganz. But you gotta
dialog: get me outta here first.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: You're crazy.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: I can help you, man, but you gotta
dialog: get me out. I got to be on the
dialog: street. Get me outta here.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: What's the big deal about you
dialog: bein' on the street?
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: I got a lot to protect.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Bullshit.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: It's the only way you're gonna get
dialog: Ganz.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I'll think about it.
scene_heading: TRANSITION.
text: Cates typing several of official looking documents while
text: seated across from a rather dour-looking bureaucrat named BOB.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Let me borrow your pen, Bob.
text: Handed over by Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You going to use your own name?
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Shit, no.
speaker_heading: CANDY
text: He begins signing the documents.
speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Hammond, Drop the Goddamn gun.
text: Hammond looks up. He sprints across the pavement. Aims his

speaker_heading: HAMMOND

speaker_heading: CATES

text: and pulls himself into a standing position, cuffs him.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Luther, I always told you the
dialog: physical side of life wasn't your
dialog: gig. Look at you, all messed

speaker_heading: LUTHER
dialog: Haven't seen him for years. That's

speaker_heading: CATES

speaker_heading: LUTHER
dialog: Who gives a fuck what you think?

speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Hey, this works pretty good.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Want to try it again?

speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: I gotta tell you he's having a
dialog: ball with this car door, Luther...
dialog: You'd better think of somethin' to
dialog: tell him.
text: Luther besitates...flashes a look at Hammond, who sends him
text: a silent fleeting reply. Maybe Cates sees this. Maybe not.
speaker_heading: LUTHER
dialog: He ... he wants me to help him
dialog: skip town.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: When? How?
speaker_heading: LUTHER
dialog: I dunno ... he's gonna call me...

speaker_heading: LUTHER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: He's gonna call me on...Tuesday.
text: Something's wrong with all this. Cates isn't sure just what.
text: Not yet. He looks at Hammond.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: I think you better put him on ice,
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: He's gotta take that call ... if
dialog: there is one.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: If you let him run around till
dialog: Tuesday, he's gonna run right to
dialog: Ganz and warn him. Ain't you,
dialog: motherfucker?
text: Luther makes a play toward Hammond, who laughs, doesn't even

speaker_heading: HAMMOND

dialog: Luther, are you angry with me?

speaker_heading: CATES

speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Now how's your memory doin'?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Fuck off. I don't know what the

speaker_heading: HAMMOND

text: roll of bills. Hammond holds the money up to his face.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: You're in trouble, big trouble, so

speaker_heading: PUNK
dialog: It's mine, what the hell...
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: You must a rolled somebody. They
dialog: don't let punks like you take jobs
dialog: that pay this much ... you sure
dialog: you don't know a dangerous Indian,
dialog: because unless you start talkin'
dialog: I may just have to start looking
dialog: down your pants with a

speaker_heading: PUNK
dialog: What kind of cop are you, anyway?
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: I am your most terrible nightmare
dialog: ... a bad nigger with a badge that
dialog: entitles him to kick your ass...
text: Hammond turns to the Bartender...
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: (continuing)
text: One of them is under-age. Another
dialog: attacked a police officer. And you
dialog: know I ain't found what I came
dialog: lookin' here for yet...
text: Walks back to the Bartender.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: The tall one had a weapon ... you
dialog: want me to keep on makin' a list,
dialog: or you got the picture yet?
text: He reaches for a towel under a pyramid of bar glasses. Jerks
text: the towel, the pyramid capsizes onto the floor. Huge crash as
text: the glasses break into a million fragments.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Looks like you're on your way to
dialog: bein' outta business, redneck...
dialog: Now, let's see what can we fuck
dialog: with next?
text: The Bartender doesn't have the look of a happy man.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Okay, okay. The Indian hangs out
text: with a girl down the block. Right
text: where Chinatown starts. She lives
text: on top of the hardware store.
text: Hammond turns, grins at Cates. As far as he's concerned, he's
text: won the bet. Cates nods, slips out the door.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: I don't give a damn about his
dialog: girl...
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Look, give me a break, you're
dialog: going to have to settle for her
dialog: place. It's the only thing I know.
text: He looks desperate.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Try obeyin' the law once in
dialog: awhile, and I won't have to hassle
dialog: you...
text: Turns to go, then turns back.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: But remember this, cowboy, there's
text: a new sheriff in town.
text: Smiles, turns and goes.
scene_heading: TRANSITION.
scene_heading: STREET - ACROSS FROM TORCHIE'S - NIGHT
text: Hammond steps out of the bar. He crosses to Cates by the car.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I think you got something for me.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: The gun you took off that redneck
dialog: in there.
text: Hammond smiles.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: You made that move, huh?
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: While you're at it, You can give
dialog: me the switchblade, too.
text: Hammond reluctantly takes out a .22 automatic, slams it down
text: on the hood of the car.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Credit cards?
text: Hammond hands them over with the knife.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: You already got a gun and you owe
dialog: me a piece of ass. I'll settle
dialog: for the gun you just took.
text: A long moment. Then Cates slowly lifts the .22 automatic.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: You did a real good job... Guess
dialog: you deserve a reward.
text: Removes the clip. Throws it across the street. Hands Hammond
dialog: the automatic.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Motherfucker.
text: He throws the gun away.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I sure am. Now let's go get us an
dialog: Indian.
text: They walk up the block.
scene_heading: TRANSITION.
scene_heading: STREET - CHINATOWN - NIGHT
text: Neon signs with Sino lettering.
scene_heading: CATES AND HAMMOND
text: Walk down the street, spot a shop with a window display of
text: tools. Look up at the darkened apartment windows. They walk
text: to the end of the block.
speaker_heading: ALLEY
text: Stairwells lead to each apartment above the shops. Cates and
text: Hammond move along the buildings... Arrive at the back of the
text: hardware store. Quietly, they start to ascend the stairs.
speaker_heading: STAIRWELL
text: The metal steps extend onto a platform by the back door.
text: Cates leans over the railings to look through the adjacent
text: window. Between the drawn curtains, a flickering glimmer from
text: a TV set. On the tube, various poses from stridently
text: exercising women.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: What the shit is that?
text: Looks again. A female form passes by, goes out of the room.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: There.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Must be billy's girl.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: DOORWAY
text: Cates gestures to the door lock. Hammond fiddles with it for
text: several moments. The door swings open. They step into a
text: darkened room.
speaker_heading: APARTMENT
text: Cates takes the .38 from his pocket. He stops near the open
text: bedroom doorway. He looks at Hammond and then both men step
text: quickly into the room.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Police! Nobody move!
text: Hammond reaches for the light switch. Takes a heavy blow.
text: Slumps against the door. A Woman's voice screams out.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Stay where you are!
text: The light goes on. Cates' gun points at a YOUNG WOMAN (CASEY)
text: in a flimsy dressing gown. Saturday Night Special held
text: between her palms, police style... A SECOND WOMAN (SALLY)
text: stands beside Hammond at the light switch. Larger and
text: slightly older than the first, she wears a man's shirt. Holds
text: a baseball bat in her right hand.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: You better drop it or he's gonna
dialog: get another one.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Hey, talk to here jack. I don't
dialog: feel like gettin' number two along
text: side of the head.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I said police. Now drop the
dialog: goddamn gun.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Don't give me that police shit.
dialog: You drop it.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Okay, look, don't shoot. I'm just
dialog: reachin' for my badge.
text: Cates takes out his badge-Shows it to Casey.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: I don't like this bullshit. I've
dialog: seen fake badges before.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: I'll tell you something lady, this
dialog: guy is a real nervous cop - He's
dialog: just liable to pull the trigger.
text: Cates takes two steps toward Casey...
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Naw, I'm the calm type. I know
dialog: you don't want me to shoot you,
dialog: and I know that you don't want to
dialog: shoot me.
text: He takes two more steps toward her.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Shooting a cop puts you away for
dialog: a long time.
text: Holds out his hand.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: You assholes better be real.
text: She hands Cates the gun. Sally prods Hammond with the
text: baseball bat.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Just wait a Goddamn second here,
dialog: let's see your badge...
text: He snatches the bat out of her hands.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Don't have one.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I knew it. Call the cops.
text: Casey walks over to the phone.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Tell them it's Cates, Detective
dialog: 31st District. Then put your
dialog: clothes on. If you don't answer
dialog: some questions I'm taking both
dialog: your asses in.
text: After a moment, Casey puts down the phone.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Now, let's cut out the crap, which
dialog: one of you sees Billy Bear?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: None of your business, cop. The
dialog: son of a bitch isn't here, and he
text: isn't coming back.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: You can do better than that.
text: Turns to Casey.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: How about it?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: I used to go with him...I don't
dialog: know where the hell he is. I
dialog: haven't seen him for two weeks.
dialog: And I don't think I will. He owes
dialog: me money...
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: He's a Goddamn lowlife, the way he
dialog: treated her.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Sounds like a real stormy romance.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: I don't much care what it sounds
dialog: like to you, Cop. All I know is
dialog: that I went a few laps around the
dialog: track with him and I ended up with
dialog: nothin' but the short end of the
dialog: stick.
text: Cates looks over at Hammond.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Let's go.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Wait a minute. Maybe these ladies
dialog: would like to go a few laps with
dialog: us. How about it? I been nearly
dialog: three years in prison and...
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Fuck off.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Come on...
text: Hannond starts for the door with Cates.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: If you find that bastard, Billy,
dialog: tell him to stay out of my life.
dialog: I don't need any more of his macho
dialog: bullshit.
scene_heading: TRANSITION.
scene_heading: STREET CHINATOWN - NIGHT
text: The two men walk among the bright neon lights. Neither of
dialog: them very happy.
speaker_heading: CATES
text: This sucks. A maniac gets hold of
dialog: my gun and goes all over the
text: streets killing people with it.
dialog: So, instead of me being where I
dialog: oughta be, which is in bed giving
dialog: my girl the high, hard one, I'm
dialog: out here doing this shit, roaming
text: around with some overdressed,
dialog: charcoal-colored loser like you.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: You wanna leave, man? Let me take
dialog: care of Ganz all by myself.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: You? Don't make me laugh. You
dialog: can't take care of shit. You've
dialog: been dicking me around since we
dialog: started on this turd-hunt. All
dialog: you're good for is games... So
dialog: far, what I got outta you is
dialog: nothin'...
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: I'm impressed with you too, Jack
dialog: you did a real good job of busting
text: up a couple of dykes bedded down
dialog: for the night.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Luther knew more than he told me
dialog: and so do you...Now you better
dialog: tell we what the fuck this is all
dialog: about. I gave you 48 hours to
dialog: come up with something and the
dialog: clock's runnin' ...
text: A long look at Hammond.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Who gives a Goddamn what you
dialog: think? You're just a crook that's
dialog: got a weekendpass ... You're not
dialog: even a name anymore. Just a spear-
dialog: chucker with a Goddamn number
text: stenciled on the back of his
dialog: prison fatigues...
text: They walk past.
scene_heading: TRANSITION.
scene_heading: STREET ACROSS FROM TORCHIE'S - NIGHT
text: They two men walk toward the Cadillac.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Okay, Reggie, I'm done playing
dialog: around. I want to know what's
dialog: going on and I'm going to beat the
dialog: living shit out of you until you
dialog: tell me.
text: Hammond goes into a street rap.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: You beat the shit out of me?
dialog: Don't make me laugh, sucker. You
dialog: don't know how I'd dance on your
dialog: face? I'll hit you so hard, so
dialog: many times, you'll wish you'd
dialog: never been hatched. I'll turn
dialog: your face into cottage cheese.
dialog: I'll make your girl think you been
dialog: takin' ugly pills. She won't even
dialog: know who you are, sucker.
text: They stop by the car. Cates takes the gun out, lays it on the
text: hood. Hammond stares at him. Cates next takes out his
text: wallet, shows Hammond his badge, then lays the badge on the
text: car fender... Smiles.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I guess the first thing I ought,
dialog: to explain to you, nigger, is I
dialog: fight dirty.
text: Hits Hammond a tremendous right hand full in the face.
text: Hammond sags, grabs onto the car fender for support. Cates
text: hesitates ... and Hammond kicks out, sending the partially
text: open car door slamming into Cates. Cates sprawls.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: So do I.
text: Hammond aims a kick at Cates' head. Cates blocks it with
text: crossed forearms, grabs, twists. Hammond tumbles, rolls away
text: from Cates. Both men struggle to their feet, circle each
dialog: other.
text: Hammond moves in only to receive twoquick blows from Cates,
text: a bit sooner than he expected. Cates smiles.
text: Hammond dances in and out... Cates' breathing becomes more
text: labored. His windmill attack penetrates Cates' defense. Cates
text: clears his head, charges, bull-like ... His rush and greater
text: bulk send both of them crashing into some trash cans and a
text: brick wall.
dialog: Hammond is faster...
text: Cates is much stronger; Both men on their knees. They look at
text: one another. Silently, they move to their feet. Hammond's
text: back is to a wall... Cates keeps him there, negates the
text: lighter man's agility. They slug away, each now arm-weary...
text: Exchange a dozen blows. Finally, Cates steps back, arms at
text: his side... Breath coming like a bellows...
text: Hammond has to hold on to the wall; one more punch would put
dialog: him out.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Now, you bastard, you going to
dialog: tell me what's going on...
text: Puffing away.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ... Do I have to kick the shit out
dialog: of you some more.
text: They stand facing one another. Hammond smiles. A black-and-
text: white comes roaring up the street. Sirens howling, red lights
text: flashing, it slides to a stop. TWO UNIFORMED COPS jump out,
text: guns drawn.
speaker_heading: FIRST COP
dialog: All right, you two. Don't move.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: NO, no...it's okay...I'm police.
speaker_heading: SECOND COP
dialog: Yeah, sure. Get your hands above
dialog: your head.
text: He keeps his gun trained on Cates,and Hammond.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: My gun and badge are over there.
dialog: And I'm too fucking tired to raise
dialog: my hands...
text: Hammond rubs the side of his face. Cates falls back against
text: the patrol car. Still fighting for breath. The First Cop
text: lifts Cates' wallet off the Cadillac and looks at his badge,
text: shows it to the other cop.
speaker_heading: FIRST COP
dialog: What the hell's going on here?
text: Cates walks over, pockets his gun.
speaker_heading: SECOND COP
dialog: I've got a burglary call. Two
text: women say a couple of hoods broke
text: into their place posing as cops.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I was following a lead. We
dialog: rousted them... Go up and sweet
dialog: talk 'em. You can straighten it
dialog: out.
text: The First Cop checks out Cates' badge and I.D.
speaker_heading: FIRST COP
dialog: Why don't you do it? We got
dialog: better things to do than
dialog: straighten out your messes.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: So do I. I'll file a report
dialog: tomorrow.
text: The First Cop takes out his book, starts writing. He's
dialog: pissed.
speaker_heading: FIRST COP
dialog: I gotta file a..Report tonight
dialog: asshole...
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Goes with the territory.
text: He grabs Hammond and they head for the Cadillac.
scene_heading: TRANSITION.
scene_heading: ALL-NIGHT GAS STATION
text: Cadillac parked behind the service area.
speaker_heading: RESTROOM
text: Hammond looks' up at his bruised face in the mirror, then
text: washes up. Cates is one step ahead of him. He rolls up a
text: piece of the wet towel and inserts it over his bleeding gum.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Too bad we got interrupted when we
dialog: did. I was getting ready to
dialog: finish you off.
text: Cates straightens up from the wash basin.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Yeah, right. You want to try
dialog: again?
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Naw, you'd just call your pals
dialog: back to bail you out one more time.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: They saved your ass, convict.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: One thing's for sure, Jack.
dialog: That's how you'll tell the story.
text: Cates dries off his face, starts out of the washroom.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I'll even put it in my report that
dialog: way.
text: The door closes behind Cates. Hammond leans back toward the
text: mirror, nudges a tooth with his finger.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Motherfucker.
scene_heading: GAS STATION PARKING LOT
text: Cates leans on the Cadillac as Hammond emerges. Hammond
text: starts for the passenger side.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Wait a minute.
text: Hammond stops.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You come clean or we're going to
dialog: go again. Right here, right now.
dialog: Pause.
text: A long moment; Hammond decides be has no choice.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: I been waiting a long time for
dialog: some money.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: How much?
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Half a million.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Jesus.
text: Hammond smiles his meanest smile.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: How's that for a number to give
dialog: you heart failure? Guess you might
dialog: start to get the picture after
dialog: all. Mlaybe you're on the wrong
dialog: side of the old law and order
dialog: business..
text: Cates is unmoved.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Just tell me about the money.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Me and my bunch hit a dealer in
text: the middle of a sale. It's the
dialog: kind of money nobody ever reports
dialog: stolen. I was sittin' pretty,
dialog: livin' in the high cotton, then
dialog: somebody fingered me for another
dialog: job. ... Some psycho who's out
dialog: there capping people with some
text: cop's gun.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: He's after your money.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: You catch on real fast...Okay,
dialog: Jack, let's talk deal. How much of
dialog: my money you gonna let me keep?
text: Cates just looks at him.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: We split 50-50?
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Not likely, convict.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: You gonna let me keep any of it?
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Depends on how things work out. I
dialog: believe in the merit system. So
dialog: far you haven't built up any
dialog: points.
text: He smiles.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Okay, from now on, I'm gonna be
dialog: real good, Jack.
text: Cates smiles back.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Where's the money?
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
text: In the trunk of a car. A lot
dialog: better than under a mattress,
dialog: right?
text: Cates smiles.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Right, partner.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Get this. We ain't partners. We
dialog: ain't brothers. We ain't friends.
dialog: If Ganz gets away with my money,
dialog: you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Yeah. Right.
text: They get into the Caddy. Boom away.
scene_heading: TRANSITION.
text: The Cadillac moving through the city... Clock on the
text: dashboard showing 4 a.m. Cates at the wheel.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Where's the goddamn car?
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: You're a real case, you know that,
dialog: Jack?
text: Smiles.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: This'll show you how smart I am.
dialog: I got it parked.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: ...For three years? Let's hope it
dialog: wasn't a tow-away zone.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: You just drove by it.
text: The Cadillac makes a screeching U-turn,i swings into the curb.
text: Cates leans out, looks at...
scene_heading: PARKING BUILDING
text: Narrow, multi-storied, with a garage-like opening and
dialog: signals... proclaiming 'Weekly-Monthly-Long Term."
speaker_heading: CADILLAC
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Okay, now what?
text: Hammond gets out of the car.
text: Stands on the sidewalk.
dialog: Stretches.
text: Then gets into the back seats.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Since you're wired on benniest you
dialog: get to stay up and stare at the
dialog: building. I'm tired, so I'm going
text: to sleep. They take Sunday off.
text: Place opens at seven o'clock
dialog: Monday morning. Wake me up at a
dialog: quarter till...
text: Cates stares at the place.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: You son of a bitch. You knew where
dialog: the money was all along and all we
dialog: had to do was come here and wait.
dialog: I almost got my ass blown off
dialog: twice tonight for nothing.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: I wasn't sure the money was still
dialog: there until we saw Luther. You
dialog: almost got your ass shot off for
dialog: nothing once, not twice, Jack.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: THE CITY
text: Beyond the skyline, grey streaks of dawn etch the sky.
scene_heading: TRANSITION.
text: The Cadillac is pulled up facing the streets down the block
text: from the parking sections Cates walks in through the lot
text: entrance. Threads his way between the lines of parked
text: vehicles Tired and haggard, he carries a paper bag filled
text: with quick-order food.
speaker_heading: CADILLAC
text: Hammond stretches on the back seat. Cates slams the door
dialog: shut.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I don't want you sleeping on the
dialog: job.
text: Hammond yawns, eases himself into a sitting position.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
text: The place opens in five minutes.
dialog: Ganz ought to be here soon...
text: Cates tears the paper bag open. Passes a cup of coffee and
text: donut back. He sips his own coffee, adds some whiskey from
text: his flask... pops another bennie.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: You took a big chance, leaving
dialog: this here all this time.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Not really. I figured Ganz was
dialog: put down for a long time. And I
dialog: knew Luther would never job me on
dialog: his own. He's too chickenshit.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Guess what? Luther just got in
dialog: line.
text: Hammond sits up.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Musta got some primo bondsman.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Jesus Christ. That's a disgrace
text: The guy pulls a gun on a cop and
dialog: he's out in 24 hours. I tell you
dialog: some of the courts these days are
dialog: just a fucking revolving door.
scene_heading: INT. PARKING LOT BUILDING
text: Luther walks up to the window where a bored ATTENDANT reads
text: a comic book.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: LUTHER
dialog: I want to pick up my car.
text: He passes across a faded form.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: Name?
speaker_heading: LUTHER
dialog: Hammond.
text: The Attendant examines the form, surprised.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
text: This is three years old.
speaker_heading: LUTHER
dialog: Yeah, I've been busy.
text: The Attendant opens a key file, begins rummaging in it.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: We don't wash 'em, ya know.
speaker_heading: LUTHER
dialog: How about chargin' the battery?
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: That we do. And we put air in the
dialog: tires. I'll even sell you some gas
dialog: if you need it.
speaker_heading: LUTHER
dialog: Great, just great.
text: The Attendant finds the key, exits the booth. Luther follows
text: to an elevated stack of cars. The Attendant throws a switch,
text: the stack of cars begins to move.
speaker_heading: STREET
text: Luther drives down the exit ramp in a dated Porsche
dialog: convertible.
text: The car is covered with a uniform coat of dust, except for
text: the windshield which has been wiped hastily clean.
text: Luther waits for a break in the flow of traffic, drives out.
dialog: Another street
text: Luther turns onto a side street and then suddenly Cate's
text: Cadillac appears ... starts to tail the Porsche.
speaker_heading: CADILLAC
text: Cates follows Luther through several turns.
text: The Porsche jerks whenever it speeds up or slows down.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Jesus Christ, look at all the dust
dialog: on my car...why in the hell don't
dialog: he take it to a car wash?
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Didn't know you darker people went
dialog: in for foreign jobs.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: I had no choice. Some white
dialog: asshole bought the last piece of
dialog: shit skyblue Cadillac.
scene_heading: ANOTHER STREET
text: The Caddy follows the Porsche.
scene_heading: INT. CADDY
text: As they follow Luther.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: You'd think the guy'd be smart
text: enough to know he was being tailed.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's
dialog: in another world.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: If I was his size and had Ganz on
dialog: my ass, I'd just leave town.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: I'm tellin' you the man's in
dialog: love... he wants to be a hero for
dialog: his girl.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make
dialog: you stupid?
scene_heading: ANOTHER STREET
text: The Caddy follows the Porsche.
text: As they follow Luther.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I suppose you'd never be like
text: Luther and let a woman get to
dialog: you...
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: I let women get to me. The quest
dialog: for pussy is the meaning of life
dialog: ... I got my own personal
dialog: philosophy about 'em. Keep women
dialog: separate from guns, money and
dialog: business ... women are for
dialog: spending money. They got nothing
dialog: to do with helping you make it.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: That ain't philosophy. That's
dialog: common sense.
scene_heading: ANOTHER STREET
text: The Caddy follows the Porsche.
scene_heading: INT. CADDY
text: As they follow Luther.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Say, do you always work people

speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: If they don't tell me what I need
dialog: to know...
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Doesn't it get... Tiring?
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I'm not in this 'cause it's fun.
dialog: I'm not into hitting guys 'cause
dialog: it makes me feel good either... I
dialog: do it 'cause it works-...
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: You got a very depressing view of

dialog: in awhile...
scene_heading: ANOTHER STREET
text: The Caddy follows the Porsche.
scene_heading: INT. CADDY
text: As they follow Luther.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give
dialog: him a piece of your money...
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: If he's hoping that then he's

text: He opens his jacket slightly. Reveals a shoulder holster and
text: accompanying .45. A long moment.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I don't know why, but I'm going to

dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Thanks for callin' in... and I

speaker_heading: LUTHER

speaker_heading: GANZ

speaker_heading: BILLY BEAR

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Ganz!
speaker_heading: THE CADDY

speaker_heading: GANZ
text: Smashes a side window with the two handguns.
text: Blasts away.
text: Cates driving with one hand as he draws his gun.
speaker_heading: CATES

text: Yanks him close. Throws the wheel over ...
speaker_heading: CADDY
text: Swerves as bullets pepper the passenger side. Stuffing flies

speaker_heading: THE BUS
text: Roars away...
speaker_heading: THE CADDY
text: Skids into a traffic sign, demolishing some newspaper

speaker_heading: CATES

speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Don't worry about it.

speaker_heading: CATES

speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Who the hell are you?
speaker_heading: HAMMOND

speaker_heading: ELAINE

speaker_heading: STRAGGLER
dialog: You can't do this. It's against...
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Hey, just fuck off. My friends

text: Elaine finishes drying a glass and approaches.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You real down?
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I've been better...Dead end. No

speaker_heading: CATES

dialog: station. Docks... Shit...
speaker_heading: ELAINE
text: Ganz is going to be hard to track.
dialog: Just a pure schizo ... wires all
dialog: crossed... totally without any
dialog: pattern... kill anybody... The
dialog: Indian... himself... anybody...
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Jack, it's all over the papers.
dialog: He's an obvious type. But this
dialog: Indian...
text: Hammond cuts in.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: He was the only one of my bunch
dialog: that was my friend... He was
dialog: loyal, went all the way for you...
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: In all due respect, he sounds kind
dialog: of pathetic to me. The kind of
text: guy that runs home to his momma or
dialog: some girlfriend. Have you two ace
dialog: detectives checked that out?
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Yeah, well the only woman of the
dialog: Indian's we ran into was shacked
dialog: up with her dyke girlfriend. I
dialog: guess she went with him before she
dialog: came outta the Closet ... They
dialog: both looked mad enough to kill
dialog: him...
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Yeah, too bad. They were real
dialog: nice lookin' too...In bed
dialog: together, hardly any clothes one
dialog: watching TV...
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: What makes you think they were
dialog: lesbians, or as you so quaintly
dialog: put it, dykes?
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Come on, they were a little old
dialog: for a slumber party.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: It might pay to reexamine a few of
dialog: your more primitive notions. I
dialog: was in bed with a girlfriend
dialog: watching TV last week, Jack, and
dialog: one thing we know about me is I
dialog: happen not to be a lesbian ...
dialog: Now, if this Indian's girlfriend
dialog: got upset when you came looking
dialog: for him, it could just be she's
text: still vulnerable to him.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: So what?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: When a guy hurts you, then comes
text: back bleeding on his hands and
dialog: knees, who knows, he might just be
text: irrestible.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Hey, Come on, shrink time's over.
dialog: They wouldn't go see some old
dialog: girlfriend.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Oh, yeah, well look where you came
dialog: when you were down and out.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: She's got a point there, Jack.
text: Smiles. Cates reflects for a moment.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: It's the only thing we got.
text: He looks at Elaine.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Whaddya think?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: What do I know? I'm just a

speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Let's go, Reggie.
text: He kisses Elaine.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND

speaker_heading: HAMMOND

speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Whatever play I maker just back me
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: If we run into Billy first, let me
dialog: try and talk him in.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Sure, I'll give you a shot at it,
dialog: but Ganz is mine. You know, that
dialog: big Indian plays it for keeps...
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't
dialog: no sweetheart... I wouldn't like
dialog: it if this partnership ended
text: before it gets started.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Partnership?
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Well, you got to admit we come a

speaker_heading: CASEY

speaker_heading: CATES

speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Don't kill him. Please, just

speaker_heading: CATES

speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Yeah. Sure, i'm crazy in love
dialog: with him, who wouldn't be...
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: You're gonna help us take him.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: No chance.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: He can live or die ... You let us
dialog: in and he's got a chance to make
text: it. Otherwise, he gets ventilated.
text: Casey's face is seared with pain at the thought of Billy
dialog: dying.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: If you help use he's got a chance,

speaker_heading: CASEY
text: Billy's in the first room off the

speaker_heading: CASEY
text: In the back. Down the other

text: Cates looks at Reggie.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Looks like you're gonna get your
dialog: chance.
text: They move upward...
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Cates is stealthily going to the end of the second corridor
text: of the kitchen and living room area. That corridor turns at
text: a sharp angle and goes to the back. Hammond is at the very
text: front of that first corridor..at a door ... he shoves it back.
scene_heading: INT. FIRST BEDROOM
text: There is a bed and Rosalie, undressed, is in it... Billy is
text: seated on the edge of it... pants on, shirt off, pulling on

speaker_heading: ROSALIE
dialog: Don't let him hurt met Billy.

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: He won't hurt you. He ain't gonna

dialog: me.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: I'm tellin' ya, Billy, give it up.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I never was much for bein'
dialog: rehabilitated.
text: Billy looks at Hammond. With lightning sudden quickness, he
text: reaches and produces a huge Bowie knife from behind his back.
text: Billy smiles, laughs...then with a sudden, awful roar, he
text: leaps at Hamnond who unflinchingly fires his pistol. The big
text: slugs stop Billy cold and throw him back against the bed as
text: Rosalie shrieks.
scene_heading: INT. BACK BEDROOM
text: Ganz, half-dressed, asleep, gun in hand, throws himself off
text: the bed, pushes Sally out of the way ... opens the door and
text: starts firing furiously down the corridor... He grabs the

scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR/DOOWAY TO BACK BEDROOM
text: Cates has ducked the bullets ... he is inching toward the
dialog: door...
text: He pulls it open...Ganz from the window fires another shot
text: which almost gets him then vanishes down the fire escape...
scene_heading: INT. BACK BEDROOM
text: Sally gets to her feett yelling, runs at Cates as he appears

scene_heading: EXT. DOORWAY AT END OF ALLEY

speaker_heading: GANZ

scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET
text: Cates comes out of the doorway from which he's fired...and
text: comes into the middle of the street, gun up ... he puts it
text: down when he sees Ganz with Hammond in jeopardy. The hand
text: that's around Hammond's throat also holds the black bag.
text: Cates walks forward, his gun down at his side...
speaker_heading: GANZ
dialog: After I get outta this, cop...I'm
dialog: gonna live forever...
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: I don't think you're gonna make it.
speaker_heading: GANZ

dialog: everything...
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Give up. He's crazy. He'll kill

text: They are now closer to each other. Ganz holding Hammond and
dialog: the money...
speaker_heading: GANZ
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Okay, cop ... give me your gun and
dialog: I'll let him live. Come on, Cates,
dialog: you're real good at giving up your
dialog: gun.
text: Cates keeps the same methodical pace...
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Sure...
text: Suddenly, he crouches and fires twice. Hammond twists as Ganz
text: also fires. Ganz is hit in the collarbone and driven ten feet
text: backward. His grip on Hammond drops, Hammond dives to the
text: ground, looks at Cates.
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Jesus Christ, I didn't think you'd
dialog: really do it. You are crazy.
text: Ganz' gun still in his hand, but his arm useless at his side.
text: Cates is frozen in the crouch, ready to fire again.
text: Ganz is in enormous pain holding his bleeding chest... A look
text: of childish disbelief passes over his face.
speaker_heading: GANZ
dialog: I got hit. I can't believe it. I
dialog: got shot.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: You're done. End of story.
speaker_heading: GANZ
dialog: I ain't gonna beg for my life. It
dialog: ain't cool.
text: He runs at Cates full-speed, screaming, roaring, then is
text: stopped by two more bullets that tear fist-sized holes in his
text: chest. Cates rises from his crouch. Takes his gun out of
text: Ganz' now lifeless hand. Then goes over to Hammond...
speaker_heading: HAMMOND
dialog: Yours?
text: Cates raises the pistol.
speaker_heading: CATES
dialog: Mine...
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: CATES
