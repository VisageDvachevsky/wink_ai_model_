speaker_heading: A COLLEAGUE
dialog: This venture is impossible.
scene_heading: CHARLES KINGSLEY
dialog: For some. Gentlemen, the only way to

speaker_heading: A COLLEAGUE
dialog: That kind of thinking could ruin you.
scene_heading: CHARLES KINGSLEY
dialog: I’m willing to take that chance.
dialog: Imagine trading posts in Rangoon,

text: He stops. His nine year-old daughter ALICE stands at the

speaker_heading: CHARLES KINGSLEY (CONT’D)

scene_heading: CHARLES KINGSLEY
text: Blue caterpillar. Hmm.
speaker_heading: ALICE

speaker_heading: HELEN KINGSLEY (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: ALICE

speaker_heading: HELEN KINGSLEY
dialog: But you’re not properly dressed.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Who’s to say what is proper? What if

speaker_heading: HELEN KINGSLEY
dialog: Alice.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: To me a corset is like a codfish.
speaker_heading: HELEN KINGSLEY

scene_heading: EXT. THE ASCOT ESTATE - THE GARDENS - DAY 6
text: The garden party is in full swing. Everyone has turned out
text: in their summer finery. Guests play croquet on the great

text: Alice approaches LORD and LADY ASCOT with a fixed unnatural
text: smile. Lord Ascot is a stately, aristocratic man. Lady
text: Ascot is red-faced with annoyance.
speaker_heading: LADY ASCOT
dialog: At last! We thought you’d never

speaker_heading: HELEN KINGSLEY

speaker_heading: HAMISH
dialog: On the contrary. I find it

speaker_heading: HAMISH (CONT'D)
dialog: Pardon us! Miss Kingsley is

dialog: (to Alice)

speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: I was wondering what it would be like

speaker_heading: HAMISH
dialog: Why would you waste your time thinking
dialog: about such an impossible thing?
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Why wouldn’t I? My father said he
dialog: sometimes believed in six impossible
dialog: things before breakfast.
text: She laughs at the memory. Hamish looks pained. He sees his

speaker_heading: HAMISH
dialog: Meet me under the gazebo in precisely

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You'll soon be twenty, Alice. That

speaker_heading: MARGARET

speaker_heading: LADY ASCOT

speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Did you see that?
speaker_heading: LADY ASCOT
dialog: See what?
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: It was a rabbit, I think.
speaker_heading: LADY ASCOT
dialog: Nasty things. I do enjoy setting the

dialog: rabbit.
speaker_heading: LADY ASCOT (CONT’D)
dialog: If you serve Hamish the wrong foods,

text: And there it is, a LARGE WHITE RABBIT in a waistcoat,

speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Hamish has a blockage. I couldn’t be

text: I keep seeing a rabbit in a waistcoat.
speaker_heading: IMOGENE
dialog: How very strange. What kind of

speaker_heading: ALICE
