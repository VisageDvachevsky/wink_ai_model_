scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - DUSK
text: It's finally happened. Hell's frozen over.
text: Christmas is two weeks off, arid SNOW is falling in Gotham.
text: Beneath its pristine white blanket, the city looks
text: uncharacteristically serene -- almost inviting. Peace has
dialog: been miraculously restored: strangers wave hello. Salvation
text: Army Santas ring their bells on streetcorners. And now, as
text: night falls, an ILLUMINATED SIGN winks on above Broad Avenue:
scene_heading: "JOYEUX NOEL GOTHAM -- Only 16 Shopping Days Left Till
dialog: Christmas."
text: The streets are bustling with jolly shoppers. At a souvenir
text: store, we find an exasperated MOM squabbling with her seven-
text: year old. Like many other storefronts in Gotham, this one is
text: overflowing with bootleg BATMAN MERCHANDISE: t-shirts, key
text: chains, ceramic figurines. The kid is already wearing a
text: Batman baseball cap and a little black cape, but he obviously
dialog: wants more.
text: Mom drags him off past another store window, this one full of
text: SCRAP METAL, with a sign reading "AUTHENTIC FRAGMENTS OF THE
text: BATWING -- $19.95 and up." A PANHANDLER is perched at the
text: entrance. Beneath his array jacket is a grubby sweatshirt
text: with the familiar yellow-and-black logo. In Gotham this
dialog: winter, Batmania is everywhere...
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Two hours later, the SNOWSTORM's grown into a full-fledged
text: blizzard. The drifts are two feet deep and the streets are
text: all but empty of cars. A massive SNOW PLOW the size of a
text: Panzer tank rumbles past, FILLING THE FRAME...
text: ...and revealing, as it passes, a group of CAROLERS, all
text: bundled up in mufflers and parkas. Unbothered by the weather,
text: they walk the street singing, spreading cheer and goodwill to
text: the few passersby.
text: They've just gone into a lovely <i>a capella</i> rendition of "Silent
text: Night" when an oversized DELIVERY TRUCK, outfitted with snow
text: chains, clanks slowly past in the wake of the plow. Its sides
text: are decorated with cartoon igloos advertising a popular ice
text: cream snack -- POLAR BARS -- oddly inappropriate for this time
dialog: of year.
text: A streetcorner SANTA, with bell and bucket, WAVES at the truck
text: as it rounds a corner. The CAROLERS carol. Then --
text: -- a VIOLENT EXPLOSION rocks the street -- followed by the
text: sound of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE and a high, wailing SECURITY ALARM.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHRACH AND CO. - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: Around the corner there's CARNAGE on the streets. The windows
text: have blown out of Gotham's leading jewelry store. Gut-shot
text: SECURITY GUARDS stagger and go face down in the snow as
text: ROBBERS, dressed in white camouflage gear, clamber out through
text: the shattered glass with SACKFULS OF LOOT.
text: CAROLERS spill around the corner to see what's going on, but a
text: spray of GUNFIRE sends them scattering in panic. The POLAR
text: BAR truck pulls even with the jewelry store, and as it does...
text: The REAR DOORS open. A RAMP slides down from the back of the
text: truck. The ROBBERS scramble aboard, and mere seconds later
text: SLIDE out AGAIN -- riding atop five SKIDOO SNOWMOBILES.
text: SIRENS HOWL. A POLICE CAR appears, taking the corner just a
text: trifle too fast -- FISHTAILING on the icy street and plowing
text: into a drift.
scene_heading: INT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: The COPS gun the engine, but their wheels are spinning in the
text: snow -- no traction. They're about to climb out and give
text: chase on foot when, through the windshield, they see the
dialog: Salvation Army SANTA...
text: ...HOISTING AN AK-47 AND FIRING DIRECTLY AT THEM. The
text: windshield disintegrates and the COPS sink from view as SANTA
text: races off to the last of the snowmobiles, which is already
text: burdened with LOOT.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: MORE SQUAD CARS converge on the jewelry store -- but it's
text: difficult to carry on a high-speed pursuit when the snow's a
dialog: foot deep and the best you can do is 6 MPH. The COP CARS skid
text: to a halt, blocked by the rumbling SNOWPLOW. By now, of
text: course, the LOOTERS are gone -- scooting off on either side of
text: the plow, sticking to the snowy sidewalks.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
text: SNOWMOBILES glide across the sidewalks, sending the few hardy
text: souls who are out on the streets DIVING FOR COVER. A couple
text: of DERELICTS are cowering behind a fire hydrant, trying to
text: avoid getting run over. Every time they poke their heads out,
text: another SKIDOO whizzes past, missing them by inches.
text: The ROBBERS fan out in various directions. These guys are
dialog: obviously going to get away clean -- unless...
text: The DERELICT points up at the night sky, where a BEACON is
text: blazing in the darkness -- THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT...
scene_heading: INT. POLICE CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: MORE SIRENS. A COP takes a radio call as he streaks down the
text: long wide avenue which borders Gotham Park -- one of the few
text: streets which is relatively clear. The COP at the wheel goes
text: wide-eyed and nudges his partner in disbelief.
text: Before their eyes, FIVE SNOWMOBILES appear from the cross
text: streets up ahead and CONVERGE at the entrance to Gotham Park.
text: Bringing up the rear is SANTA CLAUS.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: What the hell -- ?
scene_heading: EXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: BRAKES SQUEAL. Several squad cars are now massed at the
dialog: entrance to the park -- but there's one problem. The city's
text: snow plows don't operate on the park roads -- and the entrance
text: is blocked off with SAWHORSES reading "CLOSED TO TRAFFIC." A
text: huge steep drift prevents them from entering -- and so all
text: they can do is stand by helplessly, WATCHING as the
text: snowmobiles vanish into the trees.
text: The COPS race about like headless chickens, trying to concoct
text: a plan. A couple of them are trying to scale the stone walls
text: of the park. Another is at his car, barking into a radio
dialog: mike:
scene_heading: COP WITH MIKE
dialog: Yeah, you heard me. Snowmobiles!
dialog: <i>(pause)</i>
dialog: So what do we do? Chase 'em on foot??
text: ALL EYES TURN at the blare of a horn. The COPS peer down the
text: long corridor of the cross street -- and see a STRANGE BLACK
text: VEHICLE barreling toward them at 90 MPH, with no intention of
dialog: stopping...
text: THE BATMOBILE!! COPS dive left and right. A split-second
dialog: later...
text: ...a FORTY-FOOT JET of NOVA-INTENSITY FLAME erupts from the
text: front of the jet-black supercar -- instantaneously DISSOLVING
text: the drift that blocks the entrance to the park -- turning the
text: ice and snow on the paths before it into water!
text: The BATMOBILE screams past in the wink of an eye. The COPS
text: get to their feet; cold as it is, they're sweating. One of
text: them mops his brow and announces, dumfounded:
speaker_heading: COP I
dialog: ...That was Batman.
speaker_heading: COP II
dialog: NO SHIT!!
text: COP II yanks COP I into the nearest squad car, and the others
text: follow suit. ENGINES REV. As long as the BATMOBILE's cleared
dialog: a path, they might as well join in the chase...
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDLE PATH - THAT MOMENT
text: TWO BURLY TEENAGERS -- both dressed in RED BERETS and PARKAS
text: with BLACK BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS visible underneath -- are
text: trudging along the path when they're STARTLED by a pair of
text: speeding SKIDOOS. Moments later, they spot a RED GLOW on the
dialog: horizon...
text: ...and their JAWS DROP as the BATMOBILE roars into view,
text: BURNING OFF THE SNOW IN ITS PATH. Thrilled beyond words, they
text: WHOOP WITH GLEE, slapping high-fives as the car streaks past.
scene_heading: INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT
text: His face is weirdly illuminated by the flame still spitting
text: from the front of the car. Cool as ever -- approaching the
text: chase as a simple problem in logic -- he checks a radar
text: display on his dashboard and sees FIVE BLIPS.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: The cops follow along in BATMAN's path. The lead car LOSES
text: CONTROL and plows headlong into a drift. The DRIVER jams the
text: pedal, but his rear wheels end up digging a deep rut in the
text: ice. He sits there cursing, pumping the accelerator as other
text: COPS race past him on foot.
scene_heading: INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN
text: The various ROBBERS have spread out, their vehicles BOUNDING
text: over the hilly terrain of the park. He spots two of them up
text: ahead; as he draws closer, they PART WAYS, veering off to the
dialog: left and right...
scene_heading: ANGLE ON BATMOBILE - MOVING
text: PODS OPEN on the front fenders, and MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate
text: into place. The Batmobile fires a pair of HEAT-SEEKING
text: TORPEDOS, which BURROW into the snow on either side and
dialog: disappear.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON LEFT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING
text: The DRIVER looks back over his shoulder and sees what appears
text: to be a BLACK SHARK FIN plowing through the snow behind him,
text: GAINING FAST. He takes evasive action, but the SHARK FIN
text: always seems to follow. Just as he approaches the crest of a
dialog: hill...
text: ...the TORPEDO slams into the rear of the SNOWMOBILE. The
text: force of impact knocks the ROBBER cleanly off. His LOOT lands
text: in the snow beside him, but the SNOWMOBILE keeps going --
text: sailing over the crest of the hill and striking the rocks
text: beyond with a deafening EXPLOSION.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON RIGHT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING
text: This ROBBER's a little smarter than his buddy. When he sees
text: the shark fin on his tail, he noses his snowmobile off into a
text: GROVE OF TREES. The trees are too closely spaced for the
text: torpedo to maneuver; it strikes the nearest tree trunk and
text: explodes harmlessly.
text: The ROBBER is feeling good about himself, because the
text: Batmobile can't follow either. But BATMAN has a Plan B. As
text: he drives alongside the grove, he HITS THE ACCELERATOR,
text: passing the snowmobile on its left. A STEEL SPIKE attached to
text: a cable launches from the side of the Batmobile and WEDGES
text: ITSELF into a distant TREE.
text: The cable goes taut, and the tree TOPPLES -- directly into the
text: path of the second SNOWMOBILE. The vehicle crashes into the
text: trunk, and the hapless ROBBER goes cartwheeling head-over-
text: heels into a drift.
text: In the distance, COPS appear -- racing to the scene on foot,
text: ready for mop-up duty. BATMAN kills the flamethrower, hits
text: the brakes, and FISHTAILS, doing a quick 180 on the snow.
text: He's just spotted fresh quarry: snowmobiles three and four,
text: whizzing over a rolling white pasture in the distance.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - THAT MOMENT
text: We're at a makeshift CAMPSITE -- where a cluster of HOMELESS
text: PEOPLE are burning refuse in a garbage can to keep warm. They
text: look on in puzzlement as the two SNOWMOBILES whiz past and
text: disappear over a crest of a hill...
scene_heading: EXT. LAKEFRONT - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4
text: They bounce down the hillside and SKID -- arriving at the edge
text: of a frozen-over LAKE. With the roar of the Batmobile behind
text: them, the two DRIVERS get the same idea simultaneously.
text: Smiling, they rev their engines and set out over the surface
dialog: of the lake.
text: Now the Batmobile crests the ridge. The car's weight tips
text: suddenly and it begins to skid down the hill toward the lake.
text: BATMAN sees what's happening and kills the flamethrower just
text: in time -- but he can't brake the car on the snowy slope. The
text: prow of the Batmobile slides out onto the edge of the lake --
text: -- and under its weight, the ICE begins to crack. The left
text: front tire takes a sudden dip -- and worse yet, the car is
text: sliding forward.
scene_heading: INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN
text: He shifts frantically from drive to reverse, trying to rock
text: the car out of its predicament, but his rear wheels find no
text: purchase. He can hear the ice cracking beneath him.
text: Grimacing, he throws a switch on the dashboard --
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - ON BATMOBILE
text: -- and the trunk pops open. An industrial-strength GRAPPLING
text: HOOK shoots upward and digs in at a point beyond the crest of
text: the hill; and a concealed WINCH ASSEMBLY begins to grind away,
text: hauling the Batmobile uphill, out of danger.
scene_heading: INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN
text: Suspended just above the icy lake, he sees the SNOWMOBILE
text: vanishing into the distance. He opens (yet another) panel on
dialog: the dashboard...
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4
text: The ROBBERS give each other a big thumbs-up. They're almost
text: halfway across the lake now and the Batmobile is disabled.
text: All at once they hear a strange WHISTLING overhead...
text: Fireworks? No, it's a THERMITE BOMB -- rocketing past them,
text: hitting the ice some forty feet ahead and EXPLODING GAUDILY.
text: JAGGED CHUNKS OF ICE break free and SHIFT in the frigid water
text: -- and the ROBBERS are skidding into the drink before they
dialog: know what's hit them.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON SNOWMOBILE #5 - MOVING
text: The last of the robbers is SANTA CLAUS -- his big sack filled
text: not with toys, but precious stones. He approaches the edge of
text: the park, negotiating his way through a maze of rocky
text: outcroppings. He squirts out from behind a boulder into a
dialog: clearing...
text: ...and GASPS in PANIC as a SEARING BURST OF FLAME erupts
text: behind him. The BATMOBILE speeds out from the other side of
text: the boulder; SANTA twists his accelerator, desperately trying
dialog: to build up speed.
text: As it is, he's barely managing to stay ahead of the
text: flamethrower. But the jet of flame suddenly DIES; the HOOD of
text: the Batmobile rises half a foot --
text: -- and TWIN PROJECTILES launch into the air. A heavy NET is
text: strung between them -- and it lands SMACK ON TOP OF SANTA
text: CLAUS, entangling the snowmobile and stopping him in his
dialog: tracks.
text: Immobilized, he watches through the net in horror as the
text: Batmobile barrels down. When the great black machine is
text: almost atop him --
text: -- it stops on a dime six inches from his heavily-padded
dialog: frame.
scene_heading: EXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT
text: The COPS are spread out near the entrance. They've rounded up
text: the other ROBBERS and returned most of the loot. They hear a
text: dull ROAR in the distance...
text: ...and a few seconds later the BATMOBILE streaks into view,
text: dragging the NET behind it -- SANTA, his loot, and his
text: snowmobile, all tied up in one tidy parcel.
text: At the entrance to the park, the NET detaches itself from the
text: Batmobile, dumping SANTA into the hands of the waiting COPS.
text: Without stopping, the BATMOBILE roars out of the park and
text: vanishes whence it came. A mildly-humiliated COP turns to his
speaker_heading: colleague and SHRUGS:
speaker_heading: COP I
dialog: ...Merry Christmas.
text: The second COP points to SANTA, still struggling in the net.
speaker_heading: COP II
dialog: Gift-wrapped and everything.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CITY HALL - DAY
text: TV MINICAM CREWS are camped out on the steps of City Hall,
text: with a sizable crowd watching from the street. COMMISSIONER
text: GORDON is reading from a prepared statement.
speaker_heading: GORDON
text: After a high-speed chase -- over $750,000
dialog: in precious jewels were recovered intact
dialog: by the police force -- working in concert
dialog: with Batman.
text: At the sound of Batman's name, a CHANTING goes up in the
dialog: crowd:
scene_heading: VOICES IN CROWD
text: TAKE BACK THE STREETS! TAKE BACK THE
text: STREETS! TAKE BACK THE --
text: GORDON winces and lets out a sigh. The CHANTERS are a group
text: of pugnacious, well-muscled KIDS, late teens and early
text: twenties, all dressed in identical garb: black Batman
text: SWEATSHIRTS and little red Guardian-angel BERETS. They're
dialog: obviously members of the same club -- just like the guys we
text: saw in the park.
text: GORDON waits for them to shut up, but they don't; so he grabs
text: the mike and speaks slowly and distinctly, trying to be heard
text: over the din.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I would like to stress -- that while this
dialog: city enjoys a special relationship with
dialog: Batman --
dialog: <i>(louder)</i>
dialog: -- we do not condone vigilantism --
dialog: <i>(practically screaming)</i>
scene_heading: -- IN ANY FORM.
text: It's no use. He's totally drowned out by the RED BERETS, who
text: continue to shout and shake their fists. Giving up, he
text: returns the mike to a REPORTER and marches up the steps in a
text: huff. The RED BERETS CHEER.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN
text: The evening news: a live, on-the-spot interview from Gotham
text: Square. A superimposed GRAPHIC identifies a surly kid in a
scene_heading: RED BERET as "MIKE SEKOWSKY -- SPOKESPERSON -- ORDER OF THE
dialog: BAT."
speaker_heading: SEKOWSKY
dialog: And hey! Where does this --
dialog: <i>(BLEEP; expletive deleted)</i>
dialog: -- Gordon get off calling us <vigilantes>?
dialog: We're not breakin' any laws. We're a
dialog: group of concerned citizens, that's all --
dialog: just like Batman.
speaker_heading: WOMAN IN CROWD
dialog: You people are nothing but hoodlums!
speaker_heading: SEKOWSKY
dialog: Hey, lady -- we're out here on patrol
dialog: riskin' our necks to protect old biddies
dialog: like you.
dialog: <i>(into mike)</i>
dialog: If this lame-o Gordon could do his job --
text: MORE CATCALLS from the crowd. The picture jumps suddenly as a
text: minicam is jostled; some sort of SCUFFLE appears to be
text: breaking out. Before it does, CAMERA PULLS BACK from the TV
dialog: screen, placing us in:
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: where ALFRED THE BUTLER is watching the Sekowsky interview
text: with extreme dismay. As he trims the crusts from a pair of
text: hearty watercress sandwiches, he SLICES HIS FINGER OPEN.
text: ALFRED makes a pained face -- it's all Sekowsky's fault.
text: Onscreen, the fracas continues; SEKOWSKY has recommandeered
dialog: the mike...
speaker_heading: SEKOWSKY (on TV)
dialog: We're provin' that the spirit of Batman is
dialog: alive in this city. We're gonna take back
dialog: the streets!
text: SEKOWSKY raises a fist. Behind him, his CRONIES begin to
text: chant: "TAKE BACK THE STREETS! TAKE BACK THE STREETS!"
text: Incensed, sucking on his finger, ALFRED moves to the TV and
text: flicks it off.
text: He turns on the radio in search of something more soothing.
text: "Good King Wenceslas" pipes through the manor; smiling, ALFRED
text: sets the sandwich plate alongside a steaming kettle on a
dialog: Sterling silver tea service.
scene_heading: INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: The CAROL CONTINUES UNDERNEATH as ALFRED, white linen draped
text: over one forearm, sets the tea tray down on his master's big
text: mahogany desk. He digs in his pocket for a key and unlocks a
text: side drawer.
text: The drawer contains a stack of yellowed, aging NEWPAPER
text: CLIPPINGS -- among them one which reads "THOMAS WAYNE
text: MURDERED: Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery.
text: Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed." ALFRED digs
text: around beneath the clippings and finds a concealed SWITCH at
text: the rear of the drawer.
text: Gears grind, and a sectional bookcase detaches itself from the
text: wall -- sliding out a couple of feet to reveal a STONE
text: STAIRWAY which descends into darkness...
scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
text: Descending the stone stairs, ALFRED arrives in the Batcave.
text: "Good King Wenceslas" is on the speakers down here as well.
text: Across a catwalk the BATMOBILE rests on its little plateau,
text: wrapped in a tarp.
text: ALFRED clears some space on a lab table and sets the tea
text: service down. He glances up at the bank of video monitors and
text: sees SEKOWSKY, still babbling, on several channels
text: simultaneously. He scans the cave, but there's no trace of
speaker_heading: BRUCE.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Sir? -- MASTER BRUCE??
text: As if in response, BATS screech and flutter in the distant
text: recesses of the cavern. ALFRED turns suddenly and sees BRUCE
text: behind him, suspended from a thin filament wire, RISING OUT OF
text: A BOTTOMLESS ABYSS.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I'm not deaf, Alfred. I hear you.
text: He's wearing his civvie -- tweed pants and cashmere sweater --
text: but he's got the utility belt, with its spring-action reel,
text: buckled about his waist. Clutching a bundle, he hangs in
text: midair for a moment, dangling over the void. ALFRED slowly
text: regains his composure:
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I took the liberty of preparing tea.
dialog: <i>(indicating tbe monitors)</i>
dialog: I take it you've been watching the news?
text: BRUCE, still dangling, glances up at the SEKOWSKY interview
text: and nods.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Yeah...lot of crazy people in this world.
text: BRUCE rocks back and forth to build up momentum. He kicks off
text: on the nearest stone outcropping, lands gracefully on the
text: Batcave floor, and unbuckles his belt. Preoccupied, he drops
text: his mysterious bundle on the lab table: a roll of black
text: fabric, and a cluster of lightweight, hollow ALUMINUM RODS,
text: connected by what appears to be SURGICAL TUBING.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I should inform you...Christmas is
dialog: approaching, and we've received our annual
text: solicitation from the Fireman's Toy Fund.
dialog: <i>(eyeing the equipment)</i>
dialog: If I may inquire...?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Oh, yeah. Watch this.
text: BRUCE hits a trigger on a tiny gas canister attached to the
text: tubing. The tubing inflates and the rods spring erect --
text: stiffening, wing-like, into something which looks remarkably
text: like the skeleton of an umbrella.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Most ingenious, sir. What exactly <is> it?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What does it look like?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: To the untrained eye, sir, it looks
dialog: remarkably like...the skeleton of an
dialog: umbrella.
text: Sounds good. BRUCE eyes his new invention, thinks it over,
text: smiles slyly.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Good guess, Alfred. That's exactly right.
text: BRUCE hits the trigger, and the rods WILT with a hiss. He
text: sits at his lab table; ALFRED unfolds a napkin on his lap,
text: pours a cup of tea.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Splendid, sir, and if I may say, I'm glad
dialog: you're putting your time to such
dialog: productive use.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: Now -- the Toy Fund. Our contribution
dialog: last year was a half-million dollars...
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: We can do better than that.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Then there's the foster-parents program...
dialog: the Gotham homeless crusade...
text: BRUCE nods abstractedly and tucks into his sandwich. He seems
text: oddly preoccupied -- not exactly melancholy, but his thoughts
text: are obviously a million miles away. ALFRED looks on,
dialog: concerned:
speaker_heading: ALFRED (cont.)
dialog: Is something troubling you, sir?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Yeah...the holidays, I guess. Always gets
dialog: me thinking about...
dialog: <i>(he changes the subject)</i>
dialog: And to tell you the truth, I'm a little --
dialog: concerned about Vicki.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: <i>(anxiously)</i>
dialog: Miss Vale, sir...?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Yeah. I've been thinking about it lately.
dialog: Thinking about it a lot...
dialog: <i>(gravely; shaking his head)</i>
dialog: ...and I still can't figure out what to
dialog: get her for Christmas.
text: BRUCE shoots ALFRED a solemn, perplexed look -- and ALFRED
text: heaves an audible sigh of relief as we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PRISON CELL - DAY
text: TIGHT ON a stack of COOPS and CAGES, piled high against a bare
text: concrete wall. Each cage -- and there are at least two dozen
text: of them -- contains a twittering BIRD: starlings, pigeons,
dialog: cardinals, titwillows...
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK from the bars of the cages to reveal a VERY
text: ODD FIGURE in prison greys. A CANARY, perched on his
text: shoulder, SINGS HAPPILY as he stands in front of a grimy,
text: cracked mirror, plastering back his hair, BUFFING HIS NAILS
text: with quick, birdlike strokes.
text: MR. BONIFACE is beak-nosed, epicene, and so fat that it seems
dialog: his skin should burst; the adjective that comes to mind is
text: "obscene." Despite his eccentric appearance, he comports
text: himself with overblown, theatrical dignity. Fastidious and
text: preening, he does not suffer insults lightly.
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK FURTHER -- through another set of bars --
text: and we realize that MR. BONIFACE is himself caged. A PRISON
text: GUARD arrives to slide back his cell door...
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Up and at 'em, Pengy. -- Pengy?
text: MR. BONIFACE pointedly ignores the GUARD, refusing to
dialog: acknowledge the odious (if wholly appropriate) nickname.
speaker_heading: GUARD (cont.)
dialog: Boniface...
text: MR. BONIFACE finally turns. With an expression of extreme
text: distaste, he affixes a MONOCLE over one eye, returns the
text: canary to its cage and allows himself to be ushered out.
scene_heading: INT. WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY
text: MR. BONIFACE and his ATTORNEY sit at a long table across from
text: the WARDEN and the members of the PAROLE BOARD.
speaker_heading: PAROLE OFFICER
dialog: You want to return the money you stole.
speaker_heading: BONIFACE
dialog: Intact. The map will show you where it's
dialog: buried.
text: The PAROLE OFFICER stares skeptically at a hand-scrawled MAP.
speaker_heading: PAROLE OFFICER
dialog: All of it. Forty-two million dollars.
text: MR. BONIFACE stares down humbly at the table -- as if he finds
dialog: the mere mention of his transgression too embarrassing to
dialog: bear.
speaker_heading: PAROLE OFFICER II
dialog: Why this sudden change of heart?
speaker_heading: MR. BONIFACE
dialog: Gentlemen, I want my debt to be repaid in
dialog: full. I want to be a part of civilized
dialog: society!
dialog: <i>(oozing sincerity)</i>
dialog: Prison life is not for me. The guilt, the
dialog: fear, the constant shame...one meets a
text: disturbingly low class of people.
speaker_heading: PAROLE OFFICER II
dialog: Sure, but -- forty-two million dollars??
text: MR. BONIFACE nods plaintively. It's quite a perfomlance. He
text: dabs at his face with a handkerchief; it's hot in here, and
dialog: he's the delicate type...
speaker_heading: WARDEN
dialog: His record's clean. Thirteen years
dialog: without an incident.
speaker_heading: ATTORNEY
dialog: I'd like to point out, my client's put his
dialog: time to good use. A student of
dialog: ornithology...articles published in
dialog: several respected journals...
text: The PAROLE OFFICER thumbs through a stack of magazines: Bird
text: World, Ornithological Review, Beaks And Feathers, Nest Egg.
speaker_heading: MR. BONIFACE
dialog: Birds, yes. My only source of solace.
speaker_heading: PAROLE OFFICER
dialog: In light of this rather extraordinary
dialog: gesture, I see no reason not to endorse
dialog: your application for parole.
speaker_heading: BONIFACE
dialog: Thank you, sir. You won't regret it.
text: MR. BONIFACE shakes hands with the members of the PAROLE
text: BOARD. As the GUARDS escort him out, a BLACK MYNAH BIRD
text: SQUAWKS LOUDLY from its cage in the corner of the office:
speaker_heading: MYNAH
text: CRIME DOES NOT PAY. AAWWK!! CRIME DOES
dialog: NOT PAY.
text: CHUCKLES all around. On his way out the ATTORNEY gestures
text: toward the mynah -- and BEAMS at the parole board:
speaker_heading: ATTORNEY
dialog: Personally trained by my client.
scene_heading: INT. PRISON CELL - DAY
text: Free time -- the cell doors are open and the convicts are
text: milling around in the common area. T-BONE, 220 lbs. of dumb,
text: hulking beef, saunters up to his cell and finds his bunkmate,
text: MR. BONIFACE, staring at a stack of EMPTY CAGES. BONIFACE
text: whirls on him suddenly, his face beet-red, APOPLECTIC WITH
speaker_heading: RAGE:
speaker_heading: MR. BONIFACE
dialog: -- Where are my birds?!?
speaker_heading: T-BONE
dialog: Shit, Pengy. I let 'em go.
speaker_heading: MR. BONIFACE
dialog: Hermione. My canary. It's the dead of
dialog: winter!
text: T-BONE flops casually on his bunk, obviously enjoying MR.
text: BONIFACE's profound distress.
speaker_heading: T-BONE
dialog: They were all cooped up. With you leaving
dialog: and all -- seemed like the humane thing to
dialog: do.
text: BONIFACE'S GAZE FALLS on a corner of the cell. He spots a
text: scattering of YELLOW FEATHERS -- a patch of FRESH BLOOD. With
text: a supreme effort of restraint, he turns and forces a smile...
speaker_heading: MR. BONIFACE
dialog: I see. -- You might as well have this. I
dialog: won't be needing it...
text: He tosses a SONY WALKMAN to T-BONE, who flicks it on. The dim
text: strains of CLASSICAL MUSIC are audible through the
dialog: earphones...
speaker_heading: T-BONE
dialog: Well, thanks, Pengy. No hard feelings.
dialog: <i>(chuckling to himself)</i>
dialog: Y'know, I'm gonna miss that pudgy little
dialog: ass of yours.
text: T-BONE tunes the Walkman to a rock station, slips the headset
text: on, grins from his bunk. TWO GUARDS arrive. As they escort
text: him out, MR. BONIFACE mutters:
speaker_heading: MR. BONIFACE
dialog: You won't miss it long.
scene_heading: EXT. PRISON - MAIN ENTRANCE - DAY
text: It's fifteen degrees outside as MR. BONIFACE -- aka THE
text: PENGUIN -- waddles forth from the prison gates, regally
text: attired in cutaway and pin-stripes. He pauses to inhale a
text: deep lungful of the icy air; then, with a smile of
text: exhilaration, he removes his coat and STRETCHES -- spreading
text: his wings, REVELING in the cold.
text: A STRETCH LIMO pulls up. Two identically gaunt and vulture-
text: like DANDIES, formally dressed, with bowler hats and
text: umbrellas, step out to meet him. These two gentlemen -- FRICK
text: and FRACK -- serve as the Penguin's general factoti and
dialog: "business managers."
speaker_heading: FRICK
dialog: Welcome back, Mr. Boniface.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Mr. Frick. Mr. Frack. Our years of
text: planning are about to pay off.
scene_heading: INT. LIMO - MOVING - DAY
text: Now that he's loose, the PENGUIN's rapacious side is beginning
text: to show. His eyes twinkle with greed as he contemplates his
dialog: own ingenuity.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: I take it they found the money all right?
speaker_heading: FRACK
dialog: We buried it exactly as you specified.
dialog: $42,271,009...
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: How much have we got left?
text: FRICK reaches into his coat for a BALANCE SHEET.
speaker_heading: FRICK
dialog: Let's see -- an initial capitalization of
dialog: 42 million and change, compounded over
dialog: thirteen years, at an annual return of
dialog: just under sixteen percent --
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Fine, fine. How much?
speaker_heading: FRICK
dialog: Seventy-nine million. -- Excluding the
dialog: sum we buried.
text: THE PENGUIN lets out a dry, heaving CHORTLE, midway between a
text: normal laugh and a DUCK'S QUACK. He checks his watch and
text: reaches into his pocket for a small ELECTRONIC DEVICE.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Speaking of burials...
scene_heading: EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY
text: T-BONE on work detail. He's got the Walkman on and he's
text: shoveling snow to the beat. He winces, and removes the
dialog: headphones...
text: The MUSIC he was listening to has been replaced by an eerie,
text: high-pitched WHINE. He's twisting the knob, trying to find
text: the station he was tuned to, when a PIGEON dives down STRAIGHT
text: AT HIS HEAD.
speaker_heading: T-BONE
dialog: HEY -- !
text: He drops the shovel as the bird STRIKES, glancing off his
text: head. Before he can react, THREE MORE PIGEONS have swooped
text: down at him, PECKING at his head and shoulders in a frenzy.
text: He lets out a HOWL and staggers through the prison yard in a
text: frenzy. DOZENS of PIGEONS are pouring over the prison walls,
text: SHRIEKING HIDEOUSLY, descending on him. He falls to the
text: ground screaming for help, but the other prisoners run like
text: rabbits, terrified...
text: By the time the GUARDS come racing across the courtyard,
text: T-BONE's no longer even visible. There's just a swarming,
text: man-shaped mass of PIGEONS, pecking away, flapping their wings
text: insanely. Covering their faces as they move in, the GUARDS
text: blow their whistles -- BEAT AT the pigeons with billy clubs.
text: All at once, the PIGEONS take off <i>en masse</i> -- leaving T-BONE's
text: mutilated corpse sprawled in the yard. A GUARD notices the
text: Walkman, picks up the earphones to listen, and hears nothing
text: but ROCK MUSIC -- "Surfin' Bird" by the Trashmen. Bird bird
dialog: bird, bird is the word...
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - ON PENGUIN'S LIMO - MOVING
text: An AERIAL VIEW of the LIMO as it cruises down the deserted
text: road leading away from the prison. It disappears from view --

scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT
text: ALFRED opens the front door and finds a bundled-up VICKI out
text: on the portico, red-cheeked, flushed, and happy. She pulls
text: him forward, gives him a quick peck on the cheek.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Guess what, Alfred. I think I found a
dialog: present for Bruce.
text: She's got a long, skinny GIFT BOX propped up against the
text: exterior wall. At first it doesn't want to fit through the
text: door -- it must be eight feet long -- but with ALFRED's help
text: she gets it inside. The faithful butler stares curiously at
dialog: this odd-shaped gift...
speaker_heading: VICKI (cont.)
dialog: Skis. -- Don't let on, okay?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: He won't hear a word of it from me.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: He's such a nightmare to shop for. --
dialog: What do you get him year after year,
dialog: Alfred?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: <i>(conspiratorially)</i>
dialog: I find you can't go wrong with
dialog: surveillance equipment. Let me put this
dialog: under the tree...
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Not so fast.
text: She reaches into the pocket of her coat and pulls out another
text: small gift. ALFRED stares at the tag -- "TO ALFRED, LOVE
text: VICKI" -- and tries to suppress a HUGE GRIN.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Why, Miss Vale -- !
scene_heading: VOICE FROM BEHIND
dialog: What's all this?
text: ALFRED and VICKI turn. It's BRUCE, dressed for dinner,
text: marching down the long stairway in the entry hall. VICKI
text: waves frantically.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Don't look. It's your present.
text: VICKI rushes over to embrace him. He gapes at the long skinny
dialog: box --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What'd you get me? Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?
text: VICKI frowns and gives him a kiss. She nestles up against
text: him. WHISPERS in his ear:
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I'm going to give you the happiest
dialog: Christmas you've ever had.
text: Still in the clinch, BRUCE shoots a look at ALFRED. Taking
text: the hint, ALFRED clears his throat and bends to pick up one
text: end of the ski box. He backs out of the entry hall, dragging
text: the box before him...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM PARK - NIGHT
text: FIRES burn in garbage cans. TENTS and LEAN-TOS dot the snowy
text: landscape. Men, women, and children wander aimlessly,
text: huddling against the cold.
text: An army of the HOMELESS has set up camp in Gotham Park. On
text: the nearby periphery, PICKETERS -- half concerned citizens,
text: half down-and-outers -- are marching the sidewalks, keeping a
text: candlelight VIGIL. Hand-lettered placards read: "SAVE THE
text: PARK." "PARKS ARE FOR PEOPLE." "THIS PARK IS OUR HOME."
text: The source of the protest? A towering SIGN posted in a corner
text: of the park, announcing the imminent consuuction of a new
text: luxury highrise -- the GOTHAM PARK TOWERS -- a project of Shaw
dialog: Construction, Inc.
text: A LAMBORGHINI sits at a traffic light nearby...
scene_heading: INT. LAMBORGHINI - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

dialog: demonstration.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Homeless.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: I was just down here Tuesday. Seems like
dialog: there's more every day.
text: BRUCE starts to say something, but can't think of anything to
dialog: say.
speaker_heading: VICKI (cont.)
dialog: Christmas time. And they say there's over
text: a thousand people living in the park
dialog: already.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: -- Yeah.
text: The light changes. BRUCE throws the car into gear and -- at
text: the next intersection -- turns the car right, into the park.
scene_heading: EXT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT
text: Despite the name, it's a tony little bistro catering to
text: Gotham's elite. A PANHANDLER, underdressed for the cold, has
text: been hustling the customers as they come out; a couple of
text: PARKING ATTENDANTS are trying to drag him discreetly away as
text: BRUCE'S CAR pulls up.
text: A VALET opens the car for BRUCE and VICKI, who look on in
text: concern as the PANHANDLER gets the bum's rush. The liveried
text: DOORMAN shrugs apolagetically -- sorry for the inconvenience
text: -- as they enter.
scene_heading: INT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT
text: Post-dinner. VICKI's got a sheaf of PHOTOS spread out on the
text: table in front of BRUCE -- shots of Gotham's HOMELESS, being
text: forcibly evicted from slum dwellings, erecting their
text: SHANTYTOWNS in Gotham Park.
speaker_heading: VICKI
text: They're already razing the tenements and
dialog: SRO's downtown. These people don't have
dialog: anyplace else to go.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: If the city starts selling off the park...
text: BRUCE takes a good long look at his opulent surroundings.
text: HUGE WINDOWS open on a serene and picturesque view of the
text: park; CAMPFIRES flicker in the distance...
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: -- Yeah. I guess I'll pass on dessert.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: <i>(taking his hand)</i>
dialog: Bruce, you do a lot more than most people
dialog: even dream of.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Sure. Comes off the top of my taxes --
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: That's not what I meant.
text: They exchange a long silent look. Of course she's referring
text: to Batman. Still, the argument doesn't hold much water with
speaker_heading: BRUCE.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: -- What I "do" doesn't come close to the
dialog: root of the problem, Vicki.
dialog: <i>(long pause)</i>
dialog: I'm just a Band-Aid.
scene_heading: VOICE FROM BEHIND
dialog: Bruce! It's been ages!
text: VICKI turns -- and rapidly closes her photo folder.
text: Millionaire construction magnate RANDALL SHAW is in the
text: restaurant table-hopping, and he's just glommed onto BRUCE.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Randall. You remember Vicki. -- How's
dialog: the construction business?
speaker_heading: SHAW
dialog: The park tower? All systems go. If we
dialog: can get the junkies and winos cleared
dialog: out...
dialog: <i>(a big grin)</i>
text: Not too late to get in on the deal.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I'll think about it.
speaker_heading: SHAW
dialog: Say, Walter Barrett's due back from
dialog: Europe. We should all get together at the
dialog: club.
dialog: <i>(clapping him on the shoulder)</i>
dialog: Nice to see you again, Miss Veal.
text: "Miss Veal" maintains a big phony smile as SHAW moves off to
text: the next table. She murmurs to BRUCE through clenched teeth:
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: What a pig.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I've known him since he was seven years
dialog: old. He was a pig then too.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Now he wants to gobble up the park...
dialog: <i>(shivering)</i>
dialog: Bruce -- isn't there something you can do
dialog: about people like that?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What, tie him up with a bat-rope?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: No, you idiot. I meant you. Bruce.
text: BRUCE nods -- oh, yeah. Subtle distinction.
scene_heading: INT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT
text: BRUCE and VICKI emerge from the restaurant. He hands his
text: parking stub to a VALET. A crowd's beginning to form in the
dialog: lot outside...
text: The red-and-blue bubble of a POLICE CAR is flashing a short
text: distance off, near the entrance to the park. TWO RED BERETS,
text: in full Order-of-the-Bat regalia, look on as a recently-mugged
text: WOMAN JOGGER gives her statement to the investigating COPS.
text: BRUCE and VICKI, intrigued by the Batman-wannabes, move a
text: little closer -- within eavesdropping range:
speaker_heading: RED BERET I
dialog: We were on patrol. Saw the whole thing.
speaker_heading: JOGGER
dialog: I was attacked. Three men in ski masks --
speaker_heading: COP I
scene_heading: <i>(indicating the RED BERETS)</i>
dialog: And these two broke it up?
speaker_heading: JOGGER
dialog: These two?? They ran like rabbits. I
dialog: never saw anybody take off so --
speaker_heading: RED BERET II
dialog: Hey! Somebody had to go for the cops.
speaker_heading: COP II
dialog: You. SHUT UP, all right??
speaker_heading: <i>(to the JOGGER)</i>
dialog: Lady, who was it that bailed you out??
speaker_heading: JOGGER
dialog: A kid. Thirteen or fourteen tops. He
text: just came out of nowhere and -- tore into
dialog: 'em.
dialog: <i>(shaking her head)</i>
text: It was so quick I didn't even see his
dialog: face.
text: Nearby, VICKI shoots a highly quizzical look at BRUCE, who
text: responds with a mystified shrug. Her professional curiosity
text: piqued, she wanders over to introduce herself to the JOGGER.
text: An exasperated COP leads the RED BERETS away from the crime
dialog: site:
speaker_heading: RED BERET I
dialog: Dumb shit. Shouldn'ta been jogging in the
text: park at night anyway.
dialog: <i>(sullenly)</i>
dialog: Look around you. It's fulla bums.
text: BRUCE gestures at the RED BERET's Batman sweatshirt as he
dialog: passes.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Nice outfit.
speaker_heading: RED BERET I
dialog: Piss off, geek.

scene_heading: EXT. WATERFRONT DISTRICT - NIGHT
text: Snow blankets the abandoned warehouses rimming Gotham Harbor.
text: FOGHORNS blare in the distance as a pair of STILETTO HEELS --
dialog: totally inappropriate for the weather -- click across the
text: sidewalk and pause at mid-block, where a wide wooden plank
text: leads down from street level to a seedy hole-in-the-wall bar:
text: the WHARF RAT.
scene_heading: INT. WHARF RAT - NIGHT
text: A roughneck joint, about as trendy as the average bait shack.
text: The clientele consists primarily of surly types who are saving
text: up for their next tattoo. A TV over the bar is tuned to the
dialog: late news:
speaker_heading: ANCHORWOMAN
dialog: ...and tomorrow, the city's power elite
dialog: will be turning out in force to greet
dialog: millionaire industrialist Walter Barrett,
text: who returns to Gotham after a five-year
dialog: stay in Europe...
text: The BARTENDER switches to a hockey game, because none of the
text: rowdies at the bar give a shit about Walter Barrett. None,
text: that is, except for a strapping young bruiser named RICKY, who
text: gets up and makes his way to a pay phone in the corner.
text: Moments later, the owner of the high heels enters; she opens
text: her black fur coat and unwraps her muffler, revealing exotic,
text: vaguely Eurasian features. She's dark and elegant, fine-
dialog: boned, regal of bearing -- and her name, though we don't know
text: it yet, is SELINA KYLE.
dialog: She's not the kind of girl who typically frequents the Wharf
text: Rat, and so her entrance creates quite a stir. A LONGSHOREMAN
text: at the nearby pool table misses his shot and digs a rut in the
text: felt. Two blowsy WHORES size her up territorially as she
text: finds an open stool at the bar and settles in with serene
text: indifference.
text: The regulars, of course, are all but licking their chops. The
text: only guy in the joint who hasn't noticed her yet is RICKY,
dialog: who's still on the phone:
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Yo. Ricky here. What's the haps?
text: In mid-conversation he notices SELINA. She smiles invitingly
text: -- right at him. Mildly startled, he smiles back.
speaker_heading: RICKY (cont.)
dialog: Midnight. No sweat. See you then.
text: He hangs up eagerly. Then, with a deep breath, he hitches up
text: his pants and swaggers over to SELINA's end of the bar.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Well. "Ricky," is it?
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: How'd you know that?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I heard you on the phone. Talking to your
dialog: girlfriend.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Girlfriend? No, no. That was business.
text: SELINA makes a big show of peeling off her gloves.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: If you've got time for a little pleasure
dialog: ...maybe you'd like to buy me a drink.
text: She clasps his hand. His EYES BUG OUT. Three enormous rings,
dialog: a diamond bracelet -- there must be several thousand in rocks
text: on her left hand alone. RICKY gapes at the sparklers,
text: bedazzled.
speaker_heading: RICKY
text: Jeez -- they look almost real.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Why wouldn't they be?
dialog: RICKY is not the smoothest guy around, and his line of thought
text: is all too evident. He swallows hard and tries not to stare.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: You'd have to be crazy. Nobody'd wear the
dialog: real thing to a dive like this.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Oh, they're real, all right. So are
dialog: these.
text: She waves her FINGERNAILS -- long, polished, and talon-sharp
text: -- in front of his eyes. With lightning speed, before he can
text: react, she pins his wrist to the bar -- and with one quick
text: stroke carves a THIN BLOODY STRIPE in the back of his hand.
text: SELINA's eyes flash as he gasps in shock. He tries to jerk
text: his hand away, but he can't break her grip. Then -- her
text: dominance firmly established -- she releases his hand with a
text: coy, Cheshire-cat smile.
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
dialog: Weren't we going to have a drink?
text: He blinks, forces a chuckle, smiles unsteadily. She takes his
text: wounded hand, lifts it slowly to her mouth, and LAPS GENTLY at
text: the blood. RICKY is hypnotized.
text: She's got an odd way of flirting, but RICKY finds it somehow
text: -- intriguing. He dabs at his hand with a napkin and signals
text: to the BARTENDER.

scene_heading: EXT. WATERFRONT - PIER 31 - NIGHT
text: Just after midnight; the snow's still failing, the waters are
text: icy, and the wharfs are deserted -- almost. A small STEAMBOAT
text: is docked at Pier 31, and the deck is lined with THUGS --
text: mean, ugly, and heavily armed.
text: A similar contingent of gun-toting GOONS is waiting to greet
text: them on the dock below. The boys on the dock hoist ASSAULT
text: RIFLES as the BOAT THUGS extend a gangplank. Something major
dialog: is about to happen...
text: The CHIEF DOCK GOON gestures to his LIEUTENANT, who grabs a
text: black MEDICAL BAG. Hands raised, the two of them start up the
dialog: gangplank.
text: Throughout all this, the DOCK GOONS keep their guns trained on
text: the BOAT THUGS, covering their buddies. One of them turns to
dialog: a colleague:
speaker_heading: DOCK GOON I
dialog: Where's that goddam Ricky?
speaker_heading: DOCK GOON II
dialog: Probably out gettin' laid. And here we
dialog: are freezin' our balls off...
scene_heading: EXT. STEAMBOAT - ON DECK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: The LIEUTENANT unloads chemical testing gear from his doctor's
text: bag. The lead BOAT THUG gestures to a stack of SHIPPING
text: CRATES which rest atop a large NET spread out across the deck.
speaker_heading: BOAT THUG I
dialog: You pick.
text: The CHIEF GOON selects a crate at random. Two BOAT THUGS tip
text: it on its side and, using a crowbar, pry off a FALSE BOTTOM --
text: revealing a dozen packets of WHITE POWDER.
scene_heading: POV SHOT - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT
text: We're now watching the scene from a vantage point atop a
text: ramshackle boathouse at water's edge. Down on the deck of the
text: steamboat, the LIEUTENANT goes to work testing the
dialog: merchandise.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: It's pure.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE - THAT MOMENT
text: A BLACK SILHOUETTE is peering down from the boathouse roof.
text: The mysterious watcher ducks quickly out of sight; the only
text: details that register are a pair of ominously familiar POINTY
dialog: EARS...
speaker_heading: CHIEF GOON (O.S.)
dialog: Let's do it.
text: He gestures to his boys on the dock. A CRANE-AND-WINCH
text: assembly rotates into place over the deck -- and the BOAT
text: THUGS gather up the corners of the netting and attach them to
text: the big hook.
speaker_heading: BOAT THUG I
dialog: Hold it. Let's see the money.
text: Down on the wharf, a DOCK GOON kneels beside a metal suitcase
text: and opens it. Lots of long green inside. The BOAT THUG
text: signals thumbs up, and the CRATES rise into the air as the
text: goon with the suitcase starts up the gangplank.
scene_heading: LOW ANGLE - ON GANGPLANK - THAT MOMENT
text: The goon with the suitcase marches up. Beyond him, in the
text: distance, a LITHE BLACK SHADOW vaults off the boathouse roof
text: and makes a silent, graceful landing on the long shaft of the
speaker_heading: CRANE.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT
text: The moment of maximum tension: grim faces all around, everyone
text: holding a gun on someone else as the suitcase arrives on deck
text: and crane swings over the pier.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON CRANE - THAT MOMENT
text: Razor-sharp, CHROME-STEEL TALONS slash suddenly through the
dialog: air.
scene_heading: ON DOCK - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT
text: The netting GIVES WAY, and TWO DOZEN SHIPPING CRATES rain down
text: onto the pier, CRUSHING two DOCK GOONS underneath. The crates
text: explode into splinters, littering the dock with drugs and
text: random ART OBJECTS as the other DOCK GOONS scatter in panic.
scene_heading: ON STEAMBOAT - THAT MOMENT
text: Nobody knows quite what's going on. Panicking, the GOON with
text: the suitcase full of money turns tail and dives for the
text: gangplank. BOAT THUG I sees him and squeezes off a quick
text: shot. Winged, the GOON topples off the gangplank and hits the
dialog: drink, suitcase and all.
text: Pandemonium. All at once, everyone's OPENING FIRE. Thinking
text: he's been double-crossed, BOAT THUG I turns on the CHIEF GOON
text: and SHOOTS HIM TWICE at point-blank range.
speaker_heading: BOAT THUG I
dialog: YOU SON OF A BITCH!
scene_heading: <i>(to another BOAT THUG)</i>
dialog: Go after it. Get the money. GO!!
text: He raises his gun, and the second BOAT THUG dutifully obeys --
text: diving off the deck into a hail of gunfire. Everyone's
text: ducking for cover. BOAT THUG I barks orders at the
dialog: pilothouse:
speaker_heading: BOAT THUG I
dialog: Soltar las amarras! -- CAST OFF!!
scene_heading: ANOTHER BOAT THUG
speaker_heading: LOOK!
text: BOAT THUG I whirls, just in time to see a SHADOWY FIGURE
text: landing cat-like on the deck mere yards away. Clad in inky
text: black leather from head to toe, the intruder's face is
text: concealed by what appears to be a BONDAGE MASK. Studded, with
text: openings for the eyes and mouth, it spans one incongruous
text: touch: a pair of POINTED CAT EARS.
text: She bares her teeth and HISSES.
dialog: It's a woman.
text: BOAT THUG I is momentarily mesmerized. In the time it takes
text: him to lift his gun, she's produced a CAT-O'-NINE-TAILS. She
text: SNAPS it at him: REELS HIM IN; and with one lethal stroke,
text: RAKES her steel talons across his face and throat. He slumps
text: to the deck, lifeless.
text: The other BOAT THUG rushes her; she catches him under the jaw
text: with a sudden upthrust, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR, and sends him
text: toppling into the water.
text: The gangplank falls aside as the steamboat pulls away from the
text: pier. She hoists an abandoned ASSAULT RIFLE, SCATTERS the
text: DOCK GOONS with a round of automatic fire, and VAULTS off the
text: boat -- landing in a graceful crouch on the edge of the pier.
text: Most of the DOCK GOONS have taken flight, but a few unlucky
text: specimens remain behind. She somersaults forward; takes one
text: goon off his feet with a crack of the whip; knocks another off
text: the dock with a twirling high-kick to the jaw; sends two more
text: reeling with swift talon-slashes. The whole frenzied mop-up
text: action takes just under ten seconds. Alone at last, she
text: stands back to survey the scene.
text: Counting the stiff's on the boat -- which is now receding in
text: the harbor -- there must be well over a dozen dead. The snow
text: is speckled with red. A half-dozen bodies lie sprawled in
text: their own blood; one of them, the lone survivor, is face-down
text: and softly MOANING.
text: Retracting her steel claws, the MASKED WOMAN crouches amid the
text: wreckage of the smashed shipping crates. BINDLES OF WHITE
text: POWDER -- millions of dollars' worth -- are scattered all
text: about the pier, but she couldn't seem less interested.
text: Instead, she's checking the MANIFEST NUMBERS stamped on the
text: sides of the crates.
text: She finds crate #18396-BB and rummages among its contents
text: until she comes up with a carefully-wrapped parcel. She opens
text: it carefully and holds it up for inspection. The statuette of
text: a RAVEN -- carved from solid onyx -- glistens in the
dialog: moonlight.
text: The WOMAN pauses long enough to slip a small CARD in the
text: MOANING PUNK's back pocket. Then, cradling the raven under
text: one arm, she dashes off on silent cat feet.
text: A LANTERN approaches. It's an OLD SALT -- some kind of
text: hapless night watchman -- and his face goes bone-white at the
text: sight of the carnage on the docks. He kneels beside the
text: moaning punk, turns the body over, and GASPS -- because the
text: PUNK'S FACE has been CLAWED TO SHREDS.

text: Carefully landscaped, it looks like the penguin exhibit at the
dialog: Gotham Zoological Gardens.
text: A MASSIVE, INDISTINCT SHAPE glides beneath the surface. It's
text: not a whale; it's too pink. It is, instead, the PENGUIN --
text: and as he breaks the surface, sputtering, he sees FRICK
text: standing in the open doorway.
speaker_heading: FRICK
dialog: Mr. Boniface? Your...visitor has arrived.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Thank you, Mr. Frick. Show her in.
text: The PENGUIN moves to the edge of the sunken pool. Two of his
text: LACKEYS swivel a CROSSBAR, which hangs from the ceiling by a
text: long chain, into place over his head. He grasps it with both
text: hands -- and the crossbar RISES, hoisting his formidable bulk
text: out of the water.
scene_heading: INT. HIGH-RISE - CORRIDOR - THAT MOMENT
text: FRICK leads the VISITOR down a long corridor lined on either
text: side with BIRD CAGES -- exotic songbirds with brilliantly-hued
text: plumage. CAMERA TRACKS ALONG behind her, and although we
text: can't see her face, there must be something distinctively
text: feline about her -- because the BIRDS are shrieking and
text: fluttering in their cages, RECOILING INSTINCTIVELY as she
text: strolls past.
text: FRICK opens a door and ushers her into...
scene_heading: INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
text: Our visitor -- SELINA KYLE -- enters the penguin-pool room.
text: Her teeth begin to chatter. The big bay windows have been
text: thrown open, and SNOW is blowing in from outside. It's
dialog: freezing in here.
text: She sees the PENGUIN -- wearing a thin dressing gown and an
text: APRON outfitted with SEED POUCHES -- scattering birdseed on
text: the window ledge for the pigeons, totally oblivious to the
text: cold. He turns, throws his arms wide in greeting, kisses the
text: back of SELINA's hand.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Ah, Miss Kyle! At last we meet.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: At last we meet. -- Pigeons?
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Yes, they're common birds -- dirty,
dialog: stupid, unattractive -- but they're very
dialog: obedient, and they do crap on people's
dialog: heads. May I?
text: She extends a SHOPPING BAG. The PENGUIN removes a parcel and
text: unwraps it, revealing the RAVEN STATUETTE. He sets it on a
text: nearby desk, fondles it reverently...and BEAMS at SELINA.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN (cont.)
dialog: I see your reputation was not exaggerated.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I've located the others. All but one.
dialog: <i>(shivering)</i>
dialog: I'm surprised you don't catch
dialog: pneumonia -- !
text: With an apologetic smile, the PENGUIN pulls the windows shut.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: My normal body temperature is ninety-two
dialog: degrees. Germs find me inhospitable.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I see why they call you the Penguin.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: They may call me that...but rarely more
dialog: than once. Champagne?
text: She nods. He pours two glasses, hands one to SELINA, raises a
dialog: toast.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN (cont.)
dialog: My dear. Here's to the second biggest
dialog: crime in the history of Gotham City.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. POLICE OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: COMMISSIONER GORDON and another cop, LT. EDDIE BULLOCK, are in
text: darkened antechamber adjacent to an interrogation room.
speaker_heading: BULLOCK
dialog: It wasn't about the drugs. Whoever it was
text: left thirty kilos sitting on the docks.
text: They're watching, through a two-way glass panel, as a
text: terrified man with a heavily-bandaged face tells his story.
text: It's the lone survivor of the dock massacre, JULIO, and his
text: voice is audible over a concealed intercom:
speaker_heading: JULIO (filter)
dialog: Un silueta negra -- con colmillos, y
dialog: garras -- el demonio. El murcielago.
speaker_heading: MURCIELAGO!
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: What's that he keeps saying?
speaker_heading: BULLOCK
dialog: "Murcielago." -- Bat.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Nonsense. That dock looked like a
dialog: slaughter-house. Batman's never committed
dialog: murder.
speaker_heading: BULLOCK
dialog: We did find this in his back pocket.
text: BULLOCK hands GORDON a CARD. It reads: "THOSE WHO FEED ON THE
text: SOUL OF GOTHAM WILL SUFFER MY WRATH" -- and in lieu of a
text: signature, there's a little black BAT-EMBLEM in the bottom
dialog: corner.
text: While GORDON's staring at it, a POLICEMAN pokes his head in:
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Commissioner? We've got Barrett.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
text: A cubicle down the hall. The splenetic WALTER BARRETT,
text: millionaire industrialist, is fidgeting in his chair as GORDON
text: enters.
speaker_heading: BARRETT
dialog: Fine welcome. These storm troopers of
dialog: yours dragged me away from my coming-home
dialog: party!
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: I'd like to know the meaning of this --
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I'd like to know how thirty kilos of pure
dialog: cocaine wound up concealed in your
dialog: personal effects.
speaker_heading: BARRETT
dialog: Gordon -- I come from one of the oldest
dialog: and most influential familles in Gotham.
dialog: If you plan to accuse me of smuggling
dialog: drugs, be my guest.
dialog: <i>(long, menacing pause)</i>
dialog: I'll have your badge before you leave this
dialog: room.
text: GORDON weighs the threat. He nods to the COPS in
dialog: attendance...
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Book the son of a bitch.
text: GORDON storms out. BARRETT jumps out of his chair, but the
text: COPS restrain him. Outraged, he bats their hands away...
speaker_heading: BARRETT
dialog: I believe I'm still entitled to a phone
dialog: call.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN GOTHAM - DAY
text: VICKI with her camera, squeezing off snaps. She's standing
text: behind a SAWHORSE, part of a crowd of onlookers at a downtown
text: DEMOLITION SITE. SURVEYORS and HARDHATS bustle about in a
text: VACANT LOT, a full city block in size, fenced off and strewn
text: with rubble. The only structure still standing is a lone,
text: decrepit TENEMENT BUILDING; a WRECKING BALL is poised above
text: it, ready to strike.
text: A SIGN at one corner of the lot announces a forty-story OFFICE
text: COMPLEX soon to be erected on this site by SHAW CONSTRUCTION,
text: INC. Down below is RANDALL SHAW HIMSELF, in necktie and
text: hardhat, speaking into a WALKIE-TALKIE:
speaker_heading: SHAW
dialog: Come on! Let's move it! We're an hour
dialog: behind as it is!!
text: A few moments later, a CLUSTER OF PEOPLE emerge from the
text: tenement building -- a mixed team of COPS and CONSTRUCTION
text: GOONS who are forcibly removing a DESTITUTE FAMILY from the
text: condenmed building. VICKI watches angrily...
scene_heading: HER POV - TELEPHOTO LENS
text: A quick series of shots: the SQUATTERS wailing and struggling,
text: clinging to the doorways, unwilling to leave. Their few
text: belongings are packed in a couple of CARDBOARD BOXES, which
text: the cops heave rudely out onto the street. Finally, the
text: handcuffs and nightsticks come out...
scene_heading: ANGLE ON SHAW - THAT MOMENT - DAY
text: A SURVEYOR grabs SHAW by the arm and points out the woman
text: taking photos in the crowd. SHAW recognizes her instantly.
text: His face turns into a mask of outrage -- as if he's been
dialog: personally betrayed.
speaker_heading: SHAW
dialog: Jesus Christ, that's Bruce Wayne's bimbo!
text: He makes eye contact with her. VICKI stares back defiantly.
text: He's about to stroll over and tell her off when a HARDHAT
dialog: signals to him:
speaker_heading: HARDHAT
dialog: Phone call, Mr. Shaw. Guy said it's
dialog: urgent.
speaker_heading: SHAW
scene_heading: <i>(to tbe SURVEYOR)</i>
dialog: Hold the ball. I wanna hear it crash.
text: He climbs into the cab of a nearby TRUCK, where he picks up a
scene_heading: CELLULAR PHONE.
scene_heading: INTERCUT - BARRETT AND SHAW
text: BARRETT's still in custody at the police station -- using his
text: one phone call to contact the construction magnate.
speaker_heading: BARRETT
dialog: It's me, Randall -- Walter Barrett. I
dialog: want you to call my attorney. That was my
dialog: shipment they busted up last night.
speaker_heading: SHAW
dialog: Jesus, Walter, I --
dialog: <i>(suddenly puzzled)</i>
dialog: Why are you calling me??
speaker_heading: BARRETT
dialog: It's worse than that. Somebody took my
text: raven.
text: SHAW stares at the phone in horrified disbelief.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON VICKI - THAT MOMENT
text: SHE WATCHES as SHAW climbs out of the truck -- numb, in a
text: daze. He signals to the WRECKING BALL OPERATOR; a WHISTLE
text: blows, and the great iron ball knocks a MAMMOTH HOLE in the
text: facade of the tenement.
text: SHAW doesn't even stick around to watch it. He scurries off
text: to his car at the end of the block. VICKI, highly intrigued,
dialog: gets it all on film...
scene_heading: INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY
text: VICKI's in a huddle with the Managing Editor, SCHULTZ, showing
text: him her PHOTOS -- SHAW orchestrating the eviction of the
scene_heading: SQUATTER FAMILY.
speaker_heading: SCHULTZ
dialog: Great stuff, but we're looking at a
dialog: shitfight with our beloved publisher. He
dialog: and Shaw...
dialog: <i>(crossing his fingers)</i>
dialog: Old money sticks together.
text: VICKI points to a photo of SHAW racing from the truck to his
dialog: car.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I'd sure like to know what shook him up
text: so. He was out of there like a scared
dialog: rabbit...
text: Just then, a reporter -- WILK -- rushes up excitedly to
text: SCHULTZ's desk.
speaker_heading: WILK
dialog: Got a blind tip from downtown. You know
dialog: that massacre on the docks? Batman.
text: VICKI reacts in astonishment. SCHULTZ's jaw drops -- this is
dialog: hot.
speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: Whoa! Is this on the level?
speaker_heading: WILK
dialog: Cops even got a note. "Those who feed on
dialog: the soul of Gotham will suffer my wrath!"
dialog: <i>(grinning; to VICKI)</i>
dialog: Sounds like your pal's cranked it up a
dialog: notch.
text: VICKI starts to protest, but thinks better of it.
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY HALL - EVENING
text: ALFRED opens the door. A BANNER HEADLINE stares him in the
dialog: face:
scene_heading: BATMAN IMPLICATED IN DOCK MASSACRE
dialog: Industrialist Linked to Drug Smuggling Ring
text: VICKI, who's holding up the afternoon paper for ALFRED's
text: inspection, peeks out glumly from behind the masthead.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Seen the late edition?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I'm afraid so, Miss Vale. Master Bruce is
text: sequestered in the cave.
scene_heading: INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING
text: On their way to the Batcave, ALFRED and VICKI pass through the
text: library. They pause in front of the television -- which is
text: tuned to a PANEL SHOW, with various experts discussing the hot
dialog: issue of the day.
scene_heading: ENVIRONMENTALIST (on TV)
dialog: Walter Barrett's no saint. His factories
text: have been dumping poison into the air and
dialog: water for years. If he is mixed up with
dialog: drugs...
speaker_heading: PUNDIT (on TV)
dialog: That's not the issue. The issue is, do we
dialog: entrust our public safety to some...masked
dialog: vigilante. Does Batman have a license to
dialog: kill?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: <i>(shaking his head)</i>
dialog: Ah, the public. Dishearteningly fickle.
text: VICKI follows ALFRED out. We HOLD on the TV as the CAMERA
text: PANS OVER to the third guest on the panel, loudly demanding
text: air time. He's wearing a RED BERET and a BATMAN SWEATSHIRT:
scene_heading: MIKE SEKOWSKY (on TV)
dialog: Yo, here's the tip, man. Drug dealers are
dialog: scum. If Batman did wax these punks...SO
dialog: WHAT? They deserved it! End of
dialog: discussion.
scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING
text: ALFRED and VICKI arrive; BRUCE gestures for them to keep
text: quiet. He's hunched over a TAPE RECORDER -- and COMMISSIONER
text: GORDON'S VOICE is blaring from a nearby speaker...
speaker_heading: GORDON (O.S.; filter)
dialog: Anyone could've written that note.
scene_heading: INT. GORDON'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT
text: GORDON's in conference with a number of CITY OFFICIALS --
text: blissfully unaware that anyone might be eavesdropping.
speaker_heading: CITY OFFICIAL I
dialog: And I suppose anyone could've taken out a
text: boatload of armed thugs. A dozen men, Jim
dialog: -- murdered in cold blood --
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Before we forget, Batman's saved hundreds
dialog: of lives!
speaker_heading: CITY OFFICIAL II
dialog: He's still a vigilante. We don't know who
dialog: he is, where he comes from, why he does
dialog: it...
speaker_heading: CITY OFFICIAL I
dialog: Street punks are one thing, Jim. This is
dialog: Walter Barrett -- a personal friend of
dialog: mine!
text: As the conversation continues, CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES IN ON a
text: COMPUTER TERMINAL in the corner. We see the tiny TRADEMARK
text: embossed on the CPU -- "WAYNE TECHNOLOGIES."
scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT - ON BRUCE
text: as he LISTENS through his concealed bug.
speaker_heading: CITY OFFCIAL II
dialog: You've gotta bring him in, Jim -- at least
dialog: for questioning. It would sure help if we
dialog: could get that mask off...
text: BRUCE shuts the recorder off. He turns to face ALFRED and
speaker_heading: VICKI --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen...I've been framed.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM CITY - NIGHT
text: The BAT-SIGNAL blazing in the night sky. After a beat, the
text: CAMERA TILTS DOWN to a cluster of EXCITED CITIZENS, who point
text: and holler as the BATMOBILE streaks past.
scene_heading: INT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT
text: TWO COPS are parked in an alleyway, watching as the BATMOBILE
text: whizzes past on the street. The DRIVER pulls out behind it as
text: the second COP grabs his radio mike...
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: One-delta-niner -- 10-80 on Riverview
text: north-bound at 33rd -- 10-78, repeat
dialog: 10-78.
speaker_heading: VOICE ON RADIO (filter)
dialog: 10-4, one-delta-niner -- that's a 10-37,
text: repeat 10-37. Backup on the way.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - ON BATMOBILE
text: BARRELING TOWARD US on the street. The SQUAD CAR gains behind
text: it. A SIREN HOWLS; a red-and-blue bubble begins to flash...
text: The BATMOBILE makes a HAIRPIN TURN -- and ACCELERATES.
scene_heading: OVERHEAD ANGLE - THE STREETS
text: As the BATMOBILE rounds the corner and picks up speed, TWO
text: MORE SQUAD CARS scream down the cross street, joining in the
text: pursuit. All at once THICK BLACK SMOKE billows from the back
text: of the Batmobile -- ENVELOPING the police cars, BLINDING THE
dialog: DRIVERS...
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: TWO SQUAD CARS parked in a V-formation -- a makeshift
text: roadblock. ANXIOUS POLICEMEN mill about in front of them.
text: They move into position as the BATMOBILE, still trailing
text: smoke, rounds a corner and careens directly toward them...
scene_heading: ANGLE ON BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT
text: The FRONT FENDER of the Batmobile detaches and EXTENDS itself
text: from the body of the car. It BENDS in the middle; WING-PANELS
text: flip into place, forming an arrowhead-shaped COW-CATCHER.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - ON ROADBLOCK
text: A SHRIEKING HORN BLARES. The COPS see the Batmobile SPEEDING
text: UP and dive for the sidewalk. The COW-CATCHER slams into the
text: SOUAD CARS, pushes them effortlessly aside, and cruises
text: through the gap.
text: As the PURSUING CARS emerge from the smoke cloud and follow
text: the Batmobile through, we TILT UP to the roof of a nearby
dialog: building --
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT
text: -- and realize that the Batmobile's on automatic pilot,
dialog: because BATMAN's been on the roof all along -- watching the
text: action with some dismay.
text: His relationship with the Gotham PD appears to be on shaky
text: ground. He speaks into his voice-activated REMOTE CONTROL
speaker_heading: UNIT:
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Evasive.
text: SIRENS HOWL below as he strolls across the rooftop, lost in
dialog: thought.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: At this height, the SIRENS are a distant insect drone. We're
text: in the palatial digs of RANDALL SHAW, the construction
dialog: magnate. There's obviously money to be made in real-estate
text: development -- because the walls are lined with art, and the
text: floor-to-ceiling windows open on the most spectacular view in
dialog: Gotham.
text: At the moment, SHAW's posing casually in front of his new
text: Brancusi -- which rests on a pedestal near the windows. An
text: UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN in a slinky black dress LOOKS ON, her back
dialog: to the camera...
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: It's a fake.
speaker_heading: SHAW
dialog: Hmm. It cost me a half a million dollars.
dialog: You're sure?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Absolutely. You see, I...happen to know
text: where the real one is stashed.
text: The WOMAN wanders out of frame as SHAW smiles, impressed. He
text: seems peculiarly nonchalant about the whole deal; at the
text: moment, art is not the first thing on his mind. CAMERA STAYS
text: ON HIM as he pours two glasses of red wine and circles in on
text: his mysterious guest.
speaker_heading: SHAW
dialog: I guess you'd know. I have some "friends"
dialog: in the art world. They say that -- for
dialog: certain hard-to-get items -- you're the
dialog: one to call.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (O.S.)
dialog: How flattering.
speaker_heading: SHAW
dialog: They say for the right price...you could
dialog: steal Michelangelo off the Sistine Chapel
dialog: Wall.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Mr. Shaw. Do you believe everything you
dialog: hear?
speaker_heading: SHAW
dialog: Oh, I'm not one to judge. I admire people
dialog: who take what they want. I'm just curious
dialog: how you do it.
text: SHAW hands her the wine, and for the first time we see her
text: face. It's SELINA KYLE, perching seductively on the arm of
dialog: the sofa...
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I find that the old methods work best.
text: Setting her wine down, flashing her patented Cheshire-cat
text: smile, SELINA moves in on him -- and they go into a deep,
text: passionate kiss. Her long red nails dig into his back; SHAW
text: drops his wine glass, which SHATTERS -- splashing red wine
text: across the polished parquet floor.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE - SHAW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The action's gone horizontal. SELINA, peeled down to a sheer
text: lace teddy, is on the bed atop SHAW -- tickling his throat
text: with quick, lapping kisses. She rolls off suddenly; when he
text: tries to sit up, she pushes him back down with a single
dialog: finger.
text: Sitting on the edge of the bed, she peels off her STOCKINGS,
text: twisting them around into tight cords. With a coy smile she
text: runs her finger in a circle around SHAW's hairy chest -- and
text: then, abruptly, knots one stocking tightly about his wrist and
text: ties it off on the bedpost.
speaker_heading: SHAW
dialog: Hey, what are you doing -- ?
text: He tries to break her grip. She BACKHANDS him sharply across
text: the face.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: You're very inquisitive. You'll just have
dialog: to be disciplined.
text: An EDGY SMILE spreads across his face as she binds his other
text: hand to the bedpost. None too quick, he's just caught on that
text: all this is part of SELINA's kinky scene. She crosses quickly
dialog: to the bathroom --
speaker_heading: SHAW
dialog: You know, I've...I've never really done
dialog: this kind of thing before.
text: -- and reemerges wearing her CATWOMAN mask...which seems
dialog: perfectly appropriate in this context.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I think people should indulge their
dialog: fantasies. Don't you?
text: Now that he's all trussed up, she crosses the room and reaches
text: into an oversized bag. She withdraws an odd-looking chromium
text: BRACE, slips it on over her wrist, and hits a trigger. SIX-
text: INCH STEEL TALONS snick into place. SHAW's dopey smile
text: fades...
speaker_heading: SHAW
dialog: Hey, what are those -- what are you --
text: He lets out an awful, shrill SHRIEK as the camera WHIP PANS
text: away from the bed to a Jackson Pollack on the wall nearby. A
text: SPRAY OF BLOOD spatters across it -- in an aesthetically
text: pleasing way -- and the SHRIEK ends in a LOW GURGLE as we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BUILDING LOBBY - A FEW MINUTES LATER - NIGHT
text: A SECURITY GUARD is working a crossword at his booth near the
text: entrance of the building. Behind him, a bank of MONITORS show
text: various empty hallways throughout the building. He reaches
text: for his coffee and sees a RED LIGHT flashing on a wall panel
dialog: nearby.
scene_heading: INT. SHAW'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT
text: The penthouse is THROBBING with the clangorous sound of a
text: BURGLAR ALARM. SELINA is standing by an OPEN WALL SAFE --
text: concealed behind a painting, which has been swung away on
text: hinges -- and she's HOLDING HER EARS, wearing a look of
text: complete exasperation: oh, shit. The GUARD'S VOICE crackles
text: over a nearby intercom:
speaker_heading: GUARD (O.S.; filter)
dialog: Mr. Shaw? What's going on up there? --
dialog: Mr. Shaw?
text: Furious with herself, she reaches inside the safe and extracts
text: a BLACK RAVEN statuette -- identical to the one she took on
text: the docks. She slams the door shut and swings the picture
text: back into place.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: SIRENS echo in the streets. SQUAD CARS make sudden turns and
text: streak off toward SHAW's building.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT
text: Watching the cars from his rooftop vantage, BATMAN raises an
text: ANTENNA mounted on his utility belt and cups one hand to his
text: head. An EARPIECE concealed inside his cowl gives him the
dialog: police frequency:
speaker_heading: DISPATCHER (O.S.; filter)
dialog: -- possible 15 in progress, 188 E. 69th at
dialog: Gotham Park West. Move out. It's Randall
dialog: Shaw. Repeat, all units --
text: BATMAN's eyes widen. He steps to the ledge and pulls a TINY
text: METAL CYLINDER from his belt -- immediately recognizable as
text: part of BRUCE's hydraulic umbrella-gizmo.
text: But it's no umbrella. When BATMAN thumbs the switch, his
text: BLACK CAPE begins to SPREAD and RISE -- stiffening, expanding
text: -- INFLATING itself into a pair of RIGID BLACK BATWINGS.
text: He steps OFF THE LEDGE, INTO MIDAIR -- SOARING SILENTLY ACROSS
text: THE STREET LIKE A HUMAN HANG-GLIDER as the cop cars cruise
text: past far below.
scene_heading: INT. SHAW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: There's an awful BANGING at the front door. SHAW lies under
text: the bloody sheets, hands folded, staring lifelessly up at the
text: ceiling. SELINA, now dressed in full Catwoman regalia, slings
text: a lightweight KNAPSACK over her shoulders. She picks up the
text: nearest chair, RAMS IT through SHAW's plate-glass window, and
text: clambers out onto the ledge outside.
text: Ten seconds later the COPS burst in. They rush to the bedroom
text: -- spot the shattered window, the inert gory mass on the
dialog: bed --
text: -- but the real shock comes when they glance over at the wall.
text: Painted there, in blood...is a big, red, dripping BAT.
speaker_heading: COP
speaker_heading: JESUS!
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - SHAW'S BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Forty stories up. The CATWOMAN, in a surefooted crouch, she
text: scurries along the ledge -- SPRINGS at a cornice -- and in one
text: lithe motion VAULTS UP onto the ROOF. She scampers across the
text: rooftops, dropping from one to the next with rope and tackle,
dialog: like a mountain climber --
text: -- until she reaches the building at the end of the block.
text: Here she pauses to dig in her knapsack. She pulls out a
text: retractable HOOK at the end of a rope, swings it around,
text: HEAVES IT at the rooftop across the street...
scene_heading: EXT. STREET BELOW - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT
text: POLICE pile out of cars and race for the entrance, totally
text: oblivious to the odd scene taking place overhead -- where the
text: small, barely-visible figure of a WOMAN, clad entirely in
text: black leather, is doing a TIGHTROPE WALK across the
dialog: intersection.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT
text: The CATWOMAN bounds across snowy rooftops until she decides
text: she's out of danger. Then, weary and exhilarated, she drops
text: to her knees; bathed in moonlight, she preens, stretches,
text: emits eerie little purrs and hisses of pleasure. She's just
text: made a kill and her blood is running high, so she's stopped
text: for a moment of Quality Time.
text: She hears an odd crunching noise two roofs over. Her whole
text: body tenses and -- though her head doesn't move -- her eyes
dialog: dart left.
text: A CAPED SHADOW has just touched down at the end of a line.
text: The gold BAT-EMBLEM on his chest is visible for the briefest
text: of seconds before he steps back into the shadows. She acts
text: like she hasn't noticed...
text: ...but a little smile flickers across her lips just the same.
scene_heading: TIGHT ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT
text: His eyes widen -- his LIPS PART as he watches her. If it's
dialog: possible to see absolute consternation behind that mask, we're
text: seeing it now.
scene_heading: HIS POV - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT
text: She still doesn't let on that she's seen him. Instead, she
text: goes to the ledge of the roof and begins to STRUT, like a
text: gymnast on the balance beam -- POSING for him in a little
text: private show -- a strange, self-infatuated, AUTOEROTIC DANCE
text: ROUTINE for BATMAN's benefit.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT
text: His jaw is down around his knees. Whoa. He edges forward
text: slightly, as if hypnotically drawn to her...
text: She hears a noise. Stops. Makes a big show of looking left
text: and right. Somehow afraid she'll see him watching, BATMAN
text: jumps back into the shadows. She gathers her things; a small
text: WHITE CARD flutters from her knapsack to the snowy roof, and
text: she VANISHES over the edge.
text: Snapping back to reality, he bolts across the roof just in
dialog: time to see --
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE OF BUILDING - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: She's rapidly working her way down the side of the building,
text: flipping down from one fire escape to tile next -- a master
text: gymnast. Three stories up, she lands on a railing, then STOPS
text: -- LAUNCHING HERSELF out over the street, making a perfect
text: landing on the roof of a passing BUS.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: BATMAN turns -- and his eyes fall on the WHITE CARD. He
text: kneels to pick it up; a brief three-word MESSAGE is scrawled
dialog: upon it...
text: LOOKING FOR LOVE?
text: He goes goggle-eyed with astonishment. He rushes back to the
text: edge of the roof and sees the BUS just turning toward the
text: entrance to Gotham Park. He's reaching for his grappling-gun,
text: figuring to follow, when a FLOODLIGHT catches him full in the
dialog: face.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: Down below, the cops are sweeping their beams across the
text: rooftops. Two of them catch a quick glimpse of BATMAN just as
text: he ducks back behind the cornice, out of view.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Hey. You see what I saw...?
text: This sends the astounded COPS rushing to their radios. Right
text: on cue, COMMISSIONER GORDON's car pulls up. LT. BULLOCK,
text: who's already on the scene, fills him in as he climbs out.
speaker_heading: BULLOCK
dialog: It's Randall Shaw. Torn to ribbons. --
dialog: We just made Batman up on the roof.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Oh God.
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: The BUS rumbles deeper into the snowy park. A BLACK
text: SILHOUETTE springs off the roof into the trees, disappearing
dialog: among the branches...
text: We TRACK WITH the bus as it moves through the park, arriving
dialog: finally at:
scene_heading: EXT. CLEARING IN PARK - SHANTYTOWN - NIGHT
text: The little colony of HOMELESS PEOPLE in their cardboard shacks
text: and lean-tos, still occupying the future site of the Park
text: Towers. MARCHERS and PICKETERS are continuing their protest
text: nearby, and some charitable organization's set up a makeshift
text: soup kitchen on folding tables -- hot coffee and sandwiches.
text: VICKI's on the periphery of the camp, camera in hand. She's
text: trying to persuade a HOMELESS MAN to let his picture be taken.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Please, just one. It's important for
dialog: people to see what's happening.
speaker_heading: HOMELESS MAN
dialog: They don't want to see us, lady. They
dialog: just want us gone -- out of sight, and out
dialog: of mind.
dialog: <i>(mumbling as he wanders off)</i>
dialog: Get worse before it gets better. It
dialog: always does.
text: VICKI TURNS. In the distance, the PICKETERS are shrieking and
text: wailing. A VAN's just pulled up to the edge of the park, and
text: a dozen HARDHATS are elbowing their way through the crowd.
text: All at once they're swarming through shantytown with TIRE
text: IRONS and BASEBALL BATS, overturning the sandwich tables,
text: RIPPING DOWN the shabby tents and lean-tos.
text: Some of the HOMELESS PEOPLE run. Those who resist meet with
text: swift and sudden violence. A MARCHER jumps a hardhat, and
text: gets a baseball bat in the gut for his trouble.
text: VICKI waits for the police sirens, but they don't come. She
text: backs off toward the trees, she begins SNAPPING PHOTOS
text: FRANTICALLY, capturing the carnage on film.
text: A HARDHAT is dismantling a lean-to with his tire iron --
text: sending the terrified family inside scurrying off into the
text: snow -- when he glances up and sees VICKI taking his picture.
text: He points her out to a colleague...
text: ...and suddenly the two of them are RUSHING TOWARD HER with
text: pure cold malice in their eyes. VICKI turns to run, but it's
text: slow going in the snow. She SLIPS and FALLS; her attackers
text: are almost upon her...
text: ...when a SHADOWY FIGURE DIVES OUT OF THE TREES and TACKLES
text: one of the HARDHATS. The FIGURE lands a powerhouse blow to
text: the fallen HARDHATs jaw, knocking him out cold.
text: The second HARDHAT turns and lifts his TIRE IRON. But the
text: FIGURE, with surprising agility, is already rolling out of the
text: way. As he rolls, he grabs the first guy's HARDHAT off his
text: head and brings it up in front of him -- blocking the blow
text: from the second guy's tire iron.
text: In the same motion, he plants a FOOT in the second HARDHAT's
text: belly and sends him REELING BACKWARD, HARDHAT II drops the
text: tire iron, and the FIGURE snatches it out of midair as he gets
text: to his feet. He moves in on the second HARDHAT, BRANDISHING
dialog: the iron --
text: -- and while HARDHAT II is staring at it, the FIGURE HIGH-
text: KICKS HIM in the face. HOP; KICK. HOP; KICK. The FIGURE has
text: nailed him three times squarely on the jaw before he can hit
dialog: the ground.
text: The FIGURE turns toward VICKI. Her eyes go wide with
dialog: astonishment.
text: It's a KID, thirteen or fourteen at the outside, sunken-eyed,
text: grimy-looking, in a torn-and-tattered RAINCOAT. She stares at
text: him for the briefest of instants before he rushes off to the
dialog: aid of his fellow homeless...
text: She can't believe what she's seeing. The KID wades smack into
text: the midst of the remaining HARDHATS, and kicks ass --
text: spinning, pirouetting, kicking, clawing in a furious display
text: of pure athleticism. It seems like he's everywhere at once.
dialog: There's only one other guy in Gotham City who can handle
dialog: himself like this...
text: Rallying behind him, the MARCHERS and HOMELESS PEOPLE snatch
text: bats and tire irons from the fallen HARDHATS -- and the tide
text: turns. The invasion is being repelled. Faced with renewed
text: resistance, the few HARDHATS still left standing TURN TAIL and
text: race off to their VAN.
text: Triumph in shantytown. The MARCHERS and HOMELESS cluster
text: together to lick their wounds -- and the KID, satisfied that
text: everything is under control, turns and sprints off toward the
dialog: trees.
text: But one prostrate HARDHAT is only playing dead. As the KID
text: runs past, the HARDHAT extends a TIRE IRON into his path --
text: TRIPPING HIM, sending him sprawling in the snow. The KID
text: throws up his hands as the HARDHAT prepares to smash down at
dialog: him...
text: CLANG. The HARDHAT drops his tire iron and topples over,
text: BOARDLIKE. The KID looks up and sees VICKI standing there
text: with a baseball bat.
text: He gives her a quick nod of acknowledgement as he gets to his
text: feet -- thanks for returning the favor. He's about to light
dialog: out again when --
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: WAIT! Don't be afraid. I wanted to thank
dialog: you. I --
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: <i>(cautiously)</i>
dialog: Twenty.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Twenty bucks.
text: VICKI's mildly taken aback, but she reaches for her purse just
text: the same. She's barely gotten her wallet open when the KID
text: snatches the bill out of her hands. They stare at each other
dialog: for a long moment --
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: ...Who are you?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Dick.
text: -- and then he's bounding off like a shot. VAULTING up into a
text: tree and vanishing amid the snowy branches. VICKI starts to
text: follow, but there's no way she can keep up. Instead she digs
text: into her CAMERA BAG...
scene_heading: HER POV - THROUGH TELEPHOTO LENS
text: Using the long lens, she tracks the KID's progress through the
text: treetops. She can't actually see him, but occasional chunks
text: of SNOW and ICE are falling to the ground as he jumps from
dialog: limb to limb...
text: For a moment it seems like she's lost him. As she sweeps the
text: lens back and forth, scanning the trees, she catches sight of
text: an EQUESTRIAN STATUE in the distance. She ups the
text: magnification so she can see the plaque on the pedestal. The
text: stone figure on the horse is Union war hero GEN. OLIVER WAYNE
dialog: -- BRUCE's great-grandfather.
text: As luck would have it, the KID drops to earth not ten feet
text: from the statue -- VICKI's got him in her sights again. He
text: looks around cautiously to make sure no one's following, then
text: races toward a STONE BRIDGE which arches between two small
text: hillocks, over a frozen creek.
text: There's a DRAINAGE TUNNEL, four or five feet in diameter,
text: mounted in the bridge abutment, the KID pries off a wire grate
text: and clambers inside, then pulls the grate back into place
text: behind him. Home sweet home.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - ON VICKI - NIGHT
text: as she lowers the lens. Her face is full of conflicting
dialog: emotions. She'd love to corner this boy vigilante and find
dialog: out what his story is. But on the other hand -- even the
dialog: homeless are entitled to their privacy...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PENGUIN'S AVIARY - NIGHT
text: A CANARY sings in its cage as a BLACK CAT watches transfixed
text: from a nearby chair. The cat arches its back -- waits -- and
text: SPRINGS AT THE CAGE, BATTING at it in midair. The canary
text: SHRIEKS; the cat YOWLS; a WOMAN snatches it up off the floor,
text: cradles it in her arms...
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Now Hecate. You don't want that scrawny
dialog: little bird --
text: It's SELINA, looking ripe and slinky in a sheer black
text: ensemble. At the desk behind her is the PENGUIN, in his
text: customary cutaway and waist-coat, polishing his new RAVEN. He
text: bares his teeth:
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Do you want me to wring that creature's
dialog: neck?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: You try it, I'll do the same to you.
dialog: <i>(as he grumbles; bemused)</i>
dialog: I saw him, you know.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Saw who?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Batman. He was dreamy.
text: She strokes the cat, in a reverie. The PENGUIN drops his
text: polishing cloth, startled.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Dreamy?!? Are you insane!? My God --
dialog: <i>(sputtering wildly)</i>
dialog: Are you sure it was him? What did he do?
speaker_heading: SELINA
text: He stood on a roof and watched me. He
dialog: didn't realize I'd seen him. I don't
dialog: think he knew quite what to make of me.
dialog: <i>(smiling)</i>
dialog: But he was definitely interested.
text: This sends the PENGUIN into a frantic round of pacing. (Or
dialog: waddling.)
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: This scheme of yours is backfiring. We
dialog: don't need him on our tails. Do you know
dialog: how much money is at stake here?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Money isn't everything.
dialog: <i>(casually)</i>
dialog: What's the point if we can't enjoy
dialog: ourselves?
text: She chuckles to herself. He stares at her in disbelief -- and
speaker_heading: SQUAWKS.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - MORNING
dialog: The big SIGN over Gotham Square tells us there are only 9
text: shopping days left until Christmas. Down below, BRUCE is
text: walking VICKI to work.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Six-on-one, and he took 'em all out...then
dialog: vanished into a drainage pipe -- right
text: next to the statue of General Wayne.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: My illustrious great-grandfather. Think
dialog: it's the same kid we heard about?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Must be. He reminded me of you.
text: BRUCE chuckles. They pass a NEWSSTAND just outside the Globe
text: building, pausing to stare at the headlines -- which SCREAM:
scene_heading: NEW BAT-MURDER?
text: Batman Suspect in Slaying of Millionaire Developer
dialog: Commissioner Gordon Refuses Comment
text: The accompanying photo is a full-color spread of the BLOODY
text: RED BAT painted on SHAW's wall. BRUCE scowls at VICKI:
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: -- You work for this rag?
dialog: <i>(snatching up a paper)</i>
dialog: Your boss is calling for Gordon's
dialog: resignation -- unless he brings Batman in
dialog: for questioning...
text: VICKI nudges BRUCE and points at a STOREFRONT across the
dialog: street.
scene_heading: THEIR POV - SOUVENIR SHOP
text: The owner is in the store window, hastily removing all of his
text: Batman merchandise and setting up new displays devoted to
text: TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES and THE SIMPSONS. A MOTHER drags
text: her squirming TODDLER past the entrance -- the kid smells
text: heavy markdowns on Bat-shit, but Mom clearly doesn't
dialog: approve...
scene_heading: BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND VICKI
text: looking on in dismay. BRUCE crumples the paper in outrage:
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I need a good PR man.
speaker_heading: NEWS VENDOR
dialog: Hey, pal -- you buyin' or borrowin'?
text: With a sullen look, BRUCE tosses the paper back on the rack.
text: VICKI pulls him off toward the entrance of the Globe.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: That's what happens when you go after the
dialog: rich and powerful.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Hey, it wasn't me, remember? I am rich
dialog: and powerful --
text: As he's talking, BRUCE glances back at the newsstand. He sees
text: an AD FLYER tacked up on one side -- "LOOKING FOR LOVE? Find
text: it in the GOTHAM GLOBE PERSONALS."
text: Looking for Love. Eyes widening, he digs in his pocket for a
text: quarter and races back to the newsstand. VICKI keeps
dialog: walking...
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Maybe it's almost...good. In a weird way.
dialog: I mean, Shaw, and Barrett -- if people
dialog: like that were really scared, maybe
dialog: they'd --
text: She suddenly realizes she's talking to herself. She turns
text: around and sees BRUCE back at the newsstand, hurriedly
text: unfolding a copy of the Globe. She marches back and tugs at
dialog: his sleeve.
speaker_heading: VICKI (cont.)
dialog: Hey, I'm late for work. You can read that
dialog: later.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Quiet. I'm looking for a personal ad.
text: Her face screws up in confusion as BRUCE frantically scans the
dialog: page.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (cont.)
dialog: "Tall, Dark And Handsome -- You saw me on
dialog: the roof 12/16. I was in black; you were
dialog: too."
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Is this some kind of bad joke?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: It's her. That cat woman, or whatever she
dialog: is.
dialog: <i>(reading aloud)</i>
dialog: "I jumped a bus into Gotham Park hoping
dialog: you'd follow, but you were too shy..."
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: What does she want -- a date?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: She's trying to contact me. Says she's
dialog: gonna leave me another ad...
text: The two of them exchange a look of utter perplexity. BRUCE's
text: mind is racing; he seems bizarrely aroused -- in a way that
dialog: makes VICKI just a trifle nervous...
scene_heading: INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY
text: VICKI arrives at her desk and sets her portfolio down. She
text: spots a message in the "in" file. She takes one look at it,
text: and her eyes go wide with RAGE. She storms out in a fury...
scene_heading: INT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - A MINUTE LATER - DAY
text: Barging past a phalanx of SECRETARIES, VICKI bursts into the
text: inner office of HARRISON J. PROVOST, publisher of the Globe.
text: He's just opening his mail. He heaves a weary sigh as VICKI
text: BARKS at him:
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: WHY DID YOU KILL MY STORY?
speaker_heading: PROVOST
dialog: Close the door.
dialog: <i>(waiting for her to calm down)</i>
dialog: Your story isn't news. With Shaw dead --
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: But the project's still going ahead! If
dialog: attacking homeless people in the park
dialog: isn't news, I'd like to know what is --
speaker_heading: PROVOST
text: There's a psycho out there in a mask and
dialog: cape -- killing off Gotham's most
dialog: prominent citizens! That's news.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: I've known Randall Shaw all my life. His
text: family is in mourning. And it just so
dialog: happens I don't believe in slandering the
dialog: dead.
text: VICKI FUMES. She turns and stares PROVOST straight in the
dialog: eye.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Mr. Provost -- how much money do you have
dialog: tied up in the Park Tower project?
speaker_heading: PROVOST
dialog: Vicki...I'm going to forget you made that
dialog: remark. For the sake of your job, I
dialog: suggest you do the same.
text: VICKI stalks of -- and PROVOST goes back to his mail. He
text: finds an envelope addressed in a shaky, psychotic scrawl, with
text: the word "CONFIDENTIAL" underlined three times in ink. He
dialog: tears it open --
text: -- and HIS FACE TURNS PALE as he stares down at the contents:
text: a small business-sized card, signed with a BAT-EMBLEM...
text: THOSE WHO FEED ON THE SOUL OF GOTHAM
scene_heading: WILL SUFFER MY WRATH
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY
text: WALTER BARRETT and his ATTORNEY emerge onto the front steps of
text: the courthouse. BARRETT is instantly mobbed by REPORTERS.
speaker_heading: REPORTER I
dialog: Mr. Barrett! Any comment on the
dialog: arraignment?
speaker_heading: REPORTER II
dialog: Is it true bail was set at two million
dialog: dollars?
speaker_heading: ATTORNEY
dialog: Stand back! My client has nothing to say
dialog: at this time!
text: The ATTORNEY clears a path for BARRETT, who climbs into a
text: waiting CAR, shielding his face. REPORTERS cluster around
dialog: it...
text: As the car pulls out into traffic, we see a flock of PIGEONS
text: taking wing from their perches on the statues outside the Hall
dialog: of Justice.
scene_heading: OVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR
text: PIGEONS fill the frame, swooping down toward the CAR, which is
text: idling at a traffic light far below.
scene_heading: INT. BARRETT'S CAR - THAT MOMENT
text: The liveried DRIVER drums his fingers as he waits for the
text: light to change. BARRETT's in the back, speaking into his
dialog: cellular phone.
speaker_heading: BARRETT
dialog: It's time we called an emergency meeting
dialog: of the Raven Society. Get back to me...
text: Looking troubled, he hangs up. A fat white glob of PIGEON
text: SHIT splatters across the windshield. Seconds later --
text: another SPLAT.
speaker_heading: BARRETT (cont.)
dialog: Damn pigeons.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Just washed it, too.
text: The DRIVER reaches for the wiper switch. They hear a tiny
text: DINK as a SOLID PELLET bounces off the windshield.
text: BARRETT and the DRIVER exchange a mystified look. A small,
text: blinking CAPSULE has just lodged in the wiper-blade
dialog: assembly...
scene_heading: OVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR
text: Just as the light changes, the CAR EXPLODES into a million
text: fragments -- leaving a BLACKENED CRATER in the middle of the
dialog: intersection.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - DAY
text: TIGHT ON A VIDEO MONITOR -- showing FIRE TRUCKS in the
text: intersection we've just left, hosing down the wreckage of
text: BARRETT's car. BRUCE is watching intently when ALFRED appears
text: behind him.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: The Fluegelheim called again, sir. They
dialog: want to know if you'll be attending the
text: opening of the new Egyptian exhibit.
text: BRUCE, still engrossed in his news broadcast, waves ALFRED
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Cancel.
speaker_heading: ANCHORWOMAN (on TV)
dialog: -- and, citing new evidence in the so-
dialog: called string of "millionaire murders,"
dialog: Police Commissioner J.T. Gordon today
dialog: swore out a warrant for the arrest of
dialog: Batman.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: We go now live to Mike Sekowsky,
dialog: spokesperson, Order of the Bat.
speaker_heading: SEKOWSKY
dialog: Jeez! Talk about gratitude -- !!
text: At the sight of SEKOWSKY's face, BRUCE kills the sound in
text: disgust. ALFRED looks on helplessly as he paces the floor of
dialog: the Batcave.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Well, Alfred, it's official. I'm a wanted
dialog: man.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: "New evidence"...I've gotta find that
dialog: woman. Did you check the personals?
text: As ALFRED shakes his head no, a BUZZER sounds. They've got a
text: visitor. BRUCE hits a switch on a monitor, and sees
text: COMMISSIONER GORDON'S CAR sitting outside the wrought-iron
text: gates of Wayne Manor.
text: He throws a nervous look at ALFRED. ALFRED speaks into a
dialog: microphone:
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Who's there?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Jim Gordon, Alfred. I've got to see
dialog: Bruce.
text: A spooky development. Does GORDON suspect? After a moment's
text: hesitation, BRUCE nods to ALFRED -- let him in.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Mr. Wayne will see you, sir.
scene_heading: INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER
text: A curious BRUCE ushers GORDON into the library, gestures
text: toward the liquor cabinet. The Commissioner nods his head no.
text: He's fidgety, ill at ease -- he obviously doesn't want to be
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Sorry to bother you. Bruce -- I'll get
dialog: right down to it. You knew Shaw and
dialog: Barrett --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I saw them occasionally. We all sat on
dialog: the board of the Fluegelheim...
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Did you have any...dealings with them,
dialog: or --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: No. I never liked the way they did
dialog: business.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: The thing is, Bruce, you're all lumped
dialog: together in the public mind -- the Five
dialog: Families of Gotham, that sort of thing --
dialog: and, uh...
dialog: <i>(taking a card from his pocket)</i>
dialog: Harrison Provost got this in the mail.
text: BRUCE examines the card, -- "THOSE WHO FEED," etc. He stares
text: at GORDON in mock-concern, playing it close to the vest...
speaker_heading: BRUCE
text: Then Batman is behind all this.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Batman or a damned good imitation.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Well. He's changed tactics, hasn't he.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: <i>(shrugging; at a loss)</i>
dialog: Shaw, with his high-rises -- Barrett, a
dialog: druglord, major polluter -- they weren't
dialog: exactly model citizens. Who knows, it
dialog: could be some crazy social-conscience kind
dialog: of thing.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: You mean he's going after...the root of
dialog: the problem.
text: GORDON shakes his head and gets up to go. BRUCE hands him the
dialog: card.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Let me know if you get one of these.
dialog: We'll put all our resources at your
dialog: disposal.
text: BRUCE nods thoughtfully as ALFRED appears to see the
text: Commissioner out. A moment later, the butler reappears.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Changed my mind, Alfred. I'll be dropping
dialog: in on the Fluegelheim after all.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FLUEGELHEIM MUSEUM - NIGHT
text: It's a party to celebrate the opening of the new Egyptian
text: exhibit, and the Fluegelheim is hopping. BOARD MEMBERS,
text: MUSEUM PATRONS, and SOCIALITES mill about in dinner jackets
text: and evening gowns, making small talk. AN OPEN SARCOPHAGUS has
text: been set up as a wet bar.
text: On a raised concrete platform in the center of the hall,
text: rimmed by a decorative moat, sits an ancient Egyptian SHRINE.
text: The TEMPLE OF BASTET has been moved to Gotham and
text: reconstructed in the Fluegelheim --sandstone walls, fountains,
dialog: statuary and all.
text: Guarding the entrance is a stately bronze statue of the
text: goddess BASTET -- who has the body of a woman and the head of
text: a pointy-eared CAT. She holds an aegis and a sistrum; four
text: tiny KITTENS romp at her feet. BRUCE, who's just arrived, is
text: taking an intense interest in the cat-goddess...
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I just had a weird sense of <i>deja vu</i>.
text: He glances over by the sarcophagus and sees PROVOST, the
text: publisher, huddle with ELIOT TIPTREE III, transit magnate --
text: the remaining member of Gotham's "Five Families." The two of
text: them are engaged in some urgent conversation which he can't
dialog: quite make out...
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: Harrison -- we really ought to warn Bruce.
dialog: We owe him that much.
text: BRUCE detaches himself from VICKI and strolls toward them.
text: PROVOST and TIPTREE force smiles and wave, affecting an air of
text: nonchalance.
speaker_heading: PROVOST (cont.)
dialog: The man's a space cadet. Let him look out
dialog: for himself.
dialog: <i>(as BRUCE arrives; cheerfully)</i>
dialog: Why, Bruce! What a delightful surprise.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Good to see you two. Looks like the Five
text: Families are suddenly down to three.
dialog: <i>(looking around)</i>
dialog: In fact, if somebody dropped a bomb on
dialog: this room right now --
text: TIPTREE chuckles nervously. PROVOST is even less amused.
speaker_heading: PROVOST
dialog: Is that your idea of a joke, Bruce?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
text: Not at all. Commissioner Gordon seems to
dialog: think we should all be hiring bodyguards.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE PROVOST
dialog: Oh, that's absurd. I already have.
text: The two of them glower at each other. It's like an outtake
text: from <i>The Newlywed Game</i>. BRUCE shrugs it off and makes a
dialog: vacuous face:
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Thing is, I can't imagine why Batman would
dialog: be after us. Can you?
text: PROVOST and TIPTREE are about to go into another round of
text: hemming-and-hawing when a NEW FACE joins the party. It's
text: SELINA KYLE -- stunning as ever in an extravagantly revealing
text: dress slit up to the armpits. She's holding two glasses of
text: CHAMPAGNE...
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: You two look like you need a drink. --
dialog: And is this who I think it is?
text: She flashes BRUCE her most winning, seductive, heavy-artillery
text: SMILE. He BLINKS, temporarily speechless.
speaker_heading: PROVOST
dialog: Selina Kyle -- Bruce Wayne.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Our absentee board member! I've been
dialog: wanting to meet you forever.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
text: Selina's the new Curator of Antiquities.
dialog: She brought the Temple over block by
dialog: block --
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: You two won't be terribly upset if I
dialog: borrow Bruce for a moment, will you?
text: Before he can protest, she's linked an arm around his and
text: dragged him off. A nearby FAT MAN spots SELINA, wiggles his
text: eyebrows and WAVES BRIGHTLY. His tongue is practically
text: hanging out -- he's just dying to write her a check. SELINA
scene_heading: SIGHS WEARILY to BRUCE:
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
dialog: Major contributor. -- I always seem to
dialog: wind up in charge of fund-raising...
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I can't imagine why.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Tax year's almost over, you know. I hope
dialog: we can count on your usual generous
dialog: donation.
scene_heading: <i>(indicating PROVOST and TIPTREE)</i>
dialog: Someone's got to set an example for those
text: two tightwads.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: They're proccupied. This string of
dialog: murders --
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I asked them if they'd consider including
dialog: us in their wills.
dialog: <i>(chuckling to herself)</i>
dialog: They didn't seem a bit amused...
scene_heading: ANGLE ON VICKI - THAT MOMENT
text: She's making small talk with a bunch of STUFFED SHIRTS and
text: their overdressed WIVES. She glances across the room at the
text: statue of Bastet, sees SELINA draped all over BRUCE. A frown
text: crosses her face...
scene_heading: ANGLE ON BRUCE AND SELINA - THAT MOMENT
text: She's still clinging to his arm as they stare up at the
dialog: statue.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: -- and this is my good friend Bastet, the
dialog: Egyptian Cat Goddess.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I think we've already met. -- This is
dialog: quite an expedition you've put together.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I'm glad you think so. I have to say,
dialog: Bruce -- you're not at all what I
dialog: expected.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Sorry to disappoint you.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Oh, it's not that. Not at all. It's just
dialog: that I'd always heard you were...
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: <i>(coyly)</i>
dialog: Oh...sort of a...
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: <i>(smiling; fascinated)</i>
dialog: No. Come on. What?
text: BRUCE's state of mounting infatuation is abruptly shattered
text: when VICKI sidles up alongside him and -- territorially --
text: takes his other arm. The women exchange big, toothy, plastic
text: smiles; stranded in the middle, BRUCE realizes they're waiting
dialog: for him to introduce them.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Oh. Selina Kyle -- my friend Vicki Vale.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: The photographer. I've seen your pictures
dialog: in the Gazette.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: The Globe.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Oh, that's right. The tabloid one. --
dialog: What an original dress!
text: VICKI, still smiling, cocks an eyebrow at BRUCE. He senses
text: trouble coming and tries to head it off at the pass.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Selina supervised the reconstruction of
dialog: the temple. Brought it back from Egypt...
text: stone by stone.
speaker_heading: VICKI
text: Really. She must be awfully tired.
scene_heading: <i>(to SELINA)</i>
dialog: How'd you get to be in charge of a huge
dialog: project like this?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: It was easy. I slept with the Pharoah.
text: She laughs at her own joke. VICKI responds with a dry little
text: chuckle of her own. SELINA gives BRUCE a SHARP YANK on the
dialog: sleeve.
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
dialog: Excuse us, won't you, sweetheart? We have
dialog: some boring museum business to talk about.
text: VICKI fumes. BRUCE shrugs apologetically as SELINA drags him
text: off out of earshot.
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
dialog: I. Short leash.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Pull in the claws, okay? She's really
dialog: terrific.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I'm sorry, Bruce. Sometimes I get a
dialog: little...aggressive, you know?
dialog: <i>(handing him a card)</i>
dialog: Look, I need to talk to you. Come by
dialog: sometime. I'll give you the private tour.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Wait. Let me explain about Vicki --
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: <i>(shushing him)</i>
dialog: I understand. Anyone who's that
dialog: protective must have a pretty good reason
dialog: for it.
text: She shoots him one last smile -- sly, conspiratorial,
text: unmistakably juicy. Then she's off in pursuit of another
text: major funder. BRUCE is thoughtfully turning the card over in
text: his hands when VICKI rejoins him.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: How's "business"?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Relax, okay? I like you better.
text: He scans the room, trying to find PROVOST and TIPTREE. No
dialog: luck.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: If you're looking for your fellow
dialog: millionaires, they left some time back.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT
text: The roof of the Gotham Globe. A STARLING circles overhead for
text: a moment -- then DIVES down an exposed VENTILATION SHAFT.
scene_heading: INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT
text: TWO ARMED BODYGUARDS are standing watch outside an office.
text: Brass letters on the door read "J. HARRISON PROVOST,
scene_heading: PUBLISHER."
scene_heading: INT. PROVOST'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT
text: PROVOST, agitated, working late. He speaks, <i>sotto voce</i>, into
dialog: the phone:
speaker_heading: PROVOST
dialog: Don't worry about that. I've had the
dialog: office swept for bugs. No one's
dialog: listening...
scene_heading: INT. TIPTREE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: TIPTREE in his paneled study at home. There's an open bottle
text: on the table and he's been hitting the sauce -- hard. His
speaker_heading: VOICE QUAVERS:
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: It's just so -- unfair. I mean...it was
dialog: over a century ago. It's not like we're
dialog: responsible.
dialog: <i>(hollow-eyed)</i>
dialog: How could he know? How could Batman know
dialog: about the Raven Society??
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - ON PROVOST - THAT MOMENT
speaker_heading: PROVOST
dialog: Who knows and who cares. The point is,
dialog: it's happened...
text: He hears a CHIRP and looks up. It seems to be coming from a
text: HEATING VENT on the wall. But then it stops, so he resumes
dialog: his conversation --
speaker_heading: PROVOST (cont.)
dialog: I'm clearing out of the country, and I'm
dialog: taking the raven with me. I suggest you
dialog: do the same.
scene_heading: INT. HEATING VENT - THAT MOMENT
text: In the metal shaft on the other side of the grate is a tiny
text: BIRD -- the same one we saw flying down the air shaft. Now
text: that we've got a close-up view, we can see the thin BATTERY
text: PACK wired to its underbelly...and the MINIATURE MICROPHONE
text: taped to its leg.
speaker_heading: PROVOST (O.S.)
dialog: I'll tell you how to reach me. And don't
dialog: repeat this to anyone.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - DAY
text: The PENGUIN stands over his indoor penguin pool. He's wearing
text: rubber gloves, feeding LIVE FISH from an ice chest to his
text: arctic birds. The vents in the windows are open, and the
text: climate in the room is downright icy as SELINA's wrapped in
text: fur, stroking her pet cat:
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: He's just another rich idiot.
dialog: <i>(chuckling to herself)</i>
dialog: The odd thing is, he didn't seem a bit
dialog: concerned.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Then he is an idiot.
speaker_heading: SELINA
text: He lives in some big sprawling manor.
dialog: I'll have to get inside, scope it out...
dialog: see where he's got the raven stashed.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: How do you plan to do that?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: How do you think!
text: A feline smile from SELINA. The PENGUIN chuckles to himself,
text: lobs a FISH out over the pool. A swooping GULL snatches it
text: out of the air before it hits the water. FRICK arrives in the
dialog: doorway.
speaker_heading: FRICK
dialog: It's Mr. Provost, sir. He's planning to
text: embark on an unscheduled Christmas
dialog: vacation.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Good! That should save us a trip to the
dialog: bank.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FLUEGELHEIM - BACK ROOM - DAY
text: A huge open room cluttered with all kinds of junk:
text: archaeologist's tools, restoration equipment, etc., plus a
text: healthy assortment of curios and oddities from all over. This
text: is SELINA's private domain. CAMERA TRACKS past a glass case
text: full of ugly, withered, turdlike specimens...
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What have we got here?
speaker_heading: SELINA
text: Mummified cats. Bastet's sacred animal.
dialog: They were buried by the thousands at
dialog: Bubastis. -- Oh, careful!
text: BRUCE FREEZES with his hand poised over a set of four earthen
text: JARS. Each has a lid carved in the shape of a HEAD: ape,
dialog: jackal, man, falcon.
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
text: Canopic jars. In the process of
dialog: mummification, the internal organs were
text: buried separately.
dialog: <i>(pointing to each jar in turn)</i>
dialog: Lungs -- stomach -- liver -- intestine --
text: BRUCE withdraws his hand with a bemused shudder.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: You're in a gruesome line of work.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Keeps me interested. And that's not easy
dialog: to do...
text: BRUCE's attention turns to a crumbling statuette of an odd
text: beast: a WINGED LION with the head of a FALCON.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: This one I know. It's a gryphon, right?
speaker_heading: SELINA
text: Very good. A mythical demon, half-bird,
text: half-lion...sweeping down from the sky to
dialog: deliver retribution and justice.
text: BRUCE nods. He can dig it. He regards the gryphon for a long
text: moment and CHUCKLES.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Poor guy. Birds and cats -- you wouldn't
dialog: think the two halves would cooperate.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Only under certain circumstances.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: I'm really glad you came, Bruce. I was
dialog: afraid I'd given you the wrong impression.
dialog: Or maybe it was the right impression.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What was it you wanted to talk to me
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Your collection. I'd love to see it. I
dialog: mean, everyone says you've got a
dialog: fabulous --
text: She breaks off in midstream and chuckles to herself. She toys
text: demurely with her equipment. She looks up at BRUCE and
text: switches tactics -- going for the direct approach. BRUCE
dialog: braces himself...
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
dialog: Mainly I just wanted an excuse to see you
dialog: again. Does she know you're here --
dialog: Vicki?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: <i>(shrugging)</i>
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: It must be strange. Having all that
dialog: power, and money -- never really knowing
dialog: if that's what people are attracted to.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What are you attracted to?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I think you're a little bit nuts.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: I think you're a little -- bored with your
dialog: life. Having everything you want. No
dialog: variety, no...danger. And every once in a
dialog: while you need to take a risk. Shake it
dialog: all up.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Maybe by...coming here today.
text: She leans back against a crate, moistens her lips. She's
text: letting him have it with both barrels.
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
dialog: That's one thing I can give you, Bruce --
dialog: danger -- a little something you can't get
text: at home.
text: BRUCE hesitates -- but the lure is irresistible. He moves
text: forward slowly; SELINA's eyes close; their lips draw slowly
dialog: closer...
text: ...and he SNEEZES IN HER FACE. She backs off in shock as he
text: covers his face. His eyes are watering and he's WHEEZING.
text: She rushes over --
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Is there a cat in here?
text: Right on cue, SELINA's black cat HECATE lets out a loud MEOW
text: -- and STRETCHES against BRUCE's pants leg. He brushes the
text: animal aside and it LEAPS into SELINA's arms. BRUCE sniffles
text: uncontrollably.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (cont.)
dialog: Get it away!
text: She drops the cat, which scampers off. BRUCE rubs his eyes.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Poor thing. You're allergic!
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Yeah, cats...ever since I was a kid...
dialog: <i>(snorting and weeping)</i>
dialog: Look, I'd better get some fresh air.
dialog: Maybe another time, okay...
text: He heads for the door before SELINA can stop him. He's gone,
text: but she knows she's left a dent in his armor. She smiles in
text: bemusement as HECATE jumps into her arms and PURRS.
scene_heading: EXT. FLUEGELHEIM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
text: BRUCE stumbles out the museum feeling mildly discombobulated.
text: He marches down the front steps past a NEWSSTAND -- where he
text: stops to buy a copy of the afternoon GLOBE.
text: He opens it to the PERSONAL ADS and finds what he's been
dialog: waiting for:
text: TALL, DARK, AND HANDSOME -- Christmas is coming.
dialog: Why don't we trim the tree together?
text: This puzzles him for a moment -- until he looks up the street.
text: In the distance, at the very center of Gotham Square, WORKMEN
text: are stringing lights around an enormous CHRISTMAS TREE, almost
text: fifty feet tall.
text: The LIGHTING CEREMONY is an annual event in Gotham. BRUCE
text: smiles slightly, tucks the paper under one arm and walks to
dialog: his car.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT
text: SNOW falls on a huge CROWD gathered around the big tree. The
text: tree won't be lit for another twenty minutes or so, and so the
text: ONLOOKERS are singing CHRISTMAS CAROLS from printed lyric
dialog: sheets.
text: A BAND is playing on a makeshift ORCHESTRA PLATFORM erected in
text: front of the tree, leading the crowd in a spirited rendition
text: of "God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen." The Square is rocking with
dialog: good will toward men. When they get to the part about saving
dialog: us all from Satan's power --
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: -- the CAMERA TILTS UPWARD to BATMAN, watching the action from
text: his usual gargoyle's perch. He's scanning the streets and the
text: rooftops, waiting tor the CATWOMAN to make her move --
dialog: whatever it is.
text: He glances at the building directly across the square from
text: him. On the roof is a neon sign reading Gotham City Globe in
text: ornate old-English letters -- and above that, a ROTATING METAL
text: SCULPTURE of the world turning. His eyes rove downward along
text: the facade of the building...
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT
text: At street level, an ARMORED CAR has pulled up in front of the
text: Globe offices. THREE SECURITY GUARDS with rifles climb out of
text: the ARMORED CAR, followed by a FOURTH -- who has an OBLONG BOX
text: handcuffed to his wrist. Of course, we can't see what's
dialog: inside, but to those of us in the know the box looks just
text: about the right size for a RAVEN STATUETTE.
text: The GUARDS scan the street and enter the building without
text: incident. As they do, a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN crosses the
text: frame; mounted on its side is an ADVERTISING PLACARD which
dialog: reads:
scene_heading: BATMAN: HERO OR MENACE?
dialog: Read All About It in the GOTHAM GLOBE!
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN
text: He watches with some curiosity. An armored car: is this some
text: part of the CATWOMAN's scheme? But no...the GUARDS are safely
text: inside the building, and the CAR is leaving. He settles back
dialog: to wait.
scene_heading: INT. NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN - THAT MOMENT
text: The innocuous-looking VAN rounds the corner of the Globe
text: building. FRICK is at the wheel, FRACK is riding shotgun, and
text: the PENGUIN is between them, peering out eagerly through the
dialog: windshield.
text: They turn into the Globe's BASEMENT GARAGE -- where dozens of
text: similar vans are parked at the LOADING BAYS. Just part of the
dialog: fleet...
scene_heading: INT. PROVOST'S OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER
text: The quartet of SECURITY GUARDS arrive at PROVOST's office.
text: The publisher has already packed his suitcases for a speedy
text: getaway. The LEAD GUARD -- the one cuffed to the RAVEN BOX --
text: sets his precious cargo on a desk and stands discreetly at
text: arm's length while PROVOST unlocks it and checks its contents.
text: Satisfied, he slams it shut. He reaches into his top drawer
text: for an ENVELOPE, which he hands to his PERSONAL SECRETARY.
speaker_heading: PROVOST
dialog: Open this in an hour. Phone my wife and
dialog: tell her where to meet me.
dialog: <i>(to the GUARDS; edgily)</i>
dialog: No trouble on the way, I take it?
speaker_heading: LEAD GUARD
dialog: No sir, Mr. Provost. We came straight
text: from the bank vault.
speaker_heading: GUARD II
dialog: 'Copter should be just touching down.
dialog: We'll have you safely out of here in no
dialog: time.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN
text: "Here Comes Santa Claus" echoes up from the streets. BATMAN
text: watches as a COPTER descends toward the HELIPAD on the roof of
dialog: the Globe...
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER
text: PROVOST and the LEAD GUARD with the raven box are at an
text: elevator bank. The other GUARDS head for a stairwell.
speaker_heading: GUARD II
dialog: We'll check the stairs. See you on the
dialog: roof.
text: The LEAD GUARD starts to press the UP button, but PROVOST
text: pulls a key from his pocket instead:
speaker_heading: PROVOST
dialog: No -- my private elevator. It's safer.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT
text: shooting DOWN on the car as it rises. The shaft above it is
text: filled with BIRDS -- starlings, crows, pigeons and the like,
text: swooping and gliding among the gears and cables...
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF OF GLOBE BUILDING - THAT MOMENT
text: In BG, the helicopter on its pad, idling noisily, the rotors
text: still spinning. In FG, the small dormer-like structure that
text: houses the STAIRWAY. The metal access door opens, and the
text: first of the GUARDS steps warily out, rifle at the ready. He
text: smiles back at his pal.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: No way. They don't pay us enough to
dialog: tangle with Batm--
text: A black-gloved, CHROME-TALONED HAND snakes around the edge of
text: the dormer and RAKES ACROSS HIS THROAT...
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT
text: SWEAT beads up on PROVOST's lip as the GUARD hits the up
text: button and the car begins to rise. Suddenly, the LIGHTS GO
text: OUT. The car stops with a lurch.
speaker_heading: PROVOST
dialog: What is it?? What's happening??
text: Suddenly, there in the darkness, they hear a series of loud
text: POPPING SOUNDS...which could be gunfire...
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - ON CROWD
text: singing "Here Comes Santa Claus" at the top of their lungs.
text: Happy faces beam. No one hears anything unusual over the
dialog: music...
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - ACROSS STREET - ON BATMAN
text: BATMAN straining to listen. We get another faint series of
text: POPS -- barely audible over the CAROLING from below, and the
text: loud PUTT-PUTT-PUTT of the helicopter blades.
text: He can't really be sure he's heard anything at all. He scans
text: the roof of the Globe building, but he can't see what's
text: happening beyond the big steel globe sculpture and the neon
dialog: sign...
scene_heading: EXT. GLOBE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT
text: The CATWOMAN lets fly with another burst of automatic fire
text: from the dead GUARD's rifle. The helicopter is still idling,
text: but no one's left to fly it -- the rooftop is littered with
dialog: stiffs...
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT
text: PITCH BLACK. Pre-verbal GROANS and MURMURINGS OF FEAR issue
text: from the darkness. An EERIE RED LIGHT kicks on -- the
text: emergency generators -- and we see PROVOST backed up in a
text: corner of the car, twitching and jumping like a crazed
text: spastic. The GUARD, in a futile effort to placate him, points
text: up at the LIGHT:
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: There. Mr. Provost. See? The
dialog: generator's kicked in. It's just an
dialog: electrical problem.
text: PROVOST is only marginally consoled. They hear a strange
text: TWITTERING NOISE in the shaft above them...
text: PROVOST starts babbling again. The GUARD slaps him across the
text: face. But the TWITTERING has him a bit concerned as well. He
text: stares up at the ceiling of the car as he PUNCHES BUTTONS on
text: the panel; with another LURCH, the car begins to move.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: There. See? It's moving. We're fine.
speaker_heading: PROVOST
dialog: It's going down. We're going DOWN!!!
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT
text: The BIRDS in the shaft have all ROOSTED on the TOP OF THE CAR.
text: They're patiently riding it down as it descends...
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT
text: The car stops again. PROVOST is totally losing it. The
text: exasperated GUARD grabs him and SHAKES HIM.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Okay, Mr. Provost -- I'm gonna have a look
dialog: through the trap door. But I need you to
dialog: help me. Okay? You have to help.
text: PROVOST nods and tries to get a grip on himself. The GUARD
text: looks up at the trap door in the ceiling of the car. He can't
dialog: reach it...
text: He uncuffs the BOX containing PROVOST'S RAVEN from his wrist
text: -- and STANDS on it. Still short. Unholstering his gun and
text: using it as a prod, he can almost reach the trap door. He
text: JUMPS UP and, poking with the gun, manages to dislodge the
text: panel slightly.
text: More TWITTERING. PROVOST and the guard look up through the
text: tiny crack in the ceiling and see nothing but darkness.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Probably just some bird that's gotten in
dialog: the shaft. Now calm down. You'll have to
dialog: give me a boost.
text: The GUARD climbs back atop the raven box. PROVOST gives him a
text: boost and he manages to catch hold of the lip of the trap
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: GUARD (cont.)
dialog: Okay, help me out...steady...
text: PROVOST wraps both arms around the GUARD's wriggling LEGS and
text: tries to hoist him upward.
scene_heading: INT. SHAFT - ON ROOF OF CAR - THAT MOMENT
text: From a vantage level with the roof of the car, we see the
text: GUARD'S FINGERS, clinging to the lip of the trap door. Now
text: his HEAD rises into view, pushing the panel aside as he pulls
text: himself upward.
text: He peers around. His BROW wrinkles as he sees a bizarre sight
text: -- PASSELS of SQUAWKING BIRDS, walking back and forth in front
text: of him, STRUTTING and PREENING mere inches from his face...
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT
text: The bottom half of the GUARD dangles from the ceiling.
text: PROVOST still has his arms wrapped around the GUARD's knees.
text: All at once, the GUARD begins to SCREAM -- his body JERKS and
text: his legs KICK WILDLY. Still PROVOST struggles to hang on --
text: even as BLOOD spatters across the top of his bald dome...
text: Finally, the GUARD's violent spasms are too much. PROVOST
text: trips over the raven box, stumbles backward and lands on his
text: ass in a corner of the car. The GUARD tumbles in a heap to
text: the elevator floor, his face PECKED and CLAWED beyond
text: recognition, his eyes gone altogether.
text: PROVOST lets out a series of SHRIEKS. He peers at the open
text: trap door, sees the BIRDS staring curiously down at him, and
text: SHRIEKS AGAIN.
text: The EMERGENCY TELEPHONE rings. He stares at it. It rings
text: again. Shielding his eyes and screwing up his courage,
text: PROVOST crawls across the floor and reaches for the receiver.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN (V.O.; filter)
text: Sixteenth floor. Linens, housewares,
dialog: ladies' lingerie!
speaker_heading: PROVOST
dialog: W-who is this??
scene_heading: INT. GLOBE - BASEMENT LOADING BAY - THAT MOMENT
text: NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VANS are parked in neat rows -- all
text: driverless. FRICK is sitting with a boxful of electrical
text: equipment next to a bank of ELEVATORS; all the cars have been
text: LOCKED OPEN here in the basement, except for ONE -- PROVOST's
text: private elevator, the doors to which are still closed. The
text: PENGUIN stands beside it, speaking into a RED PHONE.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Mr. Provost? If you want to get out of
dialog: that car alive, I suggest you follow my
dialog: instructions to the letter.
text: As he talks, we see various NEWSPAPER EMPLOYEES sprawled on
text: the concrete nearby, DEAD. A CORRUGATED METAL DOOR has been
text: lowered over the LOADING BAY, separating the newspaper
text: production staff from the VAN POOL. They're trapped on the
text: other side. BANGING AWAY LOUDLY on the door...
speaker_heading: PENGUIN (cont.)
text: SHUT UP IN THERE.
dialog: <i>(calmly; into phone)</i>
dialog: You should see a cord hanging just behind
dialog: you.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT
text: PROVOST looks over his shoulder and sees the aforementioned
text: CORD descending through the trap door.
speaker_heading: PROVOST
dialog: Yes -- yes, I see it --
speaker_heading: PENGUIN (V.O; filter)
dialog: Tie the cord to the handle of your box.
text: PROVOST lets the phone drop. He grits his teeth, but hastens
text: to obey. As he's knotting the cord around the handle of the
text: box, a DINKY BIRD flutters down through the trap and sends him
text: into a panic. Practically weeping, he reaches for the phone.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN (V.O.; filter)
dialog: When you're done, I want you to give two
text: sharp yanks on the cord.
text: Cowering in terror, PROVOST reaches for the cord and yanks it
dialog: twice.
speaker_heading: PROVOST
dialog: Who are you?? Why are you doing this??
scene_heading: INT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN
text: Behind him, FRICK and FRACK are pulling on RED BERETS and
scene_heading: BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS -- Order of the Bat gear. FRICK climbs
text: into a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN and starts the engine.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Well, Mr. Provost, I guess you could call
dialog: me an irate reader. And to be perfectly
dialog: frank -- I'm doing this because I hate
dialog: Garfield.
text: Chuckling, the PENGUIN holds a SONIC DEVICE up to the
text: mouthpiece of the phone.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT
text: A SHRILL WHINE emanates from the receiver. All at once, the
text: elevator car is FULL OF BIRDS -- squawking wildly, flinging
text: themselves against the wall, going insane in the tiny confined
dialog: space.
text: PROVOST is screaming like a madman. The birds are in his
text: hair, his face -- everywhere. He fights his way over to the
text: panel and begins punching buttons in a frenzy...
text: All at once the car PLUNGES DOWNWARD. It's as if the floor
text: has DROPS AWAY beneath PROVOST's feet -- he's in FREE-FALL.
scene_heading: INT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Going down!
text: He hangs up the phone and steps a discreet distance back from
text: the ELEVATOR DOORS.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT
text: The RAVEN BOX dangles from its cord in FG as the CAR rockets
text: uncontrollably downward. A steady stream ot BIRDS are making
text: a quick exit from the trap door in the roof...
scene_heading: INT. TOP-FLOOR LANDING - THAT MOMENT
text: The CATWOMAN's on a landing near the stairwell, just below the
text: dormer that leads to the roof. She pries open a pair of
scene_heading: ELEVATOR DOORS...
text: ...and a FLOCK of BIRDS pours out of the empty shaft, making
text: for the open ACCESS DOOR a half-story above. She reaches
text: inside, finds the cord attached to the RAVEN BOX, and reels it
dialog: in.
text: She rips off the lock and opens the box for a quick look at
text: her trophy. It's there, all right -- another RAVEN just like
text: the first two. An awful CRASH, from twenty-five stories down,
text: RATTLES THE SHAFT...
text: She makes a disgusted face, grabs the RAVEN, and bolts for the
dialog: roof.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP ACROSS STREET - ON BATMAN
text: He watches in puzzlement as a VAST FLOCK OF BIRDS takes flight
text: from the Globe roof across the square. Something weird is
text: definitely going on. He's about to abandon his post --
text: -- but down below, the CAROLERS have stopped CAROLING. The
text: big tree's about to be lit, and they're counting off the
dialog: seconds:
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: Ten! Nine!...
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - CORNER NEWSTAND
text: A ramshackle kiosk at street level. The NEWS VENDOR has
text: stepped out onto the sidewalk to watch the tree festivities.
text: A GLOBE DELIVERY VAN, its side bearing the "BATMAN -- HERO OR
text: MENACE?" advertisement, cruises past and dumps a bundle of
text: papers on the curb.
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON CROWD AT TREE
text: EXCITEMENT is BUILDING as the seconds tick off:
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: ...Three! Two! One!
text: The CHRISTMAS LIGHTS come on, and the CROWD breaks into
text: CHEERS. The ORCHESTRA strikes up a sprightly version of
text: "JINGLE BELLS."
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON NEWSTAND
text: The NEWS VENDOR is applauding and singing along like everyone
text: else when a second newspaper van rumbles past...
speaker_heading: NEWS VENDOR

text: He spots TWO MASKED MEN in the doorway of the van -- wearing
text: RED BERETS and BAT-SHIRTS. They shove a BODY out the door --
text: The mutilated corpse of HARRISON PROVOST lands on the sidewalk
text: with a THUD -- right beside a bundle of NEWSPAPERS which read
scene_heading: "BATMAN MURDER SPREE BAFFLES POLICE."
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON VAN - MOVING
text: The NEWS VENDOR chases after the VAN, but it's already rounded
text: a corner and is cruising along the periphery of Gotham Square.
text: The CROWD is still singing merrily, unaware of its presence --
text: -- until the BACK DOORS fly open -- and a swarm of RABID,
text: CHITTERING BATS screech out into the midst of the crowd!!
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON CROWD AT TREE
text: The CAROLERS break into MASS HYSTERIA as HIDEOUS BATS swoop
text: down from above, CLAWING at their heads and shoulders.
text: ORCHESTRA MEMBERS drop their instruments and stagger off the
text: BAND PLATFORM, falling into the branches of the giant
dialog: Christmas tree.
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON SIDEWALKS
text: CHRISTMAS SHOPPERS are teeming in and out of nearby STORES.
text: They drop their SHOPPING BAGS and race about in utter CHAOS as
scene_heading: the bats attack. WOMEN SCREAM. CHILDREN SCREAM. MEN SCREAM
speaker_heading: TOO.
text: A MAN staggers backward through a GLASS STOREFRONT and lands
text: on his butt in a WINDOW DISPLAY -- a big mechanical SANTA
text: CLAUS on his North-Pole throne, chuckling merrily in a
text: prerecorded voice: "HO HO HO." The MAN STRUGGLES WILDLY as
text: the BATS converge on him.
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - THAT MOMENT
text: HORRIFIED SHOPPERS scatter through the aisles as the BATS pour
text: in through the broken window. WOMEN lined up for a FREE
text: MAKEOVER squeal in panic as BATS arrive to rearrange their
dialog: hairdos.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN
text: He stares down stunned at the PANDEMONIUM raging below. He
text: glances across the street...and sees the TINY SILHOUETTE of a
text: WOMAN standing atop the cast-iron GLOBE SCULPTURE, LAUGHING at
text: the chaos, TAUNTING him.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS - OVERHEAD ANGLE - THAT MOMENT
text: A few blocks away from Gotham Square. SIRENS HOWL. There's a
text: steady stream of COP CARS speeding toward the site of the
text: disturbance. One vehicle is moving in the opposite direction,
text: against traffic -- a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN.
scene_heading: EXT. GLOBE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - A MOMENT LATER
text: BATMAN touches down on the roof and stares in horror at the
text: CORPSES strewn across the helipad. A dying GUARD raises a
dialog: shaky hand...
text: BATMAN crouches beside him. A GURGLE comes up from his throat
text: and a bubble of BLOOD swells on his lips. All at once he
text: hears a WOMAN'S VOICE from the shadows of the GLOBE
text: SCULPTURE...
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Some people just can't take discipline.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: Go ahead. Finish 'em off...
text: His head jerks up. He can't see anything. A sudden WHOOSHING
text: noise, and now the voice is coming from the other side of the
dialog: roof.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN (O.S.)
dialog: You might as well. You're going to get
dialog: blamed for it anyway.
text: He stands. He gets a quick glimpse of a FELINE SHADOW
text: springing past a skylight; she's jumping all around the roof,
text: clinging to exposed pipes and fixtures. He reaches for a
dialog: Batarang.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Oh, come on, angel. You know you want to.
dialog: <i>(purring loudly)</i>
dialog: Besides -- I want to see how you do it!
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Who are you?
text: He's barely gotten it out when she SLAMS INTO HIM from behind,
text: feet first, knocking him to the rooftop. He tries to get up,
text: but she comes at him with a couple of CARTWHEELING KICKS,
text: knocking him back into a cornice. He ducks right just as a
text: SHARP SPIKED HEEL strikes the exposed brick a mere three
text: inches from his throat.
text: He catches her leg, upends her -- but she somersaults away and
dialog: lands on her feet. Cats always do...
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: My, aren't we frisky tonight.
text: He flings the BATARANG. It CLANGS into the big NEON SIGN as
text: she SPRINGS up into the darkness, out of reach. GLASS TUBING
text: shatters and SPARKS FLY as she calls down from the shadows --
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: I should tell you -- I've got nine lives
dialog: to play with -- and you've only got one...
text: He turns -- she drops DIRECTLY ONTO HIM -- and locked in a
text: death grip, they STAGGER BACKWARDS across the roof, directly
text: toward the HELICOPTER. The huge ROTOR BLADES are still
dialog: turning...
text: BATMAN ducks instinctively and the CATWOMAN breaks free --
text: FALLING BACKWARD onto the roof. It's a strategic move: when
text: he rushes at her, she BRACES HERSELF against the ground and
text: KICKS UPWARD with startling force.
text: This time the spiked heel connects -- LIFTING BATMAN off his
text: feet, KNOCKING HIM BACKWARD into the TAIL of the HELICOPTER.
text: He slumps there, stunned -- and before he knows it, she's on
dialog: him.
text: She grabs his THROAT with one hand and clamps the other around
text: his CROTCH. He tries to break her grip, but she's just as
text: strong as he is. And she's LIFTING him -- forcing him upward,
text: toward the REAR STABILIZING ROTOR on the tail of the
dialog: helicopter!
text: The rear ROTOR BLADES WHINE LIKE A BUZZSAW as his head rises
text: perilously closer. At the last possible instant, he grabs a
text: handful of her HAIR -- YANKS IT as hard as he can --
text: With a YOWL, she releases him. They tumble to the roof and
text: she DIVES ATOP HIM. Her TALONS click into place -- he sees
text: them poised directly above his EYES --
text: -- but manages to slam an ELBOW under her chin before she can
text: strike. Now they're disentangled; they get up groggily and
dialog: circle each other...
text: SOMEONE IS BANGING on the metal door that leads up to the
text: roof, trying to break it down. BATMAN turns for an instant --
dialog: a sudden CRACK --
text: -- and he finds himself all wrapped up in the CATWOMAN's CAT-
text: O'-NINE-TAILS...which is also outfitted with a TASER. She
text: sends a PARALYZING ELECTRIC CHARGE through his body and he
text: collapses to the roof in a jittering heap. The BANGING on the
text: door is louder...
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Did I tell you I invited company? -- Keep
dialog: 'em busy, angel, I've gotta scat.
text: She kneels down and plants a BIG WET KISS on his twitching
text: face. Then she scurries to the edge of the roof,
scene_heading: DISAPPEARING --
text: -- just as the DOOR gives way -- and an ARMED SWAT TEAM comes
text: crashing out onto the roof!
text: Just coming around, BATMAN tries to roll out of sight -- but
text: the COPS are swarming the place. They spot the BODIES on the
text: tar and gravel, see BATMAN scuttling for cover, and draw the
text: obvious conclusion. Pulling guns, they OPEN FIRE. BULLETS
text: RICOCHET off the big metal GLOBE.
text: BATMAN, as is customary in these situations, shoots a
text: GRAPPLING HOOK at the roof of the next building over -- which
text: is a couple of stories taller than the Globe -- and REELS
text: HIMSELF UPWARD along the side wall. The SWAT COPS score a
text: couple of dead hits which set him swinging like a pendulum,
text: but his body armor holds and he clings to the line long enough
text: to reach the roof.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. NEWSPAPER VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: FRlCK and FRACK, still in their Order-of-the-Bat garb, are in
text: the front seats; the PENGUIN is leaning out the side door.
dialog: Someone's obviously tipped the COPS about the source of all
dialog: the ruckus --
text: -- because a pair of POLICE CARS are on their tail and gaining
text: fast. Still hanging in the doorway, the PENGUIN raises his
text: UMBRELLA, peers down its length like a RIFLE SIGHT, and PULLS
speaker_heading: A TRIGGER.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT
text: A SONIC DART -- one of the PENGUIN'S BIRD MAGNETS -- lodges
text: itself in the GRILLE of the foremost POLICE CAR.
scene_heading: INT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT
text: The COPS in the car react in astonishment as PIGEONS begin
text: HURLING THEMSELVES at the WINDSHIELDS. A DOZEN KAMIKAZE BIRDS
text: bounce off in rapid succession. CRACKS begin to spread across
dialog: the glass.
text: The COPS can't see where they're driving. The car SWERVES
text: WILDLY. And still the PIGEONS KEEP COMING -- COVERING THE
text: WINDSHIELD -- TOTALLY OBSCURING THE STREETS FROM VIEW...
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT
text: The first car, COMPLETELY COVERED WITH BIRDS, smacks into a
text: LAMPPOST and SKIDS. The second car CRASHES INTO IT. And the
text: pigeons continue to pour down from the heavens, SWARMING onto
text: the immobilized squad cars.
scene_heading: INT. NEWSPAPER VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT
text: The PENGUIN grins with delight as the van speeds off
text: unmolested.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Look at that, boys -- they do flock
dialog: together!!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: AMBULANCES are pouring into the square as the BAT ATTACK
text: continues. COPS are firing their guns blindly into the skies
text: as they try to evacuate the citizenry. PARAMEDICS drop the
text: stretcher they're carrying when BATS swoop down at their
dialog: heads...
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT
text: BATMAN is still pursuing the CATWOMAN, who's perched one roof
text: over, in a squat, wiggling a finger for him to follow. The
text: roofs are icy and treacherous, but he matches her step for
text: step, leap for leap, as she vaults from one building to the
text: next, leading him on. Finally she reaches the edge of a
text: building on the corner of the block; there's no place to go
text: but down. She squats on the ledge and smiles, beckoning to
dialog: him --
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Ooh. Where have you been all my life?
text: He edges closer. Suddenly, she does a BACKFLIP -- DIRECTLY
text: OFF THE EDGE OF THE ROOF.
text: BATMAN hears GLASS SHATTERING. He hesitates a second -- moves
text: closer to the edge of the roof -- PEERS OVER THE ICY CORNICE.
scene_heading: BATMAN'S POV - THAT MOMENT
text: Staring down, he sees a narrow LEDGE running around the facade
text: of the building some ten or twelve feet below. The window of
text: a corner apartment has been smashed; the curtains are flapping
text: in the chill wind.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF - ON BATMAN - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
text: She's obviously making her getaway through the apartment.
text: BATMAN climbs up on the slippery cornice and prepares to drop
text: to the ledge below -- cautiously, because it's a long way
text: down. A sudden CRACK --
text: The CATWOMAN hasn't entered the apartment. Instead, she's
text: followed the ledge around the corner of the building, silently
text: doubling back onto the roof behind BATMAN. He TURNS just as
text: her WHIP wraps itself around his left leg. She gives it a
text: sharp tug -- his feet SKID on the ice -- and HE TOPPLES OVER
text: THE EDGE OF THE ROOF.
scene_heading: EXT. FACADE OF BUILDING - ON BATMAN
text: He plunges downward for the briefest of seconds -- then JERKS
text: UP SHORT, SLAMMING INTO THE WALL OF THE BUILDING. The WHIP
text: has coiled itself around his leg, and for now it's holding
text: tight. He's dangling upside down, bat-like; he bounces away
text: from the wall; he SPINS in midair as one loop of the whip
text: UNRAVELS, dropping him another foot or so.
text: He manages to brace his left foot against the wall. It's a
text: massive strain, but he's momentarily safe if he can keep from
text: moving. The alternative is a twelve-story drop, straight down
dialog: to the pavement...
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT
text: She's wrapped the handle-end of the whip around an exposed
text: pipe on the roof, anchoring BATMAN in place. With a cheshire-
text: cat grin, she removes the RAVEN from her knapsack and holds it
text: on the edge of the cornice.
scene_heading: EXT. FACADE - THAT MOMENT
text: BATMAN hanging immobile. Craning his neck, he can just see
dialog: the
text: RAVEN STATUETTE on the ledge above him -- bouncing slightly,
text: and apparently talking to him...
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Nevermore. Nevermore!
text: Now the CATWOMAN appears beside it -- elbows on the cornice,
text: chin propped up on her folded hands, like a chatty girl at a
dialog: fern bar.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Cute, huh! I think it'll look nice over
dialog: the fireplace. Maybe you can drop by and
dialog: see it sometime.
dialog: <i>(demurely)</i>
dialog: I hope you won't think I'm too...
dialog: aggressive or anything, but I find you
dialog: very attractive.
text: She toys aimlessly with the whipcord, batting at it like a cat
text: with a piece of yarn. BATMAN grimaces. She speaks in a low,
text: soothing, seductive tone -- almost a purr. Behind the bondage
text: mask she bats her eyelashes.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN (cont.)
dialog: It's just so hard to meet interesting men
dialog: these days. Don't you think so?
dialog: <i>(sighing)</i>
dialog: I have trouble with relationships. Men
dialog: find me intimidating...kind of predatory,
dialog: you know? Really I'm not. Really I'm
dialog: just playful...
text: BATMAN huffs and puffs, trying to bend at the waist so he can
text: grab hold of the whip. She frowns and YANKS on it. His foot
text: flies free of the wall, and another loop of the whip uncoils
text: before he can stabilize himself.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN (cont.)
dialog: Don't laugh! I'm trying to open up to
dialog: you!
text: Angrily, she holds a STEEL CLAW to the whip -- ready to cut
dialog: him loose.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON BATMAN
text: He's palmed the GRAPPLING-HOOK LAUNCHER from his belt.
text: Holding it close to his body, out of view, he works it around
text: into firing position. He'll shoot it right through her if he
dialog: has to...
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN (cont.)
dialog: I always seem to fall for the wrong guys.
dialog: You know...most men are rats.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON CATWOMAN
text: She withdraws her hand from the whip, reverts to her
dialog: philosphical mode.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Mice, really. It's disgusting -- they beg
dialog: you to walk all over them and then they
dialog: whine when you do it. Once you've had
dialog: your fun there's not much you can do but
dialog: kill them.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: But you seem different. I mean, you
dialog: obviously understand about dressing up...
dialog: that saves a lot of explaining. I think
dialog: people should indulge their fantasies,
dialog: don't you?
text: BATMAN is sweating profusely. He can't hold his position much
text: longer. And the CATWOMAN is dragging this insane flirtation
text: out endlessly...
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: So I think I'll let you live. Cute boys
dialog: like you are hard to find...
dialog: <i>(standing up)</i>
dialog: 'Bye, angel. I'll be thinking about you.
text: And just like that, she VANISHES -- moving silently off with
text: her raven, leaving BATMAN to dangle. He hangs there a moment,
text: tries to twist himself around without moving his foot. He
text: braces one hand against the wall; with the other, he lifts his
text: grappling gun and FIRES.
text: The HOOK SNAGS somewhere on the roof. BATMAN yanks the line
text: taut and is laboriously trying to pull himself erect when --
text: -- the CATWOMAN reappears over the edge of the cornice!
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Gee...I'm so fickle.
text: A QUICK SWIPE of her STEEL TALONS, and the whipcord is neatly
text: SEVERED. BATMAN'S FOOT slips out from under him -- but he's
text: still got hold of the GRAPPLING GUN. He DROPS eight or ten
dialog: feet...
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN
text: watching with amusement as BATMAN's weight causes the hook to
text: DISLODGE. It skitters across the gravel surface of the roof
text: and CATCHES, at the last instant, on the edge of the
speaker_heading: CORNICE --
text: -- which promptly CRUMBLES and GIVES WAY. Fascinated, the
text: CATWOMAN leans over the edge of the roof and peers down...
scene_heading: ANGLE ON BATMAN - AS HE FALLS
text: He flails wildly, tangled in his cape, as the ground rushes up
text: toward him. He gets a last-ditch inspiration -- finds the GAS
text: CYLINDER on his belt and hits the switch. The rods in his
text: cape begin to INFLATE...
text: Six stories up, his BATWINGS spring erect, slowing his plunge.
text: Five stories up, an UPDRAFT hits him and he suddenly INVERTS.
text: Four stories up, he rights himself. Three stories up, he goes
text: into a downward spiral, out of control, gliding in great wide
text: arcs over the street...
text: ...and a moment later there are no stories left. With an ugly
text: crunch, he smacks into the slush-covered pavement and BOUNCES.
text: Face down, he skids some twenty feet to a halt -- right in the
text: middle of a BUSY INTERSECTION.
scene_heading: EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: A DELIVERY TRUCK hits the brakes and screeches to a stop, two
text: feet away from BATMAN'S HEAD. He doesn't move. PEDESTRIANS
text: are already gawking and pointing as the DRIVER climbs out and
text: peers down at the inert caped figure lying face-down in the
dialog: street:
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: What the hell is this?
text: CARS are backed up, due to the panic in Gotham Square a few
text: blocks over. HORNS are honking. A TRAFFIC COP marches
dialog: over --
speaker_heading: TRAFFIC COP
dialog: Awright, what's the problem here?
dialog: <i>(spotting BATMAN)</i>
dialog: Jesus.
text: He tries to clear the crowd away. A full-fledged GRIDLOCK is
text: forming around the prostrate BATMAN. The COP blows his
text: whistle, tries to maintain order as two unifonned PATROLMEN
text: rush up to join him.
text: They manage to roll the unconscious BATMAN over on his back.
text: The assembled COPS stare down at the mask, the scuffed body
text: armor. Still waxy, they finger the GUNS in their holsters...
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: Good God. Cowan -- get to the car --
dialog: radio the commissioner!!
text: By now there must be two hundred people in the intersection,
text: all surging forward to get a look. More COPS are arriving to
dialog: beat them back.
speaker_heading: TRAFFIC COP
dialog: Is he dead? What do we do?
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: The mask. Get the mask off.
text: They hunker down over BATMAN. One of them tugs at his mask --
text: but the helmet-like cowl doesn't want to give way. He feels
dialog: around --
speaker_heading: TRAFFIC COP
dialog: Some kinda seam here on the neck...
text: The PATROLMAN nods okay, and the COP tugs at a Velcro-like
text: fastening under BATMAN's chin. The instant it comes open --
text: -- a BURST of FINE GREEN MIST spews forth from concealed JETS
text: in the gold-and-black BAT-EMBLEM, and the COPS reel backward,
text: shrieking, gasping for breath and clewing at their eyes.
dialog: Booby-trap -- they've just been Maced.
text: One of the ONLOOKING COPS steps back in horror and confusion.
text: On impulse, he draws his gun and FIRES TWICE at BATMAN. The
text: body JERKS and the bullets RICOCHET OFF --
speaker_heading: TRAFFIC COP
dialog: DON'T SHOOT, you idiot. The crowd --
text: Before he can finish, a BLACK BOOT kicks the gun out of the
text: ONLOOKING COP's hand. BATMAN is back among the living.
text: SIRENS BLARE as he spins and rolls into a crouch -- lashing
text: out with elbows and knees -- driving the cops back --
text: Fuck the crowd. TWO MORE COPS pull their guns and open fire
text: in absolute panic. BATMAN slams backward into the delivery
text: truck and crumples to the ground. As he falls, he grabs a
text: couple of SMOKE CAPSULES from his belt and flings them to the
dialog: pavement.
text: Seconds later, a THICK CLOUD OF BLACK SMOKE is spreading
text: through the intersection. BATMAN emerges into the midst of
text: the crowd -- weaving in and out among the stalled vehicles --
scene_heading: EXT. INTERSECTION - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT
text: A MOUNTED COP rides up to the outer fringe of the traffic jam,
text: drawn by all the confusion. He rears the horse back, turns it
text: in a circle; blows his piercing whistle as he tries to reroute
dialog: the incoming cars...
text: Suddenly a WIRE wraps itself around his chest and arms. He
text: looks down. He sees a BATARANG in the instant before a sudden
text: JERK pulls him cleanly off his mount.
text: BATMAN climbs up on the hood of the nearest car -- vaults over
text: to the next -- and the next -- then hops into the saddle of
text: the MOUNTED COP's waiting HORSE. He digs in his heels,
text: maneuvering through traffic...
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE CAR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
text: LT. EDDIE BULLOCK and another plainclothesman are a few blocks
text: off trying to get through the jam. Their siren is on, but the
text: cars blocking their path have no room to pull over. BULLOCK
text: grabs the radio mike:
speaker_heading: BULLOCK
dialog: Hell of a mess up here, Commissioner.
dialog: We'll have to go in on foot...
text: As they wait for a response, they see a HORSE charging past in
text: the opposite direction. On the back of the horse...is BATMAN.
text: Gaping, BULLOCK nudges his partner -- who throws the car
text: immediately into REVERSE. As they watch, BATMAN kicks the
text: horse's flanks and turns right -- toward Gotham Park.
scene_heading: INT. GOTHAM PARK - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
text: Two RED BERETS, members of the Order of the Bat, are on night
text: patrol, strolling down a rambling path near the entrance to
dialog: the park.
speaker_heading: RED BERET I
dialog: This is wack, man. Nothing ever happens
dialog: around here anymore.
text: The other RED BERET lets out a WHOOP OF FEAR and yanks his
text: partner out of the way. They tumble into a snowdrift as
text: BATMAN'S HORSE vaults over the stone wall of the park and
text: gallops past, nearly trampling them in the process. By now,
text: SQUAD CARS are roaring into the park...
scene_heading: INT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER
text: SIRENS BLARE and RED LIGHTS FLASH in the distance as the COP
text: CARS spread out along the winding roads that run through the
text: park. BATMAN reins the horse in suddenly as a black-and-white
text: whips past on an access road just ahead of him, no more than
text: twenty yards away.
text: He turns the horse in a circle. MORE RED LIGHTS appear in the
text: distance; another contingent of SQUAD CARS has just entered
dialog: from the opposite side of the park. It's going to be tough
dialog: getting out of here...
text: Then: his eyes fall on the statue of his great-grandfather,
text: GENERAL WAYNE -- two Waynes on horseback, not twenty feet
text: apart. He thinks back to his earlier conversation with VICKI
dialog: and gets an inspiration.
text: He rides past General Wayne to the STONE BRIDGE which spans
text: the little frozen creek. There he finds the DRAINAGE TUNNEL
text: VICKI described, obscured by the wire-mesh grate. This must
dialog: be where the boy vigilante holes up...
text: He dismounts, ties his CAPE to the pommel of the horse's
text: saddle and sends it off with a slap. He pries the grate loose
text: and crawls inside.
scene_heading: INT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT
text: A dank, but cozy, hideout; WARM STEAM hisses from a grate in
dialog: the floor.
text: RUMBLING SOUNDS fill the little chamber as a SUBWAY TRAIN
text: passes directly underneath. A little farther back there's an
text: ACCESS SHAFT, with a Jacob's ladder, leading to the train
dialog: tracks below.
text: Poking around, he finds a couple of cardboard BOXES -- the boy
text: vigilante's stash. The first contains tins of food, plus
text: various odds and ends. The second's more in line with what he
text: needs -- it's full of OLD CLOTHING.
text: A TRAIN rumbles past underneath. BRUCE removes his COWL and
dialog: sets about putting together a civilian disguise that'll get
text: him out of the park. A wool hat and a long, moth-eaten
text: topcoat: perfect. As he's pulling them out of the box, he
dialog: spies something extremely odd --
text: It's a COSTUME -- a spangled red-and-green GYMNASTS OUTFIT
text: with a little yellow CAPE -- neatly folded and in pristine
text: condition. He removes it carefully from the box and holds it
text: up in front of him. Stitched on the vest is a single initial,
text: "R," in a black circle. He stares at the whole mystifying
text: ensemble in complete befuddlement...
text: The roar of the train subsides, and he hears a SCUFFLING
text: NOISE. Someone's in the tunnel with him. He lowers the
dialog: costume abruptly --
text: -- revealing DICK, the boy vigilante, who's crouched in front
text: of him not three feet away. The kid's just crawled up through
text: the ACCESS SHAFT, and he's not at all happy to see an intruder
dialog: messing with his stuff:
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: It's MINE!
text: He lunges furiously at BRUCE. The two of them tumble back
text: into the grate at the tunnel entrance, KNOCKING IT LOOSE --
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - MOUTH OF TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: A POLICE CAR streaks past on the bridge overhead mere seconds
text: before BRUCE and DICK roll out into the snow, still grappling.
text: BRUCE flings the kid into the bridge abutment. DICK lands
text: hard; when he looks up, his EYES WIDEN, and a weird crooked
text: smile comes to his face...
text: Out here in the moonlight he can see his opponent. The body
text: armor -- the gold-and-black emblem on the breastplate -- and
text: above it all, the face of BRUCE WAYNE, exposed to view...
text: As a siren howls nearby, BRUCE flattens himself against the
text: bridge. Like it or not, his fate rests entirely in a strange
text: little boy's hands.
text: The kid sizes up the situation immediately. He nods his head
text: up and down. Then he takes off his own ratty coat and throws
text: it to BRUCE.
text: BRUCE is in no position to look a gift horse in the mouth. He
text: pulls on the coat, gives DICK a nod of acknowledgement, and
text: starts to move off.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: NO. WAIT!
text: BRUCE turns, uncertainly. DICK throws him his woolen SKI CAP.
text: The KID GIGGLES -- oddly, uncontrollably. Then he sprints off
text: into the woods, dancing, leaping. As he disappears from view,
text: he lets out a shrill, piercing, almost FERAL SHRIEK --
text: -- which is obviously intended to divert the cops. BRUCE
text: makes haste in the opposite direction.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER
text: BRUCE'S HORSE gallops through the trees, the black bat-cape
text: still attached to its saddle and BILLOWING behind it.
scene_heading: INT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: TWO COPS scanning the park. The CAPED HORSE charges past in
text: front of them and is momentarily silhouetted in the
text: headlights. From a distance, it looks like BATMAN is still in
dialog: the saddle.
text: The COP at the wheel makes a sudden turn. A moment later, he
text: SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.
text: A MAN has just stepped out onto the road, directly in the
text: squad car's path -- a hunched figure in an old coat and woolen
text: ski cap, obviously one of the homeless. A COP leans on the
text: horn and shouts out the window:
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Dumb son of a bitch!!
text: The MAN -- BRUCE -- steps back out of the squad car's path.
text: The COPS take off -- in hot pursuit of a riderless horse.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - PRE-DAWN

speaker_heading: BANDAGE.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Commissioner Gordon called. He wants to

text: is open and he's holding his arms aloft while ALFRED wraps a
text: full roll of adhesive tape around his battered RIBS.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Great. What'd you tell him?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I told him that since you were Batman,
dialog: you'd require no protection from Batman.
text: BRUCE makes a face: how droll. ALFRED tears off the tape with
text: a brisk YANK -- and BRUCE lets out an involuntary YELP OF
speaker_heading: PAIN.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Jesus, Alfred -- !!
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: In future, sir...I strongly advise against
text: trying to fly off twenty-story buildings.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
text: It's just a few bruises.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: One bruise, sir. Which covers your entire
dialog: body.
text: BRUCE gets up -- stiffly -- and buttons his shirt in gingerly
text: fashion while ALFRED packs his first-aid gear in the doctor's
dialog: bag.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I'm getting too old for this line of work.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: Cops placed me at the scene of the crime
dialog: -- that weird kid of Vicki's saw my
dialog: face --
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I shouldn't worry overmuch. I doubt the
dialog: two of you move in the same circles.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: -- and I got the living shit knocked out
dialog: of me by a woman.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Sir -- such outmoded sexist attitudes are
text: quite unbecoming.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - DAY
text: In a lavishly-appointed guest room on Gotham's Upper East Side
text: (or equivalent thereof), we find a pair of PLAINCLOTHES COPS
text: settled in for a stakeout: rumpled topcoats thrown across
text: antique chairs, french-fry bags and GREASY BURGER WRAPPINGS
text: littering the carpet. HIGH-POWERED RIFLES propped against one
dialog: wall.
text: They peer through venetian blinds at an ELEGANT OLD BROWNSTONE
text: across the street...
scene_heading: HIS POV - ROOF OF BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT
text: A UNIFORMED COP, also carrying a walkie-talkie, is keeping
text: watch on the roof of the brownstone. He signals "all clear"
text: to his counterpart watching from the house opposite.
scene_heading: INT. UNMARKED CAR - THAT MOMENT
text: TWO MORE PLAINCLOTHESMEN are parked at the end of the block,
text: munching on donuts and watching the same brownstone. They
text: spot a POSTMAN lugging his sack up the tree-lined street on
text: his way to the brownstone. One of the PLAINCLOTHESMEN picks
dialog: up his RADIO MIKE:
speaker_heading: PLAINCLOTHESMAN
text: Mailman's coming.
scene_heading: EXT. BROWNSTONE - A MINUTE LATER
text: The POSTMAN marches up the front steps of the brownstone,
text: sorting through letters and packages. He hasn't even rung the
text: bell when the door is opened by ANOTHER COP -- who snatches
text: the mail delivery from his hands and SLAMS THE DOOR IN HIS
speaker_heading: FACE.
scene_heading: INT. BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT
text: MORE COPS, at least half a dozen, are milling about inside --
text: unshaven, ties loosened, shirtsleeves rolled up. They're in
dialog: for the long haul.
text: The first COP gives a handful of letters to a couple of
text: COLLEAGUES -- then hands over a PARCEL, wrapped in brown
text: paper, to a pair of BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERTS. They carry it
text: gingerly into the kitchen. Into the midst of all this
text: bustling activity strides COMMISSIONER GORDON:
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Anything suspicious!
text: In the parlor, where all the shades are drawn, TWO COPS are
text: examining each letter in turn, holding them up to a light
text: bulb, CREASING THEM carefully before slitting them open.
speaker_heading: COP
text: Nothing yet. Christmas cards and bills.
text: He anxiously watches their progress. A VOICE calls from the
dialog: kitchen.
speaker_heading: BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT (V.O.)
dialog: Commissioner -- ?
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER
text: GORDON enters. The bomb-disposal boys have their equipment
text: scattered all over the kitchen table. They've slit the brown-
text: paper wrapping of the PACKAGE, exposing a ROUND DECORATIVE
dialog: TIN.
scene_heading: BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT
dialog: It's a fruitcake.
text: He lifts the lid for GORDON to have a look.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: ...Have it analyzed.
scene_heading: INT. BROWNSTONE - ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT
text: A bleary-eyed ELLIOTT TIPTREE marches down the stairs carrying
text: a pair of OVERSIZED SUITCASES. His WIFE and TWO KIDS are
text: behind him -- all bundled up, preparing to embark on an
dialog: extended vacation.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Mrs. Tiptree? The car's here.
text: TIPTREE, fighting back tears, embraces his wife for a long
text: wordless moment. Their LITTLE GIRL, aged six, tugs at Mommy's
dialog: sleeve.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: I don't wanna go to Grandma's. I wanna
dialog: stay here with Daddy.
speaker_heading: MRS. TIPTREE
dialog: She's got a nice tree just like ours,
dialog: honey. Daddy'll be up as soon as he can.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
text: She's old. She doesn't even have cable.
speaker_heading: LITTLE BOY
dialog: What about our presents?
text: He gestures toward the GIFTS piled high around the tree in the
dialog: parlor.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: Don't worry. I'll bring 'em up with me.
dialog: We'll open 'em when I get there.
text: TIPTREE forces a smile for the kids. He CLUTCHES his wife's
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Sorry, folks, but we'd better move along.
speaker_heading: MRS. TIPTREE
dialog: Kids? Tell your Daddy goodbye...
text: Tearful hugs all around; then a cadre of UNIFORMED COPS escort
text: MRS. TIPTREE and the KIDS to the door. TIPTREE pulls GORDON
dialog: aside.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: They'll be safe, won't they?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: As safe as we can make 'em.
dialog: <i>(beat; sternly)</i>
dialog: It would help if you could give us some
dialog: small hint what this is all about.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: I told you. I...
text: TIPTREE shrugs helplessly and stares at his shoes. GORDON is
text: convinced he's holding something back.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: You have no idea what was in that box that
text: Provost had delivered from the bank.
text: TIPTREE shakes his head wearily. GORDON glowers as he turns
dialog: to go.
speaker_heading: GORDON (cont.)
dialog: All right, Mr. Tiptree. Merry Christmas.
text: GORDON exits. TIPTREE wanders listlessly into the living
text: room, pulls back the drapes, and WATCHES as his wife and kids
text: ride off in a convoy of POLICE CARS. One of the COPS tries to
text: pull him away from the window, but he refuses to move...
text: ...until a PHONE RINGS. Everyone jumps at once. A TECHNICIAN
text: hits a switch on a loudspeaker-and-tape-recorder assembly,
text: then gestures for TIPTREE to pick up the receiver...
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: Hello...?
scene_heading: VOICE ON LOUDSPEAKER
dialog: Mr. Tiptree? Andy here. Listen -- we've
dialog: got a chance to grab a good-sized block of
dialog: Atlantic Teledyne at twenty-six and an
dialog: eighth --
text: The COPS heave sighs and turn off their tracing equipment.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: Not today, Andy. Let's talk after New
dialog: Year's.
text: TIPTREE hangs up and starts to BAWL right there in the middle
text: of the room. The COPS turn away in sympathetic embarrassment
text: as he goes to a corner wet bar and pours himself a good stiff
dialog: jolt.
scene_heading: INT. TIPTREE'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: Wallowing in despair, TIPTREE sits at an antique secretary
text: composing a LETTER. He takes a long pull on a glass of
text: Scotch, signs his name, and inserts the letter into an
text: envelope. He opens the desk drawer -- takes a long look at a
text: .38 automatic stashed inside -- then finds a stamp and affixes
text: it to the envelope. He addresses it to BRUCE WAYNE.
text: A moment later he hears a noise at the window: TINK TINK TINK.
text: He peers through the blinds and sees a CARRIER PIGEON on the
text: ledge outside -- pecking at the glass, asking to come in.
text: He raises the window and the PIGEON hops fearlessly inside,
text: onto the sill. The bird, well-trained, struggles only
text: slightly as he unties a tiny CAPSULE from its leg and removes
text: a FOLDED NOTE. Scrawled across it is a handwritten message:
text: IF POLICE SEE THIS YOUR FAMILY IS DEAD
text: He opens the note and begins to read as the PIGEON takes wing.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - DAY
text: BRUCE is at his desk examining the morning editions. A BANNER
text: HEAD-LINE shrieks:
scene_heading: BATMAN SOUGHT IN PUBLISHER'S MURDER
dialog: Bat Attack Panics Gotham Square
dialog: J. Harrison Provost, 41, Leaves Distinguished Legacy
text: He hears a VISITOR arriving in the entry hall. He gets up...
scene_heading: INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT - DAY
text: BRUCE ambles out and sees SELINA, who's just arrived, doing
text: her patetented thing on ALFRED.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: English accents are so stimulating.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: You have the most beautiful silver hair!
text: ALFRED stammers as she reaches up to STROKE HIS HAIR. He's
text: about to break into a sweat. He's eminently relieved when she
dialog: turns and sees --
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
dialog: Bruce!
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Selina. What are you doing here?
text: ALFRED affects a look of grandmotherly outrage as SELINA
text: slinks over and takes BRUCE by the arm. She's on him like a
text: barnacle.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I wanted to see your things, remember?
dialog: And I got tired of waiting for you to call
dialog: me back.
dialog: <i>(gesturing toward ALFRED)</i>
dialog: He's adorable. How long have you had him?
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
text: BRUCE leads SELINA down a hallway to the armory. He glances
text: back over his shoulder and sees ALFRED peering snoopily around
dialog: the corner.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: You heard about Harry Provost.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: It's incredibly awful. It got me a little
dialog: worried.
dialog: <i>(sidling up closer)</i>
dialog: I hate to think of something happening to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Same here.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: It's odd, though. Danger, the thought of
text: suddenly dying -- in a weird way it gets
dialog: you sort of...aroused. Don't you think?
text: BRUCE cocks an eyebrow at her. Everything gets her sort of
dialog: aroused.
scene_heading: INT. ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER
text: SELINA BEAMS at the fantastic collection of armored gear and
text: exotic weapons. She's like a kid in a toy shop.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Bruce, this is incredible.
dialog: <i>(indicating a suit of armor)</i>
dialog: Malaysian -- ?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Not bad. Sarawak warrior caste.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: It's like -- everything in here is another
dialog: little piece of your mind. I was right
dialog: about you.
dialog: <i>(turning to face him)</i>
dialog: Promise, okay? Promise you'll show me
dialog: every inch of this place.
scene_heading: PAGE 87 MISSING FROM HARD COPY
scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER
text: ALFRED is at a PRINTER, scanning page after page of computer
text: printout. He delivers his findings to BRUCE, who's seated at
text: a nearby terminal, scanning data and tapping away at the
dialog: keyboard.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: The police have no files whatsoever on
dialog: Selina Kyle.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: <i>(abstractedly)</i>
dialog: London...Cairo...Belgium...
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: What exactly are you --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Her credit card records.
dialog: <i>(looking up)</i>
dialog: Every major art theft in the last five
dialog: years -- she's been on the scene or close
dialog: to it.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: You mean she's some sort of -- collector?
dialog: A...cat burglar, or --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Could be. Museum curator, authenticator
dialog: -- she's got the perfect cover for it.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: What would she want with that stupid
dialog: raven?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Raven, sir?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: That's what the Catwoman took from
text: Provost. A little raven statuette, about
dialog: so big...
dialog: <i>(shaking his head)</i>
dialog: But it couldn't have been that valuable.
text: He continues to scan the screen. ALFRED is suddenly lost in
dialog: thought.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: How very odd.
dialog: <i>(long pause)</i>
dialog: I'm sure it's nothing, but --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What, Alfred?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Your father had a raven, sir. A small
dialog: statue of the very sort you describe. It
text: used to sit on his desk.
text: This piques BRUCE's interest. He swivels around in his chair
text: and stares directly up at ALFRED.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What happened to it?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: After your father's...demise, Mr. Tiptree
dialog: came to the house and asked if he could
dialog: have it. As a keepsake. I saw no harm...
dialog: <i>(shrugging)</i>
dialog: That was thirty years ago.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Wait a minute. Mr. Tiptree?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: George Tiptree. Your friend Elliott's
dialog: father.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. TIPTREE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
text: TIPTREE has an oversized suitcase open on the bed. It's empty
text: -- except for the BALLED-UP WADS of NEWSPAPER which he's
text: stuffing inside it. His head turns suddenly at the sound of
dialog: the doorbell...
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER
text: TIPTREE emerges from his bedroom and peers over a bannister
text: into the ENTRYWAY below. Standing there is an unexpected
text: visitor -- BRUCE WAYNE -- holding his arms aloft while a
text: battery of COPS pat him down.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What are you looking for -- Batarangs?
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: Bruce! Come on up.
dialog: <i>(to the COPS)</i>
dialog: I want to talk to Mr. Wayne alone.
text: The COPS look on suspiciously as BRUCE ascends the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. TIPTREE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER
text: TIPTREE lets BRUCE inside and shuts the door behind him.
text: BRUCE hands him a GIFT BOX.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I brought you a Christmas present. Sorry
dialog: about the wrapping -- the police made me
dialog: open it.
text: TIPTREE opens the box and pulls out a diamond-studded TIE
text: CLASP. He looks up at BRUCE with an odd mixture of
text: bewilderment and gratitude. BRUCE nods for him to try it on,
dialog: and he obliges...
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: ...I'm afraid I don't have anything for
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I think you may have something that
dialog: belonged to my father.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: -- You know?
text: He stares at BRUCE, astonished. His head sinks into his
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE (cont.)
dialog: It'll all be over tomorrow. One way or
dialog: another, it'll all be over.
dialog: <i>(looking up; despondent)</i>
dialog: I've decided, Bruce. I'm gonna give him
text: the last two ravens. He's already got the
dialog: others.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What are you talking about? Who?
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: Batman. I don't know how he found out,
dialog: but --
text: TIPTREE reaches for the bottle on his desk to pour himself a
text: drink, but BRUCE angrily knocks the glass out of his hands.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: It's time you told me what's going on
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: Didn't you ever wonder where it came from,
dialog: Bruce? All the privilege, all the power
dialog: ...all the money?
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: The ravens are a...a kind of map, Bruce.
dialog: The key to an incredibly vast fortune.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Whose fortune?
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: Gotham City's.
scene_heading: FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS)
text: The cobblestone streets of 19th-Century Gotham. A massive
text: EXPLOSION blows open one wall of a municipal building, and

text: POLICE rushing to the scene...
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: In 1880 the Gotham City Treasury was
dialog: looted. It was a fantastic operation --
text: perfect military precision. The robbers
dialog: made off with milllons in gold and silver
dialog: bullion...
text: A HORSE-DRAWN CART weighted down with gold bricks careens
text: around a corner. Atop it are two men in MASKS, firing a

speaker_heading: TIPTREE (V.O.)
dialog: The city was going under. Bankrupt...

dialog: rights, the mineral rights, the service
dialog: contracts --
scene_heading: BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND TIPTREE
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: The Five Families.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: Our ancestors. They bought Gotham City --
text: carved it up and ran it into the ground.
dialog: In five years they were rich beyond
dialog: imagining.
dialog: <i>(pause)</i>
dialog: We've just been following in their
dialog: footsteps. And in all this time no one's
dialog: ever suspected --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: -- that they were the ones behind the

scene_heading: FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS)
text: The FIVE PATRIARCHS in front of a roaring fireplace at Wayne

speaker_heading: TIPTREE (O.S.)
text: They had five ravens made. Five ravens
dialog: which -- combined -- would reveal the

dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: But they never touched it. They never
dialog: needed to. It's still there to this day.
scene_heading: BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND TIPTREE
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: The ravens, and the secret -- have been
dialog: passed down through generations. Father

dialog: <i>(shaking his head)</i>
dialog: Your father -- died before he could tell
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: So they stole his piece of the puzzle.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: Yeah. I've got it, Bruce, and I'm going
dialog: to hand it over. He's right, you know.
dialog: We've all been feeding -- feeding on the
dialog: soul of Gotham...
text: BRUCE stares at him, stony-faced. There's one part of the
text: story that doesn't quite add up.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (cont.)
dialog: I don't believe you, Elliott. My father
dialog: was a decent man -- an honorable man. He
dialog: would never have taken part in a scheme
dialog: like this.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: It wasn't his doing, Bruce. It was --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: That doesn't matter. If he knew that his
dialog: fortune was based on a crime -- a crime
dialog: against the city...
dialog: <i>(violently)</i>
dialog: Reputation or not, he would've tried to --
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: Christ, Bruce! Do you want me to spell it
dialog: out for you?!?
text: BRUCE backs off. An awful shiver of anticipation runs down
text: his spine.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE (cont.)
dialog: He was a decent man. He was an honorable
dialog: man. That's why they had him killed.
text: CAMERA ZEROES IN ON BRUCE'S HORRIFIED FACE as we get a
speaker_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS
text: Quick, almost subliminal glimpses of BRUCE's primal trauma: a

text: lunging at him. The young JACK NAPIER firing at THOMAS.
text: PEARLS showering down on the rain-drenched sidewalk. A second
text: bullet felling his MOTHER --
text: -- and finally, young BRUCE himself, face wracked with PAIN
dialog: and GRIEF --
scene_heading: BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE
dialog: -- an expression which perfectly matches the one which the
text: adult BRUCE is wearing as he relives it all thirty years
text: later. Staggered and glassy-eyed, he stares off into space as
text: TIPTREE finishes his tale.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: They killed him...to protect their secret
dialog: ...and now the bill's come due. Now the

scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - BRUCE'S BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT
text: BRUCE lies motionless on his bed. Scattered about him are
text: SCRAPBOOKS, FAMILY PHOTOS and yellowed NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS

speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I realized long ago -- that there are

dialog: <i>(pause)</i>
dialog: He loves you, Miss Vale. But in certain
dialog: ways he will always be alone.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (O.S.)
dialog: ...Thanks for the testimonial.
text: ALFRED turns and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway, staring

text: He returns to his dinner preparations as BRUCE sits down
text: across from VICKI. She extends a hand and he takes it --

speaker_heading: BRUCE
text: Tiptree's planning some kind of rendezvous

scene_heading: INT. TIPTREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

text: in the kitchen, where the COPS are playing poker and watching
dialog: TV.
scene_heading: INT. PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
text: CHRISTMAS TREE LIGHTS twinkle in the darkness. TIPTREE kneels
text: beside the tree and digs around among the packages. He pulls
text: out an OBLONG GIFT BOX with a tag addressed "TO DADDY -- FROM
dialog: SANTA."
text: With a glance back at the kitchen, he soundlessly unwraps the
text: package -- and opens it to reveal a matched set of RAVEN
text: STATUETTES. He transfers them to the big suitcase -- then
text: slinks into the hallway...
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM ACROSS STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: The two STAKEOUT COPS are chuckling at a Charlie Brown
text: Christmas special on a portable TV. One of them glances out

speaker_heading: STAKEOUT COP I
dialog: Shit -- that's Tiptree!!
text: The COP grabs for his WALKIE-TALKIE.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Mr. Tiptree! What the hell are you --
text: HEADLIGHTS FLASH ON as the SURVEILLANCE CAR revs its engine.
text: TIPTREE breaks into a RUN -- and the COPS from the brownstone
text: follow suit. At the end of the block he vanishes down a
scene_heading: SUBWAY ENTRANCE.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY STATION - THAT MOMENT
text: A VIOLINIST is panhandling outside the token booth as the COPS
text: come racing down the stairs. The COPS trip over his open
text: violin case, scattering small change across the conrete floor.
text: They flash their badges at the booth and VAULT OVER THE
speaker_heading: TURNSTILE --
text: -- just in time to see TIPTREE, with his SUITCASE, scuttling
text: down a stairway which leads to the train platform below.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - A MOMENT LATER
text: TIPTREE steps onto an EXPRESS TRAIN. The doors slide shut
text: behind him -- and the hapless COPS curse under their breath as
text: he rolls off.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: We've gotta get back to the radio.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY CAR - A MOMENT LATER - MOVING
text: TIPTREE takes an open seat and looks around apprehensively.
dialog: Being fabulously rich, be's probably ridden the subway twice
text: in his life -- and at this time of night, EVERY FACE in the
text: sparsely-populated car looks vaguely menacing. Derelicts,
dialog: prostitutes, teen-gang members -- ALL OF THEM eye this well-
text: heeled stranger with intense curiosity as he clutches his
text: suitcase and stares anxiously at the floor...
text: An ODD, GAUNT FIGURE enters at the end of the car. It's a
text: DEAFMUTE. He shambles down the aisle passing out little white
text: CARDS. One side is a guide to International Sign Language.
dialog: The other reads:
speaker_heading: DEAF AND DUMB
scene_heading: PLEASE HELP -- $1.00
text: TWO YOUNG TOUGHS take a card and tear it in half, chuckling,
text: shining the DEAFMUTE on. A HOOKER, the heart-of-gold type,
text: stuffs a buck in his tin cup. He reaches TIPTREE and extends
text: a card; TIPTREE ignores him, refusing to make eye contact --
text: -- but the DEAFMUTE shoves the card insistently into his face.
text: Now TIPTREE looks up. THIS CARD bears a personalized message:
scene_heading: GOTHAM CENTRAL STATION
scene_heading: B-TRAIN WEST TO RIVERVIEW
text: TIPTREE's eyes widen. The DEAFMUTE -- who is in fact FRICK --
text: glowers down and holds out his cup. TIPTREE digs in his
text: pocket; the smallest bill he's got is a twenty, but he hands
dialog: it over anyway.
text: Smiling at this act of generosity, FRICK moves on to the next
text: car. TIPTREE stares down tremulously at the card. He fidgets
text: with his TIE CLASP -- the one BRUCE gave him earlier...
scene_heading: INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT
text: TIGHT on a hand-held ELECTRONIC TRACING DEVICE. A small BLIP

text: thirty or forty feet away -- speaking into WALKIE-TALKIES as
text: they scan the crowd.
text: Sticking close to the tracks, he turns swiftly toward the
text: nearest stairway -- blending in with the crowd, trying to hold
text: the SUITCASE out of view.
scene_heading: INT. LOWER PLATFORM - A MINUTE LATER
text: TIPTREE IS RUNNING for the B-train just as the doors begin to
text: close. He manages to thrust the suitcase inside -- but the
text: doors SLIDE SHUT on his hand, and he DROPS IT. He stands
text: there on the platform, his face turning BONE WHITE as the
text: train lurches forward...
text: False alarm. The train stops, and the doors hiss open again.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY CAR - MOVING - A MOMENT LATER
text: TIPTREE clambers aboard with a severe case of palpitations.
text: As the train pulls out, a couple of rough-looking but helpful
text: STREET TYPES show him to a seat and hand him his precious
text: suitcase. He sits there panting...
text: Moments later, a DEAFMUTE enters the car. TIPTREE does a
dialog: take: it's the exact same guy who was riding the other line!
text: Of course, he doesn't know about Frick's malignant twin --
text: FRACK...
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: INT. LOCAL STOP - TEN MINUTES LATER - NIGHT
text: Having changed trains twice more since we left him, TIPTREE
text: debarks at a deserted local stop. The station is EMPTY except
dialog: for one other passenger, who's gotten off here as well -- a
text: WOMAN in a long fur coat.
text: TIPTREE WATCHES as she approaches on her way to the stairwell,
text: STILLETO HEELS clicking across the floor. There's something
text: familiar about her -- but she's wearing a big, broad-brimmed
text: hat, and she TILTS IT DOWN as she passes, obscuring her face.
dialog: It is, of course, SELINA...
text: TIPTREE stands there expectantly with his suitcase, awaiting
text: further instructions. They aren't long in coming. A BLACK
text: MYNAH BIRD swoops out of the tunnel, lands on the platform,
text: and STRUTS in front of him.
speaker_heading: MYNAH
text: FOLLOW ME. AWWWKK! FOLLOW ME.
text: The bird flutters its wings and takes off again -- INTO THE
text: TUNNEL. TIPTREE stares after it in disbelief. Then the bird
text: CAWS AGAIN -- its shrill voice echoing from the darkness of
dialog: the tunnel:
speaker_heading: MYNAH (O.S.)
dialog: FOLLOW ME. AWWWKK!
text: TIPTREE clambers over the edge of the platform, dropping
text: awkwardly to the tracks below. Suitcase in hand, he begins to
dialog: walk...
scene_heading: INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT
text: ALFRED tearing up the streets as BRUCE consults his tracer.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
text: He's slowed down. Looks like he's under
dialog: the park.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: How do you propose to get down there, sir?
dialog: We can't have Batman strolling up to buy a
dialog: token.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I know another way in.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: Step on it. They're down there waiting
dialog: for him.
text: ALFRED turns the limo hard right -- into GOTHAM PARK -- past
text: the statue of GENERAL WAYNE atop his horse...
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT
text: A LOCAL TRAIN roars by, filling the screen. When it passes,
text: we see TIPTREE with his suitcase, walking along the express
text: tracks at the far wall of the tunnel -- more frightened with
text: each step. It's dark and eerie down here in the tunnels; the
text: only illumination comes from dim LANTERNS spaced at fifty-foot
dialog: intervals.
text: He sees the lights of an EXPRESS TRAIN behind him, and quickly
text: switches to the local tracks. The train rumbles past with a
text: deafening blare, and the car lights briefly illuminate his
text: surroundings. TIPTREE glances over at the inside wall of the
dialog: tunnel...
text: ...where he sees, huddled in an ALCOVE just off the tracks, a
text: small gathering of HOMELESS PEOPLE. They've set up camp down
text: here in the tunnels, away from the elements. Surrounded by
text: bags full of old clothes, DINING on canned food and cheap
text: wine, they stare curiously at the well-heeled stranger with
text: the suitcase who's invaded their domain.
text: TIPTREE eyes them fearfully and picks up his pace, hastening
text: down the tunnel. The HOMELESS make no move to follow -- with
text: one exception. A KID, thirteen or fourteen, in a ratty
text: topcoat, climbs down onto the tracks and watches inquisitively
text: as TIPTREE vanishes into the shadows.
text: His face is familiar. It's DICK -- the boy vigilante from the
dialog: park.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - FARTHER DOWN TRACKS - A MOMENT LATER
text: In this stretch of the tunnel the LANTERNS don't seem to be
text: working -- and the MYNAH is completely invisible. When he
text: comes to a fork in the tracks, he has to wait for the sound of
text: the bird's shrill voice to guide him:
speaker_heading: MYNAH
text: AWWRRK! FOLLOW ME.
text: TIPTREE stumbles ahead blindly in the darkness. He trips on
text: the tracks and drops the suitcase. As he's getting to his
text: feet, a FLASHLIGHT shines DIRECTLY IN HIS FACE...
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: STOP THERE.
text: The MYNAH BIRD flutters through the beam of light and perches
text: on the shoulder of an UNSEEN FIGURE. TIPTREE COWERS and
text: SQUINTS, trying to make him out, but the figure who stands
text: before him is shielding his face with an open UMBRELLA.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: I've cooperated. I've done everything you
dialog: said.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Open the case.
text: TIPTREE lifts the lid, revealirig TWO RAVENS in the suitcase.
text: A CACKLING LAUGH echoes in the darkness.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN (cont.)
dialog: ...Two ravens?
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
text: The other one is Bruce Wayne's.
dialog: <i>(trembling)</i>
dialog: He doesn't know anything about this.
dialog: You've got what you want. There's no need
dialog: to --
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Thank you, Mr. Tiptree. You may go.
text: TIPTREE stands. He backs away from the suitcase warily.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: My family. You won't --
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: We'll certainly take your unexpected
dialog: generosity into consideration.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: We -- ?!?
dialog: <i>(shielding his eyes)</i>
dialog: You're not Batman.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: No. I'm his brother-in-law -- Birdman.
dialog: Now move out.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT
text: TIPTREE marches slowly down the tracks, TOWARD CAMERA,
text: silhouetted in the flashlight beam. The beam SHIFTS SLIGHTLY
text: as the Penguin moves toward the suitcase and sets the light
dialog: down --
text: -- and we catch sight of the CATWOMAN perched on a steel
text: cross-girder above the rails, her CHROME-STEEL TALONS GLINTING
text: as she waits for TIPTREE to pass underneath.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - ON TIPTREE
text: looking increasingly twitchy as he approaches the cross-
text: girder. He slips a hand into the pocket of his topcoat,
scene_heading: WHIRLS SUDDENLY --
text: -- and brings up his .38 AUTOMATIC, firing THREE QUICK SHOTS
text: at the PENGUIN. The shots RICOCHET LOUDLY off the umbrella --
text: which happens to be a bulletproof job. The PENGUIN lifts his
text: brolly; FIRE SPITS out of the shaft --
text: -- and TIPTREE staggers backward. SHOT IN THE CHEST. He
text: spins into a steel upright and topples, face-forward, onto the
text: ELECTRIFIED THIRD RAIL -- FRYING HIMSELF in a shower of
dialog: sparks.
text: The smoke is still clearing when the CATWOMAN drops to the
text: tracks. The PENGUIN rushes to her side to check TIPTREE for
text: signs of life.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: That idiot. Another six feet --
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: So sorry to spoil your fun. -- He brought
dialog: two ravens. We've got a complete set!
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: What??
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Yeah! They're in the suitcase --
text: An AWFUL RUMBLING fills the tunnel. They see the lights of a
text: TRAIN approaching on the center track -- the same one they're
text: standing on, the one TIPTREE's body is slumped across. The
text: PENGUIN's first impulse is to run back toward the inner track,
text: where the ravens lie, but the CATWOMAN is trying to drag
text: TIPTREE out of the train's path...
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: GIVE ME A HAND!
text: They pull the corpse onto the outer express track just as the
text: train arrives. They stand against the outer wall, waiting for
dialog: the train to pass...
text: ...and when it does, they see DICK -- the boy vigilante --
text: standing on the inner track directly across from them.
text: HOLDING THE SUITCASE. The kid takes off like a shot. The
text: CATWOMAN and the PENGUIN exchange quick looks of utter
text: disbelief -- and BOLT AFTER DICK.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK
text: The bulky suitcase is slowing his progress. He looks back
text: over his shoulder; although the stubby-legged PENGUIN has
text: fallen well behind, the CATWOMAN is gaining fast.
scene_heading: PAGE 101 MISSING FROM HARD COPY
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK
text: watching in the light from the train as the two costumed
text: figures grapple in the distance. He races back toward the
dialog: scene of the melee...
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - OUTTER EXPRESS TRACK - THAT MOMENT
text: ...where BATMAN and the CATWOMAN are trading punches, blow for
text: blow. He knocks her off her feet with a vicious right hook,
text: and she sprawls on the track, dazed and bleeding. She lifts a
dialog: hand: <i>no mas</i>...
text: He looks back toward the suitcase on the center track. Before
text: he can make a move toward it, he spots ANOTHER TRAIN
text: approaching on the outer tracks -- right on the heels of the
text: last one. He crouches to pull the CATWOMAN's limp frame out
dialog: of its path...
text: ...but as he does so, a HORN BLARES -- and a SECOND TRAIN
text: comes barrelling down the center track from the opposite
text: direction! Now he's got trains approaching on either side,
dialog: and there's no place to go --
text: The CATWOMAN is groggily getting to her feet. He LUNGES at
text: her -- THRUSTS HER BACKWARD, toward an ALCOVE in the outer
text: tunnel wall.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK - THAT MOMENT
text: The OUTER train is already speeding past, obscuring BATMAN and
text: the CATWOMAN from view. The CENTER train is bearing down
text: fast. A split-second before it arrives, DICK'S HAND snatches
text: the suitcase out of its path -- and he TUMBLES TO SAFETY on
text: the innermost LOCAL TRACK.
text: He stands and watches as the two trains pass in opposite
text: directions. He doesn't know if BATMAN is alive or dead...
scene_heading: INT. ALCOVE - THAT MOMENT
text: BATMAN and CATWOMAN are flattened in the tiny alcove --
text: there's not two inches of breathing space between them and the
text: passing TRAIN. She's come around now, and she's FLAILING and
text: CLAWING at him, trying to PUSH HIM OUT.
text: HER HAND closes around his UTILITY BELT. As they struggle,
text: she hits the trigger of a SMALL GAS CYLINDER...
text: It's BRUCE's hydraulic BATWING DEVICE -- the one that saved
text: him when he fell off the roof. But this time the results are
text: altogether different. He GASPS IN HORROR as the WINGS OF HIS
text: CAPE stiffen and inflate -- FORCING HIM AWAY FROM THE WALL OF
scene_heading: THE TUNNEL.
text: His OUTER WING strikes the TRAIN -- FLAPPING WILDLY against
text: the passing CARS -- SNAGGING FINALLY on the ralling of the
dialog: rearmost car --
text: -- and BATMAN is suddenly RIPPED OUT OF THE ALCOVE -- DRAGGED
text: OFF DOWN THE TRACKS by the passing train!
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - INNERMOST TRACK - ON DICK
text: He's still there with the suitcase -- waiting apprehensively
text: to see what's become of BATMAN. Finally the center train
dialog: passes --
text: -- and he sees CATWOMAN standing ALONE IN THE ALCOVE --
text: smiling at him -- advancing menacingly. DICK TURNS TO RUN...
text: A GUNSHOT rings out -- and the last thing he sees as he slumps
text: to the tracks is a whiff of SMOKE pluming from the shaft of
text: the PENGUIN'S UMBRELLA.
text: The PENGUIN's panting -- soaked with sweat. The CATWOMAN
text: snatches up the suitcase and rushes over to join him. She
text: peers off into the tunnels after BATMAN, exhilarated...
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: God. Did you see him? Isn't he hot?
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Haven't you got anything else to think
dialog: about?
dialog: <i>(mopping sweat from his brow)</i>
dialog: I'm hot. That was exhausting.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: No pain, no gain! -- Suck it up. We're
dialog: not out of here yet.
text: She sprints off down the tracks. SQUAWKING, he waddles along
text: behind her, as fast as his fat little legs will carry him...
text: As they vanish into the darkness, the CAMERA TRACKS back --
text: past DICK, who lies unconscious on the tracks, bleeding
text: heavily from his shoulder wound -- DEEPER INTO THE MAZE OF
speaker_heading: TUNNELS --
text: -- arriving finally on the ragged black figure of BATMAN as he
text: staggers forth from the shadows, dazed and bloody. He scans
text: the tunnel, finding no trace of his enemies -- and then his
text: gaze falls on DICK.
text: He limps over and KNEELS at the boy's side -- cradling his
text: head protectively, staring helplessly into the blackness all
dialog: around him...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT
text: The stark outlines of the city, BATHED IN MOONLIGHT. CAMERA
text: ZEROES IN on the glowing, ornamental DOME of CITY HALL...
scene_heading: INT. CITY HALL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: A PENTAGONAL BALCONY girds the interior of the dome. We TILT
text: DOWN to ground level -- where TWO AGED SECURITY GUARDS lie
text: sprawled at odd angles on the marble floor, FATALLY SHOT.
text: The PENGUIN closes his gun-umbrella and waddles across the
text: atrium of City Hall, past a statue of blind Justice, to a
text: point directly under the dome. There, encased in a plexiglass
text: case, is a SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM CITY -- circa 1885, when City
text: Hall was erected. He shouts up:
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: LETS DO IT!
scene_heading: INT. CITY HALL - BALCONY UNDER DOME - THAT MOMENT
text: The CATWOMAN, FRICK, and FRACK are already up on the balcony.
text: Lining its periphery are various DISPLAY CASES of historical
text: interest; and positioned along the wall at each point of the
text: pentagon are FIVE ARCHED NICHES -- each one containing a
text: bronze bust. The patriarchs of Gotham's Five Families...
text: The CATWOMAN and co. go to work quickly. She removes the FIVE
text: RAVENS from a gunny sack as FRICK and FRACK work their way
text: around the balcony, YANKING the busts from their recessed
text: bases. She follows along behind them, replacing each bust
text: with a RAVEN.
text: When they're done, the PENGUIN yells up:
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Now. Give each raven a quarter-turn.
text: His pals in the dome oblige -- TWISTING each raven in its
text: recessed socket, in quick succession...
scene_heading: INT. CITY HALL - ATRIUM - ON PENGUIN
text: The moment of maximum tension. He stands there frothing at
text: the mouth with anticipation. SECONDS TICK OFF, and nothing
dialog: happens.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: What happens now?
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: I don't know. That's all...!
text: He looks around expectantly as the others peer down at him
text: from above. He really doesn't know what's supposed to happen
text: next. Suspecting the worst, he throws his umbrella to the
text: floor and begins STAMPING ABOUT IN A RAGE, SPUTTERING,
text: flapping his arms like wings.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN (cont.)
dialog: We've been TRICKED! It's a HOAX! It's
dialog: a --
text: He SHUTS UP suddenly at the sound of a loud CHUNK. Somewhere
text: behind him, ANCIENT GEARS are beginning to grind. He spins
text: and stares at the SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM in its plexiglass
dialog: case...
text: The city model is TREMBLING slightly. As he watches, the DOME
text: of the miniature CITY HALL -- in the dead center of the model
text: city -- POPS OFF on a hinge. A METAL STRONGBOX rises into
dialog: view...
scene_heading: INT. DOME - ON BALCONY - THAT MOMENT
text: The CATWOMAN, FRICK and FRACK stare down at the little metal
text: box. The PENGUIN is already clambering atop the plexiglass
text: case of the model, SMASHING AT IT with his umbrella, trying to
dialog: get at the box.
speaker_heading: FRICK
dialog: That's the treasure?
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: No. It's a map...
text: She affixes a ROPE to the balcony railing and CLIMBS OVER.
scene_heading: INT. CITY HALL - ATRIUM - ON PENGUIN
text: The plexiglass case finally SHATTERS -- and the PENGUIN falls
text: through, landing atop Gotham City. He snatches at the
text: strongbox and gets to his feet, bestriding the city like a
text: colossus. He's climbing down off the tabletop when the
text: CATWOMAN, on her rope, touches down behind him.
text: He hunkers down on the floor and knocks the rusted padlock off
text: the box. He opens it and stares greedily at the contents -- a
text: MAP and a bunch of old, crumbling PHOTOS. The CATWOMAN creeps
text: over to his side:
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Bruce Wayne. So he doesn't know a thing
dialog: about the treasure, eh...?
dialog: <i>(handing her the map)</i>
dialog: Look at this. It's right under Wayne
dialog: Manor. It's been there all along!
text: Now the CATWOMAN snatches at the PHOTOS. They show
text: progressively closer views of ANCIENT GNARLED STALACTITES --
text: an odd, distinctive SUBTERRANEAN ROCK FORMATION...
speaker_heading: PENGUIN (cont.)
text: Looks like some kind of cave.
scene_heading: FADE THROUGH TO:
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY
text: TIGHT ON THE FACE of DICK. He lies unconscious in a big soft
text: frilly bed A WOMAN'S HAND wipes his feverish brow with a damp
text: cloth; he moans slightly...
text: His eyes snap open suddenly. He sits BOLT UPRIGHT with a
dialog: yelp.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: No, no -- don't try to get up -- you're
dialog: hurt.
text: He pushes her aside and climbs out of bed anyway. His
text: shoulder is bandaged, his arm in a sling. The pajamas he's
text: wearing are three sizes too large. He paces about, staring at
text: his unfamiliar surroundings.
speaker_heading: VICKI (cont.)
dialog: It's all right. You're safe. You can
dialog: stay here as long as you need to.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: I don't belong here. You can't keep me
dialog: here.
text: Vaguely unnerved, he goes to a window, pulls back the shades,
text: looks out at the grounds.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: It's "Dick", isn't it? Or do you prefer
dialog: "Richard"?
text: He stares at her as if she's nuts. VICKI opens a closet door:
text: all of his ratty belongings are hanging inside -- including
text: the red-and-green GYMNAST'S SUIT with the "R" insigne on the
dialog: breast.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: "R" -- for Richard, right? See, all your
dialog: things are here...
dialog: <i>(staring at the costume)</i>
dialog: What is it, some kind of gymnast's outfit?
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: It's none of your business. What is this,
dialog: some kind of home?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: No, not that kind. There's a swimming
dialog: pool -- tennis court -- you can have
dialog: anything you want.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Tennis court?! -- Lady, you're rich. How
dialog: the hell would you know what I want?
text: VICKI tries to lay a soothing arm on his shoulder. He bats it
text: away, pushes her aside and turns toward the door in
dialog: agitation --
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: I'm not staying. You can't make me --
text: -- and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway looking at him.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I can make you.
text: DICK freezes -- as if BRUCE's mere presence has mesmerized
text: him. The hint of a smile plays across his face: ohhhhh. I'm
text: in Batman's house.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (cont.)
dialog: Come on. Wanna go at it?
dialog: <i>(no response)</i>
dialog: Look, kid -- like it or not, you're my
dialog: guest -- and long as you're here you might
dialog: as well enjoy it.
text: ALFRED appears with a tray of hot food and sets it down on a
text: bedside table. DICK edges toward it and sits down. He waits
text: for ALFRED to leave and then TUCKS IN HUNGRILY -- eyeing BRUCE
dialog: all the while.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (cont.)
dialog: Will you two be okay in here?
text: VICKI nods yes. BRUCE backs out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - OUTSIDE GUEST ROOM - DAY
text: BRUCE pulls the door shut. ALFRED follows him down the hall.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: What do you propose to do with him, sir?
dialog: Keep him in the room for the rest of his
dialog: life?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I don't know, Alfred. I've got other
dialog: stuff to worry about.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: The child is hurt, sir. At the very least
dialog: we should attempt to locate his parents.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: He hasn't got any parents.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: How do you know that, sir?
text: BRUCE turns and fixes ALFRED with a steely gaze.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: ...I know.
text: The PHONE RINGS as BRUCE starts down the long stairway.
text: ALFRED picks up a hallway extension. He covers the
dialog: mouthpiece:
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Sir -- it's Miss Kyle.
text: BRUCE rushes back upstairs to take the call.
scene_heading: INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - THAT MOMENT - DAY
text: ARCTIC BIRDS chirping all around in the penguin-pool room. A
text: SNOW OWL struts across the PENGUIN's desk as SELINA makes a
text: phone call -- with the PENGUIN, FRICK, and FRACK hovering over
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Well! Tall, dark and handsome. Are we
dialog: still on for tonight?
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - ON BRUCE
text: He covers the receiver and stares intensely at ALFRED. On his
dialog: look we
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT
text: Christmas carols playing. VICKI's got DICK helping her trim
dialog: the tree.
scene_heading: INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: BRUCE is getting dressed for his date with SELINA.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Is this necessary, sir? After all...it is
dialog: Christmas eve.
text: BRUCE reaches for his UTILITY BELT. He empties the contents
text: of one packet onto a dresser: a dozen tiny, red GLASSINE
text: CAPSULES. He scoops up a handful of the CAPSULES and deposits
text: them in his jacket pocket.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Stuff'll knock out a moose, much less a
dialog: cat.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I don't like to see you going out on a
dialog: date...unprotected, sir.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: She'll be ready for Batman -- but not for
dialog: me.
dialog: <i>(turning to go)</i>
dialog: It's the only way, Alfred. I've got to
dialog: take her out tonight.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRY HALL - FIVE MINUTES LATER (DICK'S POV)
text: DICK watches from the front parlor as VICKI meets BRUCE at the
text: bottom of the stairs. The two of them exchange a few brief
text: words; he embraces her, strokes her hair gently -- then glumly
text: sets his jaw and moves off toward the front door.
text: VICKI reenters the parlor, trying to force an expression of
text: cheer as DICK turns discreetly away. This is one weird
dialog: household he's landed in...
scene_heading: INT. SELINA'S LOFT - NIGHT
text: SOFT MUSIC plays in the background as SELINA preens in front
text: of a vanity, doing her eye makeup, taking great pleasure in
text: her own reflection. She's looking especially sultry tonight
text: in a glittering low-cut gown. She lowers one shoulder strap
text: and strikes a pose in the mirror: better. She runs a hand
text: through her hair, TOUSLING IT for that recently-ravished look.
text: The DOORBELL rings, and by the time SELINA crosses over to
text: answer it, she's lowered the other strap as well -- which
text: means she has to hold up the top of her dress with one hand.
text: BRUCE finds himsell dumbstruck as she lets him in. She pulls
text: up both straps as she greets him nonchalantly:
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: You're early. I'm afraid I'm not quite
dialog: dressed.
text: BRUCE enters and takes a long look around. It's a big open
text: loft, only partly finished, filled with Egyptian artifacts.
text: The walls feature modern paintings with CAT MOTIFS. The
text: finished section is dominated by a huge BED on a raised
text: platform -- three or four CATS are walking around on it,
text: yowling at BRUCE. SELINA CHUCKLES as he scopes it all out.
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
dialog: If you're looking for my bondage gear,
text: it's at the cleaners.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Christmas eve. No tree?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: No presents. I've been a bad girl this
dialog: year.
text: BRUCE takes a seat on the sofa while SELINA goes to a nearby
dialog: wet bar.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I'm surprised you kept this date. I
dialog: thought you would've lost interest by now.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: What makes you say that?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: You've got what you want, don't you?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I do now.
dialog: <i>(smiling)</i>
dialog: We've had this date for a long, long time.
text: With that, she sets the drinks down on the table and moves in
text: to KISS him -- a long, slow, wet kiss. But BRUCE seems
text: strangely unresponsive. She breaks free and gives him a funny
dialog: look.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: How much is it going to cost me?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: ...To get the ravens back.
text: He watches her closely for a reaction. SELINA's shocked, but
text: she conceals it well -- chuckling in apparent confusion.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: You're the oddest man I've ever met.
dialog: <i>(moving in on him)</i>
dialog: Let's talk later, Bruce. I've got kind of
text: a short fuse...
text: BRUCE tenses slightly as she KISSES him again -- leaving a
text: crimson LIPSTICK SMEAR on his cheek. She works her way
text: downward, kissing him around his neck and throat...
text: HIS HAND reaches into his jacket pocket. He withdraws a tiny
text: GLASSINE CAPSULE. But before he can use it --
text: He JERKS BACK suddenly -- pushes her away. His free hand goes
text: to his neck, where a thin trickle of BLOOD is oozing from
text: between two bright red LIPSTICK LIPS. She's bitten him...
text: Now she SHUSHES him -- reaches over to the tiny wound and
text: massages it gently with one hand.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Did I hurt you? Just relax -- you'll
dialog: start to enjoy it.
text: BRUCE pulls away again. His eyes are strangely glazed. He
text: tries to speak, but his tongue feels thick and swollen.
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
dialog: Bruce, you look faint. It must be the
dialog: cats.
text: BRUCE stands suddenly. It's as if he's mired in a slo-mo
text: nightmare. His legs give way beneath him and he topples to
text: the floor, INERT. His fingers go slack and the capsule rolls
text: out; he tries to reach into his pocket, but his arm won't seem
dialog: to work.
text: SELINA's cat, HECATE, strolls across his prostrate form --
text: purring and stretching...
speaker_heading: BRUCE'S POV
text: A worm's-eye view -- SELINA looms over him with a predatory

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What di-- what did you d--
text: She runs a finger across her lips and holds it up -- bright
dialog: red.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I guess I've...gotten under your skin.
scene_heading: BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE
text: His hand goes to the BITE on his neck -- and he realizes
text: SELINA's lipstick is spiked with a fast-acting PARALYTIC DRUG.
text: He writhes helplessly on the carpet, his whole body gradually
dialog: going slack.
text: The PENGUIN, FRICK and FRACK stroll through the doorway and
text: stand over him -- ALL LAUGHING...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT
text: A COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR cruises past the manor, right on
dialog: schedule.
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - PARLOR - NIGHT
text: ALFRED on the telephone, checking in with the County Sheriff's
dialog: boys.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Everything's fine, thank you. We'll talk
dialog: in an hour.
text: Behind him, VICKI is waiting up for BRUCE. She's curled up on
text: the sofa, reading a book, throwing the occasional anxious
text: glance at a big grandfather clock -- which strikes eleven
dialog: o'clock.
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: DICK opens the bedroom door and peeks down the hall. He's got
text: all his belongings tied up in a bundle on the bed; he opens a
text: window and throws the bundle outside.
text: There's a nice strong TREE BRANCH some ten or twelve feet from
text: the window -- just close enough that he should be able to make
text: it. He climbs up onto the windowsill, crouches, and SPRINGS.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - OUTSIDE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: A car full of trouble: SELINA, wearing a fur coat over her
text: Catwoman garb, at the wheel; the PENGUIN riding shotgun; and
text: FRICK in the back seat -- next to BRUCE, who's semi-conscious
text: and stone limp. The car idles outside the wrought-iron gates
dialog: of Wayne Manor.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Try his mag card.
text: FRICK digs in BRUCE's pockets and finds a bunch of RED
speaker_heading: CAPSULES.
speaker_heading: FRICK
dialog: Look at this. He's a pillhead.
text: Now FRICK finds a mag-striped card and INSERTS IT into an
text: electronic device at the edge of the drive. The gates
text: magically part. There's a large VAN just behind the car --
text: driven by FRACK, and carrying two random GOONS. Both vehicles
text: pull in before the gates slide shut.
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - A MOMENT LATER
text: VICKI hears a signal from the security panel in the kitchen
text: announcing what should be BRUCE's arrival. She heaves a huge
text: sigh of relief -- then rushes to the door and flings it open.
text: She sees BRUCE standing there and her face lights up.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Ohh. Am I glad to --
text: To her horror, BRUCE topples forward -- and lands on the
text: floor, flat as a board. VICKI SHRIEKS as the PENGUIN enters,
text: throwing his arms wide.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
scene_heading: MER-R-R-RY CHRISTMAS!!
scene_heading: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: DICK has shimmied down to a lower branch. He lets go and
text: drops to the snow, WINCING; his shoulder wound is bleeding
text: again. As he grabs his bundle, he hears RAUCOUS LAUGHTER
text: coming from around the house.
text: He races over to peer around the corner. He sees the two cars
text: out front. He sees the last of the goon squad barging in
text: through the front door.
text: His face full of confusion and conflict, he moves to a window.
text: In the entry hall he sees BRUCE on the floor -- and VICKI
text: surrounded by gun-toting intruders. One of them grabs her and
text: twists her arm behind her back.
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT
text: VICKI shrieking and struggling as she stares down at BRUCE.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: What did you do to him??
text: SELINA gives her a catty little smile.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: First-time jitters, I guess. Everything
dialog: was going great, and then...he just went
text: limp as a noodle.
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - ON STAIRWAY
text: Drawn by the commotion, ALFRED rushes down the stairs to the
text: entry hall, pulling a robe around him. He freezes in his
text: tracks when he sees FRICK dragging VICKI into the front
text: parlor, holding a gun to her head.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: You'd be the butler. Why don't you come
dialog: on down and attend to your guests?
text: ALFRED hesitates, until the PENGUIN pulls a gun on him. He
text: marches down the stairs slowly, pausing by BRUCE's prostrate
dialog: form.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Mr. Wayne. Is he -- ?
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: You know how it is. Some guys just can't
dialog: hold their egg nog.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER
text: The PENGUIN marches ALFRED in where the rest of the gang's
text: already assembled. FRICK throws VICKI down roughly on a sofa
text: just next to the Christmas tree while the GOONS drag BRUCE
dialog: inside.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: I should explain the occasion of our
dialog: visit. There's a treasure underneath this
dialog: house -- and I don't plan to leave until
dialog: you tell me how to find it. Now who's
dialog: going to talk -- Miss Vale?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I don't know what you're talking about.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: The cave. Under the house. How do I get
dialog: there?
text: The PENGUIN gestures. FRICK holds the gun to her head.
speaker_heading: VICKI (cont.)
dialog: I don't know! I swear, I would tell
dialog: you --
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: <i>(turning to ALFRED)</i>
dialog: Then maybe you'd like to tell me.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: You're no more than a common thief.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Wrong, you old idiot. I happen to be a
dialog: very uncommon thief.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: Are you going to tell me, or does Miss
dialog: Vale get an early present this year?
text: FRICK cocks the gun. VICKI stares aghast at ALFRED, who scans
text: the room, weighing his options. Trembling, he shuts his
dialog: eyes --
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I...don't...know...
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Then go ahead, Mr. Frick...decorate the
dialog: tree.
text: FRICK's finger tightens on the trigger. VICKI winces. ALFRED
text: starts to blurt something out. But a split-second before he
dialog: can speak --
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Wait!
dialog: <i>(crossing over to VICKI)</i>
dialog: We don't know how to get down there yet.
dialog: We may need her when Bruce wakes up.
text: The PENGUIN sighs and waves FRICK off. ALFRED and VICKI heave
text: simultaneous sighs of relief. He throws her a shamefaced look
text: -- but she gives him a tiny nod of acknowledgement: you made
dialog: the right play.
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
dialog: Besides -- I want this one for myself. So
dialog: pretty...I'm going to give her a brand new
dialog: face for Christmas.
text: The PENGUIN throws a look at BRUCE, who's still out cold on
text: the floor. He turns to FRICK and FRACK.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Why don't you two tie up our host?
text: ALFRED sits beside VICKI while SELINA wanders off to tour the
text: premises. FRICK and FRACK, meanwhile, drag BRUCE into a back
text: parlor which opens off the room they're in.
scene_heading: INT. BACK PARLOR - THAT MOMENT
text: They dump BRUCE face down on a sofa -- then rip the telephone
text: cords from around the baseboard and use them to bind his hands
dialog: and feet.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT PARLOR - ON MR. BONIFACE
text: Still holding his gun on VICKI and ALFRED, he wanders about
text: the room, admiring the various furnishings and expensive
dialog: objects.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: It's all so plush and tasteful, isn't it?
dialog: Just the sort of setting in which I've
dialog: always imagined myself.
text: ALFRED, on the sofa, can't resist letting out a snort of
dialog: disgust.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN (cont.)
dialog: I see. You think I'm vulgar. You think
dialog: I'm...<i>nouveau</i>.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I think you're a dirty little man with
dialog: a --
text: The PENGUIN silences him by sweeping one arm across a
text: tabletop, sending a bunch of PRICELESS CHINA FIGURINES
text: crashing to the floor. He points to ALFRED as FRICK and FRACK
text: reappear.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: See, boys, that's old money talking.
text: After a while, they actually start to
dialog: believe they've earned all this.
dialog: <i>(smirking)</i>
dialog: I don't mind. Someday I'll be old money
dialog: too -- when the statute of limitations
text: runs out.
speaker_heading: SELINA (O.S.)
dialog: Hey! -- Guess what I just found.
text: Face full of anticipation, he TURNS -- just in time to see
text: SELINA returning from the kitchen with a big silver tray of...
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
dialog: Christmas cookies!
text: The PENGUIN is crestfallen, but that doesn't stop him from
text: cramming a handful of cookies down his gullet. SELINA
text: graciously serves VICKI and ALFRED, who munch away with
dialog: limited enthusiasm.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Let's spread out and see what we can find.
scene_heading: <i>(to FRICK and FRACK)</i>
dialog: You two -- keep an eye on our friends
dialog: here. Give me a yell the minute Wayne
dialog: comes to.
text: FRICK and FRACK post themselves at the doors to the front
text: parlor as SELINA, the PENGUIN and the GOONS fan out through
text: the house. CAMERA TRACKS WITH THEM as they move past BRUCE --
text: -- and in a quick CLOSEUP we see his EYES OPEN -- his hands
text: STRUGGLING against his bonds.
speaker_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS
text: QUICK GLIMPSES of the intruders enacting their depredations as
text: they search for the entrance to the cave. SELINA and the
text: PENGUIN are flinging open doors, moving clocks, looking for
text: secret panels; as they go, they systematically TEAR THE HOUSE
text: APART -- smashing BRUCE's possessions, ripping paintings out
dialog: of frames, etc.
text: Meanwhile, the TWO GOONS are outside prowling around the
text: grounds, looking for an exterior entrance -- and back in the
text: parlor, FRICK and FRACK are keeping their guns trained on
speaker_heading: ALFRED and VICKI.
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - CORRIDOR OFF KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: CAMERA TRACKS down a long, empty hallway -- arriving at a
text: LOCKED DOOR with curtained-off glass panels. Suddenly, an
text: ELBOW smashes through the glass -- a hand reaches inside and
dialog: fumbles for the lock --
scene_heading: INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT
text: FRICK and FRACK start at the sound of a SECURITY ALARM blaring
text: from the kitchen. VICKI looks at ALFRED...
speaker_heading: FRICK
dialog: Better check it out.
text: FRICK stays behind as FRACK rushes out into the entryway and
text: down a long hall to the kitchen. He tosses a glance back at
text: VICKI and ALFRED, then steps out into the entryway himself.
speaker_heading: FRICK (cont.)
dialog: What is it? What's going on??
text: VICKI and ALFRED look into the back parlor. DICK GRAYSON has
text: sneaked in behind the sofa -- and he's busy sawing away at
text: BRUCE's bonds with a letter opener. Both of them stiffen
text: simultaneously -- if FRICK steps back inside, he'll have a
text: clear view of DICK and BRUCE.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT
text: FRACK has opened a panel on the kitchen wall, revealing the
text: SECURITY SYSTEM from which the alarm emanates. A RED LIGHT is
text: blinking, indicating DICK's break-in. FRACK throws switches
text: frantically, trying to kill the sound. Finally he succeeds --
speaker_heading: and SHOUTS:
speaker_heading: FRACK
dialog: Some kind of security system --
scene_heading: INT. BACK PARLOR - THAT MOMENT
text: DICK's gotten BRUCE free -- but BRUCE, still under the effects
text: of the drug, isn't much use. He tries to get off the sofa and
text: crumples in a heap.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Can you move, man?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Library -- got to get me to the library --
text: DICK slings an arm around BRUCE and drags him to a door
text: opening onto the hallway. They're just about to step outside
text: when FRACK comes marching back on his way from the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT PARLOR - ON VICKI AND ALFRED
text: -- faces wracked with utter, desperate tension as they watch
dialog: the situation develop.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT
text: FRICK and FRACK conferring, ignoring VICKI and ALFRED for the
text: moment. By now the PENGUIN is waddling in from a hallway:
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: What is that ungodly racket?
speaker_heading: FRACK
text: A security alarm. It went off in the
dialog: kitchen.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: My God! Is someone in here?
text: He struts over to huddle with his cronies. BRUCE and DICK are
text: still poised in the doorway. It looks bad...
scene_heading: INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT
text: ALFRED looks at BRUCE and DICK -- then at FRICK and FRACK
text: bickering with the PENGUIN in the entryway. He pats VICKI's
text: knee -- gestures for her to keep her seat --
text: -- and LUNGES at FRICK, making a play for his gun. A moment
text: of confusion ensues -- giving DICK and BRUCE just enough time
text: to dart out into the hallway, duck around a corner, and
dialog: vanish --
text: -- but ALFRED is a frail old gent, and he can't keep it up for
text: long; a blow to the face sends him sprawling to the floor.
text: FRICK instinctively pulls the trigger and SHOOTS HIM at point-
dialog: blank range.
text: VICKI rushes into the hallway -- screaming, crying.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT
text: The room's a mess, books all over the floor. The groggy BRUCE
text: props himself up against his desk. He manages to pull the
text: bottom drawer open -- gropes frantically for the secret
text: switch. He's CRYING.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Alfred...
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: I'll go back.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I can't...get down there...without you.
text: DICK turns. To his amazement, the sectional bookcase is
text: swinging open -- revealing the secret passage to the BATCAVE.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRY HALL/FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT
dialog: We will all be pleased to know that ALFRED has only suffered a
text: superficial wound to the arm. VICKI is on her knees beside
text: him; the PENGUIN is watching them with utter contempt.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: What an extraordinarily stupid thing to
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: SHUT UP. Help me with him.
text: The PENGUIN rolls his eyes and orders FRICK and FRACK to give
text: VICKI a hand without him. They carry him into the parlor, lay
text: him out on the sofa. VICKI reaches into her purse for a
text: handkerchief and begins binding his wound as the PENGUIN pulls
speaker_heading: FRACK aside.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: You and I had better check the ground
dialog: floor and see what's going on. Mr. Frick
dialog: -- do you think you'll be able to manage
dialog: this pair?
speaker_heading: FRICK
dialog: Yes sir.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Oh, good. That does relieve my mind --
text: He turns, glances into the back parlor, and sees a pile of CUT
text: CORDS on the love seat. The blood drains out of his face.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN (cont.)
dialog: Where's Wayne???
scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT
text: DICK has just entered another world -- and he's looking around
text: him in pure, unalloyed amazement. BRUCE is fumbling with a
text: packet on a spare UTILITY BELT; he shakes out a fistful of
text: pills and swallows them dry.
text: Then he goes to his bank of monitors and begins flipping
text: switches. They blink on one by one; DICK moves up behind
text: BRUCE and looks on, dazzled.
scene_heading: INSERT - MONITOR
text: The screen shows The PENGUIN in a sun room, shouting to his
text: two armed GOONS through a pair of French doors.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Check the grounds! The shape he's in, he
dialog: can't have gotten far.
scene_heading: BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE
text: He turns to his main control panel, reaches for a switch, and
dialog: waits.
scene_heading: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: The two GOONS outside, with guns and flashlights, roaming
text: cautiously around the grounds. They turn suddenly --
text: -- as CORRUGATED-STEEL SECURITY PANELS slam into place over
dialog: every ground-floor door and window in Wayne Manor!
scene_heading: INT. SUN ROOM - THAT MOMENT
text: The PENGUIN sees the same thing happening, only from inside.
text: He listens helplessly as his GOONS pound on the steel panels
text: from outside. It's just occurred to him that he's trapped in
dialog: here...
scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER
text: DICK is up on a catwalk leading back to the library of Wayne
text: Manor. BRUCE shouts up to him from the control console down
dialog: below.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
text: -- as soon as he gets to the East wing.
dialog: Wait for my signal. You know what to do.
text: DICK nods yes and bolts off.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER
text: VICKI and ALFRED are still sitting at gunpoint. With the
text: commotion going on all around them, FRICK is getting itchy-
text: fingered.
text: Suddenly the STEREO begins blaring at top volwne -- "SANTA
text: BRING MY BABY BACK TO ME." FRICK turns and stares at it in
text: confusion -- goes over to fiddle with the controls --
text: -- and suddenly BRUCE'S VOICE is coming through the
text: loudspeakers.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (O.S.; filter)
dialog: VICKI! RUN! NOW!
text: She's off the sofa like a shot, DIVING for the entry hall.
text: FRICK turns and takes aim --
text: -- but before he can squeeze the trigger, DICK's come out of
text: nowhere to HIGH-KICK him in the face! The shot goes wild and
text: the two of them tumble into the Christmas tree, knocking it
dialog: over...
scene_heading: INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT
text: VICKI hits the floor of the entry hall. HUGE OAKEN SLIDING
text: DOORS are already slamming shut behind her. The same thing is
text: happening all down the hall -- the East wing of the house is
dialog: sealing itself off!
scene_heading: INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT
text: DICK CARTWHEELS across the carpet -- catching FRICK high on
text: the chest and RAMMING him backward, into the hearth. Before
text: FRICK can regain his balance, DICK's BEANED HIM across the
text: back of the skull with a fireplace poker.
text: He bends and picks up FRICK's gun -- which he tosses to
text: ALFRED, who's been watching all this with some fascination
text: from the sofa.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Here. You might need it.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Thank you, Master Dick. And...bravo.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT
text: VICKI has made it to the wall phone. She can't seem to get a
dialog: dial tone --
scene_heading: VOICE FROM BEHIND
dialog: Do you really think we're that stupid?
text: VICKI turns, and realizes to her horror that the VOICE is
speaker_heading: SELINA's.
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
dialog: I tawt I taw a puddy tat...!!
text: With that she raises a hand -- and her CLAWS pop out. VICKI
text: turns, grabs a carving knife from a wooden block -- but before
text: she can do anything with it, a WHIP cracks and wraps around
text: her wrist, jerking the knife loose. SELINA tugs on the other
text: end, reeling her closer.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: You know, I've got a great recipe for
dialog: Sliced Bitch --
text: VICKI lunges forward suddenly, causing the whip to slacken and
text: throwing SELINA off-balance into the center island. While
text: they're tangled up, VICKI grabs a MEAT CLEAVER and tries to
text: bring it down on SELINA, but SELINA rolls effortlessly out of
text: the way and returns the favor, SWIPING at VICKI with her
text: claws. VICKI brings a Calphalon skillet up just in time to
text: block the blow: CLANG.
text: VICKI sweeps her arm across the countertop, showering SELINA
text: with knives and appliances. It buys her enough time to make
text: for the door -- but SELINA comes flying after her. Another
text: downswipe with the claws -- but VICKI shoves a BUTCHER'S BLOCK
text: into SELINA's path, and her TALONS wedge a half-inch deep in
dialog: the wood.
text: VICKI rushes out while she's trying to pry herself loose.
scene_heading: INT. DINING HALL - A MOMENT LATER
text: SELINA enters but finds no trace of VICKI.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I love a good old-fashioned catfight --
dialog: but this is pissing me off.
text: VICKI charges out from behind a sideboard, pushing a WHEELED
text: COCKTAIL CART before her. It SLAMS full-force into SELINA,
text: who lands on her back on the great long dining table. VICKI
text: is in the doorway to the entry hall by the time she gets up.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRY HALL - STAIRWAY - A MOMENT LATER
text: VICKI races up the stairs. She has a good lead, but SELINA
text: makes up the difference in a hurry. She takes the stairway in
text: three giant bounds -- reaches the landing just as VICKI ducks
text: down the hall and into a bedroom, slamming the door behind her
text: and LOCKING IT.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: HERE, kitty kitty kitty...HERE, kitty
dialog: kitty...
text: She KICKS THE DOOR OPEN.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT
text: SELINA enters and strikes a coy pose as she shuts the door
text: behind her. VICKI has opened a pair of French doors leading
text: to a balcony, but it's too long a drop. She stands there
text: paralyzed as SELINA advances.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: So this is where you earn your keep.
text: She GRABS VICKI -- holds her out at arm's length and shoves
text: her roughly back onto the bed. VICKI flails wildly as SELINA
text: kneels atop her...
text: SELINA's CLAWS shred VICKI's blouse, revealing a frilly
dialog: section of bra --
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Mmm! Frederick's of Gotham?
text: She plants a talon against VICKI's sternum and RAKES IT
text: DOWNWARD, drawing a RED STRIPE on the exposed flesh of VICKI's
text: belly. Now VICKI just loses it. She begins to SHRIEK
text: uncontrollably.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Not so loud, honey! The neighbors'll get
dialog: the wrong idea.
dialog: <i>(laughing)</i>
dialog: Santa's coming. Time for all good girls
dialog: to go to sleep...
text: She raises her claw-hand and prepares to slash down at VICKI's
text: neck. But an instant before she can strike -- VICKI goes
text: wide-eyed and shuts up. A BLACK SHADOW falls across the
text: moonlit bed. SELINA tenses --
text: -- as a BLACK-GLOVED HAND grabs a fistful of her hair --
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Miss me, "Angel"?
text: He yanks her bodily off the bed. Before she knows what's
text: happening, he delivers a POWERHOUSE UPPERCUT. She flies into
text: the door and knocks it cleanly off its hinges.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY/STAIRCASE - A MOMENT LATER
text: BATMAN steps out after SELINA, who's only now picking herself
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Okay -- let's do it, huh? You and me...
dialog: all the way this time.
text: She HISSES and jumps him. They grapple -- a quick flurry of
text: fists -- and he knocks her ass-over-teakettle down the long
dialog: stairway.
text: She gets to her feet, limping, and darts around a corner.
text: BATMAN marches implacably down the stairs, taking his time...
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER
text: VICKI rushes out of the bedroom. She looks down the hall and
text: sees FRACK flying out of the guest room, UPSIDE DOWN --
text: slamming into the wall opposite. He slumps to the carpet, out
dialog: cold.
text: A moment later DICK strolls out. VICKI rushes to his side --
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Come on. We'll be safe in the cave.
scene_heading: INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY/ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER
text: BATMAN PAUSES outside the door to the armory, which is
text: slightly ajar. He pushes it in cautiously...
text: ...and a HALBERD smashes through the wood frame -- slicing
text: down mere inches from his face. It's the PENGUIN wielding the
text: ax; he backs off in seeming terror as BATMAN advances on him.
dialog: But then --
text: -- SELINA springs down from a perch above the doors -- landing
text: on his back -- and the two of them are going at it again.
text: It's a room full of exotic weaponry, and most of it gets a
text: good workout in the next thirty seconds.
text: BATMAN dodges a LANCE -- which embeds itself into the wall
text: behind him, QUIVERING -- and swings a MACE squarely into
text: SELINA's ribs. It's a crippling blow; she flies backward,
text: knocking over a suit of exotic armor -- which TOPPLES,
text: knocking over another -- and another --
text: -- until the various suits of armor have all fallen over,
text: domino-style -- the last of them landing squarely atop the
text: cowering PENGUIN.
text: SELINA is badly hurt now. She makes it out of a rear door to
text: the armory. BATMAN pauses to check on the PENGUIN -- he seems
text: to be out for the count -- and sets off in pursuit of SELINA.
text: SEVERAL MOMENTS PASS before the groaning PENGUIN comes around
dialog: enough to dig himself out.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER
text: As the PENGUIN stumbles around a corner, he peers into the
text: LIBRARY. VICKI is crouched by BRUCE's desk, reaching into a
text: bottom drawer. A hidden panel in the bookcase pops open...
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT
text: As she helps ALFRED into the secret passageway, VICKI turns to
speaker_heading: DICK:
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Come on. Come with us.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: No. I can still help...
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER
text: The PENGUIN flattens against the wall as DICK sprints out of
text: the library and heads off in the opposite direction. There's
text: a flabbergasted look on his face -- he recognizes this kid.
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - A MINUTE LATER
text: At the monitor bank, watching BATMAN's pursuit of SELINA, are
text: VICKI and ALFRED. They pivot suddenly at the sound of a
speaker_heading: VOICE:
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Such primitive entertainment.
text: He's holding a gun on the two of them. He stares about
text: delightedly, taking in the prehistoric splendor of the cave.
text: His eyes light up at the sight of the BATMOBILE, parked on its
dialog: little plateau.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN (cont.)
dialog: So Bruce equals Batman. It seems I've
dialog: discovered two treasures!
dialog: <i>(an evil smile)</i>
dialog: Don't move. I'd be only too happy to
dialog: shoot you both.
text: He pulls out his packet of photos and begins to scan the cave.
text: He spots the distinctive ROCK FORMATION in an upper vault of
text: the cavern. It's a couple of plateaus over; a long narrow
text: CATWALK runs past it, some ten or twelve feet below.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
text: The Gotham City Treasury. It's about to
dialog: be stolen twice.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Don't be absurd. You'll never be able to
dialog: get it out of here.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Oh, I'll manage somehow. You two are my
dialog: guarantee of that.
dialog: <i>(nudging VICKI with the gun)</i>
dialog: Let's have a look, shall we? You go
dialog: first.
text: He shoves her. She starts across the catwalk, his gun at her
dialog: head.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT
text: SELINA's made it back upstairs, but she's moving at quarter-
text: speed, favoring one leg and clutching her ribs as she lopes
text: down the hallway. She's just passed the balcony overlooking
text: the entry hall when BATMAN appears dead ahead in her path.
text: He's ready to rumble -- but instead of responding, she packs
text: it in. She stops, slumps against a wall and begins to laugh.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: It could've been so nice -- you and me --
dialog: if only you weren't so screwed up.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: It's over. I don't want to hurt you any
dialog: more.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Tell me something -- one thing. If you
dialog: don't enjoy all this...why do you do it?
text: He just looks at her. He doesn't have an especially good
text: answer. She sighs.
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
dialog: I'll never understand men.
text: She SPINS SUDDENLY, delivering a high-kick to BATMAN's throat.
text: As he reels backward, into a wall, she leaps up onto the
text: narrow BANNISTER RAILING some thirty feet above the entry hall
text: floor and goes into a CROUCH -- preparing to SPRING at the
text: enormous crystal CHANDELIER mounted to the ceiling --
text: -- but just as she launches off, BATMAN rolls -- and brings up
text: a GUN from his belt. He fires a RAZOR-SHARP DISK which sails
text: past her head, cleanly SLICING THROUGH the chain which
text: suspends the chandelier.
text: The chandelier FALLS just as CATWOMAN catches hold of it --
text: and she finds herself PLUMMETING to the floor of the entry
text: hall. On impact, the chandelier EXPLODES into a thousand
text: fragments; the CATWOMAN lands hard on her back and lies
text: sprawled in the midst of the wreckage, unmoving.
text: BATMAN advances slowly down the stairs. Her arms and legs jut
text: out at unnatural angles; she lets out an eerie, whimpering
text: YOWL OF PAIN -- a cri du chat. He stands over her; she glares
text: up at him.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Nine lives.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
text: I can't move. I can't move.
text: Her face is cut and bleeding. She tries to lift an arm and
text: can't quite manage it. He crouches down beside her, still
dialog: cautious...
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN (cont.)
dialog: DON'T LOOK AT ME!!
dialog: <i>(pleading)</i>
dialog: Do me, baby...do me now...that's what I
dialog: want. Please?
text: BATMAN looks up. DICK is standing on the balcony overlooking
text: them, highly curious as to what he'll do.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: No.
text: BATMAN slowly rises to his feet. She lets out another
text: gruesome WHINE.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: COME ON. Don't stop now. FINISH ME OFF.
dialog: <i>(almost weeping with pain)</i>
dialog: Son of a bitch. You're all alike...
text: Her STEEL CLAWS snick into place. With an agonizing effort
text: she lifts her forearm -- bends her wrist. She's trying to
text: slit her own throat.
text: He reaches for his belt, extracts a GLASSINE CAPSULE, and
text: breaks it open with his thumb. He drops it amid the shattered
text: glass around her face. A tiny cloud of GREEN GAS plumes out,
text: and her hand falls limply at her side as she lapses into
text: unconsciousness.
text: BATMAN stands over her for a minute as DICK marches down to
dialog: join him.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: You should've done it, man. You should've
dialog: killed her.
text: BATMAN gives him a long, hard look -- but says nothing.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: There's a radio in the cave. We'll send
dialog: for help.
scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER
text: The PENGUIN and VICKI are on a catwalk just below the ROCK
text: FORMATION. A STONE OUTCROPPING extends toward the catwalk,
text: and he forces her to JUMP FOR IT. Now he has to follow; the
text: prospect makes him nervous, but it's a short hop, and he
text: clears it okay -- finding his footing on the rocky slope.
text: They're cautiously making their way up toward the ROCK
text: FORMATION when BATMAN appears suddenly at the far end of the
text: catwalk -- sizes up the situation and FREEZES IN HIS TRACKS.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Ah, the illustrious Mr. Wayne. Look at
dialog: you now. Whatever would your friends say?
dialog: <i>(smiling)</i>
dialog: You've been an exceptionally congenial
dialog: host -- but I must ask you to back off.
text: The PENGUIN grabs hold of VICKI and HOLDS HER CLOSE as they
text: climb the last few feet toward the grotto. BATMAN swings his
text: cape around, concealing his hands from view. He takes a
text: cautious step backward.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - BATMAN'S HAND
text: His free hand closes around a BATARANG -- flicks it open.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI
text: They've pulled almost even with the rock formation. A LARGE
text: DANK GROTTO is visible through a small gap in the rocks.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
text: No sudden moves. It's a long way down.
text: Gun at her head, he peers into the grotto...
scene_heading: HIS POV - INSIDE THE GROTTO
text: A VAST FORTUNE in GOLD and SILVER BULLION, undisturbed in all
text: these years. GLINTING in the darkness. Hanging upside-down,
text: above it, like silent guardians, are BATS -- DOZENS of them --
text: their tiny wet red eyes GLIMMERING at the PENGUIN...
text: He dislodges a rock. It tumbles into the grotto...
text: ...and a startled BAT comes screeching out of the gap in the
text: rocks -- FLYING DIRECTLY AT HIS FACE.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI
text: He BACKS AWAY IN HORROR as the bat streaks past him. He FIRES
text: HIS GUN wildly. The SOUND OF IT rouses MORE BATS, and they
text: come flying out of the hole -- a VAST, CHITTERING SWARM.
text: VICKI SHRIEKS; the PENGUIN STUMBLES -- and the two of them
text: FALL BACK ONTO THE ROCKS, hanging on for dear life.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
speaker_heading: VICKI!
text: An instant later BATMAN lets fly with the BATARANG. Clean
text: hit; the PENGUIN staggers back, and his GUN skitters down
text: across the rocks.
text: With BATS screaming all around her, VICKI takes a deep breath
text: and VAULTS toward the CATWALK. She's a foot short; she grabs
text: hold of the railing and HANGS THERE, over the ABYSS, trying to
text: pull herself up. BATMAN races toward her --
text: -- but the PENGUIN, clambering down across the rocky
text: outcropping, has managed to grab hold of his GUN. The BATS
text: have begun to swirl up toward the higher recesses of the
text: cavern, and he's able to draw a clean bead on BATMAN.
text: THUNDEROUS ECHOES reverberate through the cave as the first
text: shot strikes BATMAN and knocks him backward. As the second
text: spins him around. As the third sends him TOPPLING OVER THE
text: RAILING.
text: VICKI screams. BATMAN manages to grab the rail with one hand.
text: Now two of them are hanging from the catwalk -- sitting ducks
text: -- and the PENGUIN is determined to empty the clip.
text: The ECHOES are cacophanous. ANCIENT STALACTITES drop from the
text: vaulted roof of the cavern, PLUMMETING DOWNWARD like deadly
text: projectiles, shattering agaist the cave floor. And then --
text: BATMAN pulls a tiny DEVICE from his utility belt and FLINGS
text: IT. It lands in the rocks at the PENGUIN's feet. He stares
text: down at it, and two beats later --
text: -- it begins to emit an EERIE ELECTRONIC WHINE. Within
text: moments, EVERY BAT IN THE CAVE is in a FRENZY -- HOMING IN ON
text: THE SIGNAL. The PENGUIN looks up sees them coming. A CHOKED
text: WAIL emits from his throat as he drops the gun and stands
text: there, PARALYZED.
text: He's just been beaten at his own game. He lets out a last
text: awful HOWL as HUNDREDS OF BATS ENGULF HIM --
text: -- and he PLUNGES DOWN INTO THE PIT -- his hideous scream
text: dwindling to a faint echo, then vanishing altogether...
text: BATMAN manages to drag himself up onto the catwalk. He rushes
text: over to VICKI, pulls her up, drapes his cape around her
text: protectively. Gradually, as the BATS recede to their distant
text: perches, he stands and helps VICKI to her feet. They embrace
text: on the edge of the abyss.
text: On the far plateau, DICK has hooked up with ALFRED. The
text: butler is slumped against a lab table, weary and exhausted,
text: clutching his wounded arm. DICK slings an arm around him and
text: helps him to the stairway.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT
text: SQUAD CARS everywhere. FRICK and FRACK emerge in handcuffs,
text: flanked by COPS. PARAMEDICS carry the still-unconscious
text: SELINA past on a stretcher and load her into the back of an
dialog: ambulance.
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY HALL - NIGHT
text: The place is an utter mess. Amid the carnage we find BRUCE
text: conferring with COMMISSIONER GORDON and LT. BULLOCK. In b.g.,
text: a POLICE DOCTOR is dressing ALFRED's gunshot wound.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: ...and then Batman showed up?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: He saved all our lives, Jim. I can't say
dialog: for sure, but I'd bet she's the one behind
dialog: the murders.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: God -- I pray you're right.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: One thing before we go, Bruce. Who's the
dialog: kid?
text: BRUCE looks into the front parlor, where VICKI and DICK are
text: righting the fallen Christmas tree.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Oh, that's Vicki's little cousin. He's in
dialog: town for the holidays.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Well, he picked a hell of a time to visit.
dialog: <i>(turning to go)</i>
dialog: Merry Christmas, Bruce. Good luck
dialog: cleaning this place up.
text: GORDON and BULLOCK file out, followed by the POLICE DOCTOR.
text: BRUCE smiles wearily to himself and strolls into the front
dialog: parlor.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT
text: ALFRED loads 'SILENT NIGHT' on the CD. VICKI ambles up to
speaker_heading: BRUCE:
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: What are you going to do with all that
dialog: gold?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I dunno. Might be a good start on a place
dialog: to live -- for some people who don't have
dialog: one.
text: She hugs him. DICK plugs in the Christmas-tree lights; they
text: blink to life just as the GRANDFATHER CLOCK strikes twelve.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: It's Christmas.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Yeah. Maybe you should -- open your
dialog: present.
text: She runs a hand along his cheek and laughs softly.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Oh, Bruce, presents doesn't matter. None
dialog: of it matters. We're all safe. We're
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: ...You might as well.
text: He digs around in his jacket pocket and produces a tiny GIFT
text: BOX, which he hands to VICKI. She unwraps it, opens it slowly
text: -- and sees a DIAMOND RING inside.
text: She gazes up at him, speechless. He gazes back.
text: CAMERA PULLS UP and away until we can see the whole of the
text: devastated room, and all the people in it -- VICKI, falling
text: into BRUCE's arms; DICK, off to one side, watching them;
text: ALFRED, tossing broken furniture into a roaring fireplace.
dialog: And on the image of this decidedly eccentric family unit, we
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: THE END
