scene_heading: INT - TOP CORRIDOR - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT - CONVENT - NIGHT
text: Lights in the windows flick on.
scene_heading: INT - TOP CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: The nuns are running up the corridor in their night dresses and caps,
text: calling urgently in French. They reach the door of Sister Agnes' room
text: and try the door. It is blocked. Pushing harder they see the blood
text: stained figure of SISTER AGNES. Much alarm and crying...
scene_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Agnes!... Agnes...
scene_heading: EXT - CONVENT - NIGHT
text: An ambulance comes tearing down the road, siren blaring. It cuts the

text: the ambulance drives inside.
scene_heading: INT - TOP CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: Two PARAMEDICS urgently run the stretcher down the hall to the

speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC
dialog: I'm just going to put something here to
dialog: stop the bleeding. Excuse me Sister.
dialog: She'll be fine.
text: They lift her on to the stretcher and run back down the hall.
text: The Mother Superior looks around worriedly and goes into...
scene_heading: INT - SISTER AGNES' ROOM - NIGHT
text: She kneels down by a waste paper basket full of bloodied sheets and

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT - SUPREME COURT - DAY
text: A normal busy day. A car pulls up with a woman and a man driving. The
text: woman is MARTHA LIVINGSTON. She kisses the man (LARRY), gets out of
text: the car, runs across the road dodgingtraffic and goes up the steps of
text: the courthouse. There a group of REPORTERS there and a sudden bustle
dialog: of interest.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Here they are now.
text: Martha watches intently as 3 nuns, the Mother Superior, Sister
text: Marguerite, and Sister Agnes (dressed in a white novices habit) and
text: their LAWYER come out of the court escorted by police. The reporters
text: leap on them, taking photographs, asking questions in English and
text: French. Suddenly Sister Agnes looks right at Martha, then she is
text: quickly bustled past. Martha goes on into the courthouse.
scene_heading: INT - JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - DAY
text: Inside EVE, LYON, and JUSTICE LEVEAU are sitting. Martha is standing
text: by the window smoking furiously.
speaker_heading: LEVEAU
dialog: Martha, it's you.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What about Roger? He's free.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: They want a woman.
speaker_heading: LYON
dialog: All you have to do is meet with her
dialog: once or twice... then tell the court
dialog: she's insane.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Are you dictating my position to me?
dialog: We're getting into some sticky legal
dialog: territories here.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants
dialog: this to come to trial, not the Church, not
dialog: the Crown... least of all me.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Eve, she strangled a baby!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Nobody is interested in sending a nun
dialog: to prison.
speaker_heading: LEVEAU
dialog: We're not telling you what to decide
dialog: Martha. We're not even telling you to
dialog: take this.
speaker_heading: LYON
dialog: Is there any reason why you feel you
dialog: shouldn't take it?
text: Martha pauses for a long moment at the window, then turns.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Today's my birthday. I always make
dialog: bad decisions on my birthday.
text: The Judge, Eve and Lyon all chuckle. The Judge throws the file down
text: on his desk towards her.
speaker_heading: LEVEAU
dialog: Happy birthday.
scene_heading: 15 INT - MARTHA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Martha unlocks the door and comes in. She plays her

speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Hi, Kitty.
text: The answerphone whirs...
speaker_heading: SECRETARY (V.O.)
dialog: Hi, it's Helen, calling to tell you
dialog: that Mrs Davenport phoned to confirm
dialog: her appointment at nine o'clock
dialog: tomorrow, okay? Bye bye.
text: Some whirs and clicks.
speaker_heading: ROGER (V.O.)
dialog: Hi Martha, it's Roger. Can you call

speaker_heading: SECRETARY (V.O.)
dialog: Hi, Marty it's Helen again. I cancelled

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 16 EXT - CONVENT - DAY
text: Martha pulls up in her BMW outside the convent walls and gets
dialog: out, cigarette
text: in hand. A sign tangled over with creeper reads "Les Petites
text: Soeurs de Marie Madeleine". Martha jangles a bell. After a wait she
text: presses a buzzer. A peephole in the door slams open and Sister
text: Marguerite looks out.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Bonjour, I'm Doctor Martha
dialog: Livingston, I...
text: The peephole slams shut, but the door does open. Sister
text: Marguerite glares at her.
speaker_heading: MARTHA (Cont.)
dialog: Hello... I'm Doctor Martha
dialog: Living...ston... I...
text: Martha realizes it is the cigarette that is causing the
dialog: trouble
text: and hastily grinds it underfoot.
speaker_heading: MARTHA (Cont.)
dialog: Excuse me... I'm...
text: Sister Marguerite eyes flick down at cigarette butt. Martha
dialog: awkwardly tries
dialog: to kick it away.
speaker_heading: MARTHA (Cont.)
dialog: ...the court-appointed psychiatrist.
text: Sister Marguerite gives a frosty imitation of a smile and
text: motions for her to come in.
speaker_heading: MARTHA (Cont.)
dialog: Thank you. I um... I believe your
dialog: Mother Superior's expecting me.
text: Martha and the Sister walk up the drive to the convent.
scene_heading: 17 INT - WAITING ROOM - DAY
text: Martha follows Sister Marguerite into a grilled waiting room.
text: Sister moves off, leaving Martha looking around curiously. Then
text: the MOTHER MIRIAM arrives from behind the grilled door, sees
text: Martha, sighs exasperatedly and enters giving Martha a slight
dialog: start.
scene_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
text: (beaming at her own
dialog: little joke)
dialog: Doctor Livingston I presume? I'm
dialog: Mother Miriam Ruth. You needn't call
dialog: Mother if you don't wish.
dialog: (shaking hands)
dialog: Most people find it uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Well... I...
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: (carrying right on)
dialog: I'm afraid the word brings up the most
dialog: unpleasant connatations in this day and
dialog: age...
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Yes... I...
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: You can call me Sister.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: ... Thank you.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: You must have tons of questions. You
dialog: may smoke if you want to. Just don't
dialog: tell any of the Sisters.
text: Martha sits; Mother Miriam gets her a box of matches.
speaker_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM (Cont.)
dialog: They wouldn't understand, especially
dialog: Sister Marguerite. She'd scare the pants
dialog: off Queen Elizabeth.
dialog: (she lights Martha's cigarette)
dialog: Besides, I miss them.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: You were a smoker?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
text: Two packs a day.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I can beat that.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
text: Unfiltered.
text: Martha inclines her head impressed. Mother Miriam sits down
text: next to her.
speaker_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM (Cont.)
dialog: Well, you have questions.
dialog: (checks her watch)
dialog: Fire away...
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: No-one.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: How did she hide it from the other nuns?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
text: She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Is that normal?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: How did she hide it during the day?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: (indicating her habit)
text: She could have hidden a machine gun in
dialog: here if she had wanted to.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Didn't she have any physical examinations
dialog: in this time?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy
text: fell in between the doctor's visits.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Who was the father?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: I haven't a clue.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What man had access to her?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: None as far as I know.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Was there a priest?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Yes, but I...
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What's his name?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Father Martineau, but I don't see him
dialog: as a candidate.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Could there have been anyone else?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: Obviously there was.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: And you didn't try to find out who?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: (standing)
dialog: Believe me, I've done everything possible
text: short of asking Agnes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Why haven't you asked her?
text: Mother Miriam removes a tray from under a pot plant and
dialog: brings
dialog: it back to
dialog: use as an ashtray.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: (sitting again)
dialog: She can't even remember the birth. Do
dialog: you think she'd admit to the conception?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Look, someone gave her the baby.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Yes, but that was some ten months ago.
dialog: I fail to see that the identity of that
dialog: somebody has anything to do with this
dialog: trial.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Why do you think that?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Don't ask me those questions dear,
dialog: I'm not the patient.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's
dialog: going to decide what is, or is not
dialog: important here.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you
dialog: this politely, but I don't approve of you.
dialog: Not you personally...
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: The science of psychiatry.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: (standing)
dialog: Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes
text: as speedily and as easily as possible.
dialog: She won't hold up under any sort of cross
dialog: examination.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (also standing)
dialog: I am not with the Inquisition.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: And I am not from the Middle Ages. I
dialog: know what you are! I don't want that
text: mind cut open.
text: Then Mother Miriam walks out.
scene_heading: 18 INT - WAITING ROOM - DAY
text: A little later, Martha is sitting alone smoking. SISTER ANNE
text: enters and indicates that Martha should follow her. They exit out of
text: the grilled room
text: and head up a steep flight of wooden stairs. Faintly the
dialog: voice
dialog: of a single
text: young woman can be heard singing in Latin.
scene_heading: 19 INT - TOP CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Martha follows Sister Anne down the hall towards the singing.
text: They stop outside Agnes' room. Martha looks to see...
scene_heading: 20 INT - AGNES' ROOM - DAY
text: ... Agnes an almost childlike young woman singing happily,
dialog: looking out the
text: window. Then Agnes hears a slight sound and stops abruptly.
dialog: She
text: turns to see
text: Martha standing in the doorway.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been
dialog: asked to talk to you. May I?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Yes.
text: Martha moves further in the room. An ELDERLY NUN hovers
dialog: outside
text: the door.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: You have a lovely voice.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: No I don't.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I just heard you.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: That wasn't me.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Was it Sister Marguerite?
text: Agnes laughs and Martha closes the door, shutting out the old
dialog: nun.
speaker_heading: MARTHA (Cont.)
dialog: You're very pretty Agnes.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: No I'm not.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Let's talk about something else.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What would you like to talk about.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Anything... may I sit down?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Yes.
text: They both sit.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: First thing that comes to your mind?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: God! But there's nothing to say about
dialog: God.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Second thing that comes to your mind.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Love.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Have you ever loved anyone?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Everyone.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Well, who in particular?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Right now?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: Agnes, have you ever loved another
dialog: man... other than, Jesus Christ?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: (chuckles)
dialog: Oh, there are so many.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Well do you love... do you love
dialog: Father Martineau?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Oh, yes!
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Do you think he loves you?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Oh, I know he does.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: He's told you?
speaker_heading: AGNES
text: No. But... when I look into his eyes,
dialog: I can tell.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: You've been alone together?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Often?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: At least once a week.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: And you like that?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Oh, yes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Where do you meet?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: (obviously)
text: In the confessional.
text: A slightly awkward pause.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Agnes, do ever see Father Martineau
dialog: outside the...
text: Agnes suddenly looks exasperated.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: You want to talk about the baby
dialog: don't you?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Would you like to talk about it?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I never saw any baby... I think they
dialog: made it up.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Why should they?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Do you remember the night they said
dialog: it came?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: No. I was sick.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: How were you sick?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Something I ate.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Did it hurt?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Down... there.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: And what did you do?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I went to my room.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: And what happened?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I got sicker.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: And then what?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I fell asleep.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: In the middle of all the pain?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Where did the baby come from?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: What baby?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
text: The baby they made up.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: From their heads...
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Is that where they say it came
dialog: from... ?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: No, they say it came from the waste
dialog: paper basket!
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Where'd it come from before that?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: From God.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: After God... before the waste-paper
dialog: basket.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I... I don't understand.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Agnes, how are babies born?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Don't you know?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Yes I do, but I want you to...
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: (very agitated)
dialog: I don't understand what you're
dialog: talking about... you want to talk
dialog: about the baby... everybody wants
dialog: to talk about the baby but... I
dialog: never saw the baby so I can't talk
dialog: about the baby because... I don't
dialog: believe in the baby.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Then let's talk about something else...
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: (standing)
dialog: No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been
dialog: talking for weeks, nobody believes me
dialog: when I tell them anything... nobody
dialog: listens to me.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (also standing)
dialog: Agnes...
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: (opens the door)
dialog: No... no, I don't want to answer any
dialog: more questions.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Would you like to ask them?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: (pausing in the doorway)
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Anything?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Anything.
scene_heading: 21 INT - NUN'S ROOM - DAY
text: The elderly nun looks out the window into the courtyard where
text: Martha and Agnes are walking, then pulls the curtain across.
scene_heading: 22 EXT - COURTYARD - DAY
text: Martha and Agnes are walking together. Martha is smoking.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: What's your real name?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Martha Louise Livingston.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Are you married?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Would you like to be?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Not at the moment, no.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Do you have any children?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Would you like some?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I can't have them any more.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: I've stopped menstruating
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Why do you smoke?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Does it bother you?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: No questions.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Smoking is an obsession with me.
dialog: Maybe one day I'll become obsessed
dialog: with something else, then I'll stop
dialog: smoking... Do you have any more
dialog: questions?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: One.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What?
text: They both halt.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Where do you think babies come from?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: From their mothers and fathers of
dialog: course. Before that, I... I don't
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Well I think they come from... angel
text: lights on their mothers chest and
text: whispers into her ear. That makes good
dialog: babies start to grow. And bad babies
text: come from when a fallen angel squeezes
text: in down there, and they start to grow,
dialog: grow, till they come out down there.
dialog: I don't know where good babies come out.
dialog: And you can't tell the difference...
dialog: except bad babies cry a lot... and they
dialog: make their fathers go away... and their
dialog: mothers get very ill... die sometimes.
text: Agnes sits down on a bench and Martha follows her.
speaker_heading: AGNES (Cont.)
dialog: Mummy wasn't very happy when she died
dialog: ... and, I think she went to hell because
dialog: every time I see her she looks like she
dialog: just stepped out of a hot shower, and I...
dialog: I'm never sure if it's her, or the Lady who
dialog: tells me things! They fight over me all
dialog: the time.
dialog: (staring into space)
dialog: The Lady... I saw when I was ten. I was
text: lying on the grass, looking at the sun, and
text: the sun became a cloud, and the cloud
dialog: became, a Lady. And she told me she would
dialog: talk to me. And then... her feet began to
dialog: bleed and I saw there... there were holes
text: in her hands and in her side. And I tried to
text: catch the blood as it fell from the sky, but
text: I couldn't see any more because my eyes
text: hurt because there were big black spots in
dialog: front of them. And she tells me things like,
dialog: like... right now she's crying Marie! Marie!
dialog: ... but I don't know what that means.
text: Martha stands up, disturbed. Agnes is slightly delirious with
dialog: happiness.
speaker_heading: AGNES (Cont.)
dialog: ... and... she uses me to sing, it's as
text: if she's throwing a big hook through
text: the air and it catches me under my ribs
text: and tries to pull me up, and I... I can't
text: move because Mommy's holding my feet
dialog: and all I can do is sing in her voice...
dialog: it's the Lady's voice, God loves you!
text: And her cry echoes all around and the doves fly out of the
dialog: bell
dialog: tower.
speaker_heading: AGNES (Cont.)
dialog: (to Martha)
dialog: God loves you.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Do you know a Marie?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: No... do you?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Why should I?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I don't know.
scene_heading: 23 INT - MOTHER MIRIAM'S STUDY - DAY
text: Mother Miriam is standing checking some papers when Martha
text: enters. Mother Miriam seems to have entirely regained her good
dialog: humour.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Well... what do you think? Is she
dialog: totally bananas or merely slightly
dialog: off centre... or maybe she's perfectly
dialog: sane and just a very good liar.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What's your opinion?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: I believe Agnes is different.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: From other nuns...
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Yes I... I've noticed.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: From other people!
dialog: (moving across the room)
dialog: I believe she is not crazy, nor is she
dialog: lying.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: How could she have a baby and know
dialog: nothing of sex or birth?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Because she's an innocent. She's a slate
dialog: that's hasn't been touched except by God.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (lights a cigarette)
dialog: That's ridiculous...
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
text: (moves to her desk,
dialog: starts writing)
dialog: In her case it isn't. She's had very little
dialog: schooling. Her mother kept her home
dialog: almost all the time and when her mother
dialog: died Agnes came here, to us. She's never
dialog: been out there Doctor. She's never seen a
dialog: movie or a television show. She's never
dialog: even read a book.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: If she's so innocent, how come she
dialog: murdered a child?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: She didn't! This is manslaughter, not
dialog: murder. She didn't consciously kill that
text: baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was
text: unconscious by the time we got to her.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: So, someone else could have done it.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: No... not in the eyes of the police.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: And in your eyes?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: I've already told you what I thought.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: That she was unconscious, yes! So
dialog: someone easily could have come in
dialog: the room and killed the...
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: You don't really believe something like
dialog: that happened do you?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: It's possible isn't it?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
text: One of the other nuns found out about
dialog: the baby and... and wanted to avoid a
dialog: scandal.
text: Mother Miriam removes the tray from under a pot plant and
dialog: bangs
text: it down in front of Martha to act as an ashtray.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: That's absurd!
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: That possibility never occurred to
dialog: you?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: No-one knew about Agnes' pregnancy.
dialog: No-one. Not even Agnes.
scene_heading: 24 EXT - CONVENT - DAY
text: Martha's car exits out of the convent and heads up the road.
scene_heading: 25 INT - CAR - DAY
text: The car radio is playing light band music...
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: You have been listening to Mostly Music
dialog: from Montreal. This is CBC Radio.
dialog: (and again in French)
text: Martha flicks the radio off and stops the car. She thinks for
dialog: a
dialog: moment
dialog: then...
scene_heading: 26 EXT - LONELY ROAD - DAY
text: ... she turns the car around and heads back in the direction
dialog: she came.
scene_heading: 27 EXT - PRESBYTERY - DAY

scene_heading: 28 INT - PRESBYTERY - DAY

dialog: Is Father Martineau in please?
speaker_heading: HOUSEKEEPER
dialog: (in French)
dialog: ???
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (answers in French)
dialog: ???
text: The housekeeper indicates she should enter and walks back
text: inside.
speaker_heading: HOUSEKEEPER
dialog: (halting briefly)
dialog: Wipe your feet.
text: They move into the next room. The housekeeper goes further
dialog: calling...
speaker_heading: HOUSEKEEPER
dialog: Pere Martineau...
dialog: (in French)
dialog: ???
text: Martha stands uncertainly at the doorway. The sound of
text: thumping
dialog: is heard,
text: and then the figure of a very old priest, FATHER MARTINEAU
dialog: appears walking
text: with a stick.
scene_heading: 29 INT - PRESBYTERY DINING ROOM - DAY
text: Father Martineau and Martha are having tea. He pours a slug
dialog: of
text: whisky from a flask into her cup and an even larger slug into his
dialog: own.
scene_heading: FATHER MARTINEAU
dialog: (French accent)
text: They arise at five in the morning... and
text: they're in bed by nine at night. Even if a
dialog: man could get to them, he would probably
dialog: find them praying. That's why I see that
dialog: the real question is not only how he got in,
dialog: but when.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: And you're the only man to see them?
scene_heading: FATHER MARTINEAU
dialog: I promise you Doctor, even if I had the
dialog: inclination, how could I possibly catch
dialog: her? She would have to be a very slow
dialog: and patient nun.
dialog: (they both laugh)
dialog: Ah no... they're a very special and rare
dialog: people those Sisters. Only a few of them
dialog: left in this modern world, consecrated to
dialog: the praise of God.
scene_heading: 30 INT - NURSING HOME, LOUNGE - DAY
text: An elderly WOMAN is sitting watching "Spiderman" on TV
dialog: cackling
text: with laughter. She is physically alright, but quite senile. Martha
dialog: enters, goes
text: over to her and kisses her.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Hello, Mama
dialog: (pulls up a chair)
dialog: ... brought you something.
speaker_heading: MAMA
dialog: Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: It's your favourite...
speaker_heading: MAMA
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: It's Martha, Mama.
text: (hands over a tub
dialog: of icecream)
dialog: There you go.
speaker_heading: MAMA
dialog: Marie brings me icecream too you
dialog: know. Chocolate... my favourite.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I thought cherry-vanilla was your
dialog: favourite.
speaker_heading: MAMA
dialog: Not any more... now I like chocolate.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (stroking her hair)
dialog: Did you have a good week Mama. Are
dialog: they treating you all right?
speaker_heading: MAMA
dialog: You know Martha never comes to see me.
dialog: You watch it, she's going straight to
dialog: hell... after all the things she said to
dialog: me. Then she marries that son of a bitch
dialog: of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I
dialog: knew that one wouldn't work out. Not
dialog: like you Marie. You got married to God.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (lighting up)
dialog: Marie's dead Mama.
speaker_heading: MAMA
dialog: I remember when you was a little girl
dialog: Marie. You come back from the movies
dialog: and you'd say - Mama that ending was so
dialog: sad... and I'd tell you they had all the
text: happy endings locked away in a vault in
dialog: Hollywood.
dialog: (chuckles)
dialog: And you believed me.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
speaker_heading: MAMA
dialog: (a long pause)
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I... I'm Martha, Mama.
scene_heading: 31 EXT - CONVENT, CHICKENYARD - DAY
text: It is raining... distant thunder in the background. Martha is
dialog: standing under
text: an umbrella talking to Sister Anne who is feeding the
dialog: chickens.
speaker_heading: SISTER ANNE
dialog: The convent was built for over fifty.
dialog: Not many of us left... just us and
dialog: the chickens.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: How do you survive?
speaker_heading: SISTER ANNE
dialog: Oh, we own the land around here.
dialog: But we rent it out. We keep a few
dialog: acres for ourselves,
dialog: (indicating)
dialog: some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Well that's a lot of land. You must have
dialog: help. Do you have field hands that help
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: SISTER ANNE
dialog: No. We work the land alone. No-one but
dialog: Sister Marguerite and I are permitted
dialog: contact with the public.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
text: Sister Anne points up to a window on the corner of the
dialog: convent.
speaker_heading: SISTER ANNE
dialog: Oh that one there, in the corner.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: The one up on the third floor?
speaker_heading: SISTER ANNE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Uh huh.
scene_heading: 32 INT - AGNES' OLD ROOM - DAY
text: Mother Miriam unlocks a padlock on the door, opens it for
text: Martha. They both enter the room which is totally plain,
dialog: stripped
dialog: of everything.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
text: This convent is locked solid. The only
dialog: one that has a key is Sister Marguerite
dialog: and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Well, it's been known to happen in the
dialog: day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Oh come on, you've talked to her. She
dialog: doesn't even know how babies are born,
dialog: let alone made.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: When did you first learn about her...
dialog: innocence, the way she thinks?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Shortly after she came to us.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: And you weren't shocked?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: I was appalled, just as you are now.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: And what happened?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: She stopped eating completely...
scene_heading: 33 INT - CHAPEL - DAY
text: In flashback: Agnes, all in white is lying face down in the
dialog: sign of the
text: cross in front of the altar. Mother Miriam enters.
speaker_heading: MARTHA (V.O.)
dialog: This was before her pregnancy?
speaker_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM (V.O.)
dialog: About two years before.
text: Mother Miriam stops in front of Agnes.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Agnes, it has come to my attention
dialog: that you have stopped eating. Why
dialog: is this?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: (not looking up)
dialog: I've been commanded by God.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: He talked to you Himself?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: No.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Through someone else?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I can't say.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: She'd punish me.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: One of the other Sisters?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: No.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Who?
text: Mother Miriam glances up at an older NUN who has been in the
text: chapel watching all along. She takes the hint and hobbles out.
speaker_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM (Cont.)
dialog: Why would she tell you to do this?
dialog: ... Agnes look at me.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: Because I'm getting fat.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Oh, for Heaven's sake.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I am, there's too much flesh on me.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Agnes...
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I'm a blimp.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Why does it matter whether you're fat
dialog: or not...
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Because...
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: ... You needn't worry about being
dialog: attractive here.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I do, I have to be attractive to God.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: He loves you the way you are.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Who told you this?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: It's a sin to be fat.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: AGNES
text: Look at the statues, they're thin.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Agnes...
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: That's because they're suffering...
dialog: suffering is beautiful, I want to be
dialog: beautiful.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Who tells you these things?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Christ said it in the Bible, he said -
dialog: suffer the little children, I want to
dialog: suffer like a little child.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: (genuinely distressed)
dialog: That's not what he meant.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I... I am a little child but my body
dialog: keeps getting bigger and soon I... I
dialog: won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be
dialog: able to squeeze into Heaven.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
text: Agnes gets to her knees and pushes up her breasts.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: No... I mean... I mean look at these.
dialog: I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Oh my dear child.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: (standing)
dialog: God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll
dialog: blow me up, that's what she said...
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every
dialog: day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay
dialog: little it won't happen.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Your mother tells you this?... Agnes
dialog: your mother is dead.
speaker_heading: AGNES
text: But she watches... she listens.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I
dialog: want you to eat.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I'm not hungry.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: You've got to eat something Agnes.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: No I don't... the host is enough.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: My dear, I don't think a communion wafer
dialog: has the recommended daily allowance of
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Of God.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Yes, of God.
text: Then Mother Miriam looks down and is shocked to see Agnes'
text: white habit is spotted with blood, and more blood is dripping onto
text: the floor. She pulls out Agnes' hand from her habit and gasps with
text: shock; there is a bleeding hole in
text: the middle of her palm.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I'm being punished.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I don't know.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Dear Jesus...
text: She quickly leads Agnes out of the chapel.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: It started this morning and I can't
dialog: get it to stop.
scene_heading: 34 INT - AGNES' OLD ROOM - DAY
dialog: Back in the present, as before...
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: It was healed by the following morning
dialog: and she started eating again...
speaker_heading: MARTHA
text: She had a... a hole in the palm of her
dialog: hand! She could have bled to death.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: But she didn't... did she. If anyone had
dialog: seen what I'd seen she'd be public
dialog: property... newspapermen, psychiatrists,
text: ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: She has it now.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: I know what you're thinking, she's a
text: hysteric pure and simple.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Not simple, no.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
text: I saw it. Clean through the palm of
dialog: her hand. Do you think hysteria could
dialog: do that?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: It's being doing it for centuries. She's
dialog: not unique, she's just another victim.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: God's victim. That's her innocence.
dialog: She belongs to God.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: And I intend to take her away from Him.
dialog: That's what you're afraid of isn't it?
text: Martha walks out. Mother Miriam yanks the padlock out of the
dialog: door.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: You bet I am.
scene_heading: 35 INT - CHAPEL - DAY
text: All the Sisters are present. Mother Miriam leads the chant in
text: Latin and the rest of the nuns respond at intervals. Agnes is very
text: happy. Their singing continues over, until the end of scene 41.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 36 EXT - POLICE PRECINCT - DAY
text: Martha and Larry are at the top of steps. He hands her an
dialog: envelope.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Here you are. Don't let anyone know
dialog: where you got them.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (kissing him)
dialog: Thanks...
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

text: Agnes is happily swinging on a long swing attached to a tree.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 38 INT - CRYPT - DAY
text: The Sisters go about their tasks. Then all together they move
text: to a corner of the room which is laid out with burning candles and
dialog: make their devotions.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 39 INT - CONFESSIONAL - DAY
text: Agnes is confessing to a rather disinterested Father
dialog: Martineau.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Last Tuesday, I didn't eat all of my
dialog: lima beans... hid them under my
dialog: spoon.
scene_heading: FATHER MARTINEAU
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: (very quietly)
dialog: I thought... thoughts... about...
scene_heading: FATHER MARTINEAU
dialog: Speak up, I can hardly hear you.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: (very loudly)
dialog: I thought ugly thoughts about Sister
dialog: Marguerite.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 40 INT - MARTHA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Martha is leafing through a sheaf of police photographs of

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 41 EXT - CONVENT FARM - DAY
text: Agnes is milking the cow. She pours the milk into a large

scene_heading: 42 INT - JUDGE'S OFFICE - DAY
text: The same four are in a meeting. This time they are all
dialog: sitting
dialog: except for
text: Lyon who is standing by the window.
speaker_heading: LEVEAU
dialog: Would you tell me why the hell this
dialog: is taking so long.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Look there are a lot of unanswered
dialog: questions here.
speaker_heading: LYON
dialog: Martha, your job is to diagnose, not to
dialog: heal and play detective. Who do you
dialog: think you are?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I know my job. Don't tell me my job Lyon.
dialog: My duty as a doctor is to...
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Martha, you have to make a decision on
dialog: her sanity as quickly as possible and not
dialog: interfere with due process of law.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as
dialog: I see fit.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: The longer you take to make a decision,
dialog: the more difficult it will be for us.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: EVE
text: The bishop is breathing down our necks.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: And the sooner she goes to prison, the
dialog: better off she'll be?
speaker_heading: LEVEAU
dialog: (in French)
dialog: ???
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I don't believe this. I don't bloody
dialog: believe this.
speaker_heading: LYON
dialog: Well the bishop will be very upset
dialog: about this.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I'm fighting for this woman's life, not
dialog: some bloody bishop.
scene_heading: 43 EXT - CONVENT GRAVEYARD - DAY
text: It is a strange place; all the crosses are identical and very
dialog: simple. Martha
text: is standing. Agnes is kneeling in front of a cross marked
dialog: with
dialog: the name
dialog: "Soeur Marie Paul" and the dates she was born, consecrated
dialog: and
dialog: died. Agnes
text: places some winter flowers on the grave.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: You liked Sister Paul?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: She was kind to me. She told me
dialog: I was beautiful.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (crouching down)
dialog: What else did she tell you?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: She said all of God's angels would
dialog: want to sleep beside me if they could.
dialog: I liked that.
text: Agnes makes the sign of the cross, they both stand and start
dialog: to
dialog: move off.
speaker_heading: AGNES (Cont.)
dialog: She lived here for almost seventy
dialog: years. Every day she'd ring the bell,
dialog: wake us up, call us to God. She took
dialog: me to my secret place.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Where's that?... I promise I won't tell,
dialog: would you take me?
text: So Agnes takes her.
scene_heading: 44 INT - BELL TOWER - DAY
text: Martha and Agnes enter the bell-tower. Agnes leads the way up
text: the steep wooden steps. Martha becomes breathless almost
dialog: immediately.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Sister Paul was in her eighties? Did
dialog: she climb up here often?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: No, only when she felt like it. She
dialog: brought me up here last winter and
dialog: the next day she died.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (halting, out of breath)
dialog: No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes
dialog: how do you feel about babies?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll
dialog: drop them. They have a soft spot on
dialog: their heads and if you drop them so
text: they land on their heads they become
dialog: stupid. I was dropped on my head,
dialog: that's why I don't understand things.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: (climbing again)
dialog: Numbers... you can spend your whole
dialog: life counting and never reach the end.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (following her)
dialog: I don't understand them either. Do
dialog: you suppose I was dropped on my head?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be
dialog: dropped on your head.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Oh, I've got to give up smoking. Agnes
text: ... wait a minute... Agnes slow down.
scene_heading: 45 EXT - TOP OF BELLTOWER - DAY
text: Agnes climbs up through the trapdoor to the bell platform.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: She said you could see the whole
dialog: world from up here. But it looks
text: much better far away than it looks
text: close up.
text: Martha arrives exhausted.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Beautiful...
text: Agnes lies down under the bell.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: And sometimes I get under here...
text: it makes a wonderful sound.
text: She starts to sing in a beautiful voice and the sound rings
dialog: in
dialog: the bell.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What happens if the bell rings and
dialog: you're under there?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
text: Agnes sings a little more.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: It's like hiding from my mother when
dialog: I was a little girl.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Where did you go?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Oh, no place as wonderful as this.
dialog: Agnes... have you ever thought of
dialog: leaving the convent for something
dialog: else?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: No. There is nothing else. Just being
dialog: here at night helps me sleep.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: You have trouble sleeping?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I get headaches. Mommy did too...
dialog: oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew
dialog: things that nobody else knew.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What things?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: She knew what was going to happen
dialog: to me. That's why she hid me away.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: How did she know that?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Somebody told her.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Agnes...
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: You'll laugh.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I promise I won't laugh. Who told
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: An angel, when she was having one
text: of her headaches.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Did your mother see angels often?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Do you believe she really saw them?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: (sitting up)
dialog: No, but I can never tell her that.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Why not?
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: Mmm?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: She'd get angry.
text: Martha moves round close to Agnes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Agnes, did you love your mother?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Did you ever want to be a mother
dialog: yourself?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I could never be a mother.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Well I don't think I'm old enough and
dialog: besides I don't want to have a baby.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Because I don't want one.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: If you did want one, how'd you go
dialog: about getting one?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: From someone who didn't want to
dialog: have a baby.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Like you?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: (suddenly frustrated)
dialog: No, not like me!
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: How would that person get one if
dialog: they didn't want one?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: (jumping to her feet)
dialog: A mistake...
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Agnes, how did your mother get you?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: A mistake... it was a mistake...
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Is that what she said?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: (very upset)
dialog: If you're trying to get me to say that
dialog: she was a bad woman and hated me and
dialog: didn't want me but that's not true, she
dialog: was a good woman, a saint...
dialog: (distorted)
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing
dialog: about sex...
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I can't help it if I'm stupid.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: ... that you don't remember getting
dialog: pregnant...
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Not my fault.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: ... and that you don't believe you
text: carried a child.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I was a mistake.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What the child?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Everything... I don't have children.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Agnes...
text: Martha puts her arm out to Agnes who slaps it away.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Don't touch me like that! You don't
dialog: touch me like that, I know what you
dialog: want from me, you want to take God
dialog: away. You should be ashamed, they
dialog: should lock you up people like you.
text: Agnes disappears down through the trapdoor. Martha throws her
text: cigarette away.
scene_heading: 46 INT - CONVENT - DAY
text: Mother Miriam is comforting a tearful Agnes. She sees Martha
text: coming across the courtyard and pushes Agnes gently away.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: You hate us don't you?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Nuns... you hate nuns.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I hate ignorance and stupidity.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: The Catholic Church...
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I haven't said anything against the
dialog: the Catholic Church.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Catholicism is not on trial here. I
dialog: want you to deal with Agnes without
dialog: any religious prejudice or you turn
dialog: this case over to someone else...
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: How dare you tell me to run my affairs!
text: Mother Miriam starts to walk away, Martha angrily follows
dialog: her.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: It's my affair too.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: How dare you think I'm in a position
dialog: to be pressured...
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: I'm only interested...
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: ... or bullied or what ever you're doing.
dialog: Who the hell do you think you are? You
dialog: go around here expecting applause for
dialog: the way you treated this child.
text: Martha and Mother Miriam are climbing the stairs. They pause
dialog: briefly.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
text: She is not a child.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: And she has a right to know that there's
text: a world out there filled with people who
dialog: don't believe in God...
dialog: (Mother Miriams walks on)
dialog: ... and aren't any worse off than you
dialog: Mother. People who've gone through
dialog: their entire lives without bending their
dialog: knees once, to anybody. And people who
dialog: fall in love and have babies and occas-
dialog: sionally are very happy. She has a right to
dialog: know that. But you and your... your order
dialog: and your Church have kept her ignorant...
text: They reach Mother Miriam's study.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: ??? (distorted)
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: ??? (distorted)
dialog: ... virginity, right Mother? Poverty,
dialog: chastity and ignorance is what you
dialog: live by.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married
dialog: for twenty three years, two daughters.
dialog: I even have grandchildren... surprised?
dialog: It might please you to know that I was a
dialog: failure as a wife and mother. My children
dialog: won't even see me any more, that's their
dialog: revenge. I think they tell their friends
dialog: that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm
dialog: making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud.
dialog: (she sits)
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Then help her.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: I am...

scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: What good would it do. No matter what
dialog: you decide it's either the... the prison
dialog: or the nut house and the differences
text: between them are pretty thin.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: There's another choice.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Aquittal.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Innocence. Legal innocence. I know

speaker_heading: MARTHA

speaker_heading: MARTHA

scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM

speaker_heading: MARTHA

scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Take at look at it.
text: Mother Miriam moves to her desk and opens the day book.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM

speaker_heading: MARTHA

scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM

dialog: Oh, Dear God...
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What is it?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: The sheets...
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What sheets?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed...
scene_heading: 48 INT - CONVENT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: In flashback: the sisters are sitting around the table at
text: dinner. SISTER GENEVIEVE, the other novice is serving them. Mother
text: Miriam folds up a linen towel.
speaker_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM (V.O.)
dialog: ... I should have suspected something.
text: In flashback, Mother Miriam addresses Agnes.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Sister Marguerite says you have been
text: sleeping on a bare mattress Sister.
dialog: Is that true?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Yes Mother.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: In the medieval days the nuns and monks
dialog: would sleep in their own coffins.
text: Sister Marguerite gives a snort of derision. Mother Miriam
text: glances sharply
text: at her, then turns back to Agnes.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: It made them holy.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: It made them uncomfortable. And if
dialog: they didn't sleep well I'm certain the
text: next day they were cranky as mules.
dialog: Sister where are your sheets?
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: Do you really believe that sleeping on
dialog: a bare mattress is the equivalent of
dialog: sleeping in a coffin?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: No.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I burnt them.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: (a long pause)
text: They were stained.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: How many times have I burned into
dialog: your thick skull and the thick skull
dialog: of your fellow novice, that
dialog: menstruation is a perfectly natural
dialog: process and nothing to be ashamed of.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Yes, Mother.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Say it!
speaker_heading: AGNES and GENEVIEVE
dialog: It is a perfectly natural process and
dialog: nothing to be ashamed of.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Mean it!
text: The two girls start to repeat it but Agnes starts to cry and
dialog: Genevieve
text: falters into silence. Mother Miriam goes on more kindly.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: A few years ago one of the Sisters came
dialog: to me in tears, asking for comfort,
dialog: comfort because she was too old to
dialog: have any children. Not that she wanted
dialog: to, but once a month she had been
text: reminded of that possibility.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: It's not that... it's not that...
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: It's not my time of month.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Should you see a doctor?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I don't know. I don't know what
dialog: happened Mother, I woke up... there
dialog: was blood on the sheets, but I don't
dialog: know what happened.
dialog: (starts to weep)
dialog: I don't know what I did wrong, I don't
dialog: know and I should be punished.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I don't know... I don't know...
speaker_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM (V.O.)
dialog: That was the beginning, the night of
dialog: the conception. That's why she burnt
dialog: the sheets.
scene_heading: 49 INT - SICKROOM - NIGHT
text: Still in flashback, Mother Miriam enters the room where
speaker_heading: SISTER
text: PAUL lies dying. Father Martineau is there and many of the other
text: nuns singing hymns.
speaker_heading: MARTHA (V.O.)
dialog: When was that?
speaker_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM (V.O.)
dialog: The twenty third of January. On that
dialog: night one of our elder nuns passed away.
speaker_heading: MARTHA (V.O.)
dialog: Sister Paul?
speaker_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM (V.O.)
dialog: Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was.
dialog: I was needed in the sick room.
text: Father Martineau annoints the old woman. Then Agnes quietly
text: slips in unobserved. Sister Paul rallies for a moment, tries to say
text: a single silent
text: word to her. The smile slips from Agnes' face. Then Sister
dialog: Paul
dialog: lies back
dialog: and dies.
scene_heading: 50 INT - CATHEDRAL - DAY
text: Martha and the MONSIGNOR are walking through the church
text: talking. He is quite young and has a rather abrasive manner.
dialog: (beginning missed)
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MONSIGNOR
dialog: Well you're probably right about
dialog: that. It certainly can't help Sister
dialog: Agnes to have this investigation
dialog: continued for any length of time.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Why do you call it an investigation?
dialog: I never have.
speaker_heading: MONSIGNOR
dialog: Your mother was a resident of Saint
dialog: Catherines home before you moved
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What does this have to do with..?
speaker_heading: MONSIGNOR
dialog: And you had a sister who died in the
dialog: convent.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Who told you this?
speaker_heading: MONSIGNOR
dialog: Do you still go to church?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What business is it of yours..?
speaker_heading: MONSIGNOR
dialog: Oh, we just wonder if you can be very
dialog: objective about this case.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Look, Father, ah... just because I
dialog: don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs
dialog: you subscribe to...
speaker_heading: MONSIGNOR
dialog: (halting)
dialog: But what you believe makes no difference
dialog: to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does
dialog: make all the difference to Agnes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I don't understand. Are you expecting me
dialog: to..?
speaker_heading: MONSIGNOR
dialog: Well somone's got to suffer for this Doctor.
dialog: You've got to be merciful and quick. Excuse

speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: But you're troubled... aren't you?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: That's because you keep reminding me.
dialog: If you go away then I'll forget.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: And you're unhappy.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Agnes...
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Answer me! You never answer me.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Sometimes, yes.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Only you think you're lucky because
dialog: you didn't have a mother who said things
dialog: to you and did things to you that maybe
dialog: weren't always nice but that was because
dialog: of me, because I was bad, not her.
text: Agnes carries the milk pail round to the churn.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What did you do?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I'm always bad.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What did you do?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I breathed!
text: Agnes falls to her knees. Martha moves round and kneels in
text: front of her.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Agnes. What did your mother do to
dialog: you?
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: If you can't answer me, just shake

speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA

speaker_heading: AGNES

speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: AGNES
text: She watches... she listens.
speaker_heading: MARTHA

speaker_heading: AGNES

speaker_heading: MARTHA

speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: And that you're stupid?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: That you're a mistake?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: She says my whole body's a mistake.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Because she says if I don't watch out
dialog: I'll have a baby.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: How does she know that?
speaker_heading: AGNES
text: Her headaches.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Oh, yes.
speaker_heading: AGNES

speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: AGNES

speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do

speaker_heading: MARTHA

speaker_heading: AGNES

speaker_heading: MARTHA

speaker_heading: AGNES

speaker_heading: ELDERLY NUN

speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Thank you.

text: They both have the same surname Burchetti. The the door opens and

speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: You lied to me
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (brandishing the files)
dialog: Your niece!
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: I didn't tell you because I didn't
dialog: think it was important.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: No, it just makes you doubly
dialog: responsible doesn't it?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: I never saw Agnes until she set foot
dialog: in this convent. My sister ran away
dialog: from home. We lost touch with her.
dialog: And when my husband died and I came
dialog: here, she wrote to me and asked me if
dialog: I would take care of Agnes in case
dialog: anything happened.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: And Agnes' father?
text: Mother Miriam turns out of the room. Martha goes after her.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM

scene_heading: 57 INT - CORRIDOR - DAY

speaker_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM (Cont.)

speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Like keeping her home from school?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Listening to angels?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: She drank too much. That's what killed
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Do you know what she did to her?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: I don't think I care to know.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: She molested her!
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Oh, dear God.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: There is more here than meets the eye
dialog: isn't there? Lots of dirty little secrets.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: (crying)
dialog: Oh God, if only I'd known.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Why didn't you? You knew she was
dialog: keeping her home from school. You
dialog: knew she was an alcoholic.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: I knew that after the fact.
speaker_heading: MARTHA

speaker_heading: MARTHA

dialog: That was in the days when the Church
dialog: was a ruling body. We let governments
dialog: do those things today. So what did we
dialog: do to you eh? You wanted to neck in the

speaker_heading: MARTHA

speaker_heading: MARTHA

dialog: I'm out of prac...
dialog: (cough)
dialog: ... practice.
dialog: (cough)
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: All right?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Fine thanks...
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Do you suppose the saints would have
dialog: smoked if tobacco had been popular
dialog: back then?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course
dialog: but, well Saint Thomas More...
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (chuckles)
text: Long, thin and filtered.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and
text: stub them out on the soles of his bare
text: feet.
dialog: (they roar with laughter)
dialog: And of course (distorted)
speaker_heading: MARTHA
text: Hand rolled.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Even Christ would partake socially.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Saint Peter?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Pipe!
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Right...
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Mary Magdelen?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (imitating)
dialog: Oh, you've come a long way baby.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: And Saint John would chew tobacco.
text: More laughter, then the moment because more serious.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Right.
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: What do you suppose today's saints
dialog: are smoking?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: There are no saints today. Good people
dialog: yes, but extraordinarily good people...
dialog: those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Do you think they ever existed?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Yes I do.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Do you want to become one?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Become? One is born a saint.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Yes, but goodness has very little to do
dialog: with it. Not all the saints were good,
dialog: in fact some of them were a little crazy.
dialog: But... they were still attached to God.
dialog: Agnes has that birth.
dialog: (she stands)
dialog: No more... we're born, we live, we die.
dialog: No room for miracles.
dialog: (Martha gets up too)
dialog: Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles.
text: They start walking back to the convent.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Do you think Agnes is still attached to
dialog: God?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Listen to her singing.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: I'd like to begin.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Begin what?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Would it stop you if I did?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: No.
text: They both halt.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: May I be present?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Of course.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Then let's begin.
scene_heading: 64 INT - ATTIC ROOM - DAY
text: The room is painted white and completely empty with a steeply
text: sloping ceiling. Agnes is sitting on a chair with her eyes closed,
text: already under hypnosis. Martha and Mother Miriam are facing her.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: You're listening to a chorus of angels.
dialog: The music surrounds you like a...
text: warm and, comfortable pool of water.
dialog: And while you're sleeping, you're
dialog: going to be able to recall, all the things
dialog: that we want you to remember. And
text: when I count to three and clap my hands,
dialog: you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you
dialog: hear me.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Who am I?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Doctor Livingston.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: And why am I here?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: To help me.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Good. Would you like to tell me why
dialog: you're here?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Because I'm in trouble.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What kind of trouble?
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: What kind of trouble Agnes?
text: Martha starts to walk around behind Agnes.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I'm frightened.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Of what?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Of telling you.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: But it's easy. It's just a breath with
dialog: sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: I had a baby.
text: Both Martha and Mother Miriam react with some degree of
dialog: relief.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: How did you have a baby?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: It came out of me.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Did you know what was going to come
dialog: out?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Did you want it to come out?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Because I was afraid.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Why were you afraid?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Because I wasn't worthy.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: To be a mother?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: May I open my eyes now?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
text: No not yet Agnes, very soon but not
dialog: yet. How did the baby get into you?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: It grew.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What made it grow? Do you know?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Would you like to tell me?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Did anyone else know about the baby?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I can't tell you that.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Will she be angry?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: She made me promise not to.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Who? Who made you promise?
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: It's alright Agnes. It's alright.
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: Let's go to your room. It's the night
dialog: about six weeks ago when you were
dialog: very sick.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I'm afraid.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright.
dialog: I want you to tell me what you did
dialog: before you went to bed.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I ate.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Hm hmm. What did you have for
dialog: dinner?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Fish...
dialog: (distastefully)
text: ... brussel sprouts.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: You don't like brussel sprouts?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I hate them.
text: Martha and Mother Miriam can't help smiling.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: And then what happened?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: We went to chapel for vespers.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Hm hmm.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I left early because I wasn't feeling
dialog: very well.
text: Suddenly Agnes leaps up from her chair.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Someone's following me.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Sister Marguerite I think.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Was it Sister Marguerite who knew
dialog: about the baby?
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: Alright Agnes, I want you to see your
dialog: room as you saw it on that night.
speaker_heading: MARTHA (Cont.)
dialog: Open your eyes.
dialog: (she opens them)
dialog: What do you see?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: My bed.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What else?
speaker_heading: AGNES
text: A crucifix.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Above the bed? Any... anything else?
dialog: What do you you see, something
dialog: different? What is it?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: (puzzled)
text: A wastepaper basket.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Do you know who put it there?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What do you think it's there for?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: For me to get sick in.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Are you ill?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What do you feel?
speaker_heading: AGNES
text: I feel as if I've eaten glass.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What do you do?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I have to throw up...
text: And she falls to her knees, retching horribly.
speaker_heading: AGNES (Cont.)
dialog: I can't... glass... one of the sisters
dialog: has fed me glass.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Which one?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I don't know which one (distorted)
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Of what?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Of me. Oh... God! My God...
dialog: (assumes the birth
dialog: position and looks
dialog: between her legs)
dialog: Water... it's all water...
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Why isn't anyone coming?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: (trying to wipe up
dialog: the water)
dialog: They can't hear me that's why.
dialog: (in terrible pain)
dialog: Oh God... I don't wanna...
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: (to Martha)
dialog: Stop her!
text: Then Agnes tries to crawl away as though terrified of
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Please get away from me...
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Go away, I don't want you here.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Is someone in the room with you?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: No... don't hit me please...
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Stop this, she'll hurt herself
dialog: (stepping forward)
dialog: I'm not going to allow this.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (hauling her away)
dialog: NO... no... I said leave her alone.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: (still screaming)
dialog: You're trying to take my baby... trying
dialog: to take my baby... no...
dialog: (then quietly)
dialog: It wasn't my fault Mommy... it was a
dialog: mistake Mommy.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Alright Agnes... it's alright. One, two
dialog: three...
text: (claps her hands;
dialog: Agnes comes to)
dialog: It's alright... it's me, Doctor Livingston,
dialog: it's alright, alright. Thankyou Agnes,
dialog: thankyou. How do you feel?
speaker_heading: AGNES
text: Frightened.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Do you remember what just happened?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: (a long pause)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: That's good. Do you feel well enough
dialog: to stand?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Yes.
text: Martha helps her to her feet. Agnes clings to her.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: There you go. It's alright, it's alright,
dialog: it's all over. It's alright Agnes, that's
dialog: right, that's right.

speaker_heading: MARTHA (off)

dialog: for some ah... ground plans for the
dialog: ah... Saint Marie Madeleine Convent
dialog: in (distorted).
speaker_heading: MAN (off)
dialog: (answers in French)
text: Martha and a middle aged official come into view. He
dialog: stops
text: at a long set of drawers and starts looking through it.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (in French)
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (replies in French)
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Oh... very interesting I guess...
text: (he pulls out a
dialog: folder of plans)
dialog: Excuse me...
text: He sets the folder down on a table and starts going through
dialog: it.
dialog: They both
dialog: look at the plans.
speaker_heading: MAN (Cont.)
dialog: Ah viola! This has everything. Even
text: the secret entrance. They all had
dialog: that. Usually to get from building to
text: building in the snow...
dialog: (he indicates on
dialog: the plan)
dialog: ... like that one.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (murmurs)
dialog: That's how he got in... or she got
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Oh excuse me, what did you say?
speaker_heading: MARTHA

speaker_heading: MAN

scene_heading: 67 INT - CRYPT - DAY

scene_heading: 69 INT - BARN - DAY
text: Martha emerges through a trapdoor in to the barn which is
dialog: full
text: of doves. It begins to make sense for her.
scene_heading: 70 EXT - CITY - DAY
text: Various closeups of famous statues. A bell is tolling. Two
dialog: nuns
dialog: come out of
text: a building, down streets, across the road as though traffic
dialog: did
dialog: not exist
text: and into another building.
scene_heading: 71 INT - LIFT - DAY
text: The nuns are Sister Anne and Mother Miriam. In the lift an
speaker_heading: OFFICE GIRL

scene_heading: 72 INT - CORRIDOR - DAY

scene_heading: 73 INT - MARTHA'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Mother Miriam addresses the secretary, HELEN.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Is the Doctor in her office?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Ah, who shall I say is calling?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: (grimly)
dialog: General MacArthur.
text: She heads onto Martha's office. Helen jumps up after her.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Just a minute please, you can't go in
dialog: there.
text: Mother Miriam pushes the door open to reveal Martha.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (standing)
dialog: It's... it's alright Helen, just close
text: the door.
text: Mother Miriam walks in and throws some papers down onto
text: Martha's desk.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: I've just met with the bishop. We're
dialog: taking you off the case.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (picking up the papers)
dialog: You're what?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: If we want to hire a psychiatrist for
dialog: Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you.
dialog: (starts to leave)
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: One that will ask the questions you
dialog: want asked.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: (halting)
dialog: One that will approach this matter
text: with some objectivity and respect.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: For the Church?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: For Agnes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: You think she's a saint?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: She's been touched by God, yes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
text: How? How? She hallucinates, stops
text: eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is
dialog: that supposed to convince me she
dialog: shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: The father!
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Who is he?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Why must he be anybody?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (laughs and sits down)
dialog: My God, you're as crazy as...
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth,
dialog: I'm saying...
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: How (distorted) ?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Don't be ridiculous.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Well give me a reasonable explanation
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: A miracle is an event without an
dialog: explanation. If she's capable of putting
text: a hole in her hand without benefit of a
dialog: nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her
dialog: womb?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: This is insane.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: There as no man in the convent on that
dialog: night and no way for any man to get in
dialog: or out.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: You're saying God did it?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: No, that's as much as saying Father
dialog: Martineau did it. I'm saying God
dialog: permitted it.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: But how did it happen?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: You'll never find the answer for
dialog: everything God did.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I thought you didn't believe in miracles
dialog: today Mother?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: But I want the opportunity to believe.
dialog: I want the choice to believe.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: But what you are choosing to believe
dialog: is a lie because you won't face the fact
dialog: that she was raped... or seduced...
dialog: or that she did the seducing.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
text: She is an innocent.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
text: But she is not an enigma Mother.
dialog: Everything that Agnes has done is
text: explainable from modern psychiatry.
text: One, two, three, right down the line.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: That's what you believe she is? The
dialog: sum of her psychological parts?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: That's what I have to believe...
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Then why are you so obsessed with her?
dialog: You're losing sleep over her?
dialog: (Martha gets up disturbed)
dialog: You're thinking about her all the time.
dialog: You're bent on saving her. Why?
text: Martha has no answer.
speaker_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM (Cont.)
dialog: (calmer)
dialog: I'm not accusing. I'm recognizing.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
text: There's a tunnel out of the crypt into
dialog: the barn. Did you know about that?
dialog: There's an answer Mother. That's how
text: she got out.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: That's crazy. How could she find out
dialog: about it?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Somebody told her.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Who? That tun... that tunnel hasn't
dialog: been used in fifty years.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Why would I lie?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Because it's murder we're talking about.
dialog: Aren't you concerned about what she told
text: us about the other person in her room.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: I'm concerned about her health.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Who was that person Mother? Was it
dialog: you?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: If you believe this is murder, it is the
dialog: Crown attorney you have to talk to, not
dialog: me. And definitely not Agnes.
text: She goes out and slams the door.
scene_heading: 74 EXT - POND - DAY
text: After a couple of establishing shots of the convent, the nuns
text: are shown ice skating on the frozen pond. They are quite
text: uninhibited, like little

speaker_heading: MARTHA

speaker_heading: LEVEAU
dialog: Why?
dialog: (continues in French,
dialog: then...)
dialog: You've done nothing to show any progress.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
speaker_heading: LEVEAU
dialog: You're getting to all of us Martha, let's
dialog: face it.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I'll have a decision by next week.
speaker_heading: LEVEAU
dialog: It's gone on long enough. You're out.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
speaker_heading: LEVEAU
dialog: (halting)
dialog: You have proof?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I'll have it.
speaker_heading: LEVEAU
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Next week.
speaker_heading: LEVEAU
dialog: (walking on)
dialog: No, no, no...
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I can get you new evidence next week.
speaker_heading: LEVEAU
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by
dialog: tomorrow. I will.
text: They reach the door of Leveau's office. He thinks...
speaker_heading: LEVEAU
dialog: Yes, demain (?)
scene_heading: 77 INT - CHAPEL - DAY
text: The scene consists of a number of shots dissolving into one
text: another. Sister Genevieve lying face down in front of the bishop,
text: Genevieve praying on her knees, her family (4) watching from
text: behind the grilled gate. Genevieve's
text: hair being cut, her joy at the habit being fitted to her,
dialog: running out to

speaker_heading: NUN (off)
dialog: Excuse me Mother, Doctor Livingston
dialog: is here.
text: Mother Miriam nods tiredly and goes to meet Martha at he
dialog: door.
text: Martha hands her a court order. Mother Miriam reads it briefly
text: and hands it back.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: This is permission to take her apart.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Where is she?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Hasn't she had enough?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I have a few more questions to ask her.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: My God, but you're determined.
text: They move back into the room.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Who knew she was pregnant?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Why do you insist upon pressing...
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Was it you?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Is it because she's a nun?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Did you know she was pregnant?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: And you didn't send her to a doctor.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
text: I didn't guess until it was too late.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: For what? An abortion?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Oh, don't be ridiculous.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Too late for what?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: I don't know... too late to stop it.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: The baby?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: The scandal...
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: You went to the room to help with
dialog: the birth.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: She didn't want any help.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: You wanted that child out of the way.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: That's a lie.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: You hid the wastepaper basket in her
dialog: room.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: I didn't hide it. I put it there for the
text: blood and the dirty sheets.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: And the baby.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: You tied the cord around its neck.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: I wanted her to have it when no-one else
dialog: was around, they would have taken the
text: baby to a hospital and left it with them,
dialog: but it was such a difficult birth, there
dialog: was so much blood and I panicked.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Before or after you killed the child?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: I left it with her and I went for help.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I doubt that's what she'd say.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: Then she's a liar.
scene_heading: 80 INT - ATTIC ROOM - DAY
text: It is the same as before, except that this time Martha and

dialog: Paul died. Do you remember.
text: There is a flash cut to Sister Paul being annointed. Agnes
text: stirs slightly.
speaker_heading: MARTHA (Cont.)
dialog: What's the matter?
text: There is another flash cut, this time of Sister Paul saying
dialog: that mysterious word that we could not previously understand.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: She said Michael.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What did she mean?
text: There is a third flash cut of the shrine of Saint Michael in
text: the crypt.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: The statue. She had shown it to me
dialog: the day before.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: And the passage to the barn?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: So I could go to him.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Him.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: How did she know about him?
speaker_heading: AGNES
text: She'd seen him too.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: AGNES

dialog: about as
text: Agnes moves nervously through the barn.
speaker_heading: AGNES (V.O.)
dialog: He's here.
scene_heading: 83 INT - ATTIC ROOM - DAY
dialog: Back to the present:
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Are you frightened?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: 84 INT - BARN - NIGHT
text: In flashback: the doves continue to make flapping and
dialog: bumping
dialog: sounds as
text: they fly around the barn.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Hallo...
scene_heading: 85 INT - ATTIC ROOM - DAY
dialog: In the present:
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: ... where are you?
scene_heading: 86 INT - BARN - NIGHT
dialog: In flashback:
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Is it you?
text: Then she seems to be talking to someone although we can see
text: nothing except the doves.
speaker_heading: AGNES (Cont.)
dialog: I... I'm afraid... yes, yes I do...
dialog: why me?... wait, I want to see you.
speaker_heading: MARTHA (V.O.)
dialog: What do you see?
scene_heading: 87 INT - ATTIC ROOM - DAY
dialog: In the present:
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Halos...
scene_heading: 88 INT - BARN - NIGHT
text: In flashback: Agnes is still in the barn but now she is
dialog: lying
text: on her back.
text: Still all we can see are doves flashing in the light.
speaker_heading: AGNES (V.O.)
dialog: ... dividing and dividing feathers and
text: starts, falling, falling into the iris of
text: God's eye. Oh... oh!... it's... it's so
text: lovely... it's so... blue... yellow...
text: blood wings, brown, blood...
text: And she lifts up her hands.
scene_heading: 89 INT - ATTIC ROOM - DAY
text: In the present: as she lifts up her hands, Agnes is
dialog: horrified
dialog: to see two
text: holes in her palms weeping blood.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: His blood... my God...
text: Martha and Mother Miriam are equally shocked.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Oh Agnes...
text: Agnes runs terrified over to the walls blood pouring over her
text: white habit. Mother Miriam rushes after her.
speaker_heading: AGNES
text: It's bleeding... I'm bleeding...
dialog: my God it won't stop, I can't get it
dialog: to stop.
dialog: (to Mother Miriam)
dialog: Let go of me, I wish you were dead.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (trying to hold her)
dialog: Agnes... Agnes...
text: Agnes breaks free and runs over to another wall smearing it
dialog: too
text: with blood. Martha follows her.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Stay away from me...
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Agnes it had nothing to do with the
dialog: hand of God. He did a terrible thing
dialog: to you, do you understand?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: He frightened you and he hurt you. It's
dialog: not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us
dialog: who he is so we can find him. Stop
dialog: him from doing this to other women.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Not your fault...
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Agnes who did you see?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I hate him...
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Of course you do. Who was it?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I hate him for what he did to me.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: For what he made me go through.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I hate him.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Agnes, who did this to you?
text: Agnes flings her arms back against the wall.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: God! It was God.
dialog: (sinks to her knees)
dialog: And now I'll burn in hell because I
dialog: hate him.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's
dialog: alright to hate him.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: That's enough.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Agnes, what happened to the baby?
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: (shouting)
text: She can't remember.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What happened to the baby?
speaker_heading: AGNES
text: It was dead.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: It was alive wasn't it?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I don't remember.
scene_heading: MOTHER MIRIAM
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Oh, don't do this!
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Wasn't it!
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: YES!
text: Somehow this declaration seems to calm them down somewhat.
text: Mother Miriam is looking utterly resigned.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Mother Miriam was with you wasn't
dialog: she?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: She took the baby in her arms?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: You saw it all didn't you?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: And then... what did she do?
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: Agnes what did she do?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: She... left me alone with that little
dialog: thing, and I looked at it, and I thought
dialog: this is a mistake. But it's my mistake,
dialog: not Mommy's. God's mistake.
speaker_heading: AGNES (cont.)
dialog: I thought I... I can save her.
dialog: (she raises her hands)
dialog: I can give her back to God.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What did you do?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I put her to sleep.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: H... how?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: I tied the cord around her neck...
text: wrapped her in the bloody sheets...
text: and stuffed her in the trash can.
text: Mother Miriam gives a shuddering sigh, makes the sign of the
dialog: cross and
text: prays. Martha claps her hands lightly together once.
scene_heading: 90 EXT - CITY - DAY
text: A shaft of sunlight shines through the winter clouds onto the
text: city. Angle on the courthouse.
scene_heading: 91 INT - COURT ROOM - DAY
text: All the main characters are present: Eve, Lyon, Martha,
dialog: Agnes,
text: Sister Marguerite and Mother Miriam. Justice Leveau is summing
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: LEVEAU
dialog: In view of the situation as it now
dialog: stands, and the testimony given here
dialog: this morning, it seems quite clear
dialog: that the defendant was in no manner
text: responsible for her actions. It is
dialog: therefore the judgement of this court
dialog: that she be returned to the convent of
dialog: Marie Madeleine where she will be cared
dialog: for under proper medical supervision by
text: a visiting physician.
text: Both Martha and Mother Miriam show relief at this. Justice
dialog: Leveau continues
text: to sum up in French when suddenly Agnes stands up.
speaker_heading: LEVEAU (Cont.)
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Oui. Do you have something to say?
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: (a long pause)
text: I stood in the window of my room
dialog: every night for a week. And one night
dialog: I heard the most beautiful voice
dialog: imaginable. And when I looked I saw
text: the moon shining down on him. For six
dialog: nights he sang to me, songs I'd never
dialog: heard. And on the seventh night he
text: opened his wings and lay on top of me.
dialog: All the while he sang -
dialog: (sings)
dialog: Charlie Sweet... Charlie Sweet...
dialog: Charlie's a...
speaker_heading: LEVEAU
dialog: Please, remove her from the court.
text: Martha and Mother Miriam step forward uncertainly.
speaker_heading: LEVEAU
dialog: Would someone please remove the
text: defendant from the courtroom.
dialog: (continues in French)
text: The nuns lead Agnes, still singing past Martha and out of the
dialog: court.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 92 EXT - CONVENT - DAY
text: It is full winter; many shots of the convent and surroundings
dialog: dissolving
dialog: into one another.
speaker_heading: MARTHA (V.O.)
dialog: I don't know the meaning behind the
dialog: song she sang. Perhaps it was a song
dialog: of seduction. And the father was a
dialog: fieldhand. Perhaps the song was simply
text: a lullaby that she remembered from many
dialog: years ago. And the father was hope and...
dialog: and love and desire. And a belief in
dialog: miracles.
text: The nuns are seen walking together through the snow back to
dialog: the
text: convent over which Agnes' singing can be heard.
speaker_heading: MARTHA (V.O.)
dialog: I want to believe that she was blessed.
dialog: And I do miss her, and I hope that she's
dialog: left something, some little part of
dialog: herself with me. That would be miracle
dialog: enough wouldn't it?
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 93 EXT - TOP OF BELLTOWER - DAY
text: Where Agnes is singing her song among the doves. She stops
text: singing and the music fades in on the same key. Agnes gently takes
dialog: on of the doves and lets
text: it fly away across the snowy landscape.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
scene_heading: END TITLES.
