dialog: Screenplay by
dialog: Sam Hamm
dialog: Based on the Character Created by
dialog: Bob Kane
speaker_heading: FIRST DRAFT
dialog: October 20, 1986
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. CITYSCAPE - NIGHT
text: The place is Gotham City. The time, 1987 -- once removed.
text: The city of Tomorrow: stark angles, creeping shadows,
text: dense, crowded, airless, a random tangle of steel and
text: concrete, self-generating, almost subterranean in its
text: aspect... as if hell had erupted through the sidewalks and
text: kept on growing. A dangling fat moon shines overhead, ready
dialog: to burst.
scene_heading: EXT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT
text: Amid the chrome and glass sits a dark and ornate Gothic
text: anomaly: old City Cathedral, once grand, now abandoned --
text: long since boarded up and scheduled for demolition.
text: On the rooftop far above us, STONE GARGOYLES gaze down from
text: their shadowy, windswept perches, keeping monstrous watch
text: over the distant streets below, sightless guardians of the
text: Gotham night.
text: One of them is moving.
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT
text: The pulsing heart of downtown Gotham, a neon nightmare of
text: big-city corruption, almost surreal in its oppressiveness.
text: Hookers wave to drug dealers. Street hustlers slap high-
text: fives with three-card monte dealers. They all seem to know
dialog: each other... with one conspicuous exception:
text: A TOURIST FAMILY, Mom, Dad, and little Jimmy, staring
text: straight ahead as they march in perfect lockstep down the
dialog: main drag. They've just come out of a bit show two blocks
text: over; the respectable theatre crowd has thinned out, and
text: now -- Playbills in hand -- they find themselves adrift in
text: the predatory traffic of Gotham's meanest street.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: For God's sake, Harold, can we
dialog: please just get a taxi??
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I'm trying to get a --
dialog: (shouting)
speaker_heading: TAXI!!
text: Three cabs streak pass and disappear. MOM grimaces in
text: frustration as LITTLE JIMMY consults a subway map.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: We're going the wrong way.
text: Nearby, STREET TYPES are beginning to snicker. DAD surveys
text: them nervously, gestures toward the subway map.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Put that away. We'll look like
dialog: tourists.
text: TWO COPS lean on their patrol car outside an all-night
text: souvlaki stand, sipping coffee and chatting with a HOOKER.
text: The HOOKER smiles at JIMMY. JIMMY smiles back. MOM yanks
text: him off down the street and glowers at DAD.
speaker_heading: DAD (cont.)
dialog: We'll never get a cab here. Let's
text: cut over to Seventh.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Seventh is that way.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I know where we are!
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: A deserted access street, sidewalks lined with the husks of
text: stripped-down cars. MOM, DAD, and JIMMY take a deep breath
text: and march down the darkened street. A VOICE startles them.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Hey, mister. Gimme a dollar?
text: The VOICE belongs to a DERELICT -- nineteen or twenty,
text: acne-scarred -- who sits between two garbage cans, his palm
text: uplifted. His ratty t-shirt reads: 'I LOVE GOTHAM CITY.'
text: MOM, DAD, and JIMMY pause for the merest of seconds, then
dialog: move on -- pretending not to hear.
speaker_heading: DERELICT
dialog: Mister. How about it. One dollar?
dialog: (standing up)
dialog: One dollar, man. Are you deaf?
dialog: Are you deaf? -- Do you speak
dialog: English??
text: By now the TOURISTS are halfway across the street.
text: Mercifully, the DERELICT doesn't seem to be following.
text: They pick up their pace. They don't see the SHADOWY FIGURE
text: in the alleyway. They don't see the GUN until a gloved hand
text: brings it down, butt-first, across the back of DAD's neck.
text: DAD crumples. MOM grabs JIMMY and backs up against a brick
text: wall, too terrified to scream. The DERELICT races across
text: the street to join his confederate, the STREET PUNK, who's
text: already searching for DAD's wallet.
text: MOM's mouth opens in panic. They can see she's about to
text: snap -- so the STREET PUNK, still in a crouch, trains his
text: gun on JIMMY.
speaker_heading: STREET PUNK
dialog: Do the kid a favor, lady. Don't
dialog: scream.
text: The poor woman is utterly horrified. TEARS stream down her
text: face. But she keeps her wits about her, stifles the urge to
text: shriek, and hustles JIMMY off down the street.
text: The two PUNKS watch them break into a run -- then chuckle,
text: slap hands, race off in the opposite direction.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT
text: Six stories up. The PUNKS -- NICK and EDDIE -- hunker down
text: on the tar-and-gravel roof, sizing up their take.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (emptying the wallet)
dialog: All right. The Gold Card.
dialog: (tossing the credit card
dialog: in EDDIE's face)
dialog: Don't leave home without it.
text: A chill wind whips across the roof as NICK extracts the
text: cash and begins to count it. There's a distant, indistinct
text: CLANG: metal on metal. EDDIE hears it and tenses up.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Let's beat it, man. I don't like
dialog: being up here.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What, scared of heights?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I dunno, man. After what happened to
dialog: Johnny Gobs --
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and
dialog: walked off a roof, all right? No big
dialog: loss.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: That ain't what I heard. That ain't
dialog: what I heard at all.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I heard the bat got him.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Gimme a break, will you? Shut up...
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: Five stories, straight down. There
dialog: was no blood in the body.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No shit. It was all over the
dialog: pavement.
dialog: NICK has no patience with campfire tales -- but here on the
text: roof, in the pale moonlight, he can't ignore the slight
text: tingle at the base of his spine...
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: There was no blood, man.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: My brother says... all the bad things
dialog: you done... they come back and
dialog: haunt you...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Listen to this. How old are you?
dialog: There ain't no bat.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: My brother's a priest, man.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No wonder you're such a chickenshit.
dialog: Now shut up.
dialog: (conclusively)
dialog: There ain't no bat.
text: As they speak our attention shifts to a point at the
text: opposite corner of the roof, some fifteen yards away...
text: where, at the end of a line, a STRANGE BLACK SILHOUETTE is
text: dropping slowly, implacably, into frame...
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You shouldn'ta turned the gun on
dialog: that kid, man. You shouldn'ta --
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Do you want this money or don't
dialog: you? Now shut up! Shut up --
text: BOTH PUNKS FREEZE at the sudden, inexplicable sound of
text: BOOTS CRUNCHING ON GRAVEL. They turn slowly. Their JAWS
speaker_heading: DROP.
text: Standing at the edge of the roof, bathed in moonlight, is a
text: BLACK APPARITION. IT DOES NOT MOVE.
text: EDDIE stands rooted to the spot, a choked gurgle in his
text: throat, as if he's just seen his own death. The BLACK
text: FIGURE advances, spreading its arms. Or rather, its WINGS:
text: GREAT BLACK BATWINGS, flapping in the wind.
text: NICK drops to the gravel, gropes for the gun, brings it up.
text: And still the BLACK FIGURE draws closer, deliberate,
text: menacing. On its chest: THE EMBLEM OF A BAT, in an oval
text: yellow field, glowing like a target in the darkness...
text: NICK FIRES TWICE. TWO CLEAN HITS. The strange black figure
text: is knocked bodily to the roof.
text: Trembling, sweating buckets, NICK gets to his feet. He
text: whacks a motionless EDDIE on the arm --
speaker_heading: NICK (cont.)
dialog: I'm gettin' outta here.
text: -- and bends to retrieve his loot. EDDIE lets out a
text: strange, pre-verbal squeal...
text: ... and NICK sees THE HUMAN BAT, BACK ON ITS FEET,
text: NIGHTMARISH, UNDEAD, MOVING SLOWLY AND INEVITABLY CLOSER.
text: Panic. Sheer, raw, unrelenting panic. Stolen money flutters
text: out of NICK's hands. He scuttles around the periphery of
text: the roof, his feet skidding on the gravel as he searches
text: for a way down. The BLACK SPECTRE is blocking his path to
text: the fire escape. Trapped like a rat, NICK FIRES WILDLY.
text: EDDIE is frozen in place, his eyes glazed over, his face
text: drained of blood. The BAT treads calmly past. A LEG snakes
text: out. A BLACK BOOT catches EDDIE high on the chest --
scene_heading: -- LIFTS HIM CLEANLY OFF HIS FEET --
text: -- AND SENDS HIM FLYING THROUGH THE AIR. EDDIE slams into a
text: brick chimney and slumps to the roof unconscious, a broken,
text: weightless puppet.
text: THIS ACTION IS SO SMOOTH, SO AUTOMATIC, THAT THE BAT DOES
text: NOT EVEN BREAK HIS STRIDE. NICK sees his chance and CHARGES
text: past the black wraith, scrambling toward the fire escape...
text: A GLOVED HAND slices through the air, and NICK pitches
text: forward, his legs ensnared in a tangle of WIRES. Screaming
text: now, he drags himself across the gravel roof, the looming
text: figure of the BAT at his heels...
text: ... until there's no place left to go. NICK cowers against
text: the ledge, his pants torn, his hands and knees bloody. He
text: has dissolved into total mindless hysteria.
text: Almost by reflex, NICK keeps shooting. He'd do better if he
text: could manage to open his eyes. By now the hammer is falling
text: on an empty chamber, but NICK continues, obsessively, to
text: pull the trigger. He weeps; he moans; he wails...
text: THE BAT grabs a fistful of NICK's shirt, and with
text: supernatural ease HOISTS HIM into the air.
speaker_heading: NICK (cont.)
dialog: Don't kill me... don't kill me...
text: When NICK finally opens his eyes, he realizes THE BAT is
text: standing on the ledge of the roof -- HOLDING HIM OUT, at
text: arm's length, over six stories of nothingness.
text: The gruesome black apparition speaks, in a rasping whisper:
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: I won't kill you. I want you to do
dialog: me a favor.
text: NICK looks down. Far, far below, CARS wink silently past.
text: He looks up. And sees, in the mirrored lenses where
text: BATMAN's eyes should be, the twin reflections of his own
text: stricken face.
speaker_heading: BATMAN (cont.)
dialog: Tell your friends. Tell all your
dialog: friends.
text: NICK HOWLS. Almost as an afterthought, THE BATMAN heaves
text: him roughly back onto the roof. And then -- casually,
text: without a moment's hesitation -- STEPS OFF THE LEDGE OF THE
scene_heading: ROOF, INTO MIDAIR.
text: Trembling, NICK crawls to the ledge and looks over...
text: finding ABSOLUTELY NO TRACE of the Batman.
text: NICK is still screaming as we PAN UP to the bilious yellow
text: globe of Gotham's moon. MAIN CREDITS ROLL:
speaker_heading: BATMAN
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GOTHAM CITY DEMOCRATS' CLUB - NIGHT
text: An oversized CAMPAIGN POSTER fills one wall: "A NEW GOTHAM.
text: HARVEY DENT FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEY". We TILT DOWN to find
text: the man himself, determined, dynamic HARVEY DENT,
text: addressing a crowd from behind his podium.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: ... it is no longer enough to go
dialog: after the small-time punks and petty
dialog: criminals who infest the streets of
dialog: Gotham City. Crime and corruption
dialog: must be attacked at the root!
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - THE AUDIENCE
text: Civic-minded politicos decked out in fund-raiser finery.
text: They applaud DENT's tough talk wildly. They've just shelled
dialog: out $500 a plate for a chicken dinner, and by God they're
dialog: going to enjoy this.
text: Tuxedoed WAITERS move among the tables, deftly refilling
text: water glasses. As they do, we SEE an EMPTY PLACE SETTING --
text: the only one in the hall. Some well-meaning moneybags has
text: laid out half a grand and then neglected to show up.
text: The engraved placecard reads: BRUCE WAYNE.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON DENT
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: If elected, my first act as district
dialog: attorney will be to return an
dialog: indictment against Boss Carl
dialog: Grissom!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: A woman's apartment, decorated in pastel pinks and mauves.
text: Original paintings and sculptures everywhere. The place
text: reeks of money.
text: In the foreground: a MAN'S HAND, long, elegant, manicured.
text: Manipulating a DECK OF CARDS, doing a one-handed shuffle
dialog: with extraordinary finesse.
text: In the background: a TV set tuned to the 11 o'clock news,
text: with highlights of HARVEY DENT's campaign speech.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: (on the TV screen)
dialog: Together we can make Gotham city a
dialog: safe place for decent people to live
dialog: and work and play.
text: THE HAND sets the deck on an end table, raps it twice,
text: turns up four aces off the top. This most unusual deck
text: sports a .22 calibre BULLET HOLE straight through the
dialog: middle.
speaker_heading: JACK NAPIER
dialog: Decent people shouldn't live here.
dialog: They'd be much happier someplace
dialog: else.
text: JACK NAPIER, 32, is right-hand man and chief enforcer to
text: Boss Carl Grissom. His features are delicate, almost
text: feminine, and he takes a vain, gangsterish pride in his
text: appearance. He is also absolutely merciless.
text: He trains a cold eye on DENT's televised image as ALICIA
text: HUNT -- 26, beautiful, Carl Grissom's kept woman -- glides
text: over in her negligee and snuggles up.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: Anything new?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The usual gas. If this clown could
dialog: lay a hand on Grissom... I would've
dialog: had to kill him by now.
text: ALICIA finds JACK's necktie draped over a nearby chair. She
text: begins knotting it playfully about his neck.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: If Grissom knew about us... he
dialog: might kill you.
text: JACK seems uninterested in her affections. His eye darts
text: back and forth between the TV and his own reflection in a
text: nearby vanity.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't think so, angel. I'm too
dialog: valuable. That's the way I've
dialog: planned it.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: And besides, he doesn't know.
text: JACK checks his watch, reaches for his topcoat, and stands
text: in front of the vanity. He runs a hand through sculpted
text: hair, checks out his Albert Nipon ensemble.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: You look just fine, Jack.
text: He smiles at himself before turning to the door.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: ... I didn't ask.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
text: The scene of the earlier mugging, a half-block off Gotham
text: Square. Only now, the deserted alleyway is a beehive of
text: activity: police cars, an ambulance, a forensics van.
text: EDDIE THE PUNK goes past on a stretcher, catatonic.
text: Watching him are a porcine cop, LT. ECKHARDT, and a POLICE
speaker_heading: MEDIC.
speaker_heading: MEDIC
dialog: That one there won't say a word. The
text: other one's raving his head off.
speaker_heading: ECKHARDT
dialog: Variety, huh? The spice of life.
text: At the mouth of the alley, we find ALEXANDER KNOX --
text: thirty, hyperactive, a crime reporter for the Gotham
text: Gazette. At the moment, he's chatting with a uniformed
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
text: They found him hugging a drainpipe.
text: He was scared to come off the roof.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Great, but tell me: is this another
dialog: you-know-what? 'Cause if so, it's
dialog: the third one this week.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: (testily)
dialog: I dunno. What's "what"?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Good answer. I'm gonna put you in
dialog: for a commendation.
text: KNOX spots ECKHARDT and the MEDIC, waves cheerily, and
text: saunters down the alley. ECKHARDT curses under his breath.
speaker_heading: ECKHARDT
dialog: Oh Christ, it's Knox.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Hiya, gents. This anything I should
dialog: know about?
speaker_heading: ECKHARDT
text: Nothing out of the routine.
text: At this exact moment two uniformed PATROLMEN drag a brain-
text: fried NICK past the mouth of the alley.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: A bat, I tell you, a giant bat!
dialog: He wanted me to do him a favor...!
text: KNOX tilts one eyebrow. ECKHARDT and the MEDIC trade
text: disgusted looks.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: No offense, boys, but these guys are
text: seeing something up there.
speaker_heading: ECKHARDT
dialog: No comment. Print what you like.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Come on. One question. Is there a
dialog: six-foot bat in Gotham City?
text: KNOX's tone is jokey, but only half-jokey. ECKHARDT snorts
text: in disgust and turns away. KNOX shouts after him:
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: If so, is he on the police payroll?
dialog: If so, what's he pulling down after
dialog: taxes?
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: We pick up LT. ECKHARDT as he emerges onto the side street.
text: He's headed for his car when he spies a STRETCH LIMO idling
text: across the street. Leaning on the hood, waving hi, is the
text: dandyish JACK NAPIER -- flanked by two impressive GOONS.
text: ECKHARDT throws a nervous glance back in KNOX's direction.
text: He turns left, gestures to JACK to meet him farther up the
text: block. By the time he reaches the corner JACK has swaggered
text: up alongside him.
text: ECKHARDT takes a fat brown envelope from JACK and stuffs it
text: quickly in his coat.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You didn't show up.
speaker_heading: ECKHARDT
dialog: We had another bat sighting.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm sure that was vitally important.
dialog: Listen: things are heating up.
dialog: Someone is leaking information to
dialog: Harvey Dent.
text: ECKHARDT bristles. There's no love lost between these two.
speaker_heading: ECKHARDT
dialog: I'm doing the best I can. If it's a
dialog: problem --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Eckhardt... our problems are your
dialog: problems.
speaker_heading: ECKHARDT
dialog: I'll work on it.
text: JACK reaches out and grabs ECKHARDT by the lapels of his
text: topcoat -- an Italian job, obviously expensive. He rubs the
text: material between his fingers.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Very nice, Lieutenant. But a little
text: ostentatious on a cop's salary,
dialog: don't you think?
speaker_heading: ECKHARDT
dialog: (knocking his hands away)
dialog: I answer to Grissom, punk. Not to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're a smart boy, Eckhardt. You
dialog: should be thinking about the future.
text: ECKHARDT laughs in his face.
speaker_heading: ECKHARDT
dialog: Ambition.
dialog: (nodding his head)
dialog: Forget it, Jack. You'll never run
dialog: that organization.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: And why's that?
speaker_heading: ECKHARDT
dialog: You're a psycho, friend. You're an
dialog: A-one crazy boy and Grissom knows
dialog: it.
text: JACK lashes out and BACKHANDS ECKHARDT across the face. The
text: fat cop, stunned, turns bright red and CHARGES JACK.
text: JACK claps a hand on ECKHARDT's face and shoves him back
text: full-force. The cop sprawls on his ass in the doorway of an
dialog: all-night Cuban-Chinese restaurant.
text: By now PATRONS are staring out of the restaurant windows.
text: ECKHARDT is livid. His hand goes instinctively to his gun.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Here. Use mine.
text: JACK pulls an automatic from his pocket and tosses it in
text: ECKHARDT's lap. He looks down and laughs, daring ECKHARDT
text: to pick it up -- just as the two enormous GOONS from the
text: stretch limo appear behind him for reinforcement.
text: ECKHARDT wipes blood from his mouth as JACK -- an A-one
text: crazy-boy grin on his face -- reaches down for the gun.
speaker_heading: JACK (cont.)
dialog: It's all right, boys. Lt. Eckhardt
dialog: here is a good cop. A real good cop.
dialog: (pause; smiling)
dialog: Inexpensive.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY
text: Gotham city's leading tabloid daily. COPY BOYS rush to and
text: fro; REPORTERS pound out articles on computer terminals.
text: ALEXANDER KNOX saunters in, a sheath of typed pages in his
text: hand, and pauses at a CARTOONIST's drawing table.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: What have you got for me, Jerry?
text: JERRY holds up a cartoon: a HUMAN BAT, with an awful,
text: fanged rodent's face, wearing a business suit. The caption
text: at the top reads: "HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?" KNOX nods in
dialog: approval.
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: Nice, but... maybe a little more gore
dialog: on the fangs, huh?
text: He pats JERRY on the shoulder, moves on. A BESPECTACLED
text: COLLEAGUE spots him and calls out:
speaker_heading: COLLEAGUE
dialog: Hey Knox, you got a visitor.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: I'm real busy, Clark. Be a pal and
dialog: dust him, okay?
speaker_heading: COLLEAGUE
dialog: This one you might want to dust
dialog: yourself.
text: Curiosity piqued, KNOX moves toward his desk... and stops
text: in his tracks. Propped up on the desk are a PAIR OF LEGS.
text: The legs -- exceptionally nice ones -- are attached to a
text: WOMAN leaning back in KNOX's swivel chair, taking a nap,
text: her face obscured by a big outrageous hat.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: ... Vicki Vale.
text: The hat tips back. VICKI VALE, her face framed by a shock
text: of bright red hair, flashes a dazzling smile. She pulls
text: KNOX over for a quick smooch and laughs.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: How'd you know it was me?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Honey -- I would know any randomly
dialog: selected square inch of Vicki
dialog: Vale.
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: If I had a good enough hint.
text: He points at the oversized CAMERA BAG on his desk. It bears
text: the monogram "V.V." VICKI catches on, makes a face at him.
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: Where the hell have you been?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: A nice, restful vacation.
text: She reaches into the camera bag and pulls out a stack of
text: glossy 8x10's: COMBAT PHOTOS from some unspecified war-torn
text: corner of the world. KNOX leafs though them, impressed.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: God, a girl could get hurt doing
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I do get hurt.
text: She unbuttons her sleeve, rolls it back to show KNOX a long
text: fresh scar on the inside of her arm. He winces -- then
text: points to the scar and adds, slyly:
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Got any more of those?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Nothing I'm at liberty to reveal
dialog: here. What's new and hot in Gotham
dialog: City?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: It's too good, Vick. We got a six-
text: foot bat that swoops out of the
text: night and preys on evildoers.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Evildoers, huh? Big or small?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Small so far. I mean -- they don't
dialog: allow bats in boardrooms, do they.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Speaking of which... I hear the
text: notorious Bruce Wayne is throwing a
dialog: big do for the Harvey Dent campaign.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Yeah. Hottest ticket in town. Every
dialog: law'n'order freak in the city's
dialog: gonna be there.
text: KNOX suddenly freezes. It's just occurred to him that VICKI
dialog: may have a purpose in all this.
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: Wa-a-it. Vicki. You're not saying --
text: She reaches back into her camera bag and hands over an
text: INVITATION. KNOX is all but panting with excitement.
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: Aw, Vicki. Vicki!
dialog: (apprehensively)
dialog: Got a date?
text: She flutters her great big eyelashes, shakes her head no.
text: KNOX grabs her face and plants a kiss on her forehead,
text: nearly knocking her out of the swivel chair.
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: Vicki, baby, I love you, I've always
dialog: loved you. Will you marry me?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: (straightening her clothes)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Well, I'm starving. Will you at
dialog: least buy me a hamburger?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Yes, but please -- be gentle.
text: Overwhelmed with glee, he offers her his arm.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE - DAY
text: A HUGE PLATE GLASS WINDOW opens on the best view in Gotham.
text: This spectacular penthouse suite is just one of the power
text: perks available to CARL GRISSOM, kingpin of the Gotham City
text: rackets, fat, fifty, and utterly without charm.
text: GRISSOM, behind a big broad desk, addresses his LIEUTENANTS
text: -- a fearsome assemblage of bloodless white-collar types
text: and few outright goons, sprawled in chairs throughout this
text: makeshift 'boardroom.' The big boss waves a copy of the
text: Gotham Globe -- with HARVEY DENT's face on the cover.
speaker_heading: GRISSOM
dialog: Nine points ahead in the new poll. I
dialog: don't like the way this is shaping
dialog: up.
text: JACK NAPIER slouches in an easy chair off to GRISSOM's
text: right, doing his trademark one-handed shuffle.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We can always pop him. -- Or pop
text: someone close to him.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: Let's feed him to the bat.
text: This suggestion draws CHUCKLES from several members of the
text: crowd. GRISSOM is unamused.
speaker_heading: GRISSOM
dialog: He's going after our front
dialog: companies. Specifically Ace
dialog: Chemical. Which would tie us
dialog: in with Councilman Kane, Senator
text: Miller... on up the line.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: We have to clean out our files
text: before the subpoena comes down.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: How do we go? The usual fire?
speaker_heading: GRISSOM
dialog: I'm thinking break-in. Trash the
dialog: office, remove the relevant
dialog: documents...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: "Industrial espionage."
speaker_heading: GRISSOM
dialog: That's right. And Jack --
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'd like you to handle this
dialog: operation personally.
text: JACK has just turned up the third ace off the top of the
text: deck. His hand freezes in midair.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: ... Me?
text: At this exact moment, METAL DOORS slide back -- and ALICIA
text: HUNT steps out of GRISSOM's private penthouse elevator.
text: She's carrying a handful of SHOPPING BAGS.
speaker_heading: GRISSOM
dialog: Hello, sweetheart. I wonder if you'd
text: mind waiting in the other room.
text: ALICIA's gaze meets JACK's as she vanishes through a side
text: door. The eye contact is not lost on GRISSOM.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why do you need me to handle a
dialog: simple break-in?
speaker_heading: GRISSOM
dialog: (emphatically)
dialog: Because I want someone I can
dialog: trust.
text: JACK bridles, but doesn't protest. Nervously, he turns the
text: fourth card off the top of the deck. It's not an ace.
text: It's a JOKER -- a Joker with a neat, round, .22 calibre
text: HOLE through its face.
speaker_heading: GRISSOM (cont.)
dialog: We'll work out the details later.
dialog: But it's got to be soon. -- All
dialog: right, that's all for now.
text: GRISSOM'S CRONIES get up to go. JACK, troubled, lingers
text: behind a moment.
speaker_heading: GRISSOM (cont.)
dialog: You don't mind, do you Jack? It's an
dialog: important job. I can't trust it to
dialog: somebody who'll screw up.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I understand.
speaker_heading: GRISSOM
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Jack. Don't forget your lucky deck.
text: JACK pockets the deck and leaves. GRISSOM sits behind the
text: big desk and GRINS WOLFISHLY.
speaker_heading: GRISSOM (cont.)
dialog: My friend, your luck is just about
dialog: to change.
text: He reaches for the phone. ALICIA appears in the doorway
text: nearby, modeling her new purchases for him. He smiles
text: coolly at her as he speaks into the receiver.
speaker_heading: GRISSOM (cont.)
dialog: Get me Lieutenant Eckhardt.

scene_heading: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT
text: A vast, rambling mansion on sixty wooded acres a half-
text: hour's drive from Gotham: old money, and how. Out front, a
text: team of red-jacketed VALETS are parking expensive cars.
scene_heading: INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
text: A DEALER'S HAND pushes cards out of a shoe (the card kind,
dialog: not the Florsheim kind). It's casino night at Wayne Manor;
text: the ballroom has been outfitted with roulette wheels,
text: blackjack tables, etc., and the various members of Gotham's
text: power elite are happily -- and legally -- throwing money
text: into Harvey Dent's campaign kitty.
text: DENT himself is surrounded by a gang of political cronies,
text: telling jokes, calling in favors. VICKI's off in another
text: group, looking luscious, drawing compliments from big shots
text: and envious, furtive glances from their wives. And, in a
text: corner of the room, all alone in his cheap suit, stands
text: ALEXANDER KNOX -- staring inquisitively up at the ceiling.
text: A butler, ALFRED, appears alongside KNOX with a trayful of
text: champagne glasses. He too looks up at the ceiling.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: How high up would you say that is?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: You know, if you cut your bathroom
dialog: in half, you'd have my apartment.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Which bathroom is that, air?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: The small one.
text: KNOX takes a drink and ALFRED moves on. A moment later,
text: VICKI detaches herself from her little circle of admirers
text: and hooks up with KNOX.
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: Man, I feel like Robin Leach. You
dialog: actually know all these people?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Some. I am a rich bitch, remember.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'm quoting.
text: KNOX winces at the reminder. She smiles and takes his arm.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Yeah, I guess we move in different
dialog: circles. -- Though I did meet a
dialog: one-eyed pimp last week.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON JAMES W. GORDON
text: Gotham's Police Commissioner, a distinguished-looking gent
text: in his late fifties. He's at a craps table, blowing into
text: his fist. ONLOOKERS root him on as he lets the dice fly.
text: Snake eyes. Crapped out. GORDON passes the dice as KNOX and
text: VICKI wander up alongside him.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Commissioner Gordon! What do you
dialog: hear from our pointy-eared friend?
text: KNOX puts his hands up behind his head and wiggles his
text: fingers -- like little bat ears. GORDON groans.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Knox, for the ninth time, and you
dialog: can quote me -- there is no bat.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Aww, Commissioner. There's gotta be
text: one honest cop in Gotham city.
text: HARVEY DENT is working the room. He ambles up, claps a
text: friendly hand on GORDON's shoulder.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: How's your luck, Jim?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Mr. Dent. What's your stand on
dialog: winged vigilantes?
text: DENT exchanges a meaningful look with GORDON.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Mr. Knox, I think we have enough

dialog: worrying about ghosts and goblins
dialog: and Halloween characters.

scene_heading: INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: TIGHT ON the rear-view mirror. JACK NAPIER is meticulously

speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: My question is, where does one man
dialog: get all this junk.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: All over the world. They say he
dialog: spends most of the year overseas --
dialog: until recently, anyway.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Holy shit...
text: KNOX goes goggle-eyed as they enter the LIBRARY.
scene_heading: INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S LIBRARY - NIGHT
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: ... We found the arsenal.
text: One wall is lined to the ceiling with leather-bound
text: volumes. On the other walls hang EXOTIC WEAPONS. Halberds.
text: Maces. Blowguns. Bolas. Thugee ropes and samurai swords...
dialog: every arcane implement of death the human mind has ever
text: devised. KNOX lets out a low whistle.
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: This guy has just gotten
dialog: interesting. What else do you know?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Just what I've heard. Rich.
dialog: Reclusive. Old money and lots of it.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Likes to kill?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Women find him magnetic.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: I bet they like him for his big
dialog: charity balls.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: That, and the sweet smell of two
dialog: hundred million bucks.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Well, you know me. The more they've
dialog: got, the less they're worth.
dialog: (scanning the room)
dialog: This guy must be the most worthless
dialog: man in America.
text: Just then, A VOICE FROM BEHIND intrudes.
speaker_heading: BRUCE WAYNE
dialog: You disappoint me. Why not the
dialog: world?
text: KNOX turns. We get our first good look at the smiling face
text: of BRUCE WAYNE: 32, tall, athletic, impeccably mannered...
dialog: and intensely handsome.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: I assume in my usual charming manner
dialog: I've just insulted the host.
dialog: (extending a hand)
dialog: Alexander Knox.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Bruce Wayne. -- I've read your work.
dialog: I quite like it.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Great. Give me a grant.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I might consider it if you introduce
dialog: me to Miss Vale.
text: KNOX blinks at VICKI. BRUCE already seems to know who she
text: is. KNOX shrugs and forges bravely ahead:
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: "This is Miss Vale." -- That felt
dialog: redundant.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
speaker_heading: (to VICKI)
dialog: You're just back from Corto Maltese.
dialog: I saw your combat photos. Quite a
dialog: departure for you.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: That's intriguing. They haven't been
dialog: published yet.
text: BRUCE smiles and ignores the implied question.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: ... You have an extraordinary eye.
text: He's laying on the charm now. KNOX, his territorial
text: instincts aroused, pipes up:
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Some people think she has two.
text: VICKI shoots KNOX a sidelong glance:
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Don't mind my friend. He's a little
dialog: nervous tonight.
text: KNOX, chastened, calls off the dogs and sizes up his
dialog: competition. BRUCE is charming, all right, but there's
text: something formal, maybe even calculating about it -- he
dialog: could be reading his clever remarks off cue cards. It's
text: almost as though he's an actor doing a brilliant imitation
dialog: of charm.
text: This is a man who thinks three moves ahead. KNOX doesn't
text: like him. But VICKI -- who's used to seeing male charm
text: turned on and off, at will -- doesn't seem to mind at all:
speaker_heading: VICKI (cont.)
dialog: This is an amazing house. I'd love
dialog: to shoot it sometime.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I don't... seek publicity. -- Will
dialog: you be staying in Gotham for a
dialog: while?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: As far as I know.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Good. Then with any luck we'll run
dialog: into each other.
text: Suddenly ALFRED, the butler, appears in the doorway behind
text: them. He clears his throat. BRUCE turns.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Excuse me, sir. Commissioner Gordon
dialog: was compelled to leave -- very
dialog: unexpectedly. He asked me to convey
dialog: his regrets.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Thank you, Alfred.
speaker_heading: (to VICKI)
dialog: I hope you'll excuse me. It was a
dialog: great pleasure meeting you.
speaker_heading: (to KNOX)
dialog: And you.
text: Without bothering to shake hands BRUCE does a sharp 180 and
text: strides hurriedly out of the room.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: I know the rich are different, but
dialog: that guy is real different.
text: VICKI, staring off after BRUCE, doesn't seem to hear him.
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: Hello? Vicki?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Oh. Sorry. I was thinking.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: What were you thinking?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Yum, yum.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Well, he must like the way he
dialog: looks. He's got a mirror in every
dialog: room.
text: And indeed, the two of them are standing before an enormous
text: WALL MIRROR, eight feet wide, running from floor to
dialog: ceiling.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I get it. Bruce Vain.
text: She pokes KNOX. He groans at the dumb pun. And suddenly we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE - THROUGH THE MIRROR
text: looking DOWN ON KNOX and VICKI -- THROUGH ONE-WAY GLASS --
text: as they continue to chat. Behind the mirror... recording
text: everything that happens in the room... is a small, silent,
text: state-of-the-art SURVEILLANCE CAMERA.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - VIDEO MONITOR
text: showing KNOX and VICKI in the library. CAMERA PULLS BACK to
text: reveal that the screen we're watching is only one in a
text: whole vast bank of video monitors. From this control
dialog: center, we can see everything that's happening in the
dialog: house.
text: Now we ZERO IN on a single screen: GUESTS moving backward,
text: with exaggerated speed, as a videotape REWINDS.
text: At the panel, BRUCE WAYNE hits a button. And now we see
text: COMMISSIONER GORDON talking to a uniformed POLICEMAN.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: ... anonymous tip. Tonight. The Ace
dialog: Chemical Company.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: (obviously agitated)
dialog: Good Lord, it we could put our hands
dialog: on Jack Napier... Why wasn't I told
dialog: about this? Who's in charge of
dialog: the --
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: Lt. Eckhardt, sir.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Eckhardt. Oh my God...
text: And suddenly COMMISSIONER GORDON is grabbing for his coat.
text: The monitor goes black. BRUCE reaches up, loosens his tie.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: UNMARKED POLICE CARS are pulling into the lot, headlights
text: off. ECKHARDT circulates among his ARMED SWAT TEAM, handing
text: out xeroxed copies of a PHOTOGRAPH.
text: The PHOTOGRAPH is a full-face shot of JACK NAPIER.
speaker_heading: ECKHARDT
dialog: Shoot to kill.
scene_heading: INT. ACE CHEMICAL - FILE ROOM - NIGHT
text: SPARKS FLY. A SAFECRACKER, in welder's mask, trains a
text: blowtorch on the office safe. Behind him, JACK'S HOODS are
text: at work on the filing cabinets.
text: The SAFECRACKER kills his blowtorch and opens the metal
text: door of the safe, giving JACK a good look at its contents:
speaker_heading: SAFECRACKER
dialog: ... Empty.
speaker_heading: HOOD I
dialog: Just like the file cabinets.
speaker_heading: HOOD II
dialog: I don't get it. If this place is
dialog: cleaned out already, what do we need
dialog: five men?
text: JACK shakes his head. His boys are antsy, ready to mutiny.
text: By now it's depressingly obvious: they've been set up.
text: Then, as if they needed any proof -- a SIREN blares
dialog: outside.
scene_heading: EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - NIGHT
text: ECKHARDT'S SWAT TEAM goes wide-eyed as a CONVOY OF POLICE
text: BLACK-AND-WHITES roars into the Ace parking lot. UNIFORMED
text: COPS pile out of their squad cars, relieving the SWAT TEAM.
text: ECKHARDT goes livid as COMMISSIONER GORDON approaches.
speaker_heading: ECKHARDT
dialog: What are you trying to do, blow the
dialog: collar?
speaker_heading: GORDON
speaker_heading: (to SWAT TEAM)
dialog: You men are dismissed. We'll take
dialog: over from here.
speaker_heading: (to UNIFORMED COPS)
dialog: Any man who opens fire on Jack
dialog: Napier... will answer to me.
text: ECKHARDT tries to slink off. GORDON grabs him roughly.
speaker_heading: GORDON (cont.)
dialog: You. Stick around.
scene_heading: INT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT
text: JACK and his HOODS ducking out of the office. It's two
text: stories above the refinery floor, accessible by a network
text: of steel ladders and CATWALKS running between the walls.
text: Down below, a CORRUGATED METAL DOOR begins to rise.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Freeze!
text: One hood goes into a crouch and OPENS FIRE. Half of his
text: colleagues dive back into the office, looking for a rear
text: exit. The others take off across the CATWALKS.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON GORDON
text: standing in the doorway as his MEN rush into the building
text: and take their places behind heavy machinery. SHOTS RING
text: OUT as the HOODS scatter.
speaker_heading: ECKHARDT
dialog: (snidely)
dialog: Nice work, Commissioner.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I'm in charge here. Not Carl
dialog: Grissom.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT
text: TWO HOODS run down a tiled corridor in the office section
text: of the complex. They're almost at the end of the hall when
text: a CAPED BLACK SHADOW steps into their path.
text: It stands there, motionless. EXTENDS ITS ARMS -- like giant
text: WINGS -- revealing the yellow-and-black insigne on its
text: massive chest. BATMAN.
text: One millisecond later, the shocked HOODS are racing back in
text: the opposite direction.
text: THE BATMAN flings a handful of STEEL BALL-BEARINGS across
text: the tiled floor. HOOD I tumbles to the floor and lands
text: hard, losing his breath. HOOD II rolls and pulls a GUN.
text: BATMAN hurls a BOOMERANG -- its edges scalloped, like a
text: bat's wing. HOOD II finds his gun hand PINNED TO THE WALL
text: by the twin prongs of the BATARANG.
text: THE BATMAN strides briskly toward them, businesslike,
text: taking his time. He grabs a handful of HOOD I's hair, lifts
text: his head off the floor, KNEES HIM IN THE FACE.
text: He turns to the petrified HOOD II. CHROME-STEEL TALONS
text: spring out of his fingertips. He strolls past HOOD II,
text: reaching out casually to give him a QUICK NICK on the chin.
text: HOOD II slumps against the wall, unconscious.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON JACK
text: down on the floor, racing along a wall, THROWING SWITCHES
dialog: -- anything to create a diversion. With every switch he
text: throws, ANOTHER GIGANTIC MACHINE roars to life. CENTRIFUGES
text: SPIN. HUGE POLYMER EXTRUDERS spit out thick strands of
text: plastic gunk. OVERHEAD CHEMICAL TANKS rotate into place
text: over giant basins.
text: JACK SEES a squad of COPS on his tail, moving from machine
text: to machine, keeping covered. He SHOOTS AND RUNS.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON CATWALKS
text: BLASTING AWAY, HOODS III and IV scuttle across the elevated
text: walkways, keeping down, avoiding police fire. One of them
text: starts up a vertical ladder leading to the next catwalk up.
text: BATMAN plunges past on the end of a rope. A BLACK-GLOVED
text: HAND snatches at HOOD III's collar as he climbs and YANKS
text: HIM CLEANLY OFF THE LADDER. They drop to the lower catwalk.
text: HOOD IV gapes. He LEVELS HIS GUN at BATMAN, who stands his
text: ground, holding onto the rails of the catwalk for support.
text: A bullet hits him squarely in the chest. He does not fall.
text: HOOD IV turns and scrambles. BATMAN goes to his belt for a
text: miniature SPEAR GUN. He points it at HOOD IV and FIRES...
text: planting a BARBED HOOK in the HOOD'S LEG.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON COPS
text: staring up in utter disbelief at the action on the catwalk.
speaker_heading: COP
speaker_heading: LOOK!
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: My God... it's him.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON CATWALK
text: HOOD III, on his feet now, charges BATMAN from behind.
text: BATMAN -- not even turning to face him -- DROPS HOOD III
text: with an ELBOW. Now he has a HOOD on either side.
text: He takes a STEEL BILLY CLUB from his belt, whips it once
text: through the air. It telescopes out into a FOUR-FOOT STAFF.
text: Like a drum majorette from hell, he WHIRLS THE STAFF as the
text: HOODS CONVERGE on him. HOOD III takes a debilitating JAB
text: UNDER THE JAW. BATMAN SPINS on his heels and SLAMS THE
text: STAFF into HOOD IV's BACK -- knocking him OFF THE CATWALK
text: to the factory floor forty feet below!
scene_heading: INT. ACE LOADING BAY - THAT MOMENT
text: JACK spots a possible out. He hits a button on the wall;
text: STEEL DOORS RISE to reveal ACE CARGO TRUCKS in the parking
text: lot outside. Beyond the trucks... AN ARMY OF COPS waiting
text: for JACK to make his move.
text: No go. He turns. Behind him, other cops -- the inside team
text: -- are rushing at him in full riot gear. JACK ducks behind
text: a forklift and darts into the adjacent room.
scene_heading: INT. CHEMICAL SUPPLY ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
text: JACK sprints through the room, firing FOUR SHOTS at the
text: metal CHEMICAL TANKS on the wall. TOXIC CHEMICALS gush out
text: onto the floor in streams. The streams run together...
text: begin to SMOKE and SIZZLE.
text: COPS RIGHT BEHIND HIM. JACK can't resist taking one last
text: pot-shot at a FIFTH CHEMICAL TANK.
text: AN EXPLOSION knocks him off his feet.
scene_heading: INT. FACTORY FLOOR - A MOMENT LATER
text: COPS LOOK ON IN PUZZLEMENT as a RIVER OF CHEMICALS courses
text: out into the main refinery. A second later, they go UP IN
text: FLAMES. A WALL OF FIRE bisects the factory floor.
text: JACK RACES ALONG behind the spreading wall of flame. The
text: cops can't see him now. He ducks behind a huge machine,
text: hits a switch -- and SLUICE GATES OPEN. CHEMICAL SLUDGE
text: begins to churn. A big HOLE IN THE WALL appears as a gate
dialog: opens on the East River. It's the waste dump!
text: Up on the catwalk, BATMAN has a perfect view of JACK. If
text: JACK can just sprint through the flames without getting
text: shot, he'll make it to the river. BATMAN hooks a rope to
text: his Batarang, FLINGS IT at a catwalk across the floor.
text: JACK bolts. BURSTS THROUGH the wall of fire. And just as he
dialog: does --
text: BATMAN leaps off the catwalk and swings down toward him!
text: His foot catches a THIRTY-FOOT ROLL of plastic, six feet in
text: diameter, one of several standing upright on the floor. The
text: plastic roll DROPS into JACK's path, BLOCKING HIS EXIT.
text: An instant later, BATMAN lands on top of JACK. Wraps an arm
text: around his throat and RAISES his free hand. DRUG-TIPPED
text: STEEL TALONS appear. But before he can paralyze JACK...
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: HOLD IT!
text: In all the ruckus, HOOD V has managed to circle back behind
text: the heavy machinery. Now he's got a GUN pointed DIRECTLY AT
scene_heading: COMMISSIONER GORDON'S HEAD.
speaker_heading: HOOD V
dialog: Let him go or I'll do it.
text: BATMAN releases JACK and stands back. JACK chuckles to
dialog: himself: what loyalty. Then, with plenty of time, he
text: strolls across the floor to a Jacob's ladder mounted on the
text: back wall... and BEGINS TO CLIMB toward the catwalks.
text: All action stops. BATMAN doesn't move. The COPS don't move.
text: HOOD V stands there sweating, his gun hand shaking as he
text: waits for JACK to climb safely out of shooting range.
text: ECKHARDT's pig-like eyes glisten. His hand drops to his
text: side. He's half-tempted to pull a gun and get the
dialog: Commissioner plugged.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON JACK
text: at a crouch, groping his way along the rail of the catwalk.
text: He reaches a paneled glass window propped open by a
text: supporting rod. It's a forty-foot drop to the swirling
text: black currents of the East River... and freedom.
text: He's about to climb out when his eye falls on a .38
text: AUTOMATIC -- which lies, abandoned, on the gridwork floor
text: of the catwalk mere yards away.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON FACTORY FLOOR
text: The HOOD, one arm around GORDON. With his gun at the
text: Commissioner's temple, he backs slowly toward the door.
speaker_heading: HOOD V
text: Nobody makes a move. We go out
dialog: clean.
speaker_heading: JACK'S VOICE
dialog: ECKHARDT!!
text: ALL EYES TURN to the catwalk overhead, where JACK stands
text: poised with the .38 in his fist. A SINGLE SHOT drops
text: ECKHARDT cleanly.
text: The moment's distraction is all BATMAN needs. He hurls a
text: NINJA WHEEL -- a small, ratcheted, razor-sharp disc -- at
text: the FOREARM of HOOD V. One jerk of a thin filament WIRE --
text: a sudden SHRIEK -- and GORDON IS FREE.
text: The THUG lurches forward. His GUN DROPS to the floor,
scene_heading: DISCHARGING ACCIDENTALLY.
text: AN UNGODLY HOWL OF PAIN echoes out from the catwalk above.
text: JACK REELS and STAGGERS, his hands CLUTCHING AT HIS CHEEKS.
text: BLOOD GUSHES from between his fingers.
text: JACK NAPIER HAS BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE FACE.
text: A YOUNG COP, unnerved by the sight of JACK's agonized
text: pirouette, draws his gun and OPENS FIRE.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: NO!!
text: But the bullet has caught JACK in the arm. He spins,
text: totters to the edge of the catwalk... and TOPPLES OVER. The
text: COPS look on helplessly as JACK plunges TWO STORIES DOWN
text: into a CATCH BASIN full of BUBBLING TOXIC WASTE, SCREAMING
text: ALL THE WAY.
speaker_heading: GORDON (cont.)
dialog: Goddammit, we had him. We --
text: And suddenly, with JACK out of the picture, all attention
text: focusses on THE BATMAN. COPS reach for their guns, circle
text: warily around him. Cornered now, he backs off slowly, HANDS
text: ON HIS BELT.
speaker_heading: GORDON (cont.)
dialog: Hold it right there, Mister.
text: THE BATMAN raises his hands in a gesture of surrender. Then
text: -- as the COPS advance -- he flicks TWO TINY CAPSULES onto
text: the factory floor.
text: A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT. COLORS BURST in a wild
text: pyrotechnic display. COPS stumble backwards, momentarily
text: dazzled, as a THICK WALL OF BLACK SMOKE conceals BATMAN
dialog: from view.
text: A TINY GRAPPLING HOOK rockets out of the dense curling
text: cloud and CATCHES on a catwalk overhead.
speaker_heading: COP
speaker_heading: LOOK!
text: The COPS are firing wildly into the smoke. But it's too
text: late. At the end of a cord, THE BLACK MAJESTIC FIGURE OF
text: THE BATMAN whips upward, rising out of the smoke like an
text: avenging angel -- and DISAPPEARING into the shadowy
text: heights, safely out of range.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: HOLD YOUR FIRE!
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: ... Who is this guy?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I don't know, but he's one hell of a
dialog: showman.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: A BLACK SHADOW scurries across the roof. From the
text: illuminated sign with its neon ace, WE PAN DOWN past the
text: chemical sluice to a SECOND ACE... a card from JACK's lucky
text: deck, pierced by a neat, round bullet hole, bobbing on the
text: oily surface of the foul, polluted river.
text: As deadly toxins gush forth, OTHER CARDS from the deck
text: swirl past: a nine. A deuce. A queen. And finally, a JOKER
scene_heading: -- SHOT CLEANLY THROUGH THE FACE.
text: A BONE-WHITE HAND BREAKS THE SURFACE as we
scene_heading: SHOCK CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY
text: A BANNER HEADLINE on the late edition of the Globe: "BAT
text: MAN FOILS ROBBERY. WHO IS MASKED VIGILANTE?"
text: Behind the newspaper, feet propped up on his desk, is a
text: jubilant KNOX. He's on the horn to COMMISSIONER GORDON.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Commissioner. Do us both a favor.
dialog: Don't tell me some lie you'll have
dialog: to retract later.
text: CLICK. KNOX grins, lowers the paper, finds himself looking
text: up at the smiling face of VICKI VALE.
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: Vick! Looks like our friend the bat
dialog: is getting ambitious. -- Why the
dialog: dopey grin?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Guess who's got a date with Bruce
dialog: Wayne.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Bruce Wayne? Date? He called you up
dialog: and asked you for a date?... Shit.
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: HEY MIRANDA! C'MERE!
speaker_heading: (to VICKI)
dialog: I want you to pay close attention to
dialog: this. Miranda -- tell my friend here
dialog: what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
text: A SUPERANNUATED SOUTHERN BELLE toddles over. MIRANDA REITZ,
dialog: 60, is the society editor of the Globe.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You mean Mister One-Nighter?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Yeah. "Mister One-Nighter."
speaker_heading: (to VICKI)
dialog: Because that's the average length of
dialog: his relationships with women.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: The current record is almost two

speaker_heading: KNOX

dialog: I'm curious. I do this for a living.

speaker_heading: VICKI

speaker_heading: BRUCE

speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: You do a very convincing imitation.

speaker_heading: VICKI (cont.)
dialog: ... Ginger ale?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
text: Two drinks and I start swinging from

speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: ... I guess I needed a change.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: You were one of the most successful

dialog: Everyone wanted you.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Have you ever been to Corto Maltese?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Not since the shooting started.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: We went there once when I was
dialog: little. I played on the beach. And
dialog: at nights -- they had a band -- I
dialog: danced with my father on the hotel
dialog: patio.
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: That was Corto Maltese. When the war
dialog: broke out I had to go back. And I
dialog: promised myself that this time... I
dialog: wouldn't look away.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What did you see?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: ... Terror.
text: The conversation is getting rather intense -- at both ends.
text: VICKI seems to have hit some weird chord within BRUCE.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: There's terror everywhere. Some
dialog: types are just more -- familiar
dialog: than others.
text: For a moment BRUCE seems to be drifting back into his
text: familiar 'preoccupied' mode. VICKI laughs apologetically.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to -- I
dialog: know it all seems a million miles
dialog: away, out here on the water, with
dialog: all this --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Insulation?
text: VICKI is momentarily stuck for a reply. In some way she
text: can't quite grasp, he seems to be challenging her.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Bruce, really, when I say these
dialog: things I don't mean to criticize
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I think you see things very clearly.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I'm happy to talk about something
dialog: else. I don't want to be depressing.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Do you assume that if I know you
dialog: better I won't like you as much?
text: VICKI starts laughing. BRUCE is a notorious womanizer, but
text: if this is a come-on, it's like no come-on she's ever seen.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I'm sorry, Bruce, I have to ask. Are
dialog: you like this with the other women
dialog: you know? -- Because I just can't
dialog: seem to get a handle on this
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (taking her hand)
dialog: Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or...
dialog: ambiguous, I think you should put
dialog: the most flattering possible
dialog: interpretation on it. Because even
dialog: if it doesn't sound that way...
dialog: that's how I'll mean it.
dialog: Bingo. The guy's a chessplayer, but on the other hand he's
text: also rather touchingly, almost childishly, sincere. Before

speaker_heading: DOCTOR (cont.)

scene_heading: INT. GRISSOM'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: GRISSOM (O.S.)
dialog: That you, sugar bumps?
text: GRISSOM waddles in unsuspectingly from the adjoining room.

speaker_heading: GRISSOM
dialog: Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
speaker_heading: JACK

text: And now, for the first time, he flings away the hat. RIPS
text: THE MUFFLER from his face. And -- as GRISSOM gasps in shock
text: -- STANDS REVEALED in his full horrendous glory.
text: His flesh is bleached bone-white. His hair is a luminous
text: seaweed-green. And his cheeks are torn and puckered from
text: the bullet wound, TWISTING HIS MOUTH INTO A HIDEOUS,
scene_heading: PERPETUAL HARLEQUIN'S GRIN.
speaker_heading: JACK (cont.)
dialog: I'm not a Jack any more.

speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I didn't mean to scare you. I just

speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Then there's one thing in the world
dialog: you don't do very well. And I know

text: A moment later, it's all over but the screaming. VICKI
text: emerges from the crowd and finds BRUCE slumped against the
text: wall, nearly catatonic. She moves to touch him.
text: As if by reflex he reaches out and GRABS HER BY THE ARMS --
text: with a grip so strong it could crush bone. She GASPS, looks
text: up -- and sees, in his traumatized EYES, a look so raw, so
text: desperate, that it virtually defies comprehension.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: BRUCE!!
text: He blinks rapidly. He relaxes his grip. Before VICKI's
text: eyes, he's changing... becoming the BRUCE she knows.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Oh my God... are you all right?
text: He reaches for her. Involuntarily, she steps back.
text: He sees her reaction and his face goes slack -- frightened,
text: pleading. This time she lets him embrace her... but her
text: face is full of bewilderment and doubt.

speaker_heading: ANCHORWOMAN (cont.)
dialog: Commissioner, you've heard the

dialog: of the mysterious 'Batman'?
text: A PIERCING CACKLE fills the air. CAMERA PULLS BACK from the

speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: All reet! I think it's about time

scene_heading: INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - DAY
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Please tell him... I'm not trying to

dialog: I'd just like to know what's going
dialog: on.
text: A KNOCK at the door as VICKI hangs up. She goes to open it,
text: finds KNOX -- wearing a big, cheshire-cat smile.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Hiya, peanut. I got something I'd
dialog: like you to see.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - DAY
text: A MICROFILM MACHINE. As VICKI looks on curiously, KNOX --
text: all eagerness now -- threads up a roll of film and begins
text: cranking through back-issue newspapers.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Okay, here we go. Check it out.
text: He steps back. VICKI stares down at the display screen. A
scene_heading: FRONT-PAGE BANNER HEADLINE reads:
scene_heading: THOMAS WAYNE MURDERED
dialog: Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery
text: Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed
text: Beneath it, a PHOTO: cops kneeling over corpses. Medics
text: with stretchers. And off to one side, a YOUNG BOY -- BRUCE
text: WAYNE -- his arms wrapped around the waist of a BEAT COP.
text: The BOY stares straight at the camera. His face is a mask
text: of UNFORGETTABLE AGONY. You can't take your eyes off it.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Oh my God... I've seen this picture.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: I guess so. Pulitzer Prize, 1963.
speaker_heading: VICKI
text: His face. Allie, look at his face.
text: TIGHT ON THE BOY'S contorted face, staring out in shock and
text: disbelief, his features recognizable across all the years
text: -- permanently, indelibly traumatized. The same face VICKI
text: saw in Halliday Plaza.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Yep. He watched the whole thing
dialog: happen. -- Recognize the beat cop?
dialog: Jim Gordon.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Oh, Bruce...
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Something like this -- what do you
dialog: suppose this could drive a guy to?
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - DAY
text: A greasy spoon off the lobby of the Globe building. KNOX
text: and VICKI in a booth.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Alexander, you are on drugs.
speaker_heading: KNOX
text: He walks out on his own party. Half
text: an hour later, the Caped Crusader
text: turns up in full bat-drag.
dialog: (beat)
text: Sees an execution, freaks out in an
dialog: alleyway. No place to change.
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Yeah, Vicki, he's "married" all
dialog: right.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: You're pissing me off, Allie. I know
dialog: exactly why you're doing this.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: (leaning forward)
dialog: Oh? Why is that, Vicki?
text: VICKI wilts under the challenge. She holds her silence for
text: a second, then changes the subject.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: He's best friends with Jim Gordon
dialog: and Harvey Dent. They would know.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: ... Okay, Vicki, I have a confession
dialog: to make. I'm the Batman.
text: VICKI snorts, rolls her eyes impatiently.
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: Don't believe me? Why not?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Alexander... I know you.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Right. And they know him. And
dialog: that's why it would never occur to
dialog: them for a minute that their old

speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: This is pointless. I'm leaving.
speaker_heading: KNOX

scene_heading: INT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. - DAY
text: LOW ANGLE on the JOKER. He stands on a catwalk high above
text: the refinery floor, lord of all he surveys, overseeing
text: production like a demented middle manager.
scene_heading: INT. STOREROOM - DAY
text: A dank, windowless room in the bowels of Ace Chemical,
text: which the JOKER has converted into a makeshift lair. SAP-
text: LIKE GOO drips in puddles from exposed pipes overhead.
text: CAMERA DRIFTS across the JOKER's cluttered desk. Shipping
text: manifests. Ledgers. PSYCHOTIC DOODLES scrawled in crayon.
dialog: More significantly: an old CONTRACT dating back to the mid-
text: seventies. It's half-obscured by other papers, but the
text: initials 'CIA' are plainly visible.
text: Then: a BOUND REPORT with the title 'DDID NERVE GAS:
scene_heading: RESULTS OF PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTATION.' Across its title
text: page, a diagonal rubber stamp: 'DISCONTINUED January 1977.'
text: And finally: a sheaf of PHOTOS. Laboratory apes, chimps and
text: orangutans, all DEAD. Their LIPS are drawn back, exposing
scene_heading: HIDEOUS, CHEMICAL-INDUCED GRIMACES.
text: ON ONE WALL: POSTER-SIZED BLOWUPS of the grinning apes.
text: ON THE OPPOSITE WALL: a large-scale photographic
text: reproduction of the Gotham City skyline, its bottom half
text: HIDDEN FROM VIEW by the JOKER's desk.
text: The PHONE RINGS. The JOKER -- who has been sitting on the
text: floor by the cityscape -- POPS INTO FRAME and picks it up.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: How's that first shipment coming?
speaker_heading: VOICE ON PHONE
dialog: Right on schedule. Oh, we got that
dialog: address for you -- 79 East End,
dialog: #12-C.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Mmm. How'd you find it?
speaker_heading: VOICE ON PHONE
dialog: Called her agent.
text: The JOKER nods in satisfaction and resumes his place on the
text: floor. Like a happy kindergartener, with paste pot and
text: scissors, he's CLIPPING PHOTOS from a magazine -- horrible
text: scenes of death, destruction, panic, mutilation.
text: One by one, he's PASTING these shots on the blowup of
text: Gotham city -- all along sidewalk level -- creating a
text: massive photomontage of ANARCHY IN THE STREETS.
dialog: We've seen these photos before. VICKI VALE took them... in
dialog: Corto Maltese.
scene_heading: INT. PHOTOGRAPHER'S STUDIO - DAY
text: In foreground, ROWS OF MAKEUP in startling profusion:
text: mascara, blusher, eyeliner, lipstick. HALF A DOZEN
text: BEAUTIFUL MODELS giggle into their makeup mirrors.
text: In the background VICKI wanders past with a stylish friend,
text: CLAIRE, who owns and operates the studio.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: ... of course, after Corto Maltese,
dialog: this must all seem pretty tame.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Not to me. I need a job.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Now Vicki. Everyone knows you've
dialog: got your hooks in Bruce Wayne.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Then "everyone" must know something
dialog: I don't.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (cattily)
dialog: Oh. Really. Well. -- Come on,
dialog: dear, Tony's dying to see you.
text: In a corner of the studio, TONY, a gaunt, tubercular Brit,
text: is shooting a swimsuit layout with two SUPERMODELS. They
text: all ad lib greetings to VICKI as TONY darts around
text: hyperkinetically, snapping the girls in a series of poses.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Yes, ladies, smiles, show me
dialog: those smiles, fabulous, tropical
dialog: smiles, think Tahiti, I want to
dialog: see teeth, yes, those glorious
dialog: teeth --
text: As VICKI looks on, the SUPERMODELS freeze in place
text: simultaneously, a strange, STRICKEN LOOK on their faces.
speaker_heading: TONY (cont.)
dialog: My God no, don't stop now, those
dialog: smiles, I need those smiles --
text: Suddenly the girls are LAUGHING -- but the laughter is
text: unnatural, involuntary. VICKI, sensing that something is
text: terribly wrong, lays a hand on CLAIRE's arm.
text: The MODELS, now wearing HUGE SMILES, begin to TWITCH
text: SPASMODICALLY. TONY snaps away.
speaker_heading: TONY (cont.)
dialog: Yes! Oh baby, YES! That's --
dialog: (beat)
dialog: No! Too far, too far! Pull back,
dialog: pull back!
dialog: (dropping the camera)
dialog: OH MY GOD!
text: The SUPERMODELS PITCH TO THE FLOOR, shuddering

scene_heading: PATSY HAS GONE INTO CONVULSIONS. CAMERA WHIPS VIOLENTLY
text: RIGHT AND LEFT as she jerks out of her seat and TOTTERS

text: PATSY spins like a dervish and LURCHES BACKWARD over the

speaker_heading: MODELS (CARTOON VOICE)

scene_heading: INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

text: HARLEQUIN'S FACE. He waves merrily in time to the music.
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO - VIDEO CONTROL BOOTH - THAT MOMENT

speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
text: Ooh. He's tense. Irritable. Out of

dialog: He's been using Brand X! But with

speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: ... it's a SMILE EVERY TIME!!
scene_heading: EXT. IDYLLIC PASTORAL SETTING - DAY

text: DEAD... and GRIMACING HORRIBLY.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: -- and the world smiles with you!
dialog: Irresistable -- oh-so-kissable --

speaker_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS
text: Television sets all over Gotham, as startled citizens react
text: to the JOKER's maniacal promo.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I know what you're saying. Where can

dialog: Well, that's the gag, folks, you
dialog: never know. Chances are... you've

text: As his RANT CONTINUES, we SEE:
text: - A YOUNG MAN watching the bedroom TV as he dresses for
text: a date. He's got an aerosol deodorant can poised under
text: one arm, ready to spray. He looks down at the can,
dialog: suddenly uncertain. Could it be...?
text: - A FAMILY in their kitchen, eyeing a 12-inch portable
text: as MOM serves dinner. They dig in automatically, then
text: FREEZE with their forks in midair.
text: - A MIDDLE-AGED MATRON at the living-room TV. Shocked,
text: she calls to her husband -- and gets no reply. We
text: FOLLOW HER to the bathroom door.
text: On the floor she sees AN OVERTURNED SHAMPOO BOTTLE.
text: Then: her HUSBAND, slumped down in the tub, a lethal
text: GRIN on his face. She lets out a SHRIEK.
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - STUDY - NIGHT

speaker_heading: JOKER

speaker_heading: ANCHORMAN
dialog: Men's cologne toothpaste mouthwash
dialog: -- underarm deodorant --
text: - A SUBWAY CAR jammed with STRAPHANGERS. HUGE PATCHES OF

text: PASSENGERS RECOIL VISIBLY at the unendurable stench.
text: - The original ANCHORWOMAN, whose look is now 100%
text: natural. Her hair is frizzy. Her eyebrows are missing
text: altogether. Every wrinkle on her face is plainly
text: visible.
speaker_heading: ANCHORWOMAN
dialog: Hair spray -- eyebrow pencil --

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DUSK

dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: She's outside the Fluegelheim.
scene_heading: INT. ALICIA HUNT'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT
text: A BONE-WHITE HAND slams a phone receiver down. THE JOKER is
text: at his vanity. He's rinsed his hair black. He's applying
text: pounds of pancake makeup to his bleached face, his puckered
text: cheeks. In the right light he could almost pass for human.
text: In all the city, he's the only person still using
dialog: cosmetics.
text: A DREAMY, DRUGGED VOICE intrudes:
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: Jack? Who was that?
text: As he looks up at the mirror, we get a quick glimpse of
text: ALICIA behind him. The voice, the long blonde hair, are
text: unmistakable. But for some reason, ALICIA'S FACE is
text: COVERED... by a SHINY WHITE PORCELAIN DOLL'S MASK.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Get dressed. We're going out.
scene_heading: INT. FLUEGELHEIM MUSEUM - EVENING
text: A Gotham landmark, the Fluegelheim looks like something
dialog: Frank Lloyd Wright would've dreamed up -- a large open
text: atrium encircled by a stucco RAMP, which spirals up along
dialog: the interior walls to the CEILING four stories above. You
text: walk up this gently-inclined ramp to view the paintings.
scene_heading: INT. FLUEGELHEIM - ROOFTOP TEA ROOM - EVENING
text: The upper terminus of the ramp opens on an airy, fern-
text: filled dining room popular with tourists and elderly
text: matrons who work up an appetite looking at art. VICKI
text: enters, camera bag slung over one shoulder, portfolio in
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I'm meeting Mr. Wayne. Is he here?
speaker_heading: MAITRE D'
dialog: No, but your table is ready.
scene_heading: INT. TEA ROOM - TWENTY MINUTES LATER - EVENING
text: VICKI, sipping on a gin and tonic, checks her watch. A

text: bearing a single word: URGENT.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Miss Vale, this just arrived for
dialog: you.
text: As the WAITER leaves, she tears off the wrapper. Inside is
text: a small white box and a NOTE -- SCRIBBLED IN CRAYON.
speaker_heading: DEAR V. VALE,
text: PUT THIS ON RIGHT NOW.
text: Unsigned, of course. VICKI, puzzled, opens the box to find
text: a MINIATURE GAS MASK.
text: She hears a strange HISSING NOISE. A few feet away, GREEN
text: SMOKE is billowing out of an air-conditioning vent.
text: TRAYS OF FOOD CRASH TO THE FLOOR as WAITERS pass out. ART
text: LOVERS drop forks, go face down in their pasta salad.
text: VICKI hurriedly fits the gas mask over her nose and mouth.
text: Within seconds, she's the only one conscious in the room.
scene_heading: INT. MUSEUM - THAT MOMENT
text: GREEN SMOKE plumes up toward the ceiling as we TILT DOWN
text: toward the floor of the atrium. PATRONS and SECURITY GUARDS
text: lie sprawled on the floor, twisted at odd angles, out cold.
text: The mist is beginning to clear now. The doors swing open
text: and in strolls THE JOKER, looking quite dapper in his
text: street makeup and BIG PURPLE PIMP'S HAT.
text: A SQUAD OF GOONS enters behind him. Some of them are
text: carrying large cartons. They lock the entry doors, place a
text: "CLOSED" sign in front of them, and begin uncrating LARGE
text: CANS OF BLACK PAINT.
text: The JOKER steps up onto the ramp, examines the artwork with
text: an appreciative eye.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Okay, boys, let's broaden our minds.
text: He stops in front of an Ingres odalisque. Stands back a
text: pace or two to get a better look. Then pulls out a STRAIGHT
text: RAZOR and cuts a LONG DIAGONAL GASH in the canvas.
text: He ambles up the ramp, stepping over collapsed patrons,
text: pausing at every fourth or fifth painting. Monet water
text: lilies, a Degas ballerina -- all get the razor treatment.
text: Behind him his CRONIES work their way up the ramp, HEAVING
text: BLACK PAINT on every canvas the JOKER has missed.
text: He cocks an eyebrow at Edvard Munch's "THE SCREAM."
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: I kinda like this one. Leave it.
scene_heading: INT. TEA ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING
text: VICKI at her table, still wearing the gas mask, scared as
text: hell. The overhead lights wink out and the room goes dark.
text: The JOKER saunters over and pulls up a chair.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I think it's safe to take that off.
text: VICKI recognizes the deranged smile instantly. She removes
text: the gas mask, tries to gather her wits.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: You're quite beautiful.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: ... Thank you.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Unfortunate, but I think we can work
dialog: around it.
text: He sets a couple of CANDLESTICKS on the table and reaches
text: for his lighter. A LONG JET OF FLAME shoots out, Jerry
text: Lewis-style, as he lights the candles.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: You're Vicki Vale. I guess you know
dialog: who I am. -- Is this your
dialog: portfolio?
text: She nods. He opens it, begins leafing through the record of
text: VICKI's career. Newspaper photos from the Globe, at first.
text: Then fashion layouts, magazine covers of celebrities.
text: Artier B&amp;W shots from VICKI's first couple of exhibitions.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: Crap. Crap. Crap, crap, crap...
dialog: Ahhh. Now here's what caught my eye.
text: He's come to the COMBAT PHOTOS from Corto Maltese.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
text: The panic. The bloody skulls. The
dialog: armless screaming fellows... you
dialog: know, the atrocities.
dialog: (smirking)
dialog: Somehow, when you shoot it, it all
dialog: comes out so clean, so lovely.
text: VICKI is squirming, but she doesn't think it wise to debate
dialog: the point. Not with this lunatic, anyway.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: I guess I'm just an old cornball,
dialog: but... I live for beauty. I look
dialog: around at my little city, it gets me
dialog: down.
dialog: (indicating the photos)
dialog: We don't have anything like this.
dialog: Well, it came to me that what this
dialog: city needs... is beautification. Kind
text: of a big makeover.
dialog: (enraptured)
dialog: Miss Vale, I finally realized that
dialog: one man can make a difference. You
dialog: know the saying. "In his image...
dialog: created he them"?
text: VICKI gazes at the awful face of this deranged visionary,
text: getting more frightened by the minute.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: And you want a --
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: A visual record, yes. A before-and-
dialog: after kind of thing.
dialog: (leaning closer)
dialog: This could make your reputation.
text: Her first impulse is to get up and run. But she fights the
dialog: impulse. She won't run... not until she gets this maniac
text: on film. She reaches for her camera bag.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Maybe we should start with a
dialog: portrait of the artist. People might
dialog: like to see the face behind the
dialog: makeup.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (momentarily puzzled)
dialog: ... Behind the makeup?
text: Then it sinks in. By candlelight, in the darkened
text: restaurant, with his pancake makeup and his black rinse
text: job, he looks practically normal. VICKI must think she's
dialog: looking at his real face!
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: Oh. Yes. I see what you mean.
text: He finds a pitcher, pours a glass of water, and very
text: carefully SETS IT ON THE TABLE in front of VICKI. Then --
text: suddenly, inexplicably -- HE BARKS AT HER:
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: Silly little TWIT -- I can't take
dialog: you ANYWHERE!
text: He sits back and grins expectantly. VICKI is thoroughly
text: nonplussed by this bizarre outburst. A moment passes.
text: He obviously wants her to do something, but she hasn't
text: got a clue as to what it is. Growing impatient now, he
scene_heading: POINTS at the WATER GLASS:
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: Well? What are you waiting for??
text: Now VICKI gets the point. She picks up the glass and HURLS
text: ITS CONTENTS in THE JOKER'S FACE.
text: His hands go up. He writhes. He shrieks -- like the Wicked
text: Witch of the West dissolving. He reaches for a napkin to
text: wipe his face clean... and begins to CACKLE.
text: His awful white-and-green clown's face revealed behind the
text: running makeup, he LEERS at her.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: You see, Miss Vale -- that was my
dialog: makeup.
dialog: (leaning forward)
dialog: What do you think?
text: VICKI is repulsed, but she's determined to tough it out.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I've seen worse. Much worse.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Strong stomach, huh? I like that in
dialog: a woman. -- Maybe we can do business
dialog: after all.
text: He seems to have calmed down a bit. It's almost as if he's
text: coming on to her. But just then, a tiny BELL sounds behind
text: them... and a VOICE intrudes:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Jack?
text: The JOKER turns. ALICIA steps out of a ROOFTOP ELEVATOR and
text: moves toward them, drugged, wraithlike. She's still wearing
text: the porcelain DOLL'S MASK we saw earlier.
speaker_heading: JOKER
speaker_heading: (to VICKI)
dialog: Christ, it's my girlfriend.
speaker_heading: (to ALICIA)
speaker_heading: WHAT?
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: You said I could look at the
dialog: pictures before you -- before you --
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Shucks, honey, I forgot.
text: (rolling his eyes at
speaker_heading: VICKI)
dialog: I'm in trouble now.
speaker_heading: (to ALICIA)
dialog: This is business, sweetie. Why don't
dialog: you go outside and see how the boys
dialog: are coming?
text: VICKI can't take her eyes off this strange figure drifting
text: eerily through the abandoned tea room.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: (hesitantly)
dialog: ... Why the mask?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Alicia! Come here, have a seat. Show
dialog: Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
text: ALICIA sits down numbly and begins to undo the mask.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: You see, Miss Vale, Alicia's beautiful.
text: One in a million. A work of art. In
dialog: fact...
text: We're looking at ALICIA's profile as the mask comes off.
dialog: The side that's turned to us is indeed beautiful. But the
text: side we can't see... SENDS VICKI RIGHT OVER THE EDGE.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: She makes you look sick.
text: VICKI lurches out of her seat, knocking it over, HER FACE
text: FROZEN IN HORROR. She finds her CAMERA, holds it out like a
text: weapon as THE JOKER advances on her.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: You SCUM! You SICK FILTH!... You DID
dialog: THAT to her!
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What? I improved her a little...
text: VICKI backs away, snapping the shutter on her camera. HE
text: BLINKS as the flash gun goes off repeatedly.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I'll see you burn. I'll see you dead.
dialog: -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Miss Vale, was it something I said?
dialog: (brightly)
dialog: Do you want to sniff my flower?
text: There's a BRIGHT PURPLE BOUTONNIERE in his lapel. He holds
text: it up for VICKI's inspection as he moves menacingly closer.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: NO!
text: The JOKER squeezes a concealed BULB. A JET OF CLEAR LIQUID
text: spurts out of the FLOWER, NARROWLY MISSING VICKI.
text: She GASPS. BUMPS INTO A TABLE. ACRID BLACK SMOKE rises from
text: the floor where the clear liquid hit. Acid.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Come on, Miss Vale... STOP AND SMELL
dialog: THE ROSES!!
text: He backs VICKI into a corner. And then -- abruptly --
text: A SKYLIGHT SHATTERS IN A HAIL OF GLASS! A CAPED SHADOW
text: DROPS TO THE FLOOR OF THE RESTAURANT! And THE JOKER is face
dialog: to face with...
speaker_heading: THE BATMAN!
text: On his wrist is a STEEL GAUNTLET. Ha AIMS IT at the JOKER
text: like a weapon. Then PIVOTS SUDDENLY -- POINTS HIS ARM
scene_heading: THROUGH THE DOOR OF THE RESTAURANT --
text: -- AND FIRES A METAL SPIKE into the adobe wall of the RAMP
dialog: OUTSIDE!!
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: ... YOU!!
text: On the end of the spike is a CORD leading to BATMAN's belt.
text: In the wink of an eye he's GRABBED VICKI -- DRAGGED HER OUT
text: OF the tea room -- and PLUNGED OVER THE RAMP WALL, FOUR
text: STORIES STRAIGHT DOWN TO THE ATRIUM FLOOR BELOW!!!
text: The JOKER races to the edge of the ramp.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: GET 'EM!! GET 'EM!!
text: His GOONS are stationed at various points along the ramp,
text: still defacing masterpieces. They pull their guns and OPEN
text: FIRE as BATMAN and VICKI plummet past.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON BATMAN AND VICKI - AS THEY FALL
text: He holds the gauntlet overhead, ROPE whistling through it.
text: As we watch, the gauntlet sprouts STEEL WINGS -- forming a
text: BULLETPROOF SHIELD over their heads!
text: TWO FEET ABOVE the marble floor, THE ROPE jerks them up
text: short -- like a bunjee cord. GUNS BLAZE as BATMAN and VICKI
text: drop safely to earth and MAKE FOR THE EXIT.
text: The doors are LOCKED. BATMAN spots the black "CLOSED" sign
text: on a metal stand. He HEAVES IT through the glass doors.
text: VICKI hustles through. He points her to a side alley.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE ALLEY - THAT MOMENT - DUSK
text: VICKI rounds the corner just as BATMAN lobs a SMOKE PELLET
text: into the doorway of the Fluegelheim.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: GET IN THE CAR!
speaker_heading: VICKI
speaker_heading: WHICH CAR?
text: VICKI suddenly feels quite stupid. Because -- while there
text: are many cars parked along the side alley -- there is only
text: one BATMOBILE.
speaker_heading: VICKI (cont.)
dialog: ... Oh.
text: The BATMOBILE is sleek, futuristic, and... well,
text: indescribable. Imagine your own. VICKI climbs into the
text: passenger seat and is immediately dazzled by a stunning
text: array of electronic gadgetry.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Ignition!
text: As BATMAN sprints down the alley, a COMPUTER DISPLAY on the
text: dashboard registers his unique voiceprint. A tinny,
text: synthesized VOICE repeats the command:
speaker_heading: COMPUTER
dialog: Ignition.
text: The engines are revving up even as BATMAN vaults into the
text: cockpit alongside VICKI.
text: Guns in hand, the JOKER'S GOONS Are stumbling out of the
text: Fluegelheim, hacking, coughing, blinded by smoke. They DIVE
text: FOR THEIR LIVES as the BATMOBILE comes barrelling out of
text: the alley at ninety miles an hour.
text: THE JOKER emerges just as the BATMOBILE careens off.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I WANT HIM!! I WANT HIM!!
text: The JOKER climbs into the back of a van labelled "MONARCH
text: PLAYING CARDS." Half his GOONS pile into the van behind
text: him, the other half into a second car nearby.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT
text: SIRENS HOWL as POLICE CARS converge on the Flugelheim.
scene_heading: INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT
text: roaring out into CITY TRAFFIC.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Look! Police!
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: I called them.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Shouldn't we --
text: A POLICE CAR whizzes past the BATMOBILE. TIRES SKID. The
text: COP CAR does a quick 180 and sets out in hot pursuit of the
text: BATMOBILE. BATMAN FLOORS THE ACCELERATOR in response.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT
text: TIGHT ON the demented face of THE JOKER. A GOON calls out
text: from the front of the van.
speaker_heading: GOON
dialog: There they are! Dead ahead!
text: THE JOKER screams into a RADIO DISPATCHER'S MIKE.
speaker_heading: JOKER
text: ALL UNITS! SOUTHBOUND ON RIVERVIEW!
speaker_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS
text: The JOKER'S ARMY. THUGS in cars. CREEPS in Italian
text: restaurants. CROOKED COPS at a coffee shop. LIGHTS FLASH,
text: BEEPERS SOUND, and within seconds they're racing to the
text: streets, eager to join the chase.
scene_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS - THE STREETS
text: COP CARS. GOON CARS. THE BATMOBILE streaks through an
text: intersection, nearly causing a pileup. THE JOKER'S VAN
text: makes short work of a SABRETT'S HOT DOG STAND in its path.
scene_heading: INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT
text: PEDESTRIANS GAWK as the sleek supercar RIPS UP THE
scene_heading: PAVEMENT.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: What about her? What about the girl?
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: He won't kill her.
dialog: (gritting his teeth)
speaker_heading: GODDAMMIT!
text: They're moving up on an EMPTY BLOCK -- a NIGHT CONSTRUCTION
text: TEAM. A HUGE PIECE OF HEAVY MACHINERY backs up slowly and
text: inexorably, BLOCKING THE INTERSECTION.
text: BATMAN GUNS THE ENGINE. SWERVES LEFT. TRIES TO SLIDE PAST.
text: And HITS THE BRAKES -- stopping inches short of a head-on
text: collision with a lamppost.
text: He jumps out of the car. No chance to get through. THE
text: JOKER'S VAN is two blocks back and coming up fast.
text: ONLOOKERS and CONSTRUCTION WORKERS are beginning to form a
text: crowd around them.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Can't we --
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Too many people. Come on!
text: (as she scrambles out)
dialog: SHIELDS!!
text: The BATMOBILE's computerized VOICE replies:
speaker_heading: COMPUTER
dialog: Shields.
text: With a series or CLANGS, CHROME-STEEL PLATES slide into
text: place -- across the cockpit, over the tires -- leaving the
text: BATMOBILE an inert, impenetrable BLOCK OF BLACK METAL.
text: BATMAN and VICKI sprint through the CONSTRUCTION SITE,
text: vaulting over mounds of loose dirt and concrete rubble.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - MOVING - NIGHT
text: THREE POLICE CARS, red lights blazing, OVERTAKE THE JOKER'S
text: VAN and bear down on the abandoned BATMOBILE.
speaker_heading: GOON AT WHEEL
dialog: Are they ours?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: ... I don't know. We'd better get out
dialog: of here.
speaker_heading: (into RADIO MIKE)
dialog: Westbound on 36th. DO YOU COPY??
text: The VAN does a discreet U-turn and rumbles off sedately
text: down the street.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: BATMAN and VICKI zigzag past storefronts and candy stands,
text: dodging astonished PEDESTRIANS.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT
text: FOUR GOONS with GUNS. They spot BATMAN and VICKI coming off
text: the side street. GOON I, the driver, speaks into a radio:
speaker_heading: GOON I
dialog: We got 'em!
speaker_heading: JOKER (V.O.)
dialog: (over radio)
dialog: Take 'em! I want his head!
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: BATMAN and VICKI race down the sidewalk. The car is gaining
text: on them; and then, from behind --
text: BATMAN and VICKI are caught in a SPRAY OF BULLETS. They
dialog: dive. Drop behind a parked car. And don't come up.
text: They've ducked into a BLIND ALLEY.
scene_heading: INT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
text: Hunkered on the pavement, they watch the car glide past the
text: mouth of the alley. VICKI sighs in relief. BATMAN -- still
text: alert, his muscles tensed -- puts a restraining hand on her
text: arm. He looks overhead, sees a catwalk spanning the width
text: of the alleyway five stories up.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: How much do you weigh?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: ... A hundred and eight?
text: He does some quick mental calculations. A beat. Then the
text: CAR reappears -- backing up -- blocking their only avenue
text: of escape. BATMAN unfurls a rope, HEAVES A BATARANG UPWARD,
text: and grabs VICKI roughly about the waist.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
speaker_heading: HANG ON!
text: The JOKER'S THUGS pile out of the car. The BATARANG catches
text: on the catwalk, and BATMAN triggers the spring-action REEL
text: on his utility belt -- jerking him and VICKI INTO THE AIR.
text: BULLETS zing past as they whip upward like fish on a line.
dialog: One story; two stories; and then...
text: They slow. They STOP. They DANGLE IN MIDAIR as the Joker's
text: goons advance. BATMAN wriggles, twists. They lurch upward
text: another few feet -- and stop again. VICKI SCREAMS.
text: Her additional weight is too much for the reel mechanism. They're
text: stranded two stories up -- SITTING DUCKS.
speaker_heading: BATMAN (cont.)
dialog: Whatever happens -- DON'T LET GO!!
text: In the wink of an eye he's detached the reel from his own
text: waist and hitched it around VICKI's belt. Before she has a
text: chance to protest, he LETS GO.
text: VICKI rockets upward at blinding speed, shrieking all the
text: way. BATMAN, his cape billowing, PLUMMETS DOWNWARD.
text: VICKI slams up into the catwalk and BOBS on the end of the
text: line as BATMAN lands with a loud crash, overturning a row
text: of garbage cans. The GOONS are on him in a flash -- one per
text: limb. Random kicking and flailing. BATMAN manages to slam
text: two GOONS into a wall, but before he can get to his feet --
text: -- GOON #3 slams a lead pipe into the back of his skull.
text: BATMAN is down for the count. The THUGS dust themselves off
text: and circle around his prostrate form, still wary.
text: The LEAD THUG holds his colleagues back, draws his gun, and
text: fires TWO SHOTS, point-blank, at the yellow-and-black
text: INSIGNE on BATMAN's chest. The body jerks.
text: They move closer. And stop.
speaker_heading: GOON I
dialog: ... No blood.
speaker_heading: GOON II
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: GOON III
dialog: Wait a minute.
text: GOON III screws up his courage and crouches beside the
text: body. He examines THE BATMAN'S TUNIC... and RIPS IT OPEN.
speaker_heading: GOON IV
dialog: ... What is that?
speaker_heading: GOON III
text: Some kind of body armor.
speaker_heading: GOON I
dialog: He's human after all. -- Take that
dialog: mask off.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - ON VICKI
text: Five stories overhead, VICKI has pulled herself up onto the
text: roof of the adjacent building. She watches transfixed as
text: the THUGS bend over to remove BATMAN's cowl. But at this
text: height -- and this angle -- she can't see his face. On a
text: sudden impulse she reaches for her CAMERA BAG.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON GOONS
text: peering-down open-mouthed at the unconscious face of BRUCE
text: WAYNE. Blood seeps from BRUCE's left nostril.
speaker_heading: GOON I
dialog: Well?... Who is this guy?
speaker_heading: GOON II
dialog: I dunno. You seen him before?
speaker_heading: GOON III
dialog: Maybe he's got some kind of I.D.
speaker_heading: GOON IV
dialog: Good idea. Let's check his wallet.
speaker_heading: GOON I
dialog: We'll worry about it later. Plug
dialog: him.
dialog: (beat)
text: In the head.
text: GOON II draws his automatic. And at that very instant... A
text: FLASH GUN EXPLODES OVERHEAD.
text: Startled, the THUGS look up. ANOTHER CAMERA FLASH.
speaker_heading: GOON III
dialog: Goddam, it's the redhead!
speaker_heading: ON VICKI
text: A chunk of ledge chips off mere inches from her head as the
text: GOONS OPEN FIRE. She ducks back behind the overhang, holds
text: the camera out over the ledge, and KEEPS ON FLASHING.
speaker_heading: ON BRUCE
text: HIS EYES WINK OPEN.
speaker_heading: ON VICKI
text: momentarily idle. She's used up her roll. The GOONS KEEP
text: SHOOTING as she reaches in her bag for new film. She finds
text: it, loads the camera with astonishing dexterity -- and
text: then, on instinct, reaches back inside the bag for a
text: TELEPHOTO LENS. All the better to see you with, Batman...
speaker_heading: ON THE THUGS
text: No response from VICKI. They begin to relax a little.
speaker_heading: GOON II
dialog: Did you hit her?
speaker_heading: GOON I
dialog: Who cares? Wax that freak.
text: They turn their attention to BRUCE. A GLOVED HAND snakes
text: out with lightning speed -- GRABBING GOON I BY THE COATTAIL
text: and pulling him DIRECTLY INTO THE LINE OF FIRE. GOON II bas
text: pulled the trigger twice before he knows what's happened.
text: In one fluid motion BRUCE HEAVES GOON I's lifeless body
text: THROUGH THE AIR, knocking GOON II backward over a garbage
text: can. GOON II falls and CRACKS HIS HEAD on the nearest wall.
text: GOON III takes a rabbit punch to the throat. He's on the
text: way down when he catches a STEEL-TOED BOOT in the gut.
text: Four seconds after all this began, BRUCE is alone in the
text: alleyway with GOON IV. GOON IV has his gun pointed right at
text: BRUCE, but he's shaking too much to pull the trigger.
text: BRUCE smiles. GOON IV SCREAMS and RUNS FOR HIS LIFE.
text: Through all this, VICKI's telephoto camera has been poised
text: on the ledge, snapping away. BRUCE looks up at the FLASH
text: GUN and shakes his head. He bends to retrieve his cowl.
speaker_heading: ON VICKI
text: She finally dares to peek down at the alley. Limp goons
text: everywhere. And, in addition, THE BATMAN -- leaping up,
text: grabbing the edge of a fire escape, climbing up to meet
dialog: her.
text: VICKI thinks fast. She may have a clean shot of BATMAN'S
text: FACE. She advances the film in the camera and removes the
text: roll, then drops it down her blouse.
text: But BATMAN is likely to want that roll. So she straightens
text: her skirt and scurries across the roof, away from the
text: alley. She should have a minute or so before be gets there.
text: It's a three-foot drop to the next roof over. VICKI
text: clambers down and quickens her pace, tossing a nervous
text: glance over her shoulder every couple of steps.
dialog: Then, somehow -- and she'll be damned if she can figure out
text: how -- she walks smack into THE BATMAN. And GASPS.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: ... Not even a 'thank you'?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Well -- I think you might consider
dialog: thanking me. You were good as
dialog: dead.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: That's because you lied about your
dialog: weight.
dialog: (a long pause)
dialog: Thank you.
text: VICKI NODS and tries to walk past him. He grabs her arm.
speaker_heading: BATMAN (cont.)
dialog: I'll have to ask you for that film.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I just wanted to distract them. I
dialog: wasn't trying to get a picture of
dialog: you.
text: BATMAN looks down at the camera hanging from her neck. The
text: telephoto lens must jut out six inches. VICKI gulps.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I won't let you have it.
text: THE BATMAN is amused. He smiles menacingly.
speaker_heading: VICKI (cont.)
dialog: I know you can break my neck and
dialog: take it. But the Joker's on that
dialog: same roll. I --
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: The Joker is a murderer. And you
dialog: were as good as dead. So --
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Look, I appreciate what you did for
dialog: me. But this is my job. And I'm
dialog: keeping those pictures.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: All right, here's a compromise. I'll
dialog: develop the photos. You keep the
dialog: Jokers and I'll keep the rest.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: How do I know you won't keep them
dialog: all?
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Because I'll take you with me.
text: He reaches out, holds her gently by the shoulders. His
text: voice is deep and soothing. True, VICKI is a little dizzy
text: from all that's happened, but she's undeniably drawn to
dialog: him.
text: Still cautious, though. She reaches into her bag and hands
text: over a roll of film. The original roll -- not the telephoto
text: shots, which are still stashed in her blouse.
speaker_heading: BATMAN (cont.)
dialog: Thank you, Vicki.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: ... Where are you going to take me?
text: No reply. She looks up into his mirrored eyes. He pulls her
text: closer to him. Brushes back her hair, runs one hand
text: delicately along the line of her cheek...
text: ... AND BREAKS A TINY CAPSULE under her nose. VICKI SLUMPS
text: into BATMAN's arms.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
text: Street level. BATMAN emerges carrying VICKI's inert form in
text: his arms. He pauses and peers around the edge of a wall at
text: the BATMOBILE two blocks down.
text: The car is still there, the chrome-steel shields intact.
text: But DOZENS OF COPS and CURIOSITY-SEEKERS are SWARMING ALL
text: OVER the fearsome machine.
text: BATMAN snorts in frustration. AN ENORMOUS THREE-TON
text: CATERPILLAR WINCH rumbles up the street toward the
dialog: Batmobile.
text: He's about to get towed. BATMAN takes a RADIO TRANSMITTER
text: from his utility belt and SPEAKS INTO IT.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
text: Shields open.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - ON BATMOBILE
text: TWO COPS are crawling along the hood of the car. From
text: within they hear the tinny computerized voice:
speaker_heading: COMPUTER
text: Shields open.
text: The steel plates begin to retract.
speaker_heading: BATMAN (V.O.)
dialog: (over radio)
dialog: Ignition.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER
dialog: Ignition.
text: The stunned COPS gaze into the Batmobile's cockpit.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: There's somebody in there!
text: They TUMBLE OFF THE HOOD as the turbine engines ROAR TO
text: LIFE and THE BATMOBILE BEGINS TO MOVE.
text: COPS AND ONLOOKERS quickly clear a path. They stand there
text: stunned as the futuristic auto PICKS UP SPEED and advances
text: toward the end of the block. The LEFT TURN SIGNAL flashes
text: dutifully. And the BATMOBILE VANISHES AROUND THE CORNER.
text: PANDEMONIUM BREAKS LOOSE as the COPS bolt for their cars.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: SIRENS WAIL. PASSERSBY STARE SLACKJAWED at the driverless
text: BATMOBILE as it tears down the street, passing, darting,
text: dodging buses and CUTTING OFF TAXIS -- all with a squad of
text: COP CARS in hot pursuit.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
text: BATMAN sees the BATMOBILE rounding the corner and
text: approaching on the straightaway. He takes VICKI in his arms
text: and STEPS DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH OF THE ONRUSHING
scene_heading: HEADLIGHTS.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: STOP!
text: BRAKES SQUEAL. The BATMOBILE stops one yard short of BATMAN
text: and VICKI. A moment later BATMAN is AT THE WHEEL.
text: SIRENS BUILD. LIGHTS FLASH. The COP CARS are now visible
text: behind them. BATMAN floors the pedal; the Batmobile's
text: powerful AFTERBURNERS kick in; and the hapless cops KILL
text: THEIR SIRENS as BATMAN zooms off into the night at 140 mph.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BACK ROAD - NIGHT
text: A deserted stretch of road, lined by ancient tall pines on
text: either side. The BATMOBILE roars past.
scene_heading: INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT
text: VICKI is gradually coming to on the passenger's side.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: ... How long have I been out?
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Quite a while. I took the scenic
dialog: route.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: (gazing around her)
dialog: Well, I've certainly enjoyed it.
dialog: What's that?
text: He's just hit a BUTTON on the dashboard.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
text: Garage door.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: At the side of the road, a FALLEN TREE, surrounded by
text: underbrush, RISES HYDRAULICALLY INTO THE AIR -- revealing a
text: SECRET ROAD invisible from the main thoroughfare.
text: Doing sixty, the BATMOBILE makes a hairpin turn. Seconds
text: later, the FALLEN TREE drops back magically into place.
scene_heading: INT. BATMOBILE - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
text: As they cruise down the hidden road, VICKI STUDIES BATMAN'S
text: FACE. KNOX's words are very much on her mind.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I meant to ask you. Up on the roof
dialog: -- how did you know my name?
text: BATMAN SMILES in response. VICKI smiles with him.
speaker_heading: VICKI (cont.)
dialog: I'm serious. How did you know?
text: No reply. VICKI frowns, looks through the windshield, and
text: SEES -- much to her horror -- an enormous SHEER CLIFF WALL
text: LOOMING DEAD AHEAD.
text: Wide-eyed, she looks at BATMAN. Still smiling, he HITS THE
text: GAS -- SPEEDING UP. She lets out a SCREAM.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON CLIFF WALL
text: One second to impact. Suddenly the cliff wall VANISHES
text: ALTOGETHER -- revealing, in its place, the GAPING MOUTH OF
scene_heading: AN UNDERGROUND CAVERN.
text: The Batmobile zooms through. A moment later, the CLIFF WALL
text: -- which is nothing more than a HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION --
text: winks back into existence, showing no trace of the cavern.
scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT
dialog: We all know this place. Although we haven't had time to
text: acquire the familiar mementos -- the dinosaur, the giant
text: penny -- the BATCAVE is unmistakable. Vast banks of
text: blinking computers. A state-of-the-art crime lab. A fully-
dialog: equipped workshop for hammering out new toys. It's the
dialog: biggest and best secret clubhouse a boy could wish for.
text: BATMAN climbs out of the car. He removes his cape, strips
text: off his bullet-riddled jersey and his body armor. There are
text: TWO BIG BRUISES on the center of his chest.
text: VICKI looks on as he goes to a rack along one wall and
text: picks out a fresh tunic -- one of four. She wanders over to
text: examine the row of bat-suits -- and the BODY ARMOR.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: What is this stuff? Kevlar?
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Better. It's not on the market yet.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: It doesn't protect your head,
dialog: though.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: That's why I wear a target on my
dialog: chest.
text: THE BATMAN takes obvious pleasure in showing her his
text: futuristic bachelor's pad. His tone is jokey, almost
text: flirtatious. Behind the mask, he's a lot looser, more
dialog: carefree, than some guys we could name...
dialog: ... like Bruce Wayne.
text: VICKI is, to put it mildly, awed. She wanders around gaping
text: at millions of dollars' worth of equipment.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: How'd you find this place?
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Stumbled across it when I was a boy.
text: VICKI'S HEAD jerks up abruptly. In the dim recesses
text: overhead, BATS ARE SCREAMING. She shivers.
speaker_heading: BATMAN (cont.)
dialog: They don't come down here. They're
text: afraid of the lights.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I don't like bats. Not that kind.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: They used to terrify me. But I
dialog: forced myself to keep coming back,
dialog: and --
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: -- I guess I became the thing I
dialog: feared the most. I'll do your photos
dialog: now.
text: He goes to a HIGH-SPEED PHOTO PROCESSING MACHINE -- the
dialog: kind they have at Fotomat, only better -- and loads the
dialog: roll.
text: VICKI wanders over to the edge of a DEEP BLACK PIT. She
text: kicks a pebble over. Long seconds pass; no sound.
text: She looks up. Suspended over the bottomless pit are a pair
text: of GYMNAST'S RINGS. This guy is dedicated.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Who pays for all this?
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: I have sponsors.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: The computers?
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: I'm running a check on the tainted
text: products. There is a pattern.
dialog: Beauty products. Personal hygiene.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: No more makeup. -- Looks like we'll
dialog: all be showing our true faces now.
text: She looks straight at him. It's almost a direct request.
text: But BATMAN is preoccupied with the matter at hand.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: I've tracked all the records. Every
dialog: shipment, every warehouse, every
dialog: loading dock. Nothing. No
dialog: opportunities for tampering. Somehow
dialog: the Joker is supplying tainted
dialog: ingredients... at the source.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Wait. You can just tap into any
dialog: corporate database you want?
dialog: Anywhere?
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Oh, no. I let the FBI do that. Then
dialog: I tap into the FBI. -- Your photos
dialog: are ready.
text: He holds up a hand to VICKI: stand back. Then he checks out
text: the pictures -- SMILING as he shuffles through the prints.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: You could've killed him, you know.
dialog: You could have killed the Joker.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: I had to save you, Vicki.
dialog: (turning to face her)
dialog: Here you go. I think I'll let you
dialog: keep the whole set.
text: She looks at the photos. Joker. Joker. Joker. And four
text: shots of the BATMAN in action. He's without his mask, but
text: there's no clean angle on his face.
text: VICKI doesn't quite know why, but her head is reeling.
speaker_heading: BATMAN (cont.)
dialog: Care for an autograph?
text: He takes one of the prints, scrawls on it, hands it to her
text: with the inscription: "TO VICKI. LOVE, B."
text: Now he turns to shut down the photo machine. VICKI is
text: trembling. Her hand goes to her belt, finds the telephoto
text: roll concealed in her blouse. She steps up silently behind
text: him, reaches for his cowl. At the last second... she STOPS.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: ... Bruce?
text: HE FREEZES IN PLACE for an indecisive moment. Then:
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Are you talking to me?
text: He turns in seeming incomprehension. And shows her a
text: SMILE... the same crooked, curious, childlike smile she saw
text: on BRUCE's face that morning when she caught him singing.
speaker_heading: BATMAN (cont.)
dialog: Maybe we've had enough for one
dialog: night. I'll take you home.
text: Almost in a trance now, she lets him lead her to the
text: BATMOBILE. As she takes her seat he reaches into his
text: utility belt for another KNOCKOUT CAPSULE.
speaker_heading: BATMAN (cont.)
dialog: Do you want to do it this time?
text: VICKI doesn't move. She looks at the capsule in her hand as
text: he walks over to the driver's side and gets in.
speaker_heading: BATMAN (cont.)
dialog: Don't be afraid. I'm here.
text: She takes one last look at the familiar SMILE beneath the
text: mask... then breaks the capsule and BREATHES DEEP.
text: FLAME ERUPTS from the rear of the Batmobile as the after-
text: burners kick in and BATMAN screeches off. A FIERY RED GLOW
text: fills the screen, BURNING OUT THE IMAGE as we
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM STREET - 1963 - NIGHT (DREAM SEQUENCE)
text: The red glow resolves itself into a DREAMLIKE STREET SCENE:
text: liquid, weightless figures moving in a tinted, soundless
text: cityscape as DISTANT, TINKLY CARNIVAL MUSIC plays
text: underneath. We're outside a theatre watching first-nighters
text: emerge from the opening of a hit musical.
text: In the crowd we pick out THREE FIGURES: DR. THOMAS WAYNE,
text: his wife MARTHA, and -- in THOMAS's arms -- their young son
text: BRUCE. BRUCE hasn't made it through the show. He's asleep,
text: head nestled peacefully against his father's shoulder.
text: THOMAS rouses the boy gently, sets him down on the
text: sidewalk. BRUCE rubs the sleep from his eyes as THOMAS puts
text: an arm around his wife. Together they begin walking.
text: IN A SINGLE CUT the crowd has DISAPPEARED, and the WAYNES
text: are walking toward us up a deserted street. THOMAS and
text: MARTHA are laughing, making jokes, reaching down to tousle
text: BRUCE's hair. Their FACES, as they draw closer, are FULL OF
text: JOY. And then, without warning --
text: A HANDGUN enters frame.
text: The WAYNES freeze in their tracks. THOMAS steps
text: protectively in front of his wife, reaches for his wallet,
text: begins unbuckling his watch. He won't put up a fight.
text: MARTHA's hand goes involuntarily to the PEARL NECKLACE at
text: her throat.
text: The GUNMAN sees it, gestures for her to hand it over. But
text: MARTHA is paralyzed, afraid to move.
text: The GUNMAN steps past THOMAS, SNATCHES AT THE NECKLACE.
text: The instant his wife is threatened, THOMAS ATTACKS. The
text: pearl strand BREAKS in the GUNMAN'S HAND as he drops toward
dialog: the sidewalk.
text: A SILENT BURST OF FLAME erupts from the muzzle of the gun.
text: THOMAS CRUMPLES. MARTHA emits a PIERCING SHRIEK -- a shriek
dialog: we cannot hear --
text: -- a shriek cut short by a second burst of flame.
text: BRUCE stands paralyzed in shock. THE GUNMAN scoops a
text: handful of pearls off the sidewalk, reaches for MARTHA's
text: purse, and rises slowly -- his gun levelled directly at the
dialog: boy.
text: Almost catatonic, BRUCE stares down at the corpses of his
text: parents. At their hands, somehow intertwined. At the tiny
text: glinting pearls and the spreading pool of blood around
dialog: them.
text: He looks up with a gaze so bleak, so petrifying... that the
text: GUNMAN turns and runs.
dialog: AND WE CUT. To an exact reproduction of the Pulitzer Prize-
text: winning photo... the cops bent over the bodies, the medics
text: with their stretchers, the boy BRUCE, his arms wrapped
text: tightly around the waist of OFFICER GORDON.
text: There's only one difference. BRUCE's head is turned away
text: from us. We can't see his face.
text: And now a HAND enters the frame. Much like the GUNMAN's
text: hand, but feminine, beckoning. BRUCE, hearing his name,
text: LOOKS UP; then, agonized, ashamed, he BURIES HIS FACE in
text: GORDON's side. GORDON gestures angrily at the intruder.
text: But the hand keeps beckoning. And ultimately BRUCE turns.
text: Showing us the tear-stained face from the famous photo. A
text: face slack with horror. The horror of his parents' death...
dialog: and more importantly, the horror that someone would dare to
dialog: violate this most private and terrible of moments.
text: At last we see what BRUCE sees: a WOMAN crouched on the
text: sidewalk nearby. The WOMAN is holding a camera. The WOMAN
text: is smiling prettily at BRUCE.
speaker_heading: The WOMAN is VICKI VALE.
text: A FLASHBULB EXPLODES. FILLING. THE SCREEN with its blinding
text: white light, SCORCHING OUT THE IMAGE as a HARSH RINGING
text: SOUND cuts through the silence.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: VICKI AWAKENS. She sits up in bed, tremulous, distraught.
text: The bedside phone is ringing. She reaches for it, but her
text: hand freezes in midair. She knows who's calling.
text: Three rings later, she manages to lift the receiver. To her
text: amazement, she finds she cannot speak. Finally, she hears a
text: VOICE at the other end of the line.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (V.O.)
dialog: Vicki... ?
scene_heading: INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S STUDY - NIGHT
text: BRUCE at a big mahogany desk in his somber, book-lined
text: study. The room is dark but for a small table lamp.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Vicki, I've been thinking about you.
dialog: (long pause)
dialog: I know it's late. I'm sorry. I --
dialog: Are you there?
scene_heading: INTERCUT BRUCE AND VICKI
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I'm sorry about the way things went
dialog: between us. I'd very much like to
dialog: see you again.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Well, Bruce... I don't think... that
dialog: would be possible.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I wish you'd reconsider.
dialog: (groping)
dialog: I didn't stand you up today. The
dialog: museum was closed when I got there.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I, uh...
speaker_heading: ON VICKI
text: Her voice trails off. She's profoundly shaken. She knows.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (V.O.)
dialog: Vicki? Vi --
text: She returns the receiver to its cradle.
speaker_heading: ON BRUCE
text: He hears the click. His lips part slightly. He hangs up and
text: sits there at the desk, staring straight ahead.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. VICKI'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: TOTAL DARKNESS. VICKI stands before the bathroom mirror.
text: She holds the OPENED ROLL OF TELEPHOTO SHOTS over the sink.

text: the sink, and -- with hollow eyes -- WATCHES IT BURN.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT
text: It's four in the morning. VICKI, wrapped in a bathrobe,
text: still shaky, pours her fifth cup of coffee. Sitting across

speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Vicki, it all fits. The stuff you're
dialog: telling me -- the car, the equipment
dialog: -- somebody's paying for it.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I just can't --
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: The FBI. You know who's got the FBI

dialog: The guy's bats all right. He's bat
dialog: shit crazy. This is gonna be the
dialog: most incredible --
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: But he's not.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Not what?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: He's not crazy.
text: KNOX slaps his forehead in frustration, sprawls back in his
dialog: chair.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire
dialog: here... who dresses up like a bat. He
text: goes out at night and swings around
text: -- in his cape -- on a rope.
dialog: (throwing up his hands)
dialog: Okay. Maybe I'm crazy.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Allie... he wants to tell me.
dialog: That's why he took me there. Because
dialog: he's trying to tell me.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Gimme a break. If he wants to chat,
text: he can talk to his car.
text: The joke dies. VICKI stares dead ahead. KNOX looks on in
text: utter disbelief as it all comes into focus: he's lost her
text: loyalty. VICKI is in over her head with BRUCE.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: He has to tell someone. And I'm the
dialog: one. He's trying to tell me.
text: KNOX, hurt in a way he doesn't fully understand, gets up
text: and pulls on his coat. He stares at her coldly:
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Well, when he does you know my
dialog: number.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: CUSTOMERS are lining up to buy the early edition of the

scene_heading: INT. WAYNE FOUNDATION - DAY
text: BRUCE in a plush office suite downtown, on the phone to his

text: wave at his fellow millionaires on their way down.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Don't sell. It won't last. We'll
dialog: ride it out.
text: With exaggerated calm, he hangs up. He lifts the receiver
text: to dial another number, then hesitates and hangs up again.
scene_heading: INT. RECEPTION AREA - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
text: BRUCE, affecting an air of nonchalance, strolls past a
text: squad of SECRETARIES at desks. Phones are ringing off the
dialog: hook.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
text: BRUCE ambles past a couple of COLLEAGUES. One of them is
text: shambling catatonically down the hall, bumping into walls.
text: The other is WAILING HYSTERICALLY.
scene_heading: WAILING COLLEAGUE
dialog: ... a nine-million-dollar bath!
text: BRUCE nods in sympathy as they pass. He stops outside the
text: door to a men's room, looks around cautiously, then enters.
scene_heading: INT. MEN'S ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
text: A small anteroom outside the bathroom proper, with a bank
text: of PAY PHONES on one wall. BRUCE checks the bathroom to
text: make sure it's empty, then digs out a quarter and dials a
text: number. He cups one hand confidentially over the receiver:
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (the familiar rasp)
dialog: Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought
dialog: I'd call and see how you're doing.
scene_heading: INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - DAY
speaker_heading: VICKI

text: At this very moment, a DAZED FINANCIER enters from behind.
speaker_heading: FINANCIER

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Cut the deal.
scene_heading: INT. CITY HALL - NIGHT

speaker_heading: NEWS ANCHOR

speaker_heading: REPORTER II

scene_heading: INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN

speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Joker here. Can we talk?
text: The MAYOR fumbles for his prepared statement.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: "While this administration remains

speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is

text: He shrugs. STARTLED REACTIONS from the city officials.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: But I'm a reasonable fella. If you

speaker_heading: MAYOR

speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Goddammit, I expect to be treated

speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: I might just think up some demands.
dialog: And I'm gonna talk to all my

scene_heading: INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - TEN MINUTES LATER - DAY

speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Well, that's how it is, chum. She

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What is it you want?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Simple. You know the score. One

dialog: tumbling down. I can take you off
dialog: the streets once and for all.
dialog: (a shaky pause)
dialog: I want you to hang up the suit. And
dialog: I want you to stay away from Vicki.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I can't do that. Not while the

speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Then stay away from Vicki. That's
dialog: all I want, man. I just want your

speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: See, I don't know how it happened --
dialog: she's a smart girl and you are an
dialog: extraordinarily screwed-up guy -- but

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: There's something I don't

speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Because I --

speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: Come on, Bruce. Be straight. What
dialog: have you got to offer? You gonna
dialog: marry her? Batman and Mrs. Batman?
dialog: (laughing bitterly)
dialog: Gimme a break, huh? Who's gonna be

dialog: It wouldn't matter much.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I don't understand it. You can do so

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Money makes money, Vicki. The

speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: You're one man. You can't save

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What it I could save a handful?
dialog: -- What if I could save one?
text: VICKI is sick of watching BRUCE torment himself. She stands

speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Bruce, at the rate you're going, you
dialog: can't even save yourself.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (staring right at her)
dialog: Sometimes... I don't know if there's

text: VICKI is totally drained. She heads for the kitchen.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Oh, God. I've got to have some
dialog: coffee or something.
text: A moment's breather as BRUCE sits on the sofa reflecting.
text: Then, suddenly, a KNOCK at the door.
text: VICKI reappears and moves to answer the door. BRUCE -- on
text: his feet instantly -- grabs her by the shoulder.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Are you expecting anyone?
text: She nods no. He goes to the peephole in the door.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (cont.)
dialog: Who's there?
text: THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE he sees a DELIVERY BOY.
speaker_heading: DELIVERY BOY
dialog: Package tor Miss Vale.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
text: Set it down by the door. On the

text: The DELIVERY BOY sets the package down and wanders off,

text: moment's interval, BRUCE opens the door and bends to pick
text: up the mysterious package.
text: Another brown-paper parcel... ADDRESSED IN CRAYON.
speaker_heading: VICKI
speaker_heading: BRUCE!
text: He strides past her, handling the parcel gingerly, and sets
text: it down on the kitchen counter.
speaker_heading: VICKI (cont.)
dialog: It's just like the last time. He
dialog: sent me a present before he --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
text: As VICKI watches, he goes into the living-room and finds
text: his ALLIGATOR ATTACHE CASE. He opens the case, removes a
text: LAPTOP COMPUTER and a handful of business papers... then
text: lifts out a false bottom to reveal his UTILITY BELT.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry
dialog: it around with you.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I feel naked without it.
text: He takes out a tiny ULTRASOUND SCANNER -- rather like a
text: stethoscope, with a miniature sonar display where the
text: earpieces should be -- and runs it over the package.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (cont.)
text: Not a bomb. But it could be rigged.
text: Wait in the next room.
text: He takes a small GAS MASK from his belt, puts it on, then
text: SLITS THE WRAPPING with a steak knife.
text: Nothing. Cautiously, he pulls back the flaps. The box is
text: full of STYROFOAM POPCORN. BRUCE shoves a hand down into
text: the popcorn... and extracts a HUMAN EAR.
text: In the doorway behind him, VICKI lets out a squeal.
text: BRUCE grabs the box and dumps TWO DOZEN EARS on the
dialog: counter.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: ... They're wax.
text: VICKI finds a hand-scrawled NOTE among the ears.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: "It worked for Van Gogh. Let's make

speaker_heading: BRUCE

text: MASSIVE COMPUTERS click and whir. At BRUCE's prodding,
text: INFORMATION comes up on the monitor: a number, a name --
text: ALICIA HUNT -- and an East Side address.
scene_heading: INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - EVENING
text: THE SAME INFORMATION scrolls across BRUCE's screen.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Got it!
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: What now!
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Hang on. I have to leave a message.
text: HE FREEZES. He's heard something in the hallway outside.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT
text: ELEVATOR DOORS open on THREE THUGS. One of them uses a key
text: to lock the car in place on VICKI's floor. The key is on
text: the end of a ring which contains dozens of other keys.
text: The KEY RING belongs to a DOORMAN, who's riding in the
text: elevator with the JOKER's trio of thugs. He's dead, alas.
text: The THUGS dump him unceremoniously on the floor of the hall
text: and march toward VICKI's apartment.
scene_heading: INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - A MOMENT LATER
text: BRUCE is nowhere in sight. VICKI is at the sink washing
text: dishes, acting nonchalant. She pretends not to hear the
text: DOOR unlocking behind her.
text: She turns -- and faces the THREE ADVANCING THUGS.
speaker_heading: THUG I
dialog: Hi, Miss Vale. Let's not put up a
dialog: fight, huh? 'Cause we'd hate to have
dialog: to --
text: BRUCE steps into the doorway behind them. With a single
text: sweep of the arm, he flings THREE DRUG-TIPPED NINJA WHEELS
text: at the thugs, catching one in the neck, one in the
text: shoulder, one in the hip. They COLLAPSE in quick
dialog: succession.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: There's a garage in this building?
text: VICKI nods yes. BRUCE -- all business now that he's in his
text: element -- disappears into VICKI's bedroom.
text: She peeks around the corner. He reemerges carrying a BLACK
text: NYLON STOCKING, which he stuffs into his pocket. VICKI is
text: full of question, but he shushes her before she can speak.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (cont.)
dialog: I've got to take him out now.
text: He stoops down beside the THUGS and pulls the elevator key
text: off the key ring -- which he then tosses to VICKI.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (cont.)
dialog: Pick an apartment and stay there.
dialog: And listen: call the police. Give
dialog: them that address. Every available
dialog: man.
text: He starts out the door, stops just long enough to take a
text: dumbfounded VICKI in his arms for a kiss.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING
text: THE JOKER'S VAN, bearing the Monarch Playing Card logo. TWO
text: ARMED GOONS lean against the hood. They watch as the
text: elevator opens and an ordinary fellow in a suit steps out.
text: BRUCE pulls car keys from his pocket and strolls past the
text: thugs, head down, whistling. As he walks around the van,
text: his hand brushes against it -- leaving a MAGNETIZED HOMING
text: DEVICE, almost too tiny to notice, stuck to the fender.
text: He walks another six paces, then stops short. He feels
text: around in all his pockets, making a big show of having
dialog: forgotten something.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Oh, hell!
text: The GOONS eye him curiously as he strides back toward the
text: elevator. The doors are closing before it strikes them that
text: something is amiss.
speaker_heading: GOON
dialog: Hey, boss, something's up. The
text: elevator's working.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - ON JOKER
text: Frustrated, snarling, ready to throw a tantrum.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: DAMMIT! You can't get good help
dialog: these days. -- Let's move out.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - EVENING - OVERHEAD ANGLE
text: From high above the street we see the JOKER'S VAN pulling
text: out of VICKI's building. We're up on the roof, with BRUCE.
text: He hits a button on his utility belt, and a RED SIGNAL
text: LIGHT begins to flash.
text: BRUCE clamps the utility belt around his waist. Pulls the
text: BLACK NYLON STOCKING over his head. And suddenly, he's
text: BOUNDING ACROSS THE ROOFTOPS in pursuit of the JOKER.
scene_heading: EXT. CROSS STREET - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING
text: The VAN turns right at the intersection. Nothing unusual.
text: But for some reason, PEDESTRIANS are pointing at the sky,
text: staring goggle-eyed at the rooftops.
text: Far above them, a MAN -- dressed in a suit, a tie, a yellow
text: belt and a BLACK STOCKING MASK -- is gliding across the
text: intersection on a ROPE.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - A MOMENT LATER
text: The VAN DRIVER guns through a red light. BRAKES SQUEAL on
text: either side. In the back of the van, the JOKER GROWLS:
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Slow down, you maniac!
scene_heading: EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT - EVENING
text: As the VAN ROARS PAST, a MOUNTED POLICEMAN shakes his fist.
text: His horse shies, rears back, turns in a circle. He's just
text: about gotten the beast calmed down when a MAN IN A STOCKING
text: MASK plummets down on a rope from nowhere and lands
text: directly behind him on the horse's back.
text: BRUCE elbows the startled COP. Now there's only one rider.
text: The VAN turns left. BRUCE gallops straight ahead through
text: the intersection, hoping to cut the JOKER off.
scene_heading: INT. ALICIA HUNT'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT
text: ALICIA peers out through the window. On the street below,
text: UNMARKED CARS are converging.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT
text: The JOKER and co. are two blocks away from ALICIA's. They
text: see a POLICE SWAT TEAM sealing off the building.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Boss! Jesus! They've --
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: They'll be sorry. They'll be
dialog: sorry. -- GET OUT OF HERE!
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - EVENING
text: BRUCE on horseback, charging past elegant old brownstones,
text: drawing stares from passersby. We get a quick look at the
text: FLASHING RED SIGNAL LIGHT on his belt.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERVIEW DRIVE - THAT MOMENT - EVENING
text: A YELLOW VW BUG rips up the street at 70 mph.
scene_heading: INT. VOLKSWAGEN BUG - THAT MOMENT
text: We can't see the driver. But we do see, on the seat
text: beside him, a VIDEO DISPLAY with a shifting grid map of the
text: city -- and on it, a FLASHING SIGNAL blinking in perfect
text: sync with the one on BRUCE's belt.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT
text: BRUCE sees the VW bug rounding the corner and STREAKING
text: TOWARD HIM. He reins in the horse; it rears back on its
text: hind legs in a classic western pose; the BUG zooms past --
text: -- and ALFRED THE BUTLER heaves out a BROWN LAUNDRY BUNDLE,
text: neatly tied in string.
text: BRUCE snatches it out of the air, gives ALFRED a quick
text: salute -- and the BUG is gone.
scene_heading: INT. JOKER'S VAN - EVENING
text: The JOKER and his boys are stalled in heavy traffic at the
text: southern border of Gotham Park. POLICE BARRICADES are
text: everywhere; the surrounding streets have been roped off for
text: the birthday gala. HORNS HONK in anger.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: MOVE! Can't you do something??
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: It's some kind of detour. They're
dialog: backed up for blocks!
text: The JOKER snorts. He happens to glance into the side-view
text: mirror. What he sees there... CURDLES HIS BLOOD.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Oh my God. How does he do it... ?
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - A BLOCK AWAY - THAT MOMENT
text: THE BATMAN, IN FULL COSTUMED GLORY, GALLOPING UP THE STREET
text: ON HORSEBACK -- passing stunned COPS, weaving in and around
text: the stalled autos, GAINING FAST on the JOKER.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT
text: THE JOKER climbing all over the DRIVER. He HITS THE GAS,
text: RUNS THE VAN UP ON THE SIDEWALK, and -- at the first
text: opening he sees -- CRASHES THROUGH A POLICE BARRICADE INTO
text: GOTHAM PARK ITSELF.
text: BATMAN is half a block behind him now. As he follows hot on
text: the JOKER's heels, TWO HELICOPTERS swing into the park from
text: overhead.
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM PARK - EVENING
text: CROWDS EVERYWHERE. On the central platform where we saw the
text: FREE CONCERT earlier, an EMCEE mans the microphone:
speaker_heading: EMCEE
dialog: -- the most spectacular, most death-
dialog: defying aerial stunt ever devised.
dialog: Tonight -- for the first time
dialog: anywhere -- THE FLYING GRAYSONS!
text: He points up at the two approaching HELICOPTERS, flying
text: side-by-side in tight formation some forty feet apart.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON HELICOPTERS
text: ONLOOKERS GASP as TWO TRAPEZES drop from the bellies of the
text: twin copters. Dangling from the trapezes are the FLYING
text: GRAYSONS -- a husband-and-wife aerialist team in spangled
text: red-and-green suits. They begin swinging toward each other
text: in a plane perpendicular to the path of the copters.
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM PARK - GROUND LEVEL
text: PANIC DOWN BELOW as the JOKER's van barrels through the
text: crowd, HORN BLARING. BATMAN is moving up swiftly.
text: On each wrist he's wearing a MINIATURE ROCKET LAUNCHER. He
text: lets fly with TWO SALVOS. The first explodes harmlessly
text: against a tree. The second HITS THE REAR DOOR OF THE VAN --
text: driving it off the access road down into the brush, where
text: it nearly topples over sideways.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON FLYING GRAYSONS
text: GRAYSON has just completed a double somersault in midair,
text: landing in the capable hands of his wife. Now they're
text: swinging again, building momentum as he prepares to make
text: the return leap back to his own trapeze.
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT
text: In the bay of the helicopter stands a kid, fifteen,
text: compact, tough, and wiry: DICK GRAYSON. Like his parents,
text: he's wearing a red-and-green suit. From the copter, he's
text: got a perfect bird's-eye view of the BATMAN-JOKER chase.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Ready to go, Dick?
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: What's all the ruckus down there?
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - GROUND LEVEL - THAT MOMENT
text: The VAN bounces over rocks and bushes, narrowly avoiding
text: trees, with BATMAN in hot pursuit.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT
text: At the foot of a hill, the JOKER spies a truck. On its
text: side, in bright red letters, a WARNING: "DANGER -
scene_heading: FIREWORKS. FLAMMABLE LOAD."
text: The JOKER reaches into the back for a HIGHWAY FLARE.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Head for the truck!
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT
text: Hovering over the chase scene, DICK catches sight of the
text: JOKER. He GASPS IN SHOCK as a LIT FLARE flies from the back
text: of the VAN... directly into the FIREWORKS TRUCK.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - GROUND LEVEL - A MOMENT LATER
text: THE BATMAN is thrown off his horse by the shock of a
text: massive EXPLOSION. All at once, THE SKY IS FULL of
text: BURSTING, INCANDESCENT COLORS!!
text: THE JOKER hangs out of the rear of the van, looking up, an
text: expression of PURE DELIGHT on his face.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I love fireworks!
scene_heading: ANGLE ON HELICOPTERS
text: LURCHING AND SPINNING IN THE SKY as FIREWORKS rocket past.
text: One of them takes a dead hit on the rotor. JOHN GRAYSON
text: falls to his death instantly; a moment later, the COPTER
text: plummets into the trees with a resounding, fiery CRASH.
text: MARY GRAYSON hangs from the second copter as it bobs and
text: weaves out of control. ONLOOKERS SCREAM IN TERROR.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT
text: THE JOKER'S VAN bursts out of the park and speeds up a
text: wide, cordoned-off avenue. Overhead, THE SECOND COPTER
text: veers wildly, out of the park now, swinging dangerously
text: close to the tall buildings along the avenue.
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT
text: DICK GRAYSON at the mouth of the bay, hanging on by a
text: canvas strap. He watches helplessly as his MOTHER swings
text: into a POWER LINE and drops three stories to the pavement.
speaker_heading: DICK
text: NO! NOOOOOOOO!!!!
text: His face is contorted with rage and pain. The PILOT
text: struggles desperately to right the copter, barely avoiding
text: a collision with the nearest building. And then -- before
text: THE PILOT can make a move to stop him -- DICK HAS JUMPED
text: OUT OF THE COPTER.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON DICK
text: With astonishing physical grace, he DIVES. GRABS A
text: FLAGPOLE. Executes a perfect somersault. FLIPS onto a
text: nearby fire escape. VAULTS to the next fire escape down.
text: And LEAPS OUT OVER THE STREET --
text: -- MAKING A PERFECT TWO-POINT LANDING on his intended
text: target... THE ROOF OF THE JOKER'S VAN!!
scene_heading: INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT
text: THE JOKER hears a THUNK overhead. He casually lifts his gun
text: and BLOWS A HOLE THROUGH THE ROOF OF THE VAN.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF OF VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT
text: The blast just misses DICK. He sprawls flat, YANKS at the
text: chrome luggage rack on the roof of the van, and BREAKS OFF
text: A FOUR-FOOT SHAFT OF METAL.
text: ANOTHER SHOT through the roof. DICK rolls forward, hoists
text: his chrome spear over the windshield.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT
text: SPLINTERED GLASS flies everywhere as DICK RAMS THE SHAFT
text: THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. THE DRIVER dodges left and LOSES
text: CONTROL OF THE WHEEL.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF OF VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT
text: The VAN careens wildly toward an OVERPASS. DICK rises up
text: into a crouch just in time to see a sign which reads
text: "DANGER -- LOW CLEARANCE." He's about to get his head taken
dialog: off!
text: ONE SECOND BEFORE IMPACT a BLACK-CAPED SHADOW swings across
text: the street and SCOOPS DICK OFF THE ROOF OF THE VAN.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: BATMAN AND DICK tumble to the pavement. THE VAN knocks over
text: a fire hydrant and STOPS. DICK is already on his feet,
text: ready to CHARGE THE VAN, when BATMAN throws a powerful arm
text: around his waist.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: LET ME GO! LET ME --
text: THE JOKER steps casually out of the van. TWO GOONS with
text: MACHINE GUNS emerge behind him. PEDESTRIANS SCREAM as the
text: GOONS level their guns at the CROWD.
speaker_heading: DICK (cont.)
dialog: YOU PIECE OF -- YOU MOTHERF--
text: DICK is kicking, screaming, clawing, biting. BATMAN has his
text: hands full restraining the kid.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Like your boyfriend. He's kinda
dialog: hot.
dialog: (glowering at BATMAN)
text: Hands off the belt.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Take me. Let the boy go.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Gosh, I could kill you, but then
dialog: you'd miss my party. And I'd be
dialog: real, real sad if you couldn't make
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Batman! Don't you even recognize
dialog: your old pal Jack? After all...
dialog: (cackling insanely)
dialog: You made me what I am today.
text: BATMAN cocks his head in puzzlement as DISTANT SIRENS
text: BLARE. The JOKER and his HOODS -- guns still aimed at the
text: crowd -- back away and race off on foot, vanishing into the
dialog: night.
text: DICK BREAKS FREE and BOLTS AFTER THEM. BATMAN throws him to
text: the street with a flying tackle. The boy is hysterical.
speaker_heading: DICK
text: HE KILLED MY PARENTS! HE KILLED
speaker_heading: MY --
text: BATMAN flinches at the sound of the words. He reaches into
text: his belt and -- mercifully -- breaks a KNOCKOUT CAPSULE
text: under DICK's nose.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN
text: A taped report from the hallway outside ALICIA's apartment.
text: COPS and FORENSICS MEN mill about in the b.g.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: ... on a tip attributed to the
dialog: mysterious Batman. The apartment was
text: booby-trapped with the Joker's
text: laughing gas, leaving 17 policemen
dialog: dead.
dialog: (beat)
text: Also found dead at the scene was
dialog: Alicia Hunt, 26, a former model --
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that the TV SCREEN is part of
text: BRUCE'S BANK OF MONITORS, deep in the Batcave. The other
text: screens show the various rooms of Wayne Manor, all empty.
text: We move now to the video display of a COMPUTER WORKSTATION,
text: showing TWO FACES side-by-side: a mug shot of JACK NAPIER
text: and a freeze-frame of the JOKER from one of his pirate
text: transmissions. A GRAPHICS PROGRAM abstracts the twin heads
text: into THREE-DIMENSIONAL, ROTATING TOPOLOGICAL GRIDS -- and,
text: as we watch, the two spinning heads COLLIDE AND MERGE.
text: Except for the fearsome grin, they MESH PERFECTLY.
text: Yet another terminal: BRUCE's database. The same phrase
text: flashes again and again, scrolling up the screen: ACE
scene_heading: CHEMICAL CO. ACE CHEMICAL CO. ACE CHEMICAL CO.
text: And, finally: BRUCE HIMSELF, slumped at a table, his head
text: in his hands. He's realized, to his horror, that he is
dialog: responsible for the birth of the Joker. And frankly...
dialog: he would just as soon be dead.
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY
text: DICK GRAYSON is sprawled on a huge four-poster bed,
text: unconscious, softly moaning. He COMES TO with a jolt.
text: Breaking into a sweat almost instantly, he looks at his
text: unfamiliar surroundings. A shadowy figure stands nearby.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: ... Where am I?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: My name is Bruce Wayne. You're
dialog: welcome to stay here as long as you
dialog: want.
text: BRUCE steps out just as ALFRED enters with a breakfast
text: tray. DICK makes a puzzled face. What the hell is going on
dialog: here?
scene_heading: INT. HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY
text: Beneath the statue of blind Justice, BRUCE and HARVEY DENT
text: march through the portico, engaged in a heated argument.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: We'll send a team into Ace the
text: moment the warrant comes through.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: He'll be ready when you do. Remember
dialog: what happened at the apartment.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: All right, Bruce, what do you
dialog: suggest?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I suggest a nice big bomb.
speaker_heading: DENT
text: Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from
dialog: Bruce Wayne. -- We do have laws.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel
dialog: the anniversary celebration.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: We've told him we'll deal. What
dialog: could he possibly have to gain by --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Do you still think the Joker cares
dialog: about money??
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I
dialog: don't have access to all your
dialog: expert sources.
text: Mexican standoff. BRUCE stalks off fuming. DENT hangs back
text: a moment, then turns down the hall.
scene_heading: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - DAY
text: The ornate, wrought-iron GATE which opens on the long
text: driveway snaking up toward Wayne Manor. It's bolted shut.
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY
text: A glass-enclosed room which houses an enormous HEATED
text: INDOOR SWIMMING POOL. DICK GRAYSON does a couple of laps,
text: then climbs out and towels himself off.
text: He looks out at the estate: tennis courts, a riding stable
text: in the distance. He's not happy. All this opulence could
text: drive a guy stark staring nuts in short order.
scene_heading: INT. GUEST BEDROOM - DAY
text: An OPEN SUITCASE on the bed. DICK fingers a gold ashtray
text: bearing the figure of Winged Victory -- then shrugs and
text: tosses it into the suitcase on top of his gymnast's
text: costume. When he looks up he sees BRUCE in the doorway
text: behind him.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: ... Your butler wouldn't gimme a ride
dialog: so I figured I'd hoof it.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Sorry. I can't let you leave.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: You can't keep me here, man. That's
dialog: kidnapping.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: If I let you leave, you'll do the
dialog: same thing again. You'll go after
dialog: the Joker... and you'll wind up dead.
dialog: (turning to go)
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Hey, man. Look at you. You're
dialog: rich. You got everything you want.
dialog: How do you know what's in my mind?
text: BRUCE turns to face him. The little hellion's eyes are
text: filled with raw, burning hatred. BRUCE knows the feeling.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I don't care what's in your mind.
dialog: You're staying.
text: BRUCE reaches for a key in his pocket. Without warning, the
text: kid RUSHES him, throwing a rock-solid punch. With blinding
text: speed, BRUCE sidesteps him, parries the blow, and winds up
text: spinning DICK around -- INTO A WALL.
text: DICK is stunned, but he has to laugh. This rich boy has a
text: move or two. BRUCE stands there, silently challenging him.
text: A second later, the kid is airborne -- upping the ante with
text: a scissor-kick aimed squarely at BRUCE's gut. In a blur of
text: motion BRUCE checks the kick, swings an arm into DICK's
text: chest, and sends the boy sprawling flat on his back.
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT
text: ALFRED, in his apron, fixing a tray of snacks. He looks up
text: curiously at the ceiling. From the sound of it, a battle
text: royal is shaping up in the guest bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. GUEST BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT
text: DICK'S BODY -- head down, feet up -- flies through the air.
text: He SMASHES INTO a closet door and slumps to the carpet.
text: Shaken now, and sweating profusely, he looks up at BRUCE...
text: who stands calmly over him, adjusting his necktie.
text: A long, tense moment passes between them. Then:
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: ... You're him.
text: No reply from BRUCE. Their gazes lock. And suddenly...
speaker_heading: ALFRED (V.O.)
speaker_heading: FREEZE!
text: DICK and BRUCE look around. The puny, mustachioed butler
text: stands in the doorway, feet spread in a Dirty Harry stance,
text: a .44 MAGNUM trained on DICK.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: It's all right, Alfred. Everything's
text: under control.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: ... Very good, sir.
text: ALFRED relaxes, musters his dignity, and turns to go.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: CANNED APPLAUSE as THE JOKER marches out onto a makeshift
text: STAGE to give his QUARTERLY REPORT to the stockholders.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Thankya, thankya. Ladies and germs,
dialog: I'm here to tell you... we have had
dialog: one helluva quarter.
text: He waves a pointer at three SALES CHARTS on portable
dialog: easels.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
text: Panic's up. Terror's up. And fear --
dialog: fear's gone straight through the
dialog: roof. You guys should be proud --
dialog: 'cause I couldn'ta done it without
dialog: each and every one of you!
text: MORE CANNED APPLAUSE. The JOKER takes a bow.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: I feel it's time to expand the
dialog: Joker line. I was askin' myself,
dialog: what are the products that every
dialog: consumer wants most? And that's when
dialog: it hit me: the water you drink, and
dialog: the air you breathe! Huh? Bingo!
dialog: (strutting across stage)
dialog: Now, some of you have your eye on
dialog: the profit margin. You're thinkin':
dialog: this boy's too ambitious. You
dialog: don't approve. In fact, some of you
dialog: have been talking about turning me
dialog: in to the cops. Or knocking me off.
text: He pauses. GLARES OUT at the audience. NO RESPONSE.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: But that's okay. I understand. Not
dialog: everyone shares my eye for beauty.
dialog: And just to show there's no hard
dialog: feelings, I'm throwin' a little
dialog: shindig tonight -- and you're all
dialog: invited!
text: THE CANNED APPLAUSE goes right off the meter.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: How 'bout it? IS EVERYBODY HAPPY??
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE - THE AUDIENCE
text: Familiar faces all around -- the major players of the
text: Gotham underworld. But despite the enormous twisted grins,
text: no one here is laughing or applauding. No one here is
text: living. The JOKER is playing to a roomful of smiling
dialog: corpses.
text: One of them topples out of his chair and lands with a plop.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Look at that, folks. We got 'em
dialog: rolling in the aisles!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - TOWARD DUSK
text: VICKI lies in BRUCE's bed, under the covers, propped up on

text: looking out at his estate.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: All this apparatus, Vicki... this
dialog: house, and the money, and the
dialog: power... it was never mine. It was
dialog: something I inherited. Bruce Wayne
dialog: was something I inherited.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: All I ever hoped for was someone who
dialog: could see through Bruce -- who could
dialog: see me -- and not be frightened.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I'm not frightened of you, Bruce.
dialog: I'm frightened for you.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: In all these years... why couldn't I
dialog: see how it would turn out?
text: He turns toward her. His face is ravaged with guilt. Now
text: she's truly afraid.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (cont.)
dialog: I'm responsible, Vicki. If it wasn't
dialog: for me, there'd be no Joker.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - EVENING
text: TIGHT ON a tiny electronic device: two cylindrical steel
text: casings bracketed together, topped by a DIGITAL TIMER.
text: BRUCE makes a few adjustments with a jeweler's screwdriver,
text: hits a trigger, and watches the TIMER tick off seconds. 30.
text: 29. 28. At 25 seconds, BRUCE kills the
text: countdown and CLAMPS THE DEVICE into an empty packet on his
text: utility belt.
text: He stands up wearily. He's in his bat-suit, minus the cape
text: and cowl. Behind him, hanging back discreetly in the
text: shadows, is his loyal butler ALFRED.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Where's the boy?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
text: Upstairs. He's quite docile.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I know that feeling. It won't last.
text: BRUCE takes a moment to survey the Batcave as ALFRED looks
text: on tremulously.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (cont.)
dialog: He's a long way ahead of where I was
text: at his age.
speaker_heading: (taking ALFRED's
dialog: shoulders)
dialog: I want you to treat him just as if
dialog: he were me. Promise.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: He'll be taken care of financially.
dialog: Beyond that... you know what to do.
dialog: Don't let all this go to waste.
text: Their eyes lock for a long moment. ALFRED is unable to
text: speak. Finally BRUCE turns and starts slowly up the long
text: circular stairway which leads from the Batcave to Wayne
text: Manor. On the third step he pauses:
speaker_heading: BRUCE (cont.)
dialog: Alfred? -- Thank you.
text: As BRUCE disappears up the stairs, a shaken ALFRED steadies
text: himself against a lab table, fighting back tears.
scene_heading: INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - EVENING
text: BRUCE draws the curtains, sets an alarm clock. The current
text: time is 7:09 PM.
text: He sits cross-legged on the floor, slumps forward slightly,
text: and closes his eyes. He inhales, exhales, taking deep,

text: BRUCE has plunged into DEEP SLEEP.
text: Time passes. The clock shows 7:19, 7:32.
text: At 7:44 we TRACK IN on BRUCE's unconscious face, drawing
text: closer and closer until HIS EYELIDS FILL THE FRAME,
text: twitching with the irregular movement characteristic of
text: R.E.M. sleep. Without warning his EYES SNAP OPEN.
text: HOLD ON BRUCE'S GAZE -- grim, alert, determined -- as the
text: clock hits 7:45. An ALARM SOUNDS, BREAKING THE SILENCE with
text: its grating electronic WHINE.

scene_heading: EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT
text: The trademark ace on the illuminated sign. From our vantage
text: point high above, we can see THREE CARGO TRUCKS rolling out
text: the main gates. A half-mile away, THE BATMOBILE cruises up
text: the waterfront, approaching soundlessly, its headlights
text: off... preparing for a final showdown with the JOKER's
dialog: forces.
scene_heading: INT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: The JOKER'S MINIONS, working late, readying a huge
text: shipment. At an open loading bay, we find a DISPATCHER with
text: a clipboard, directing MORE UNMARKED TRUCKS in the lot
dialog: outside.
speaker_heading: DISPATCHER
dialog: Boston, Philly: loading bay one.
scene_heading: EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: The BATMOBILE stops short of the main gate. ENGINES ROAR
text: and the supercar ACCELERATES, SMASHING THROUGH THE GATE and
text: taking half the chain-link fence with it.
text: In the guard's booth, ARMED GOONS pull guns as the
text: BATMOBILE streaks across the parking lot and LAUNCHES A
text: ROCKET at the corrugated metal door which opens on the
text: factory floor. A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION tears a gaping hole
text: in the door.
scene_heading: INT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: The BATMOBILE cruises through the flaming wreckage and
text: SKIDS TO A HALT on the refinery floor. The JOKER'S MEN are
text: everywhere. They take one look at the BATMOBILE, PANIC, and
text: PELT THE CAR with a barrage of MACHINE-GUN FIRE.
text: CRACKS begin to spread across the Batmobile's plexiglass
text: dome. Within moments, the windshield SHATTERS -- and
text: COLLAPSES ALTOGETHER.
scene_heading: INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT
text: BULLETS rip through the upholstered passenger seats. It
text: doesn't matter. The car is empty. No one's driving.
text: TRACK IN on the computer console -- where a familiar tinny
text: voice calmly repeats its pre-programmed command:
speaker_heading: COMPUTER
dialog: ... Detonate.
text: A beat. Then: BLAM.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: A CONVOY approaches Ace Chemical -- GORDON's team preparing
text: to raid the plant. Inside each car: SPECIAL UNIT COPS
text: dressed in asbestos suits, gas masks in their laps.
text: All at once, a BRILLIANT RED GLARE suffuses the sky.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Good Lord!
scene_heading: EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: THE JOKER'S MEN running for their lives across the parking
text: lot, KNOCKED FLAT by the force of SIX DEAFENING EXPLOSIONS.
text: For a few seconds everything is flame and fury. And then --
text: All that's left of Ace Chemical is a pile of charred rubble
text: and a PILLAR OF THICK BLACK SMOKE, spiraling up to the sky.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ANDREWS ISLAND - NIGHT
text: DAZZLING FIREWORKS explode in the night sky over Gotham
text: Harbor. SEARCHLIGHTS sweep across the mammoth, welcoming
text: stone figure of LADY GOTHAM -- still wrapped in canvas,
text: ready to be unveiled.
text: THOUSANDS OF RUBBERNECKERS jam every square inch of
text: Andrew's Island. COPS ON HORSEBACK speak into walkie-
text: talkies as they patrol the edges of the crowd. Across the
text: Harbor, Ace Chemical is going up in flames -- but as far as
text: the crowd can tell, with all the noise and excitement, it's
text: just another part of the celebration.
text: At the base of the statue, GOVERNOR GILROY speaks into a
dialog: microphone:
scene_heading: GOVERNOR GILROY
dialog: As Governor of this great state, it
dialog: is now my honor to unveil for you a
dialog: very special lady -- a lady who
dialog: stands tall for life and liberty --
dialog: America's favorite lady... LADY
speaker_heading: GOTHAM!
text: The CROWD begins to APPLAUD RHYTHMICALLY, chanting 'LADY
text: GOTHAM! LADY GOTHAM!' It's like Times Square on New Year's
text: Eve, waiting for the big ball to drop. GILROY hoists a pair
text: of oversized scissors and cuts a ceremonial ribbon:
text: hydraulic CRANES kick into gear: CABLES DROP FREE, and the
text: canvas cover draws back from LADY GOTHAM's face...
text: ... to a chorus of SCREAMS from the crowd. LADY GOTHAM IS
text: WEARING A GRISLY JOKER GRIN!!!
text: Suddenly -- in the midst of the hysteria -- THE
text: SEARCHLIGHTS DIE. The STAGE LIGHTS BLINK OUT. ANDREWS
text: ISLAND IS PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS. Instantaneous mass panic:
text: the GOVERNOR shouts to his aides as ONLOOKERS mob the
text: stage. COPS are knocked from their horses as the CROWD
text: stampedes. PANDEMONIUM RULES.
text: And across the harbor... block by block... GOTHAM CITY IS
text: GOING DARK.
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM SKIES - AERIAL SHOTS - NIGHT
text: QUICK SHOTS of FOUR HELICOPTERS hovering at different
text: points over the blacked-out city. LOUDSPEAKERS blare out a
scene_heading: PRE-RECORDED MESSAGE:
speaker_heading: JOKER (V.O.)
dialog: HAPPY BIRTHDAY, Gotham. Here's a
dialog: little token of my esteem. HAVE
dialog: FUN... 'cause THE PARTY'S ON ME!
text: INSANE LAUGHTER echoes. CARGO BAYS open wide. The JOKER'S
text: HELICOPTERS begin LEAFLETING THE CITY... with MONEY!
speaker_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS
text: ANARCHY IN GOTHAM as high-denomination bills flutter to
text: earth, blanketing the streets. HOPELESSLY OUTMANNED COPS
text: try to maintain order as SOLID CITIZENS trample one another
text: in a paroxysm of ANIMAL GREED. BUILDINGS EMPTY as APARTMENT
text: DWELLERS race outside. ALL TRAFFIC STOPS as DRIVERS climb
text: out of their cars to SNATCH MONEY FROM THE AIR.
text: DARKNESS EVERYWHERE. In the pitch-black subways, TERRIFIED
text: COMMUTERS are seized by claustrophobia. GLASS SHATTERS,
text: DOORS BREAK OPEN as they claw their way out of stalled
text: subway cars and SPILL OUT onto the tracks.
text: On the streets above, GOTHAM'S CRIMINAL ELEMENT is having a
text: field day. The cops are preoccupied, utterly helpless
text: against the first waves of RIOTING AND LOOTING.
text: FLAMES ERUPT. PUNKS race down the street carrying fur coats
text: and color TV's. LOOTERS break through the display window of
text: an electronics store, and climb in among the goodies...
text: only to FLY OUT, two seconds later, on the wrong end of a
text: SHOTGUN BLAST. THE JOKER'S DREAM IS COMING TRUE.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: In a crouch on the pavement, snapping photos of the wild
dialog: street action, is VICKI -- fearless, professional, doing
text: her job. A battered FORD ESCORT cruises up behind her.
speaker_heading: KNOX
speaker_heading: VICKI!
text: VICKI sees KNOX, climbs into the passenger seat. He's
text: wearing a big smile. They're jazzed, oblivious to danger.
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A
dialog: girl could get hurt this way.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Yeah. Deja vu.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: What do you say? Let's head for the
dialog: lights.
text: In the distance, above the tops of the buildings, BEACONS
text: are sweeping the sky.
scene_heading: EXT. BROAD AVENUE - NIGHT
text: Stationed all up and down Gotham's widest thoroughfare are
text: huge portable SEARCHLIGHTS -- mounted on trucks with
text: portable generators, unaffected by the power outage.
text: On the money-covered sidewalks, TOTAL BEDLAM. But on the
text: street itself, a bizarre PARADE is taking place, just as if
text: nothing's wrong. Rumbling up the avenue at two-block
text: intervals, moored to floats, are DOZENS OF ENORMOUS
text: BALLOONS in the shapes of cartoon characters and historical
text: figures. It's like a hellish Thanksgiving's day procession.
text: The LEAD-OFF BALLOON is a gigantic, grotesque CLOWN --
text: smiling ghoulishly, dressed in white pierrot frills. We
text: TILT DOWN to the FLOAT BENEATH IT...
text: ... and there, atop a mountain of roses where the prom
text: queen should be, sits the JOKER -- smiling, waving daintily
text: at the rioters and looters, presiding over the carnage like
text: some demented parade marshal.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - NIGHT
text: A desolate rural setting. UTTER SILENCE. Moonlight glints
text: on placid waters. We track in on a small sign bearing the
text: legend: "GOTHAM CITY RESERVOIR."
text: Far off in the distance, HEADLIGHTS ARE APPROACHING.
scene_heading: EXT. ACCESS ROAD - AERIAL SHOT - MOVING - NIGHT
text: The THREE CARGO TRUCKS from Ace Chemical roll ominously
text: TOWARD THE RESERVOIR on their deadly mission. And then -- A
text: STREAKING BLACK SHADOW ENTERS FRAME, overtaking the TRUCKS.
text: THE BATWING! A phenomenal ULTRALIGHT AIRCRAFT, swift,
text: sleek, jet-black and infinitely maneuverable, it SOARS
text: EASILY past the trucks, swooping low just long enough to
text: release a BOMB over a concrete bridge.
scene_heading: EXT. ACCESS ROAD - A MOMENT LATER
text: The BRIDGE EXPLODES, blocking the trucks' path to the
text: reservoir. PUZZLED DRIVERS climb out of their cabs and
dialog: wonder what to do next.
text: They spot the BATWING in the distance -- banking, doing a
text: sharp 180. For a moment they gape in disbelief. Then they
text: HEAD FOR THE TREES as the BATWING DIVES DIRECTLY AT THE
text: TRUCKS, firing THREE ARMOR-PIERCING SHELLS... and
text: destroying the JOKER's lethal cargo once and for all.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON BATMAN
text: in the cockpit, his jaw set, not even looking back at the
text: wreckage as his plane screams off toward the Gotham
text: skyline.
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM STREET - NIGHT
text: FRIGHTENED PEDESTRIANS race past OVERTURNED CARS. A PARADE
text: FLOAT, run aground on the sidewalk, begins to BURN.
text: Above it, a damaged BALLOON -- the cartoon character
text: UNDERDOG -- is losing helium, warping and buckling in on
text: itself, sinking down gently toward the flames. Down the
text: street, KNOX'S FORD ESCORT is coming up fast.
scene_heading: INT. FORD - MOVING - THAT MOMENT
text: VICKI snapping photos out the window as UNDERDOG drifts
text: downward. FLAMES lick up at his belly -- and the cartoon
text: blimp EXPLODES.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: So much for Underdog.
text: THEN -- as they drive past -- A SECOND EXPLOSION. And all
text: at once the STREET IS FULL OF DEADLY GREENISH GAS!
speaker_heading: VICKI
text: ALLIE!! THE WINDOWS!!
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
text: The Ford Escort, windows up, swerves out of a THICK
text: SPREADING CLOUD of GREEN LAUGHING GAS -- threatening to
dialog: engulf the entire block!
scene_heading: INT. FORD - MOVING - THAT MOMENT
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: WHAT HAPPENED?!?
text: VICKI stares back at the green cloud. Turns. And sees, up
text: the street, THE JOKER'S PROCESSION: BALLOONS BY THE DOZEN!
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Oh my God. Compressor tanks. He's
dialog: got the balloons rigged with
dialog: compressor tanks!!
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Jesus Christ, the guy's a genius.
scene_heading: INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: BATMAN, at the controls, gliding over the Gotham streets.
text: He looks down, sees a BILLOWING HAZE of DENSE GREEN FUMES.
text: At its periphery: LOOTERS reeling and staggering, falling
text: to the pavement, LAUGHING THEMSELVES TO DEATH.
scene_heading: INT. FORD - MOVING - THAT MOMENT
text: VICKI staring through the windshield. Overhead, an AIRCRAFT
text: streaks past... an aircraft with SCALLOPED BLACK BAT WINGS.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!
dialog: (frantically)
dialog: Allie -- the balloons. We've got to
dialog: find some way to tell him!
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Great. How??
text: They speed up the street toward the PARADE. SPOTLIGHTS
text: SHINE. Suddenly KNOX's eyes bug out. He SLAMS ON THE BRAKES
text: and SKIDS TO A HALT.
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: COME ON!
scene_heading: EXT. AVENUE - A SECOND LATER - NIGHT
text: Before VICKI can speak, KNOX has grabbed a tire iron from
text: the back of the car and RACED OUT ONTO THE STREET. He
text: flings the TIRE IRON through a glass STOREFRONT.
text: It's a COSTUME SHOP. In the window, MANNEQUINS dressed in
dialog: party costumes: Frankenstein. Ronald Reagan. And, that
dialog: current popular sensation... THE BATMAN.
text: As VICKI catches up with him, KNOX drags the Batman dummy
text: out of the store window. RIPS OFF ITS BLACK CAPE. And
text: DASHES MANIACALLY UP THE SIDEWALK.
text: Waving the cape, he VAULTS onto the back of a SPOTLIGHT
text: TRUCK. VICKI's face goes slack. Now she gets it.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: GIMME A HAND UP HERE!
text: VICKI climbs aboard. They drape the cape over the face of
text: the spotlight. Then they put their shoulders to the swivel
text: assembly -- tilting the spotlight -- AIMING THE BEAM...
text: ... DIRECTLY AT THE JOKER'S WHITE CLOWN BALLOON!!!
scene_heading: INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT
text: BATMAN stares at the CLOWN BALLOON dead ahead. On its
text: massive distended belly... a BURNING YELLOW OVAL. And in
text: the center of the oval... THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT.
text: BATMAN'S MOUTH drops open. He understands.
scene_heading: EXT. AVENUE - ON JOKER'S FLOAT - THAT MOMENT
text: THE JOKER reaches into a big sack and begins distributing
text: MINIATURE GAS MASKS, like party favors, to his cronies on
text: the float. Then he pulls out a radio-operated REMOTE
text: CONTROL DEVICE and points it up at the CLOWN BALLOON.
text: He hits a button. The CLOWN begins to INFLATE. Its joints
text: bulge. Its FACE SWELLS UP as the COMPRESSOR TANK concealed
text: inside it releases its noxious contents. The JOKER is
text: BEAMING, a look of PURE UNALLOYED JOY on his face...
text: ... when his PARADE FLOAT BLOWS TO SMITHEREENS BENEATH HIM!
text: The JOKER and his men CARTWHEEL THROUGH THE AIR and TUMBLE
text: TO THE ASPHALT as THE BATWING WHIPS PAST OVERHEAD, soaring
text: through the stone canyons of Gotham at a 90-degree angle to
dialog: the ground!
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: No... NOOOOO!!!
scene_heading: ANGLE ON CLOWN BALLOON
text: as it rises, rises, swelling to grotesque proportions in
text: the starless night. The tallest buildings are far below it
text: now. Finally it BURSTS -- and the deadly GAS inside it
text: disperses harmlessly in the wind.
scene_heading: EXT. AVENUE - THAT MOMENT
text: THE JOKER on the edge of a tantrum as he digs amid the
text: rubble of his float for the remote device. At last he finds
text: it; aims it up at the other balloons in the procession;
text: hits a button repeatedly...
text: ... and HOWLS IN FRUSTRATION. Nothing's happening. The
text: damned thing is broken. He heaves it to the street in a
text: fit of pique.
text: A SCREAMING COMES ACROSS THE SKY as the BATWING swings back
text: for another pass, BUZZING the JOKER at an altitude of
text: twenty feet. SIZZLING LASER FIRE sweeps the street.
text: CABLES SNAP and BALLOONS DRIFT UPWARD as BATMAN'S LASERS
text: sever their moorings. The JOKER can only look on
text: helplessly, in stunned disbelief.
text: As he's watching his plans evaporate... HIS EYES FALL ON
scene_heading: THE MAKESHIFT BAT-SIGNAL.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: There. There. -- GET 'EM!!
text: ANGLE ON SPOTLIGHT TRUCK
text: A SPRAY OF MACHINE-GUN FIRE shatters the Bat-signal. KNOX
text: throws VICKI to the street, ducks down behind the
text: spotlight, and tosses her his CAR KEYS.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: GET THE CAR!
text: The JOKER'S GOONS are coming up fast as VICKI reaches the
text: Ford, starts it, and comes ROARING UP toward KNOX. He jumps
text: off the truck as VICKI twists the wheel, lays a track of
text: rubber, and noses the car back in the opposite direction.
text: GUNFIRE as KNOX jumps inside and they PEEL OUT.
scene_heading: INT. FORD ESCORT - MOVING - A MOMENT LATER
text: KNOX's breathing is ragged, but he breaks out in HYSTERICAL
text: LAUGHTER nonetheless. The two of them are totally
text: exhilarated. They can't believe what they've just done.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: HOLY SHIT!!
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU
dialog: SEE THAT?!
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: (laughing wildly)
dialog: God yes, Allie. I've gotta say --
dialog: that was the ballsiest move I
dialog: ever --
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: (ecstatic)
dialog: Holy shit. Holy --
text: He GURGLES. AN ENORMOUS GOUT OF BLOOD bubbles up between
text: his lips -- and BURSTS.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: ALLIE!!
text: His hand goes to his stomach -- and comes away bloody. He
text: looks down in genuine bewilderment.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Jesus, Vicki.
text: That quickly, he's dead. VICKI lets out an awful wail and
text: slams on the brakes. She sits there in the middle of the
text: street, POUNDING THE WHEEL, TEARS pouring down her face.
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM HARBOR - NIGHT
text: In the sky, CARTOON CHARACTERS drift lazily out to sea.
scene_heading: EXT. BROAD AVENUE - NIGHT
text: THE JOKER and his boys running like hell down the avenue,
text: past the parade. They reach the last of the floats -- the
text: one bringing up the rear -- then CLIMB ABOARD and disappear
text: through a CONCEALED HATCH.
text: WOOD SPLINTERS as the top of the float begins to ROTATE
text: mysteriously. The muzzle of a CANNON breaks through the
text: parade decorations. And one moment later...
text: A ROSE-COVERED TANK is rumbling up Broad Avenue!
scene_heading: INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT
text: BATMAN sweeps past overhead. He sees the tank, unleashes a
text: burst of LASER FIRE. It bounces harmlessly off the tank,
text: leaves a trail of SMOKING ASPHALT on the street. He swoops
text: low overhead, hits a button on his control panel as he
text: streaks OVER THE TANK and into firing range.
scene_heading: INT. TANK - THAT MOMENT
text: THE JOKER and his MEN clap hands to their ears as an EAR-
text: SPLITTING ULTRASONIC SHRIEK reverberates in the tank. The
text: JOKER screams out commands, to no avail. No one can hear
text: him. He falls on the controls, begins hitting buttons.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT
text: The TANK TURRET swings wildly. A HEAT-SEEKING MISSILE rips
text: through the night, narrowly missing the BATWING... and
text: BLOWING A HOLE in the side of a skyscraper.
scene_heading: INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT
text: THE BLAST all but knocks the BATWING out of the sky. BATMAN
text: stabilizes the plane, climbs for the clouds. When he's
text: clear of the buildings, he grits his teeth and rolls out.
dialog: He's coming back for more!
scene_heading: INT. TANK - THAT MOMENT
text: The JOKER stares at a tiny BLIP on his radar screen.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: He'll be back... he'll be back!!
scene_heading: EXT. BROAD AVENUE - ON BATWING
text: The black ultralight hurtles down Broad Avenue at full
text: speed, on a suicide mission. MISSILES streak past on either
text: side. MACHINE GUN FIRE peppers the dome of the cockpit. The
text: REAR STABILIZER WING takes a direct hit... and BURSTS INTO
speaker_heading: FLAME!
text: The BATWING, trailing thick black smoke, bears down on the
text: tank like a kamikaze plane. BOMB BAYS OPEN as BATMAN dumps
text: the last of his high explosives DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH OF
text: THE TANK. The BATWING takes a hard bounce off the top of
text: the tank and CRASHES TO THE STREET.
text: And suddenly a GAPING CHASM opens underneath the tank as
text: the bombs go off -- and BROAD AVENUE BEGINS TO SPLIT WIDE
speaker_heading: OPEN!
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT
text: BROKEN CONCRETE SLABS rain down on a SUBWAY CAR stalled in
scene_heading: the tunnel DIRECTLY BENEATH BROAD AVENUE. SUPPORT GIRDERS
text: groan and GIVE WAY as the STREET ITSELF COLLAPSES -- and
text: the front end of the TANK drops through, CRUSHING THE
text: SUBWAY TRAIN BENEATH IT!
scene_heading: EXT. BROAD AVENUE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: The rear end of the TANK projects out through the rubble. A
text: hatch pops open. The JOKER crawls out through the smoke and
text: pulls himself up to the street.
text: He's down to his last three GOONS. He points to the
text: BATWING: bent, broken, WEDGED ON ITS SIDE in the asphalt
text: SEAM running up Broad Avenue -- half in, half out of the
dialog: tunnel.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: You do him. I'm outta here.
text: The GOONS look on in dismay as the JOKER scurries off. They
text: sidestep blackened debris and move up cautiously on the
text: Batwing. Through the cockpit dome they can see BATMAN...
text: inert in his harness, beaten to a pulp, all but dead.
text: A JET OF FLAME drives them back momentarily. They reach for
text: their guns, move in warily...
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Yo.
text: The frightened GOONS turn in unison. An abrupt flurry of
text: motion -- feet and fists flying -- quick flashes of red and
dialog: green --
text: -- and THREE GOONS lie paralyzed on the street. The only
text: one left standing is a fifteen-year-old boy garbed in a
text: red-and-green aerialist's uniform... DICK GRAYSON.
scene_heading: INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT
text: BATMAN slumps at the controls. Beneath him, asphalt SHIFTS
text: and BUCKLES. The Batwing lurches to the right, drops a foot
text: or two into the tunnel. Metal braces collapse and the
text: plexiglass dome of the cockpit SHATTERS LIKE AN EGGSHELL.
text: TONGUES OF FIRE lick at his face. He's helpless, pinned in
text: place. He manages to look up -- and SEES, through a dream-
text: like haze, A HAND extended toward him:
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: HEY! COME ON!
text: And suddenly DICK is clambering down into the flaming
text: wreckage. He gets an arm around BATMAN's chest and with an
text: extraordinary effort HAULS HIM OUT OF THE BATWING.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
text: They stagger across the ruptured street. BATMAN grimaces in
text: agony. His right leg -- shattered -- is like rubber beneath
text: him. His ribs are crushed. He's barely conscious.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Now we're even, huh? Even up.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: How did you...
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: I hitched. MOVE IT!
text: DICK drags BATMAN to safety as the Batwing ERUPTS INTO
text: FLAME behind them.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: The Joker. Is he --?
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Forget it. Relax.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: ... He's mine now.
text: DICK snatches an abandoned .38 off the pavement.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
speaker_heading: DICK!
text: THE BATMAN tries to pull himself erect. The pain is
text: unendurable. His body has finally failed him.
text: He collapses on the pavement, powerless to intervene, as
text: DICK races off with murder in his eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM CATHEDRAL - NIGHT
text: A BELLTOWER's jagged spire, jutting up into the night sky,
text: piercing the moon. Down at street level, the JOKER is
text: scrambling up the marble steps at the entrance to the old
text: abandoned cathedral. He pulls a WALKIE-TALKIE off his belt.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Gotham cathedral. Come and get me.
text: HEAVY PANELED DOORS groan on tired hinges as THE JOKER
text: forces his way inside. A beat. Then DICK GRAYSON appears,
text: hot on his trail, sprinting up the steps two at a time.
scene_heading: INT. CATHEDRAL - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
text: Ancient and creepy. A huge pipe organ, shattered stained
text: glass windows, row after row of mahogany pews... all
text: forgotten, covered with dust and cobwebs. The JOKER wanders
text: about, staring at the statuary, the rusted icons.
text: DICK enters silently behind him. He kneels behind a rear
text: pew, brings up the gun, and squeezes off THREE QUICK SHOTS
text: at the JOKER. The JOKER dives, takes cover, and RETURNS
text: DICK'S FIRE. Then: silence.
text: In a crouch, groping his way along the wall, THE JOKER
text: finds what he wants: a small door opening on a wooden
text: stairway, leading to the belltower. He ducks inside and
text: starts up.
text: DICK'S GUN drops with a thud. His hand slips from the back
text: of the pew. In the second before he slumps to the floor,
text: unconscious, he sees a curious sight: a TINY BLACK NINJA
text: WHEEL, imbedded in the flesh of his leg.
text: Behind him -- framed in the arched doorway -- A RAGGED
text: BLACK GHOST begins his final unholy march down the center
text: aisle of the old cathedral.
scene_heading: INT. CATHEDRAL - BELLTOWER - NIGHT
text: A tiny stone chamber, 8'x8', open on four sides to the
text: wind. The enormous church bell has long since been removed.
text: The JOKER stands in an archway, gazing at the gargoyles on
text: the roof below. He hits a button on the walkie-talkie:
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I'm in the belltower. Don't land.
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - MOVING - NIGHT
text: A PILOT replies through his radio headset.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: E.T.A. two minutes. Hang on.
text: The PILOT swings the copter right in a wide, swooping arc.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWAY TO BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: BATMAN. Broken, beaten, his right leg useless, he hauls
text: himself up the steps one at a time. He should be dead.
text: Dried blood cakes his face, his chest.
text: Dizzy, exhausted, his body strained to the limit, he slumps
text: against a wall to steady himself, then reaches into his
text: utility belt for a painkiller -- and forces the capsule
text: back onto his dry, swollen tongue.
text: Quaking all over, he tries to draw himself erect... and
text: TOPPLES OVER, landing with his full weight on the rotten
text: wood of the belltower stairs.
text: THE STAIRWAY COLLAPSES, turning to splinters beneath him.
text: And suddenly BATMAN finds himself DANGLING PRECARIOUSLY IN
text: MIDAIR, hanging by one hand to an upper step.
text: It would be so much easier to let go. He looks down at the
text: fragments of the shattered stairway, STILL FALLING,
text: vanishing into the dark depths of the stairwell.
text: Then he looks up. At the trapdoor. A mere six feet away.
text: His TEETH CLENCH in a monstrous grimace. AND WITH AN
text: INHUMAN EFFORT, HE HOISTS HIMSELF UP ONTO THE UPPER STEPS.
text: For a full five seconds he's blind with pain. A RAGGED
text: WOODEN SHAFT is buried in his right shoulder. Twitching,
text: trembling, he reaches up and YANKS IT OUT with his last
dialog: ounce of strength.
text: The trapdoor is a foot above his head. It could be a mile.
text: BATMAN finally realizes he's not going to make it.
text: He reaches down and rips open a Velcro seal on his utility
text: belt, revealing the strange TIMER DEVICE we saw him making
text: earlier. Before he can activate it his hand falls limply at
dialog: his side.
text: THE BATMAN is out like a light.
scene_heading: INT. BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: The JOKER glances casually down at the trapdoor, wondering
text: what all the noise is about. He draws his gun, moves
text: cautiously to the trapdoor, and lifts it a few inches...
text: just enough to see the unconscious form on the stairs.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: ... Batman?
text: No reply. The JOKER stands there and lets out a little
text: snicker. He looks out through the archway, sees no sign of
text: his rescue copter. Then -- a look of curious amusement on
text: his face -- he steps down THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR and LUGS
text: BATMAN up into the belltower.
text: He props BATMAN up against a wall. Still no sign of life.
text: The JOKER crouches beside him and -- almost tenderly --
text: pats his face.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: Batman? Batman?
text: THE BATMAN's lips part. But he's too weak to speak.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: I thought you'd be more comfortable
text: here in the belfry.
dialog: (chuckling to himself)
dialog: Before I kill you I'd like to see
dialog: who you are. Would that be okay?
text: BATMAN emits a tiny low moan. The JOKER takes it as a yes
text: and reaches over to undo his cowl.
text: BRUCE WAYNE stares up with dulled, sightless eyes. The
text: JOKER reaches into his pocket for a purple handkerchief,
text: moistens it, dabs at the caked blood on BRUCE's face.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: Oh my, aren't we pretty.
dialog: (brightening suddenly)
dialog: I know you! You're the rich boy!!
text: The JOKER is enormously tickled by this discovery. He claps
text: his hands together in sheer glee.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: My goodness, what in the world made
dialog: you do it? It must've been
dialog: something pretty terrible!
text: He's practically dancing now. He's made a friend.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: You know, we should've sat down and
dialog: had us a little heart-to-heart. I
dialog: bet we would have got on famously.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Mad... man...
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Well now, you're not exactly the
dialog: picture of mental health, are you.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: ... Murderer...
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Bruce, we're both murderers. Think
dialog: how many people you've killed by
dialog: letting me live.
text: A SPOTLIGHT cuts through the night sky. The JOKER hears his
text: helicopter approaching in the distance.
text: BRUCE reaches down furtively. Finds the timer on his
text: utility belt. FLICKS A SWITCH... and the countdown begins.
text: The JOKER pulls a straight razor from his pocket and opens
text: it gingerly.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: I have to do it now, Bruce, but it
dialog: won't even hurt. Now relax. The
dialog: bat's in his belfry, all's right
dialog: with the world...
text: He has the razor almost up to BRUCE's throat when BRUCE
text: reaches out and GRABS HIS LAPELS in a death grip. The JOKER
text: is momentarily amused by this seeming display of affection.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: Why, Bruce...
text: Then he hears ticking.
text: Looks down at the flashing digital display on BRUCE's belt.
dialog: 0:26 seconds. 0:25 seconds.
text: He SHRIEKS HORRIFICALLY and DROPS THE RAZOR.
text: BRUCE won't let go of him. Finally he manages to lurch
text: convulsively away, sprawling on the floor of the belfry.
text: BRUCE is wearing a great big Joker smile.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: IT'S NOT FUNNY!!!
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: No... sense... of humor?
text: The JOKER reaches out for the ticking time bomb. Thinks
text: better of it and retracts his shaking hand.
text: He can see the copter approaching now, slicing through the
text: clouds. He screams, waves a flashlight in the air: his
text: signal beacon. 0:20 and counting.
text: The JOKER scans the belltower frantically. His eyes fall on
text: the trapdoor. He races over, flings it open, starts down
text: the stairs in a frenzy.
text: There are no stairs. They've collapsed. 0:16 and
dialog: counting.
text: Screaming insanely, the JOKER vaults through the door and
text: makes for the open stone archway. The copter is directly
text: overhead now. A rope ladder drops from its belly.
scene_heading: EXT. BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT
text: The helicopter descends, its whirling blades stirring up a
text: windstorm on the roof of the old abandoned cathedral. DEAD
text: LEAVES rise and swirl in the churning air.
scene_heading: INT. BELLTOWER
text: The JOKER makes a futile grab at the rope ladder, almost
text: losing his purchase on the archway parapet. He gestures
text: wildly for the copter to make another pass. 0:12 to go.
scene_heading: EXT. BELLTOWER
text: A maelstrom of swirling leaves. And now, among the leaves
text: -- roused from their resting place in the rotten rafters of
dialog: the old cathedral --
text: -- A HORDE OF SQUEALING, CHITTERING BATS!! Filling the air
text: like a black cloud, HUNDREDS OF THEM, taking flight in
text: blind uncomprehending fury --
scene_heading: INT. BELLTOWER
text: The JOKER leaps into empty space, grabs hold of the ladder,
text: cackles in mad triumph --
text: -- AND SUDDENLY THE BELLTOWER IS FULL OF BATS. A SCREECHING
text: SWARM, HIDEOUS, BLACK-WINGED -- SWOOPING THROUGH THE
text: ARCHWAYS DIRECTLY AT THE JOKER --
scene_heading: -- WHO SCREAMS IN TERROR -- LETS GO OF THE LADDER --
text: -- and plunges into the night.
text: TIGHT ON BATMAN. Six seconds remain. There is still time if
text: he makes his choice now.
text: Surrounded by the flapping of leathery wings, his body
text: working on pure adrenalin, he unbuckles the belt. Lurches
text: into position. Heaves it out into the darkness.
text: It snags on the bottom rung of the dangling rope ladder.
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - POV CO-PILOT
text: The CO-PILOT is hanging out one side of the copter, just
dialog: enough to see what's going on.
speaker_heading: CO-PILOT
dialog: PULL UP!! PULL --
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCHYARD - OVERHEAD ANGLE
text: It's as if time has stopped. The world has grown suddenly
text: silent. We're looking down at the JOKER, whose body lies
text: splayed and broken on the flagstone surface of the
dialog: churchyard. Slowly, elegantly -- we have all the time in
text: the world, now -- we DRIFT DOWNWARD, closer, until his FACE
text: FILLS THE SCREEN, the familiar chilling grin still intact.
text: Sad clown, A-one crazy boy, staring aimlessly at the stars.
text: Suddenly his face is bathed in a brilliant gasoline GLOW.
speaker_heading: POV JOKER
text: Looking up he sees a beautiful display of fireworks,
text: bursting and burning, spirals of color snaking through the
text: sky as the helicopter explodes in eerie silence.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE - THE JOKER'S FACE
text: It's all so lovely. The JOKER's expression is happy, almost
text: childlike, as he gazes up at this private show. Gradually,
text: though, the bright colors fade; and the JOKER's face begins
text: to relax, the twisted grin dissolving at last as darkness
text: sets in.
scene_heading: FADE THROUGH TO:
scene_heading: INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT
text: AN ANCHORWOMAN delivering an oncamera EDITORIAL.
speaker_heading: ANCHORWOMAN
dialog: As the details of the Joker's
text: heinous plan become known, a city's
text: gratitude goes out to the mysterious
text: Batman. His whereabouts remain
dialog: unknown, but Batman -- if you're
dialog: alive -- if you're listening --
dialog: thank you.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
text: VICKI at a fresh gravesite. She places a FLORAL ARRANGEMENT
text: in the urn at the head of the grave; stands back to examine
text: it; then bends once more to reposition the drooping
dialog: flowers.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I loved you too.
text: As soon as the words come out, she begins to CRY. Then she
text: gets hold of herself; rises; turns up her collar; and goes.
text: The headstone reads: "ALEXANDER KNOX, 1956-1987."
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - STUDY - DAY
text: ALFRED, in his apron, on the phone.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: No, Mr. Wayne is in Thailand. I'm
text: afraid he's quite unreachable.
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY
text: The glass-enclosed room which houses BRUCE's Olympic-sized
text: SWIMMING POOL. Outside, snow is falling.
text: In the pool, on an inflatable rubber raft, is BRUCE WAYNE.
text: Beside him, waist-deep is the water, is VICKI -- helping
text: him rehabilitate his leg and shoulder.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I don't know why I'm doing this. I
dialog: half wish you'd stay a cripple.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Ohhhh... you don't mean that.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: (grasping for words)
dialog: I don't, but... I do. It's just... I
dialog: love you, Bruce. I --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (taking her hand)
dialog: Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or
dialog: all of me?
text: A hard question for VICKI to answer. She thinks it over for
text: several beats, then SMILES... SLOWLY, SADLY.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I guess you did it, didn't you. You
dialog: saved everyone.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Almost.
text: For a moment he stares deeply into her eyes. Then he pulls
text: her over, takes her in a tight embrace.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I don't know how to explain this so
dialog: it makes sense... but you saved
dialog: me.
scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT - DAY
text: DICK GRAYSON stands at the brink of the bottomless pit and
text: looks up at the GYMNAST'S RINGS suspended overhead. He sets
text: his jaw and then -- with only a moment's hesitation --
text: LEAPS INTO THE VOID.
text: His hands find the rings. He launches himself HIGH INTO THE
text: AIR and does a spectacular TRIPLE SOMERSAULT, catching the
text: rings on his way down.
text: Exhilarated, he makes a perfect landing on the edge of the
text: pit. 10-point-0. A SMILE OF PLEASURE comes to his lips.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - GOTHAM CITY - NIGHT
text: A dark, moonless night. LIGHTS OF THE CITY sparkle in the
text: distance. CAMERA DRIFTS across the rooftop, settling
text: finally on the broad back of a BLACK-CAPED FIGURE poised at
text: the edge of the roof, gazing down on the streets below.
text: A SECOND FIGURE enters frame. We get a brief glimpse of his
text: RED-AND-GREEN SUIT in the seconds before our EYES TURN
text: SKYWARD... to the SEARING YELLOW SPOTLIGHT sweeping through
text: the clouds. In its center: the VAST BLACK SILHOUETTE of a
text: BAT, wings extended, DOMINATING the night sky.
text: We HOLD on the GLARING BAT-SIGNAL as BATMAN and ROBIN
text: vanish over the edge of the roof, plunging down toward new
dialog: adventures. MUSIC BUILDS and we
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
