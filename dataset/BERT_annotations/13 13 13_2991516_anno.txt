speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: QUENTIN
dialog: Don’t mention it.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: So... where was I?
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: The dog had killed the neighbors
dialog: rabbit.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh yea. So the dog had killed my
dialog: neighbor's rabbit. So after I
dialog: panicked a little, my girl said
dialog: that we could cover it up. See the
dialog: neighbors were out of town and they
dialog: just had this generic white rabbit.
dialog: So I rushed to the store and got
text: another and put it in the cage.
dialog: Figured they would be none the
dialog: wiser.
text: Trevor starts laughing. Encouraged by Trevor’s laugh Joe
text: continues with more excitement. Jack seems to be drifting
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: So that’s not the best part. The
dialog: best part is, a few days later, Mr.
text: And Mrs. come home. I hear a blood
text: curdling scream, like the wife was

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Ain’t that the craziest story you
dialog: ever heard?
speaker_heading: QUENTIN
dialog: Yeah, it was even crazier the first

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oprah told my story? How’d she hear
dialog: it? I don’t remember tellin her

speaker_heading: QUENTIN

speaker_heading: QUENTIN
dialog: Are you kidding me bud? All you did
dialog: was sleep last night.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I didn’t get back to sleep after I

dialog: Next thing you’re gonna do is tell
dialog: me you're wetting your bed.
dialog: Nightmares... Ha!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Quentin, shut up...

text: CANDACE sitting down next to a hospital bed and leaning on
text: it. In the bed is an unconscious young boy, JIMMY [9].
text: Jack looks at them for a couple of seconds. He then turns
text: back to the door of his wife’s room. Jack stares at the 13 on
text: the door for a couple of seconds then puts his hand on the

text: closes slowly behind him.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 13- DAY
text: Jack walks into the room, locking the door behind him. In the
text: hospital bed, Marcy is laying there heavily sedated. She is
dialog: motionless.
text: Jack turns around and locks the door behind him. He then
text: walks over to his wife and kisses her on the forehead with a
text: long and lingering kiss. He then walks over to the armchair
text: next to her and sits down. Tired and overwhelmed by

scene_heading: INT. JACK’S LIVING ROOM - DREAM WORLD
text: Jack slowly opens his eyes. He is no longer in the hospital
text: bedroom. Instead he is standing in his living room, however
text: it doesn’t look like his living room. The paint on the walls
text: is slightly peeling and smeared in blood. On the walls are
text: three giant 13's.
text: The strangest thing Jack sees is Candace, the woman who was
text: in the room next door, standing in the center of his living
text: room and crying.
text: The walls around her as well as the floor are beginning to
text: deteriorate as if the house has been set on fire.
text: Jack is drawn to her. He starts to walk towards her. He
text: reaches out his hand to her.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Help me, Jack!
text: Jack keeps reaching for her but it seems like something is
text: holding him back. His legs are stuck in the ground and the
text: room is stretching.
text: Jack turns to look at the windows. A mob of people run
text: towards the window and start banging on them loudly.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 13- DAY
text: Jack wakes up in the hospital room. There is a bang on the
text: door. Someone tries to turn the doorknob. When it doesn't
text: turn, because it is locked from the inside, they begin
text: jiggling it.
text: Marcy is starting to stir in her bed. Jack looks uneasy. He
text: gets up and starts walking towards the door to see who it is.
text: He approaches slowly.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR #1 (0.S.)

speaker_heading: TREVOR

speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: I am so sorry, Kendra.
text: As if in a trance, Kendra moves over to being positioned

speaker_heading: KENDRA
dialog: I can play too.
text: She suddenly starts vigorously banging her head into the
text: center of the target on the concrete. Shocked, Trevor tries
dialog: to stop her.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: Kendra, no!
text: He grabs her from behind and tries to drag her away. She
text: seems a lot stronger then she should be. Trevor has trouble
text: pulling her away.
speaker_heading: TREVOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Kendra, stop!
text: Trevor tries to even harder to stop her. She throws her hand
text: back at him and scratches him in the face. He gets her to
text: stop. Her forehead is bloody from banging it on the concrete.
text: She head butts him in the face, busting his nose open.
speaker_heading: TREVOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck you, you little whore!

speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: It affects everyone differently at
dialog: different speeds. Some go full
dialog: crazy, some are only crazy for a
dialog: few moments at a time. I’m all for
dialog: going to try and rescue your kid
dialog: but it affects children the
dialog: quickest.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The news is full of shit anyway.
dialog: I’m not crazy so obviously it
dialog: doesn't affect everyone.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: I don’t know that you aren’t crazy.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: If I was crazy I would have killed
dialog: you by now, right?
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: So at least we know you and I

text: Candace shivers.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: CANDACE

speaker_heading: CANDACE

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: You wont believe me if I tried to

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: At this point, I’d believe just

text: The crazy people start banging on the Door even more.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Do you think that door is going to

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, we are three stories up, we

dialog: hard.
text: Jack nods.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Well, there are too many people on
text: the other side of that door.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We are going to have to fight our
dialog: way through.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Or we can wait them out.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're right. At least until we
dialog: know they aren’t on the other side
dialog: of that door.
text: The banging on the door slows down.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: But there is no way we can know
dialog: that. There is no way to see
text: through the door.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: They are slowing down. We need to
dialog: get out of here! I need to get to
dialog: my daughter.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: We have to wait until they stop
text: banging. It’s getting less and
dialog: less often.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Do you see anything that we can use
dialog: as weapons?
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: I can go rummaging through the

speaker_heading: CANDACE

speaker_heading: CANDACE (CONT'D)
dialog: I found these!
text: Candace holds up a bunch of medical supplies that could be

speaker_heading: CANDACE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JACK
text: Getting a piece of the mirror.
speaker_heading: CANDACE

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: To see if the coast is clear.

text: reflection he sees nothing. It looks like the coast is clear.
text: Suddenly a crazy person walks by the mirror and stops. The

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: CANDACE

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: This one’s closed. Only a few more
text: till we get to the elevator.

dialog: no body.
text: Jack turns his head and checks the corner of the wall.
text: Standing there, pressed up against the wall, much like Jack,
text: is MEREDITH, she has an amazing body but is wearing the face
text: of some man she has killed as a mask. She screams and lunges
dialog: at Jack.
text: Jack takes a step back and swings the axe but misses
text: Meredith. She knocks Jack over and gets on top of him. He
text: drops the axe. She is holding a pocket knife in her hand that
text: is already bloody. She takes off the face mask revealing her
text: own face, which is covered in blood.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Shit.
text: Jack looks upset.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: What? What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: So did I.
text: Candace grimaces.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Then how are we going to get out of
dialog: this hospital and over to your
dialog: house? We sure as hell can’t do it
dialog: on our feet.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I know that.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Let me think.
text: Candace stands there eagerly waiting.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: I got it. We need to get a bag. And
dialog: collect the car keys from all of
text: the dead doctor’s pockets.
text: Candace looks confused.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Why’s that?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Because if they are doctors then
dialog: that means they drove to work.
dialog: Their cars must be in the parking
dialog: garage.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Alright. Sounds good to me.
text: Candace reaches to turn the elevator back on.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hit floor 3.
text: Candace pauses and turns to look at Jack very confused.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Because we should take the stairs.
dialog: Not only do we have a lot of keys
dialog: to collect but also I think we
dialog: should go through the hospital on
dialog: foot.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Um, why? That’s crazy.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No crazier then going onto a level
dialog: we haven’t even checked out. What
text: if the doors open and there are
dialog: over a hundred people down there?
dialog: We would be trapped. We have to
text: sneak through the hospital and
dialog: avoid them.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Level three it is.
text: Candace hits the stop button and unstops the elevator. She
text: then hits Level 3 on the elevator and the elevator doors
text: open. Jack and Candace slowly exit the elevator.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY LEVEL 3- DAY
text: Jack and Candace emerge from the elevator. Jack turns and
text: looks around. He see’s the staircase. He holds for a second
text: and then turns back to where the receptionist is.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I’m going to get the keys out of
dialog: that receptionist’s pocket, then we
text: are going to the stairs.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Look for a bag over there, just in
dialog: case we need to grab a bunch of
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Good thinking. Here, hold on to
dialog: this.
text: Jack hands Candace the fire axe.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Why.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I already know that side of the
dialog: hospital floor is safe. If anyone
dialog: comes your way, you are gonna need
dialog: to be able to defend yourself.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Or save your ass for the third
dialog: time.
text: Jack smiles.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Or that. Anyway, if too many of
text: them come get into the elevator and
dialog: put it on hold like I did before.
dialog: You'll be safe in there.
text: Candace smiles.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Well, what about you?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'll be fine. I got the knife that
dialog: woman dropped.
text: Jack reaches into his pocket and pulls out the knife.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CANDACE

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Alright. I’m off.
text: Jack runs over to the dead body of the receptionist sitting
text: at the desk. He grabs the receptionist and pulls her back.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry about this.
text: He then reaches into the pocket, he feels nothing. He reaches
text: into the other pocket. There is still nothing. Jack looks
text: back towards Candace.
text: Jack shakes his head.
text: Candace thinks for a moment.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Well, did you check her purse?
text: Jack feels like an idiot, as if he should have thought of
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No. I didn’t.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Well, check it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, where would her purse be?
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Under her desk maybe?
text: Jack looks underneath the desk. There is a trash can.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: There’s only a trash can.
text: Candace thinks for a moment.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Well, are there any drawers?
text: Jack sees a drawer on the desk and opens it up. It just has a
text: bunch of papers in it. He closes it back up.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: There is a second drawer underneath the first drawer. Jack
text: opens it up. Sure enough, there is a purse.
text: Jack grabs the purse and empties out the contents of it.
text: Among the things that fall out of the purse are a set of keys
text: and some mace.
text: Jack grabs the keys and puts them in the purse. He also grabs
text: the mace and tucks it into his pocket. He runs back over to
dialog: Candace.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Let's go down stairs.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Alright.
text: Jack and Candace make their way towards the door of the
text: staircase. They approach the door.
text: Jack reaches and puts his hand on the doorknob and then
text: pauses and turns to look at Candace.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Stick behind me. I'll go in first.
text: Jack opens the door and enters. Candace follows close behind.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL - DAY
text: Jack and Candace slowly walk into the staircase. Jack closes
text: the door behind Candace. He then looks up the staircase. It
text: looks clear.
text: Jack and Candace start slowly marching down the stairs. They
text: take a few steps down the stairs and Jack peers over the
text: ledge. Nothing below.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: We’re home free.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Looks like it.
speaker_heading: STAIRCASE INSANE LEADER (0.S.)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: STAIRCASE INSANE LEADER (0.S.)

speaker_heading: STAIRCASE INSANE LEADER (0.S.)
speaker_heading: (CONT'D)
dialog: And they're off! With Candace
dialog: taking an early lead followed
text: closely by random douche bag with
text: Mellow Yellow hot on the tail.
text: Jack looks back while running. He sees a group of five
text: crazies rounding the corner and gaining on them. They are
text: pushing each other to get ahead.
speaker_heading: STAIRCASE INSANE LEADER (0.S.)
speaker_heading: (CONT'D)
dialog: And it looks like Number 13 is
dialog: gaining on Mellow Yellow and
text: starting to break away from the
dialog: pack.
text: Jack and Candace have ran down multiple flights of stairs and
text: are just about to hit the ground level. Jack sees that the
text: crazy people are very close to them.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Candace, open the door!
text: Candace grabs the door to level one and opens it. Jack grabs
text: the pepper spray out of his pocket and covers his face. He
text: sprays it back at the crazies and runs out through the door
text: taking Candace with him and quickly closing it behind him.
text: The five crazy people start screaming and coughing. They fall
text: down the flight of stairs. One cracks his head open on the
text: concrete staircase. Another falls and breaks his neck. Jack
dialog: effectively immobilized all of them
scene_heading: STAIRCASE CRAZY #1
dialog: My eyes!
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY/LEVEL 1 - DAY
text: Candace and Jack are standing on the other side of the
text: staircase door with their backs pressed up against it. There
text: is a wall blocking the main lobby.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Jack hears some whistling. Jack presses his body up against
text: the wall and starts walking with it, Candace does the same.
text: Jack gets to the edge of the wall and turns his head to look
text: into the lobby. In front of him the lobby is dilapidated. It
text: looks as if a train has hit it. Trash cans are overturned.
text: Dead bodies litter the ground. There are many bodies of
text: doctors on the ground. There is one live woman. Jack quickly
text: sticks his arm out and holds Candace against the wall. The
text: woman is whistling while in the middle of stabbing a doctor
text: repeatedly in the face. She looks in Jack's direction for a
text: long hard stare, then she stabs the doctor in the face one
text: more time and skips away. She goes to the elevator and enters
dialog: it.
text: Jack gets off of the wall and walks into the lobby.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Grab all the car keys from all the
text: doctors’ pockets and toss them in
dialog: the purse.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Then what?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Then we are going to have to get
text: out of here through the front.
text: Jack starts walking towards a dead doctor to grab the keys
text: from his pocket.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: And run to the parking garage?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Exactly. We cant go back in the
dialog: staircase. I sprayed mace in there.
dialog: It hasn't ventilated. I may have
dialog: immobilized all those guys but we
dialog: sure as hell can’t get through that
text: cloud of mace.
text: Jack pulls out some keys from the doctor’s pocket and tosses
dialog: it to Candace.
text: Candace catches the keys and puts them in her purse.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Nice catch.

text: through his pocket.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyway we gotta do this quick. The
dialog: pepper spray is only going to last
dialog: on them for ten minutes. Fifteen if
dialog: we are lucky.
text: Jack finds some keys in the doctor’s pocket and pulls them
text: out. Jack tosses Candace the keys from the dead doctor's
dialog: pocket.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: How do you know that?
text: Jack and Candace keep going from body to body grabbing Keys
text: out of the dead doctors pockets as they talk.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I used to be a cop.
text: Candace pulls keys out of a dead doctor’s pocket and puts
text: them in her purse. Jack walks over to a different dead
dialog: doctor.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: You mean before all this?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, I left the force a few months
dialog: ago.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: And why is that?
text: Jack pulls some keys out of the dead doctor’s pocket and
text: tosses them to Candace. She misses them but picks them up and
text: quickly places them in her purse.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Nice catch.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Don’t try to change the subject.
dialog: Just talk about it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It’s a rough subject to talk about.
dialog: My wife left me because of it.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: I’m sorry to hear that.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It’s okay.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Please tell me. I want to get to

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Look lady. The world is ending

dialog: 13/13/13, Mayan calendar, the whole

dialog: to know me?
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: For all I know you might be the
dialog: last person on earth other then me
dialog: that isn’t crazy.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Wouldn’t it be easier if we didn’t

dialog: Just incase... you know...
text: Candace grimaces.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Look if something happened, I don’t
dialog: know if I would want to live alone
dialog: in a world full of insane people
dialog: anyway.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Honey, I’ve been living in one my
dialog: entire life.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Very funny.
text: Jack laughs. Candace is visually displeased. She tried to
text: have a moment with Jack but he rejected her.
text: Jack surveys Candace’s face as she goes back to digging
text: through the pockets of a doctor in front of her.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Excessive force.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JACK

text: Flash of a clip of the perp walking through the gate into the
dialog: Backyard.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: I thought nothing of it at first.
dialog: Figured it was a cigarette break or
dialog: something, but then I heard it. A
text: faint scream of a woman yelling
dialog: “stop it”. I got out of the car and
dialog: went to check it out. Quentin told
dialog: me not to, told me I was blowing
dialog: our cover, but I did anyway. I ran
text: towards the house as he radioed in
dialog: for backup.
text: Flash of a picture of Quentin on the radio in the background
text: with Jack closer to camera walking away.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: I got to the house and opened the
text: gate to the backyard, gun drawn.
text: There was nothing. But I could hear
text: a woman crying more clearly. I kept

text: Flash of the perp on top of the woman.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)

text: but she was still crying.
text: Sound of the woman crying is heard.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: I could hear her. (Pause) I grabbed
text: the perp and pulled him off the
text: woman. Then all I saw was red. Next
dialog: thing I know. I’m on top of him and
dialog: I've beaten his face in with my
dialog: bare hands. I killed him. She was
dialog: only 17 years old. Girl lives, sick
dialog: fuck dies, I loose my job and my
dialog: wife, fair trade.
text: Candace smiles.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: You did the right thing.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I think we have enough keys. Let’s
dialog: get to the garage.
text: Jack tosses Candace one more pair of keys and she puts them
text: in her purse. They then start walking towards the exit.
text: Jack and Candace get close to the exit and a door opens next
text: to them. A man comes running out towards Jack and Candace.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: You have got to be shitting me.
text: Suddenly the stairs door opens and the three surviving crazy
text: people from the staircase start running towards them. They
dialog: scream.
text: Candace swings her axe at the guy running at them near the
text: exit. She connects with his neck but not with enough force to
text: chop his head off. The axe is lodged in the side of his neck.
text: Candace quickly pulls the axe out of the side of his neck and
text: some blood spurts out of the wound. The man collapses to the

text: Candace notices Jack’s change of direction and runs after him
dialog: as well.

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I guess we aren’t even anymore.

text: Candace leans Jack against the car.
speaker_heading: CANDACE

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: God I hope not.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Why would you hope that it wasn’t
dialog: just for one day?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Because then I would have just
dialog: killed my wife, my best friend, and
dialog: countless other people for no
dialog: reason if a day later they were all
dialog: going to be okay.
text: Candace thinks about Jack’s response and nods.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: But it was self defence.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: More like being impatient. We could
dialog: have just waited.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: So you want it to be like this

dialog: the window.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I guess...
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Who knows. Maybe they at least have
dialog: some leap year babies over there.
text: Jack laughs.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Maybe....

speaker_heading: CANDACE (CONT'D)
dialog: Jack!

dialog: to cry.
speaker_heading: CANDACE (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m so sorry, Jack...
text: Her eyes trace Jack from his wound up to his face. Behind his
text: head are some smudges on the window. She looks at them. It’s

dialog: girl.
speaker_heading: CANDACE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh Jack....
text: Candace begins to scream in agony and has a complete meltdown
text: in the car. After a few moments she manages to pull herself
