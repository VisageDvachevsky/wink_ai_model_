speaker_heading: A SIGN
text: Carved neatly into a lush hillside reads: "Bill and Ted
dialog: University, Established 2425 A.D."
text: CRANE UP. The sign rests in the midst of rolling tree-covered
text: hills which house a glass-domed, ecologically harmonious
scene_heading: UNIVERSITY.
scene_heading: Super: "SAN DIMAS, CALIFORNIA. 2691 A.D."
text: A GROUP OF STUDENTS (of all nxtionalities) suddenly FLOATS PAST
text: CAMERA on their "AIR-bIKES"-- cherry-picker-like "hoverpods" with
text: black panelled bottoms. They come to a stop on the ground near the
text: base. of one of the domes.
text: “As each student dismounts, he overturns his "bike" and its panelled
text: bottom fits neatly among other similarly overturned crafts to form
dialog: a solar generator of sorts. (We get the feeling that everything
dialog: here is very ecologically agreeable.)
text: As the Students, back-packs over their shoulders, gather onto a
text: hidden platform and begin to DESCEND, we CUT TO:
scene_heading: INSIDE ONE OF THE DOMES moucu. 2
text: Glassy, suffused with light, and with much surrounding foliage.
dialog: Prevalent are two STATUES: Very old men whom we easily recognize
text: as 90-year-old Bill and Ted. Beneath one are the words: "Be
dialog: Excellent to Each Other." Under the other: "Party On, Dudes."
text: The just-arrived Students separate, heading toward various
dialog: "learning centers." and we CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LEARNING CENTER - MOMENTS LATER
text: Pockets of colorfully-dressed STUDENTS flow throughout this space,
dialog: picking up various lessons on history, geography, philosophy, etc.
speaker_heading: IN ONE SECTION
text: A dozen or so Students sit very casually, looking up at:
scene_heading: A THREE-DIMENSIONAL "BLACKBOARD"
text: Upon which is scrawled one of the most elaborate mathematical
text: equations ever written. As we PULL BACK, we SEE that the person
dialog: doing the writing is none other than RUFUS, as we know hin.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ND
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: ("chalk" in hand)
dialog: .¢.then, of course, we take the
dialog: square root of the cosign to
dialog: determine the alacrity of the
text: incipient angle, thereby creating a
dialog: most non-heinous accoustical
dialog: reverberation...
dialog: (turning)
dialog: Isn’t that right, Pythagoras?
text: A HOLOGRAM of PYTHAGORUS nods, then speaks in his native tongue:
speaker_heading: PYTHAGORUS
dialog: Rufus, ereh saw tatiweh etep.
text: (The translation-- "SURE IS, RUFUS"-- is SUBTITLED across the
text: hologram, so the students may see what he’s saying.)
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: (turns to another HOLOGRAM)
dialog: Isosceles, any comments?
text: Next to Pythagorus, the ISOSCELES HOLOGRAM shakes his head. Rufus
text: turns to a THIRD HOLOGRAM.

dialog: Van Halen? wooee
text: The third hologram, that of EDDIE VAN HALEN, nods.
scene_heading: VAN HALEN HOLOGRAM

dialog: My feelings exactly.
dialog: (then, continuing)
dialog: Next we need to determine the
dialog: absolute value--
text: Rufus suddenly stops as in the back of his classroom, TWO BLACK-
text: CLAD, SEVERELY-DRESSED STUDENTS check their pocket watches, then
text: rise and quietly slip out of the roon.
text: Rufus hesitates a moment... then glances:
speaker_heading: OUT A WINDOW
text: Where several MORE STUDENTS (also wearing conservative, stiff,
text: black outfits) are stealing across the campus.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
text: Glances at his watch. Nods to himself. Turns.
dialog: 
dialog: we
speaker_heading: RUFUS . '
dialog: J.S., why don’t you take over?
text: A JOHANN SEBASTION BACH HOLOGRAPH nods, then turns toward the
text: "blackboard." He speaks in German, with the subtitles projected
text: holographically before hin.
speaker_heading: BACH HOLOGRAM
dialog: (in German)
text: Continuing with Rufus’ ingenious
dialog: theory of harmonic dissonance...
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - SAME
text: Rufus exits the classroom and starts down the hall after the
text: rapidly-scurrying STUDENTS IN BLACK ahead of him. CUT TO:
scene_heading: AN EMPTY CORRIDOR
text: Bootsteps echoing, the serious Students move briskly. around a
text: corner, their heavy, formal clothing rustling as they go.
speaker_heading: RUFUS h0000412
text: Rounds the same corner and stops. Looks: The hallway is empty.
text: Then turns... notices a GRATE IN THE WALL. It’s loose..:
text: Moving closer, he HEARS NOISES... clanking, clattering, clamoring.
text: He re-fits the grate, looks around. Moves toward--
scene_heading: A WHITE-PANELLED WALL
text: And removes his SECURITY PASS. He presses a button and the wall
text: parts, revealing a SECRET ELEVATOR.
text: Rufus steps inside, attaches his security pass to his jacket... and
text: the white-panelled wall recloses.
text: WHIP PAN to: A BLACK-CLAD STUDENT, who steps forward. The Student
text: speaks into a tiny device: |
speaker_heading: STUDENT
text: He’s on his way.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (from the device)
dialog: Station.
text: CUT TO: THE DANK, WATERY BOWELS OF THE UNIVERSITY
text: where the campus’ organically-fueled carbines and water-powered
text: generators get their power from a flowing underground river.
text: A dozen or so of these rigid, unsmiling STUDENTS have gathered and
text: are murmuring amongst themselves. Suddenly they fall silent as--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EO THEIR LEADER
text: -- a tall, commanding OLDER MAN, also wearing DARK, CONSERVATIVE
text: CLOTHING descends from a catwalk and slowly approaches the group of
text: Students (call them the REBELS).
speaker_heading: LEADER
text: It is time. They have reached the
dialog: second crucial turning point in
dialog: their destiny. The moment of their
dialog: "Great Discourse." The First Annual
dialog: "Southern California...
dialog: (profoundly)
dialog: ++. Battle of the Bands." The
dialog: "message" in their great speech is
dialog: about to reach millions. And now is
dialog: the time to change that.
text: We HEAR a little "DING" and, across the room--
speaker_heading: THE ELEVATOR b0000412
text: Opens, and Rufus, more than curious, slips out and cuts behind a
text: generator, eyes widening in recognition...
speaker_heading: eS RUFUS
dialog: «+. De Nomolos. My old teacher...
dialog: BACK TO SHOT
text: The Leader, DE NOMOLOS, walks before his troup of assembled Rebels.
speaker_heading: DE NOMOLOS
dialog: If our mission is successful, the
dialog: course of history will be shifted,
dialog: and fundamental values will be
text: restored to the world. Discipline.
dialog: Order. Consensus. No longer will
dialog: our world be dominated by the legacy
dialog: of the two...

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DE NOMOLOS
dialog: We must stop them now.
dialog: . (then)
dialog: Brothers and sisters, are we ready?
text: Automatic weapons are pulled, and De Nomolos crosses to an old-
text: fashioned WAGON which contains TWO COVERED FIGURES.
speaker_heading: DE NOMOLOS
dialog: Fellow Rebels, I introduce to you...
dialog: my Secret Weapons.
text: De Nomolos suddenly yanks off the cloak, revealing:
speaker_heading: BILL AND TED
text: standing, frozen, staring ahead.
speaker_heading: ‘RUFUS
text: Is shocked.
dialog: BACK TO SHOT
text: De Nomolos pushes a button and suddenly THE TWO FIGURES COME TO
speaker_heading: LIFE.
scene_heading: BILL AND TED mo 2
dialog: How’s it goin’, Rebels!
text: Everyone gasps. Several of the Rebels, as if acting on a gut
text: response, FIRE SHOTS AT THE TWO FIGURES-- who show no reaction to
text: being pelted by bullets.
text: De Nomolos raises his hands to stop the Rebels, then snaps his
dialog: finger. Suddenly--
speaker_heading: BILL AND TED
text: Grab their lower lips and pull their "skin" off their faces,
text: revealing an elaborate patchwork of intricate WIRING and CIRCUITRY.
scene_heading: AROUND THE ROOM
text: The Rebels stare, repulsed, at the two figures.
speaker_heading: DE NOMOLOS
dialog: Aytomatons, brothers and sisters.
dialog: only, programmed with ny

text: The Robots look around. (We’1ll call them EVIL BILL AND TED. They

speaker_heading: DE NOMOLOS
dialog: Now. What is your mission?
speaker_heading: . EVIL BILL
dialog: Okay, first we totally kill Bill and
dialog: Ted.
speaker_heading: EVIL TED
dialog: Yah. Then we take over their lives.
speaker_heading: EVIL BILL
dialog: Then we utterly destroy ‘em!
speaker_heading: EVIL TED
dialog: Then, at the concert... we give the

dialog: Silence!
text: The bobbing, robotic Bill and Teds are met with nothing but
text: disgusted glares.
text: Having seen enough, creeps back to the elevator and pauses.
text: Suddenly a hand clasps down on his shoulder. Rufus turns.
text: It’s the Student from the hallway (who was following Wwe)
speaker_heading: STUDENT
text: Qpen the door.
dialog: 
text: Rufus hesitates. The Student cocks his gun. So Rufus opens it.
dialog: And now...
scene_heading: DE NOMOLOS AND ALL THE REBELS
text: Are standing directly before him at the elevator door.
speaker_heading: DE NOMOLOS
dialog: Rufus, my favorite pupil... I knew
dialog: you’d come.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: De Nomolos... I thought you were--
speaker_heading: DE NOMOLOS
dialog: Dead? No. Just... in preparxtion.
dialog: I worked within the system as long
dialog: as I could, until I could stand it
dialog: no longer.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: You’ll never get away with this, De
dialog: Nomolos.
speaker_heading: DE NOMOLOS
dialog: Time will tell.
dialog: , roar?
speaker_heading: RUFUS an
dialog: Time has told.
speaker_heading: DE NOMOLOS
dialog: I will change that.
text: The Students train their guns on Rufus. De Nomolos nods to the
dialog: security pass.
speaker_heading: DE NOMOLOS
dialog: Take us to the booth.
text: De Nomolos pushes in, and we CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE LARGE DOME
text: Remodeled since we last saw it, it is larger,’ airier.
text: The THREE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN THE WORLD sit, as before,
text: suspended in mid-air. Their meditation is suddenly broken as a
speaker_heading: BELL DINGS and--
scene_heading: THE SECRET ELEVATOR
text: Opens, and Bill, Ted and Rufus walk out with the Rebels in tow.
text: The Important People gape.
scene_heading: MOST IMPORTANT PERSON

speaker_heading: DE NOMOLOS
dialog: Now! If you wish to spare the life
dialog: of your... second greatest
dialog: professor.
dialog: (turns)
dialog: No offense, Rufus.
text: And he slugs Rufus with the butt of his weapon. Rufus drops to the
text: floor, groggily opening his eyes as...
text: The Most Important Person looks at the others, then slowly extends
text: a GLOWING GOLDEN BALL... which rises toward the ceiling.
text: Suddenly the PHONE BOOTH descends, coming to a rest in a pool of
text: white light in the center of the room.
text: Evil Bill and Ted stand, heads bobbing agreeably as the Rebels
dialog: respond to De Nomolos’ litany:
speaker_heading: DE NOMOLOS
dialog: What is the fuel?
speaker_heading: REBELS
dialog: Fear.
speaker_heading: DE NOMOLOS
dialog: What is the engine?

dialog: What is the ideal?
speaker_heading: REBELS
dialog: Order.
speaker_heading: DE NOMOLOS
dialog: (to Evil Bill and Ted)
dialog: And how will we achieve it?
text: Donning sunglasses, Evil Bill and Ted step into the booth and call:
scene_heading: EVIL BILL AND TED
dialog: Death to Bill and Ted!
text: Rufus, barely conscious, shimmies toward a roped-off FLOOR AMP and
text: two leaning GUITARS, and just as-- bh0000412
text: Evil Bill and Ted get a "connection" and there is a FLASH--
text: Rufus GRABS A GUITAR and HURLS IT ACROSS THE ROOM!
text: The booth begins to drop, but before it disappears, the V-shaped
text: edge of the guitar gets tangled in the now-remodeled booth antenna,
text: causing Rufus to be dragged across the room.
text: De Nomolos gasps. The Rebels FIRE, but--

text: The PRINCESSES (JOANNA AND ELIZABETH) back them up. And.as the

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Thank you! Hope we did okay for

dialog: Dude, take it.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Well... like, he said... life is...
dialog: is...

speaker_heading: TED’S VOICE
dialog: (sotto)
text: At least she’s not booing us.
scene_heading: ELSEWHERE IN THE THEATER - MOMENTS LATER
text: Onstage, Joanna and Elizabeth are taking apart their instruments

scene_heading: ' MS. WARDROE

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Yah. We don’t understand it either.
speaker_heading: MS. WARDROE
dialog: You can’t sing, you can hardly play,
dialog: your songs are terrible. You have
dialog: no stage presence whatever. I mean,
dialog: guys... The Battle of the Bands is
dialog: the biggest event for new bands in
dialog: the area. We’ve even got live
dialog: coverage on Channel thirteen. Now,
dialog: if you were me, would yoy put you

speaker_heading: BILL AND TED 12
dialog: (instantly) powre “
dialog: No way.

speaker_heading: MS. WARDROE
dialog: However... for some reason, I have

speaker_heading: BILL AND TED
dialog: (brightening)
dialog: Excellent!
speaker_heading: MS. WARDROE
dialog: (quickly) .
dialog: But last. Midnight. By that time
dialog: everyone should’ve left.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: If they haven’t, they will by the

dialog: Shut up, Ted.
speaker_heading: MS. WARDROE
dialog: (cutting them off, serious)
dialog: Guys-- do yourselves a favor.
dialog: Prepare a little. Work on your act.
dialog: Think of something. Don’t embarrass

dialog: you’re going to be on local Iv.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Thanks, Ms. Wardroe. We won’t let

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Not to mention our speech.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: We are most unaccomplished orators.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Good thing we got the Princesses.

scene_heading: EXT. BILL AND TED’S APARTMENT BUILDING - A LITTLE WHILE LATER
text: The Van is parked in front of a two-story, stucco apartment

scene_heading: INT. BILL AND TED’S APARTMENT - SAME
text: Hard rock posters and history books abound. On the walls, framed
dialog: signed photos of Historical Figures from the last adventure
text: (Napoleon, Socrates, Genghis Khan, etc.). A booming sound system.
text: And, in a place of honor, two 8-by-10 PHOTOS of Joanna and
dialog: Elizabeth. But some of this is obscured because:
text: A small party’s in progress. A HANGING BANNER reads: "Happy 521st
dialog: Birthday Joanna and Elizabeth." . 2
text: Among the crowd, we see CAPTAIN LOGAN, standing with Ted. Though
text: there has been a thaw in their relationship, their manner is still
text: a bit strained.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN LOGAN
dialog: So... I understand you have a little
dialog: something else to celebrate tonight,
dialog: huh, Ted?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Oh, yah. We got into the battle of

text: As Captain Logan looks down at his. notes, we SEE (but no one else
text: does) Bill and Ted enter the room.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: So... how do we do this?
text: Ted shrugs. Spots a desk. Climbs onto it. And, as if diving into
text: a pool, leaps into the air and then jumps into his father’s ear.
text: Beat. Captain Logan goes blank.
text: Then, suddenly, he looks up from his notes, a goofy, Ted-like
text: expression on his face, and stands up. He looks at the other
text: officers, head bobbing.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN LOGAN
text: (in a vaguely Ted-like
dialog: voice)
dialog: Okay, dudes. I mean, fellow .
dialog: policemen. My son, Ted "Theodore"
text: Logan and his friend, Bill s.
dialog: Preston Esquire, have been murdered
text: and replaced by evil robots from the

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You did it, dude!

dialog:

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN LOGAN
dialog: I totally possessed my dad!
text: Captain Logan does an AIR GUITAR-- suddenly stopping when he
text: notices the other officers looking at him.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN LOGAN
dialog: ("officious" again)
dialog: Okay. You gotta go over and arrest
dialog: these robots so they don’t ruin
dialog: everything for me and Bill-- I mean,
dialog: my son and Bill-- and, most
dialog: importantly, they don’t hurt the
dialog: babes, uh, princesses, uh...

speaker_heading: OFFICER JAMES
dialog: I totally believe you, dude!

text: Then, Bill jumps out of Officer James and into the Officer next to
speaker_heading: him (OFFICER PRATT).

text: Captain Logan and Officer Gass go blank for a moment while we SEE

text: behind their erstwhile hosts.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: That was most invigorating.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yah. But let’s see if it worked.
text: They watch, expectant, as Logan and Gass, still holding half-eaten

text: dusty, reddish surface...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 45
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Whoa... not bad.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yah. can we do it again?
text: The guys become aware of an indistinct CHORUS OF MOANS and a
text: BATTERY OF TRUDGING FOOTSTEPS. They look around, for the first
text: time getting a full perspective of where they are. They are:
scene_heading: IN A VAST, INFINITE, INFERNO
text: Perched upon a rock-=- one of seemingly billions which hover chain-
text: linked to a massive CENTER ROCK.
scene_heading: ON THELR ROCK
text: The guys react.

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: This is not what I expected this

dialog: Yah. We got totally lied to by our
dialog: album covers.
text: Then, abruptly, an enormous PITCHFORK is driven into the ground

text: dressed all in black, grabs them and whips them OUT OF FRAME.

dialog: You wanna do it for all eternity,

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Excuse vs, Mr. Demon Sir. But how
dialog: long do we gotta do this for?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yah, we gotta get to a concert...
text: The Guard opens his mouth and pulls out a huge black RAT. He

dialog: (thrilled)
dialog: a Whooaa!!
speaker_heading: 7 BILL
dialog: Not bad!
speaker_heading: TED

speaker_heading: | e TED
dialog: : Yah... but not so many.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 47
text: A huge, suspended "boulder" is reeled past them toward the great
text: center-rock, with a screaming TORTURED SOUL protesting vehemently
text: on top of it. When it passes, Bill and Ted can see that:
scene_heading: ON THE MAIN ROCK - HIGH ABOVE THEM
text: A towering, shadowy, distant FIGURE is standing, overseeing his
dialog: dark domain.
speaker_heading: BILL AND TED
text: Look back at each other.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Who’s that?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Ted. Who do you think it is?

scene_heading: SECONDS LATER - HIGH ANGLE SHOT - FROM BEHIND THE DARK FIGURE
text: As the infinite scattering of chained boulders spreads out below
text: us, we SEE, upon one of them, TWO SMALL FIGURES thrusting their
text: arms back and forth, index and little fingers raised in the heavy
dialog: metal "Sign of the Devil".
text: We HEAR distant, tiny voices.
speaker_heading: BILL AND TED
dialog: (from way below)
dialog: Down here, dude!
text: The Figure stares down for a moment, then reaches to his side,
dialog: pulls a-ever and--
speaker_heading: ' BILL AND TED

speaker_heading: MASSIVE CHAINS

speaker_heading: THEIR ROCK

scene_heading: FROM BEHIND ~- THE DARK FIGURE

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You do?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: So does that mean...?

dialog: Thanks, dude!
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yah, you know, you got a bad rap,
dialog: but you actually seem like an okay-
text: Suddenly everything begins to shake.
text: The guys’ mouths drop open as A CREVICE opens beneath their feet
text: and they suddenly drop through the floor, and are deposited in:
scene_heading: A TUNNEL-LIKE LABYRINTH
text: Where they land with a thud. Slowly, they rise and look around.
text: Dozens of different PASSAGEWAYS-- like small cave doors-- shoot off
dialog: in all directions.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Where are we?
speaker_heading: BILL i
dialog: I don’t know.
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: But I guess we should try one of
dialog: these doors.
speaker_heading: oO
speaker_heading: QO
text: Ted nods. The guys carefully approach the first passageway on the

speaker_heading: AN ARMY BUNKER
text: Somewhere in the frozen North.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Where are we now?
text: Suddenly a WHISTLE BLOWS and the guys. turn as a FIGURE IN GREEN
text: COMBAT. FATIGUES..stalks toward then.
speaker_heading: os BILL
dialog: Who’s that?
text: Suddenly Ted’s eyes widen with fear.
speaker_heading: TED

speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: No way!!
dialog: And, suddenly--
speaker_heading: COLONEL OATS

text: Oats looks worse-- much worse-- than he did in the guys’ apartment.
text: He is now the meanest, toughest military commander ever.
speaker_heading: OATS
dialog: Gentlemen! Welcome to Hell!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: No way!
speaker_heading: OATS
dialog: (right in Ted’s face)
dialog: What??

dialog: Yes, sir, sir, dude?
speaker_heading: "OATS
dialog: (pointing down)
dialog: Get down and give me infinity!

dialog: 
speaker_heading: OATS
dialog: You stupid, pathetic, craven,
dialog: worthless little cretins! You
text: pitiful, ignorant, flabby little
dialog: morons!
dialog: 
text: He continues above them as the guys look at each other.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Dude. There is no way I can
dialog: possibly do infinity push-ups.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Maybe if he lets us do ‘em girls’-
dialog: style...
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: We gotta get out of here.
text: Ted nods, and, in an.instant, they both jump to their feet, push
dialog: Past Colonel Oats and rush--
scene_heading: OUT THE DOOR °
text: Where they dash into the rock labyrinth.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Dude.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: -What?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I think we’re in our own personal

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Let’s split up.
speaker_heading: . TED
dialog: Yah. That way he can’t get us so
dialog: bad.
text: And they dive through opposite passageways.
speaker_heading: WITH TED
text: As he tumbles into one and suddenly recoils
text: HE IS IN THE MIDDLE OF A HORRIFYING MEMORY:
dialog: 9
dialog: in terror because--
dialog: 
text: AT THE BOTTOM OF A STAIRWAY
text: Sits a colorful. EASTER BASKET. On it is a clearly marked NAME TAG:
text: "To Deacon." As he starts walking toward it he becomes:
scene_heading: YOUNG TED (KEANU AS A 10-YEAR-OLD)
text: And he tip-toes up to it. Looks around.
text: Then, suddenly, he grabs the basket and rushes up the stairs,
text: stuffing chocolates into his mouth, then suddenly STOPS IN HIS
text: TRACKS and SCREAMS, for before him:
text: Is a THREE FOOT TALL PINK BUNNY, pointing an him accusing finger.
speaker_heading: BUNNY
dialog: You took Deacon’s Easter basket!
speaker_heading: YOUNG TED

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Oh, noooocoo...

scene_heading: THE ROCK LABYRITH

text: the far rock wall
text: Bill looks up and screams:
dialog: You ugly red source-of-all-evil!
text: Boom. He’s thrown into the same wall, even harder.
text: FLAMES suddenly shoot toward them. The guys jump to their feet and

dialog: motion.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (looking over at Bill)
dialog: We’re totally NFL Highlights.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yah, only this isn’t football, it’s

speaker_heading: BILL

speaker_heading: GRIM REAPER

speaker_heading: BILL

speaker_heading: ELECTRIC FOOTBALL
text: And the Reaper’s "Running Back" is spinning in helpless little

speaker_heading: BILL

text: The Grim Reaper, his robe making movement difficult, lowers himself
text: -into a "crab" position for.a moment, then, sweating, falls

text: Slowly, he looks up at the guys, exhales. Bill nods
text: sympathetically.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: That’s all, dude. I think we’ve got
dialog: enough.

speaker_heading: TED

speaker_heading: GRIM REAPER
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: Don’t patronize me.

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Most unfairly.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: But we won the chance to go back.
dialog: And there are some individuals we
dialog: would like to invite back for a

text: Bill opens his window, calls:
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Excuse me, dude-- can we use your
dialog: phone?
scene_heading: MEANWHILE- ON THE STREET - THE EASTER BUNNY
text: Turns and starts hopping toward-- - . oo
speaker_heading: THE VAN ,
text: Where Ted grabs the car phone and dials it rapidly.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: C’mon... c’mon...
text: As the Easter Bunny reaches the van and begins CRUSHING its metal
dialog: around the guys.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Hello Deacon, it’s Ted. Ten years
dialog: ago, at Nana and Pop-pop’s house, I
dialog: totally stole your Easter Basket and
dialog: ate all your candy... Yes, me. I
dialog: did it. I did it, and I’m sorry.
text: And just as the Easter Bunny has forced the van’s creaking metal
text: right up against the guys, Ted tosses the phone to the BMW Guy--
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Thanks, dude.
text: -- and hits the gas, and, in the nick of time--
scene_heading: THE EASTER BUNNY
text: transforms into a great, glowing TUBE, which falls away from the
text: van and crashes onto the street just in front of--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE POLICE CAR
text: which has followed the van into the intersection. As the tube
text: shatters in a burst of glass and neon--
speaker_heading: THE COPS
text: skid to a stop, look at each other.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PRATT
dialog: You get that licence plate?
speaker_heading: OFFICER GASS
dialog: (nods, hits the radio)
dialog: Give me Captain Logan.
scene_heading: MEANWHILE ~ IN THE VAN
text: Bill, Ted and Death whoop it up. Station cuts a hand-shaped HOLE
text: in the side of the van, and then-- :
scene_heading: EXT. STREET wee een i 2
text: The van screams around a corner, turns down a narrow street, and
text: suddenly SKIDS TO A HALT.
scene_heading: INT. VAN
text: Bill, Ted, and Death peer out the front windshield at--
speaker_heading: COLONEL OATS
text: who is now stalking towards them, scowling horribly, bazooka
dialog: raised.
speaker_heading: OATS
dialog: (as he walks)
dialog: Damned useless furry maggot. I’m
dialog: gonna hafta do this myself.
text: And he cocks the bazooka.
scene_heading: INT. VAN
text: Bill and Ted look at each other.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: How’re we gonna get rid of him?
dialog: Bill considers, then--
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Dude. There is only one way to get
dialog: rid of a guy like this. We gotta
dialog: kill him with kindness.
speaker_heading: O
dialog: 
dialog: wo
dialog: we
text: Ted nods and we CUT TO:
scene_heading: TRACKING SHOT - FROM BEHIND COLONEL OATS
text: As Oats reaches the side doors to the van and throws them open...
speaker_heading: HIS FACE
dialog: Registers sudden surprise. For--
speaker_heading: INSIDE THE VAN
text: Bill and Ted have quickly organized Station and The Grim Reaper
text: into a pleasant little "tea party," replete with snacks, drinks,
text: and light conversation. (Station’s "creation" is mostly hidden
text: behind boxes and now-removed van-panelling.)
text: The guys look over at Colonel Oats and smile warmly.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Colonel Oats, what a surprise. Come
dialog: in, dude.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (nods) %
dialog: Join us for our tea party.
dialog: (extending a plate)
dialog: Honey Bun? Twinkie? Slim Jim?
text: Death hands Oats a styrofoam cup. Station pours some coffee into
text: it. Oats stares at them, jaw quivering, and we do a quick DISSOLVE
dialog: TO:
scene_heading: INT. VAN - A MOMENT LATER
text: Colonel Oats, now sitting cross-legged between Station and The Grim
text: Reaper, bazooka on his lap, Honey Bun crumbs on his chin, shakes _
text: his head.
speaker_heading: OATS
dialog: «.-¥You see, when I was a teenager,
dialog: my father used to spank me with an
dialog: ammo clip. He... he frightened me.
dialog: (teary; voice shaking)
dialog: I now realize that that’s what I’ve
dialog: been doing for these past twenty
dialog: years-- terrorizing young people.
text: Beat. Station strokes Oats’ hair. The Grim Reaper pats him on the
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: That’s an important epiphany,
dialog: Colonel Oats.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
text: (nods, looks at his watch)
dialog: Catch you later.
text: And sure enough, in a FLASH, Colonel Oats transforms, grabbing
text: another Honey Bun as he goes.
text: The guys looks back at each other.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: We better hurry.
text: Ted nods, then suddenly tightens, HEARING:
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN LOGAN’S VOICE
dialog: Tea!?
text: The guys turn and see:
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN LOGAN
text: rushing toward them, Missy trailing behind him.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN LOGAN
dialog: You two are in serious trouble!
speaker_heading: THE GUYS’

dialog: There’s no time, Ted. We’ve got to
dialog: get you to that concert and get rid
dialog: of those... evil robot you’s.
text: Bill and Ted look at each other, thrilled.
speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: Excelient!
text: Captain Logan tips the Colonel Oats tube out of the van. It
text: shatters on the street and we CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - NIGHT
scene_heading: A MARQUEE reads "TONIGHT... RIANNE WARDROE PRODUCTIONS PRESENTS THE

text: As people enter, passing the TV trailers parked outside, we HEAR
dialog: MUSIC and we CUT TO:
scene_heading: INSIDE THE AMPHITHEATRE
text: Where the large CROWD applauds mildly as:
scene_heading: TWO PSEUDO-MARXIST TECHNO-WAVERS
text: One tall and blondish, the other shorter and with curly hair, each

text: microphones, proclaiming in a staccato rhythm:
speaker_heading: WILLMAN/ PATRICK
text: "WE ARE CITIZENS OF THIS, OUR LIFE,
scene_heading: MANNING “HE BARRICADES OF THIS, OUR

text: And they launch into a strange, syncopated instrumental.
speaker_heading: IN THE WINGS

speaker_heading: EVIL TED
dialog: Those two loser human us’s should be

dialog: Station.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: The cars screech around a corner, shooting toward the amphitheatre.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE CAR
text: Logan drives furiously, with Missy next to him in the passenger

text: in the back seat of the police car.
text: After a beat, Missy turns to him.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: So... Bill said your name was...
dialog: Slim? .
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRIM REAPER
dialog: Grim. Grim.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Hmn. What kind of name is that?
text: The Grim Reaper yanks off his hood, revealing his gaunt, boney
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: GRIM REAPER
dialog: .I’/m Death, dammit!
text: The police car takes a dip and the Grim Reaper bounces up, hitting
text: his head on the ceiling. He sinks down into the seat, utterly
dialog: humiliated, as--
scene_heading: EXT. AMPHITHEAIRE
text: -- The police. car shoots over a curb and into the parking lot.
speaker_heading: THE VAN
text: Now looking like a metal swiss cheese, follows. As it screeches to

text: Things are definitely beginning to take shape.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (to Ted)
dialog: Tell Station he can do the final
dialog: assembly right here in the parking
dialog: lot. Me and you’1ll fight ’em as

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (to C.L. and Missy)
dialog: You guys help out here. We’re going

speaker_heading: : GRIM REAPER
dialog: Excuse me, but... What about me?

speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: No way.
text: And they jump down on the other side. Then, as they get up and
text: Prepare to run, they stop, HEARING:
scene_heading: THE GRIM REAPER’S VOICE
dialog: Qoopt.
text: Turning back, they SEE The Reaper, tangled badly, his robe caught
text: on the top of the fence and draped, inside out, over his head,
text: exposing his pale, boney body, his boxer shorts, his black socks
text: (with little sock-suspenders) and his black wing-tip shoes.

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You gotta keep the show going, ECQOr 412
dialog: Death. You gotta cover for us.

scene_heading: THE STAGE - VIEW FROM THE AUDIENCE

dialog: ‘Behold before you,
