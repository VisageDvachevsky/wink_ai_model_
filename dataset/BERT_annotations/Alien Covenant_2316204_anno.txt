scene_heading: EXT. SPACE
text: Peaceful slow DARKNESS.
text: Soon shattered by violence. The birth of a new star.
text: Cosmic dust floats, moving faster now, spiralling into an
text: inner, spinning core. FLASHES like heat lightning, until the
text: hydrogen in the center IGNITES, bursting into BRIGHT FLAME--
text: A SHOCKWAVE ripples out, CRASHING PAST US, OBLITERATING
scene_heading: EVERYTHING-——
text: Then we jump to a wider view.
text: We see the vast explosion is a tiny puff, the new star among
dialog: many stars.
text: All is still and quiet. The serene ocean of space.
text: Until a TINY OBJECT whips past the edge of a nebula.
text: We find it, closing in on...
scene_heading: EXT. COLONY SHIP COVENANT
text: The COVENANT.
text: A COLONY SHIP; built for speed and distance. The STARS AROUND
text: HER DISTORT, gravity LENSING as the ship moves faster than
dialog: light.
speaker_heading: TITLES:
text: Deep-Space Colony Ship COVENANT
scene_heading: CREW: 14, +1 SYNTHETIC
speaker_heading: PASSENGERS: 3600
dialog: MISSION: Terraform and Populate
scene_heading: DESTINATION: Origae-6
dialog: DATE: 2103, 239 light-years from Earth
text: The COVENANT is 500 meters long. The long central body of the
text: ship is made of self-contained MODULES, like wagons in a
text: wagon train. Jutting from the central body are three dominant
scene_heading: areas: INTERSTELLAR DRIVE; CREW MODULE; TERRAFORMING BAY.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-VARIOUS
speaker_heading: THE NURSERY
text: Like being inside a gigantic snow globe. A gentle SNOW falls.
text: Everything encrusted in a light frost.
dialog: 2.
text: In the darkened PASSENGER CRYO-STASIS HOLD, a kiosk beeps,
text: awakens. NAMES SPELL OUT on a screen crusted in ice. Dim
text: green light flickers out over 3600 CRYO-PODS, under the thin
text: blanket of SNOW ... The thousands of pods sweep up along the
text: huge curved wall, defying gravity.
text: We see the FROZEN FACES of... WOMEN, MEN, CHILDREN ... Also
text: banks of EMBRYOS at various stages...
text: The kiosk finishes the inventory, the female COMPUTER VOICE
dialog: speaks:
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: 7 o’clock. All’s well.
text: Ship’s BELL rings. The displays flicker out. All goes dark.
speaker_heading: THE BRIDGE
text: EMPTY and DARK until... Blinders on the bridge windows OPEN.
text: DISTANT SUNLIGHT spills over captain's chair.
scene_heading: TERRAFORMING BAY
text: A gigantic, shadowy chamber. Enormous VEHICLES. Earth-moving
text: trucks and machines. Clamped and tethered in position. Poised
text: and waiting like silent dinosaurs.
speaker_heading: CREW SLEEP BAY
text: 14 HYPER-SLEEP PODS. Dancing readouts indicate the health
text: status of the sleeping CREW.
dialog: We note something different about this sleep bay: all the
text: pods are set in pairs. Two by two, like Noah’s Ark.
speaker_heading: CORRIDOR
text: We CREEP DOWN A LONG HALL, we hear... someone WHISTLING...
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-WARDROOM
text: Large room, tables, cooking equipment. Where the senior crew
text: congregates.
text: One wall is a dramatic VERTICAL GARDEN that slopes up
text: elegantly from the floor. Fruits, vegetables, greenery for
text: oxidation. Hydroponic pools on various tiers.
text: SOMEONE tends the garden, whistling. Back to us. On his
text: knees, planting a seedling.
dialog: His hands are delicate, loving. This man cares about living
dialog: things.
dialog: 3.
text: He glances up as he wipes some condensation from his brow.
dialog: Is it DAVID? The android from Prometheus?
text: No. It’s WALTER. An android who looks identical to David.
text: Only his hair is dark and combed differently.
text: We hear MOTHER, the computer:
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: That’s a fallacy, you know.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: That music facilitates plant
dialog: growth.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Why do you think I was whistling to
dialog: the plant?
text: He stands and cleans his hands. Proud of his work.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: It’s time to recharge the energy
dialog: grid. Let’s be about it, Walter.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Nag, nag, nag.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Mother knows best.
text: He smiles, goes.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-CORRIDORS
text: He moves through the corridors, playing with the little bit
text: of dirt on his fingers.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Do you not like whistling?
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: I like efficiency.
text: He moves into...
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT - BRIDGE
text: The lights flicker on as Walter moves to one of the control
dialog: consoles.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: There's got to be more to life than
dialog: efficiency.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Not for machines, Walter.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Bitch.
text: He settles into the controls and goes to work, keying in:
scene_heading: INITIATE AUTOMATED REFUEL CYCLE
scene_heading: EXT. COVENANT - ORBITING ICE GIANT
text: The GLOWING BALL OF ENERGY that powers the INTERSTELLAR DRIVE
text: dims, and the optical ripple around the ship settles, as the
text: CONVENTIONAL DRIVES FLARE into life.
text: The COVENANT swings into orbit around the METHANE-BLUE ICE
dialog: GIANT. Then...
text: The ship's huge ENERGY COLLECTION SAILS UNFURL, silvery,
dialog: diaphanous...
dialog: Now, the amazing ship is something new: beautiful. The
text: Majestic sails give it the romantic feel of a mighty Galleon.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE - LATER
text: The distant SUN and the GAS GIANT, the edges of COLLECTION
text: SAILS visible.
text: Walter sits, feet up. Looking at that last bit of dirt on his
text: fingertips. He blows it away, something poignant and human in
dialog: the tiny act.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Walter. We may have a problem... A
dialog: strong neutrino burst was detected
dialog: in sector 106. It was weak, but it
dialog: could trigger a larger event...
text: On the HOLO NAV DISPLAY Walter ZOOMS IN on the NEBULA, seeing
dialog: FLARES here, there...
text: ...then a MUCH LARGER FLARE. His calm eyes suddenly anxious--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Channel all reserve power to the
dialog: magnetic shielding and retract the
dialog: sails--
dialog: 5.
text: But then the DISTANT NEBULA EXPLODES into BLINDING LIGHT, the
text: bridge filling with a loud radio-electric HISS as outside--
scene_heading: EXT. COVENANT - IN ORBIT ABOVE GAS GIANT
text: A massive SHOCKWAVE of CHARGED PARTICLES roils through the
text: system. The IONOSPHERE of the GAS GIANT ignites with
scene_heading: CRACKLING AURORAE as--
text: The SHOCKWAVE SLAMS INTO THE COVENANT-—
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE COVENANT ROLLS VIOLENTLY-—
text: The sails on one side SHRED, BURN, as the entire ship lurches
dialog: dangerously--
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE
text: Walter staggers to his feet, momentarily blinded. ALARMS are
text: sounding. The HOLO-MAP FLICKERS, WAVERS.
text: But Walter is android-calm as he flips at high speed through
text: DAMAGE REPORTS on a HOLO MAP of the CRAFT--
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Multiple system failures in need of
dialog: attention, but overall structural
dialog: integrity was maintained during the
dialog: incident--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I know, Mother. Please initiate
dialog: emergency crew revival. And I'1l
dialog: need-—
text: His eyes narrow on a BLINKING DAMAGE REPORT FROM THE NURSERY--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Fuck.
dialog: He bolts--
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-CORRIDORS
text: Walter runs flat-out, no apparent exertion, an android’s
dialog: amazing mechanical speed--
dialog: Meanwhile--
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-PRIMARY CREW SLEEP BAY
text: DANIELS gasps painfully--
dialog: 6.
text: She bolts awake, slamming into the closed plastic lid of her
dialog: sleep pod--
text: Her hands batter up at it as it slowly opens. She wrenches
text: herself up and out and into--
dialog: Chaos.
text: Most of the pods are already open. Others are opening. The
text: crew can be seen, kneeling, on the floor, puking, sweating
dialog: and shaking--
text: Sparks and flashing emergency lights. Smoke. The din of sharp
dialog: klaxons--
text: DANIELS is disoriented -- there’s someone shaking her--
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: Daniels, we -- Can you hear me...?!
text: ORAM -- intense, sternly commanding -- is at her side, he’s
text: little better than she is, sweating and ill--
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: For fuck sake, wake up! There was a
dialog: power surge and--
text: TENNESSEE -- her old friend -- helps pull her up--
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: Come on, darlin’, Jacob’s in
dialog: trouble. Jacob needs us--
text: At that, she spins--
text: The pod next to her, her husband's pod, has been damaged--
text: It's crackling with sparks and smoking inside. Daniels claws
text: at it. She can see her husband's face. He’s still asleep, but
text: twitching in pain.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: GET IT OPEN!
text: Daniels and Tennessee wrench at the pod to open it. Oram
text: tries all the electrical commands: sparks explode. Growing
text: panic. Her husband's face twitches more in pain.
text: SERGEANT LOPE quickly joins them -- he’s a soldier, muscular,
dialog: steady and responsible--
speaker_heading: SERGEANT LOPE
dialog: Stand back!
text: He SLAMS at the pod’s lock mechanism uselessly with an
dialog: emergency fire axe--
text: Inside the pod, more sparks, and smoke--
dialog: And then fire!
text: Daniels flings herself on the pod, clawing desperately--
dialog: Inside--
text: Her husband’s eyes snap open.
text: They lock eyes.
dialog: For one moment.
text: Everything is very still.
dialog: Then--
text: The pod is filled with flames. He’s incinerated before her
text: eyes. Under her hands.
text: She SCREAMS.
text: Tennessee wrenches her away from the pod and folds her into
text: his body, comforting.
text: Oram and Sergeant Lope step back. Defeated, emotional. Oram
text: sinks to the ground. His wife -- KARINE -- comforts him.
text: Silence in the room, everyone watching.
text: Then the pod’s fire retardant kicks in. Filling it with a
text: blast of steam. So we can no longer see the horror within.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-NURSERY
text: Walter bolts in at top speed--
text: Screeches to a stop.
text: His worst fears realized.
text: One of the sections of sleeping pods has COLLAPSED. Fallen in
text: on itself. A terrible image of sparks and shattered pods and
text: dead cold BODIES.
text: Death has come to the Covenant.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-COMMUNAL SHOWERS/LOCKER ROOM - LATER
text: IN THE SHOWERS
text: CREW MEMBERS shower in silence. Large room, unisex.
dialog: Tennessee's wife, FARIS -- every bit the engineer and pilot
text: he is, and equally big hearted -- shares a look with her
dialog: husband. What a fucking day.
scene_heading: IN THE LOCKER ROOM
text: OTHERS pull on mission jumpsuits, somber. Some STRETCH, sore,
text: still recovering from sleep. All anxious, tense.
text: RICKS, bridge crew, looks out a window with his wife,
text: UPWORTH, also bridge crew.
text: They see bits of a BURNED SAIL - micron-thin foil - hanging
text: tattered and still.
speaker_heading: RICKS
dialog: How bad is it?
speaker_heading: UPWORTH
dialog: Looks like the electrics got it
dialog: worst. Mostly stuff we can fix.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: (passing from shower)
dialog: Yeah, except for the stuff we
dialog: can’t.
dialog: He means...
text: ONE MISSION JUMPSUIT hangs in an OPEN LOCKER, uncollected.
text: Names over the lockers: DANIELS and BRANSON. Photo of the
text: happy couple, and a NOTE, "WE MADE IT!"
speaker_heading: UPWORTH
dialog: After Jacob -- guess that makes
dialog: Oram captain now, huh?
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: Lucky us.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Senior staff please assemble in the
dialog: wardroom in ten minutes. Thank you
dialog: for your promptness.
speaker_heading: FARIS
dialog: (passing from shower)
dialog: Our master’s voice.
text: She joins Tennessee at their lockers and they begin to
dialog: change.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-WARDROOM
text: The Senior Crew is gathered. As this is a COLONIZATION
text: MISSION the crew is made up of couples, to create stable
text: family units on their new world.
dialog: We meet them again:
text: ORAM: The new Captain. Life Sciences. Handsome, complicated
text: and ambitious, comes across arrogant.
text: KARINE: his Wife. Life Sciences. Quirky and imaginative where
text: he is intense. Humanizes him a bit.
text: TENNESSEE: Bridge crew and pilot. Daniels’ old friend. Rural
text: and wry. Solid as a rock.
text: FARIS: Tennessee's Wife. Bridge crew and pilot. His equal in
text: all things, and a better pilot. She wears a battered cowboy
dialog: hat.
text: SERGEANT LOPE: Head of Security Team. Handsome, intense and
dialog: committed. Old-school military, new-school relationship...
text: He is joined by his male partner, SERGEANT HALLET, a Security
dialog: Officer...
scene_heading: SERGEANT HALLET
dialog: (to Oram)
dialog: Sorry I’m late.
text: Lope gives Hallet’s hand a squeeze when he sits.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: Captain.
text: Hallet looks at him, unsure.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: I’m sorry I’m late, Captain.
scene_heading: SERGEANT HALLET
dialog: Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: (to Walter)
dialog: Report.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: We lost forty seven colonists and
dialog: 16 second generation embryos. And
dialog: one crew member.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: What the hell was it?
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: A highly charged shockwave from a
text: nearby stellar ignition. As the
dialog: sails were deployed for the refuel,
dialog: we absorbed the full brunt of the
dialog: storm. If we had--
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: (interrupts)
dialog: What are the chances of something
dialog: like this happening again?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Another such event would be highly
dialog: unlikely. It was bad luck, sir.
speaker_heading: FARIS
dialog: We've got, what, six more refuel
dialog: cycles to go before we get there?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: If Origae-6 proves habitable, yes
dialog: ... Shall we schedule the funeral
dialog: services, sir? For the dead.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: Let’s worry about repairs first.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT LOPE
dialog: (protests)
dialog: Hold on -- we just lost 47
dialog: colonists -- and our Captain. We
dialog: need to acknowledge that--
speaker_heading: KARINE
dialog: (to Oram, her husband)
dialog: He’s right, Bill.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: (snaps )
dialog: And if we don’t make repairs we
dialog: could lose all the colonists -- and
dialog: they are the entire point of the
dialog: mission, in case you need
dialog: reminding, ladies and gentlemen.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: We should do something for Captain
dialog: Branson at least.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: I really don’t think--
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: (firm)
dialog: No, we should do something for the
dialog: Captain.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: Well -- do we even know if he was
dialog: religious?
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: He was not.
text: She’s just entered, joins them. Looks awful, on the edge, but
text: she’s there.
text: DANIELS is a formidable woman. Tough, smart and beautiful.
text: There’s something dark and powerful in her, hidden depths.
text: She’s fond of Walter and Tennessee is an old friend ...
dialog: and Oram have never gotten along.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: Hey, Danny. How ya doing?
text: She sits. An empty chair conspicuous next to her.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Good, good. The terraforming module
dialog: is stable although the, um,
text: connecting strut took some damage.
dialog: I still need to check the drones.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I can help if you like.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: How long before we can make our
dialog: next jump?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Repairs should take a few days. But
dialog: we should make an effort to vacate
dialog: this sector, in case there are
text: after-flares.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: Then let’s go to work. Dismissed.
dialog: 12.
text: They disperse. Tennessee mouths to Faris: “Dismissed”?
text: Oram talks to Daniels privately.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: You should take a few days off.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: I’d rather keep busy.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: That wasn’t a request.
text: She looks at him evenly.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: Look, Danny, I know Jacob and I
dialog: didn’t always see eye to eye. But
dialog: I’m responsible for the mission now
dialog: -- and I need you at your best.
dialog: Take a couple days. Cry it
dialog: out,okay?
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: How about I mourn in my own way?
dialog: +e. Sir.
dialog: She goes.
text: Oram stands for a moment, looking out the window.
dialog: Is he up to the job?
scene_heading: EXT. COVENANT - “MORNING”
text: Tennessee is working on the HULL of the ship, wearing a
text: heavyduty SPACE SUIT with its own propulsion systems. *
text: He WELDS a blasted PANEL, arclight FLICKERING on his visor.
text: The BLUE SUN crests, rising over the DARK GAS GIANT.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE (TO COM)
dialog: Damn. Y'all should see this view.
speaker_heading: RICKS (ON COM)
dialog: We’re not seeing anything until you
dialog: get the array fixed.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE (TO COM)
dialog: Why don’t you look out the damn
dialog: window, pal?
dialog: 13.
text: The MINI-JETS on his suit come to life, heading to the ship’s
dialog: prow.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-NURSERY
text: The light snow fall. The mist of frost.
text: CAPTAIN ORAM stands, supervising a grim task.
text: A Biohazard-suited team (PRIVATES LEDWARD and COLE) is
text: sorting through the mess of pale corpses, preparing them for
text: burial. Zipping them into body bags.
text: It's tough, physical work and Ledward and Cole fumble with
text: one of the bodies as they put it into a body bag.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: (snaps)
dialog: Some reverence for the dead,
dialog: please.
text: They exchange a look: asshole.
text: KARINE, monitoring some of the sleep pods, shoots a look to
dialog: Oram:
speaker_heading: KARINE
dialog: Easy, Bill.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-DANIELS’ CABIN
dialog: Too big for one really.
text: She sits, hunched on the king size bed.
text: Her fingers unconsciously touching her wedding ring as her
text: eyes move over the room... her husband’s shoes next to hers
text: in the closet... his collection of old vinyl RECORDS and
speaker_heading: PHONOGRAPH.
text: Her eyes stop at the pictures of them on the dresser.
text: She goes to the dresser, starts removing his clothing...
speaker_heading: LATER:
text: All his CLOTHING, neatly arranged around the room. She looks
text: at it all. Touching his things. Feeling him in them.
text: She’s emotional now, can’t push it away anymore.
speaker_heading: LATER:
dialog: 14.
text: Photographs and holo-pictures of them. Spread out like a
text: mosaic on the floor. She kneels amidst them; studying them,
text: touching them, saying goodbye.
text: She presses a HOLOGRAM-PICTURE activation button:
text: Her late husband JACOB in front of the Grand Teton mountains
dialog: in Wyoming:
speaker_heading: JACOB (HOLO-PICTURE )
dialog: Hey, when are you getting here? I
dialog: miss you! Look at those mountains.
dialog: I know, I know, I said I wouldn’t
dialog: climb without you but -- come on,
dialog: look at that! Get your ass up here
dialog: or I can’t promise--
text: She freezes the image.
text: Sobbing now.
text: Her tears splashing through the hologram image, like rain.
speaker_heading: LATER:
text: Everything has been put away. Neat and tidy.
text: She stands in the center of the room.
text: Her eyes red, exhausted from weeping. Absolutely no idea what
dialog: to do with herself.
text: She jumps when the DOOR CHIME sounds.
text: She answers the door, it’s WALTER. He carries a little box.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Good evening. Do I intrude?
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: No. Come in. Good to see you ...
dialog: Good to see anyone.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I brought you something.
text: He hands her the box. She opens it. Inside: three perfectly
dialog: rolled joints.
text: She smiles, glances to him.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: The atmospheric conditions in the
dialog: garden are ideal for cannabis
dialog: growth.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: You think of everything.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: It's just my programming.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: That’s not true.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: If I may ... I understand that
dialog: keeping active can be an effective
dialog: method in helping to process
dialog: trauma. Would it be useful to go
dialog: back to work?
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Oram took me off the duty roster.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I wasn’t suggesting we inform him.
text: She looks at him, amused, thankful.
scene_heading: INT. TERRAFORMING BAY
text: Flashlights cut through the icy gloom.
text: The tires of the enormous earth-moving trucks tower above
text: DANIELS and WALTER. The cranes and diggers and dump trucks
text: are mountainous. Strange vehicle shapes and silhouettes of
text: hanging equipment.
dialog: This is Daniels’ domain. Her toys. She’s the mission’s Chief
dialog: Terraformist.
text: She and Walter wear SPACE SUITS. They check the vehicles and
text: climb higher in the chamber as they talk.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: -.. It wasn’t even my idea. Jacob
dialog: had this dream of building a cabin
dialog: on a new world -- like the old
text: pioneers on Earth. A cabin next to
dialog: a lake. There’s a lake in the
dialog: terraforming zone on Origae-6. I
dialog: mean a real cabin, made of real
dialog: wood. So in ship’s stores there's
text: wood for a cabin. And metal nails.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: DANIELS (CONT'D)
dialog: Which I don’t have the slightest
dialog: idea how to assemble. I’m sure he
dialog: threw away the instructions,
dialog: because he was always doing that...
text: They stop for a moment as she checks some equipment. He
text: shines his flashlight to help her see.
text: A beat.
text: She stops. She looks down over the massive terraforming
text: equipment. He sees the sadness creeping into her eyes.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: All of this, to make our new life
dialog: --- Now I wonder, why bother?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Because you promised to build a
text: cabin on a lake.
text: She looks at him. Appreciates the sentiment.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: ... There’s one more thing I’d like
dialog: your help with.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-WASTE EJECTION
text: The ship’s disposal facility. Currently rigged for a grim
dialog: task.
text: Her husband’s pod-like coffin is ready to be ejected.
text: WALTER stands with DANIELS.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Would you like me to say something?
dialog: I’m programmed with multiple
dialog: funerary services in a variety of
dialog: denominations, or nondenominational
dialog: if you prefer.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: No, thanks.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: If you don’t need a funeral
dialog: service, may I ask why you wanted
dialog: me to accompany you?
dialog: She looks
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
text: The crew is made up of couples.
dialog: That was the whole point ...
dialog: Everyone but me now.
text: at him.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: I thought you might know something
dialog: about being alone.
text: He seems touched, in his way.
text: The door slides open and TENNESSEE and his wife FARIS join
text: them. They have a bottle of Jack Daniels and four shot
text: glasses. Old friends.
text: He pours.
speaker_heading: FARIS
dialog: (hugs her)
dialog: Hey, Danny.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Thanks for coming.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: (re: the bottle)
dialog: His favorite. Tennessee’s finest.
dialog: Man with taste.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: Straight up. “No ice, no water, no
dialog: chaser, no shit” ... Walter?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: When in Rome.
speaker_heading: FARIS
dialog: Amen, brother.
text: They all have drinks.
text: A moment.
text: Tennessee toasts.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: A good man, gone too soon. Remember
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Remember him.
dialog: 18.
dialog: They drink.
text: Daniels looks at the coffin one last time.
text: Prepares herself.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Mother. Music database. Jacob jazz
dialog: mix one. Track one.
text: Nat King Cole’s “Unforgettable” begins to play. Her husband's
text: favorite song. Tears in her eyes.
text: She steels herself for it. Reaches forward. Presses a button
dialog: and--
speaker_heading: WHOOSH--
scene_heading: EXT. COVENANT
text: The coffin-pod shoots from the ship...
text: Arcing away dramatically as the song swells...
text: And is finally gone.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE - “MORNING”
text: Next day. RICKS, UPWORTH and FARIS are at their stations.
text: TENNESSEE is again working in space. CAPTAIN ORAM and WALTER
dialog: enter:
speaker_heading: RICKS
dialog: Array’s almost on-line, sir.
text: Oram warily sits in the Captain’s chair. Tests the feel of
dialog: it.
text: Then the full LIGHTS begin to flicker on. All the consoles
text: spring to life. HOLOGRAMS flash and form and reform quickly,
text: orienting themselves. Relief from the crew.
speaker_heading: UPWORTH (TO COM)
dialog: Well done, T. We’re live up here.
dialog: Come on in.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE (ON COM)
dialog: Don’t leave without me now.
speaker_heading: FARIS
dialog: Please, leave without him.
text: DANIELS enters, goes to Oram:
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Request permission to return to
dialog: duty, Captain.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: Granted and welcome back. How you
dialog: feeling?
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: (glance to Faris)
dialog: Little headache.
text: Faris smiles. “Little headache” means hung over.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE THE SHIP - “MORNING”
text: Meanwhile, TENNESSEE is working in a SPACE SUIT at the
text: farthest reaches of one of the newly-repaired sails; at the
text: distant communications satellite array.
text: Various digital and telemetry READOUTS are reflected on the
text: inside of the visor of his helmet so he can monitor them.
text: He has completed his work. He closes a maintenance panel and
text: then maneuvers the jets on his suit to return to the ship:
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE (TO COM)
dialog: Heading back to the airlock. Please
dialog: have a cold one ready for the weary
dialog: traveller.
speaker_heading: UPWORTH (ON COM)
dialog: You’re still on duty, T.
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: And the Captain’s on the bridge by
dialog: the way, so watch--
speaker_heading: SUDDENLY-—
text: The audio goes DEAD. And the digital displays SNAP OFF.
text: Silence. Darkness but for the glow from outside.
text: It's now very quiet and dark and lonely inside that helmet.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: +... Covenant, you reading me...?
dialog: Covenant, please respond...
dialog: Nothing. Then--
scene_heading: A_GHASTLY WHITE FACE SUDDENLY FLASHES PAST HIM-—
dialog: 
text: ON THE INSIDE OF HIS HELMET-—
dialog: 20.
scene_heading: INCHES AWAY--
text: HE SCREAMS IN SHOCK--
scene_heading: UPWORTH (ON COM, BREAKING UP)
dialog: Tennessee, we’re having trouble --
dialog: you --
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE (TO COM)
dialog: Ghost! Saw a fucking ghost!
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE - “MORNING”
text: FARIS leans into Upworth’s station:
speaker_heading: FARIS
dialog: What did he say?
speaker_heading: UPWORTH
dialog: A ghost...
speaker_heading: FARIS (TO COM)
dialog: Tennessee, you reading me?
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE THE SHIP - “MORNING”
dialog: With Tennessee--
speaker_heading: AGAIN--
text: The ghastly WHITE FACE, flicking across the inside of his
text: visor, clearer now.
text: A WOMAN. In anguish.
text: The face still unrecognizable, stretching like ECTOPLASM--
text: This time there’s a TERRIBLE SCREECHING SOUND -- deafening --
text: terrifying -- a jumble of mad sounds -- like SPEAKING IN
speaker_heading: TONGUES-—
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE (ON COM)
text: FUCKING GHOST! There’s a ghost out
dialog: here. Get me inside! Get me inside!
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE - LATER
text: Tennessee's HELMET is on a diagnostic table, connected to
text: various computers and monitors.
text: The crew is gathered around it. The helmet is projecting
text: telemetry and data into the air, a HOLOGRAM.
dialog: 21.
text: Then they see the anguished FEMALE FACE flickering through
dialog: the hologram--
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
text: There she is.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: What the hell is that?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: It's a rogue transmission most
dialog: likely. Your helmet must have
dialog: picked it up because you were so
dialog: far out, past our communication
dialog: buffers.
speaker_heading: UPWORTH (AT HER STATION)
dialog: It's a signal for sure. Coming from
text: somewhere in the neighborhood. But
dialog: nothing there on the charts.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Mother, can we hear the audio,
dialog: please?
text: The HOLOGRAM images pulse and shake as the AUDIO plays. The
text: SCREECHING FRIGHTENING sounds.
speaker_heading: RICKS
dialog: Gotta be an echo. Or a glitch. The
dialog: instruments took a lot of damage--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (pulling up data)
dialog: No. It’s in the logs, too. Every 8
dialog: seconds, ever since we got here.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: Speaking in tongues...
text: They look at him.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: I was raised Pentecostal. Real hell
dialog: and brimstone. This sounds like
dialog: speaking in tongues ... Mother.
dialog: Slow down the signal to discrete
dialog: word patterns. And reverse it.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Working. Please stand by.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: The Devil’s tongue is God's
text: language inverted. The language of
dialog: lies.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: I’ve reoriented the transmission,
dialog: Captain Oram.
speaker_heading: ORAM
text: On audio.
text: A VOICE...
text: Still distorted and eerie. But human. Female. Urgent.
scene_heading: FEMALE VOICE (AUDIO BREAKING UP)
dialog: .-. Please, please, if you hear
dialog: this, come and... help us ...
dialog: Everyone’s dying. They’re all
dialog: dying...
text: They are stunned. A human. Out this far.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: There’s geometric data, too.
text: Walter manipulates the FLOATING HOLO SIGNAL, eyes darting as
text: he decodes it, pulling the 3-D DATA around and connecting
dialog: points--
text: Then the HOLO DISPLAY abruptly DISTORTS, FLICKERS, and GOES
speaker_heading: OUT.
text: SHAKY BLUE PIXELS suddenly FILL THE HOLO, SPILLING OVER INTO
text: THE BRIDGE, FILLING THE ROOM as--
speaker_heading: FEMALE IMAGE (HOLOGRAM)
dialog: -..- Mountains of them now. I
dialog: can’t... They’re all dying. It’s...
text: The IMAGE settles and morphs into a DISTORTED FIGURE,
text: WALKING, life-size.
text: The image COHERES, and we can see... it’s ELIZABETH SHAW.
text: Her image FALLS APART, re-forms, as she PASSES through SOLID
text: OBJECTS...
speaker_heading: SHAW’S IMAGE (HOLOGRAM)
dialog: -.. Please come ... Please help
dialog: us... We don’t know what...
text: SHAW’S IMAGE walks through a WALL, and they RUSH TO FOLLOW--
dialog: 23.
text: SHAW is in anguish now. She falls to her knees and prays. The
dialog: words of the Catholic prayer for the dead desperately
dialog: whispered-—
speaker_heading: SHAW’S IMAGE (HOLOGRAM)
dialog: -.-. “Eternal rest grant unto them,
dialog: O Lord, and let perpetual light
dialog: shine upon them, May the souls of
dialog: all the faithful departed, through
dialog: the mercy of God, rest in peace ...
dialog: Eternal rest grant unto them, O
dialog: Lord, and let perpetual light shine
dialog: upon--”
text: The IMAGE abruptly LOCKS UP -- the pixels scatter, fading.
text: A dumbfounded BEAT as the HOLO goes DARK, REBOOTS.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (eyeing his HOLO)
dialog: Interesting...
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: What?
text: He turns to them. A sort of wonder in his eyes.
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: It's not coming from a ship.
text: In front of him: a BLURRY NAVIGATION IMAGE of an UNCHARTED
speaker_heading: STAR.
scene_heading: EXT. COVENANT - LATER
text: The SUN CRESTS the side of the GAS GIANT below. The COVENANT
text: is already looking ship-shape; half the sails up, none
dialog: burned.
speaker_heading: RICKS (V.O.)
dialog: She’s a main sequence star, a lot
dialog: like our own. Five planets...
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE
text: ON THE HOLO CHART, fresh data showing a BRIGHT STAR and five
speaker_heading: PLANETS.
speaker_heading: RICKS
dialog: --.and one of them: square in the
text: habitable zone. A prime candidate.
text: He zooms in on a rough PLANETARY MODEL:
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: RICKS
text: 0.96 Gs at surface, oceans. High
dialog: likelihood of a living biosphere.
dialog: Beyond our most optimistic
dialog: projections for Origae-6, in fact.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: Where is it?
speaker_heading: RICKS
dialog: She’s close. Just a short jump. We
dialog: wouldn’t even have to go to sleep.
text: The weight of this hits them all. No more hyper-sleep. A
dialog: possible new home.
text: They all look to Oram. Time to be the Captain.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: All right, let’s take a look.
speaker_heading: LATER:
text: Daniels goes to Captain Oram at the forward window, where
text: he’s looking over the cosmos. She talks to him privately.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: You sure about this, Bill?
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: I mean we spent a decade searching
dialog: for Origae-6. We vetted it, we ran
dialog: the simulations, we mapped the
dialog: terrain -- it’s what we trained
dialog: for.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: I understand that but--
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: And now we’re going to scrap all
dialog: that to chase a rogue transmission?
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: What does it cost us to take a
dialog: look? A few weeks?
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Think about it. A human being out
dialog: here where there shouldn’t be any
dialog: humans.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: DANIELS (CONT'D)
text: A hidden planet that suddenly
text: appears out of nowhere. And a
dialog: planet that just happens to be
dialog: perfect for us. It’s too good to be
dialog: true.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: Look, I know you and Jacob had big
dialog: plans about having a family on
dialog: Origae-6 and--
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: (protests)
dialog: Hold on, this has nothing to do
dialog: with--!
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: But what if this place is better? A
dialog: better habitat for the colony--
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: It's irresponsible to deviate from
dialog: the mission!
text: It was too strongly stated. Too angry, too loud. She knows
text: it. People have glanced over.
text: A beat.
text: He gives her a patient, icy smile.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: You mustn’t question my judgement.
dialog: Not on my bridge, Danny.
text: He makes sure his words land, and then goes.
text: She gazes out the window, troubled.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-DANIELS’ CABIN - LATER
text: She’s lying on the bed, smoking a joint. Deep in thought.
text: One of her late husband’s records spins on the old fashioned
text: turntable. Jazz plays.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: All crew members, please stand by
dialog: for jump to interstellar drive.
dialog: Thank you for your attention.
text: She reaches over and lifts the needle from the record. Holds
dialog: it up. Doesn’t want to scratch the album in the jolt as--
dialog: 26.
scene_heading: EXT. COVENANT - SPACE
text: The Covenant's secondary drives goes DARK, and the
text: INTERSTELLAR DRIVE, like an artificial SUN, FLARES to life--
text: The SPACE around the Covenant RIPPLES, and the Covenant
text: MOVES, slowly at first... then... she’s GONE--
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-DANIELS’ CABIN
text: The stars bend and morph past outside the window. The ride is
text: utterly smooth now.
text: Daniels lowers the needle back on the album. The jazz music
dialog: resumes.
text: She lies back. Troubled.
text: Takes a hit of the joint. Exhales.
dialog: The smoke and the music taking us to...
scene_heading: EXT. ENGINEER HOMEWORLD SUN - SPACE
text: A BLUISH SUN flares in the vacuum of space ... The stars near
text: the sun RIPPLE as the COVENANT suddenly phases out of
text: hyperjump, sling-shotting around and slowing...
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT - BRIDGE-APPROACHING THE PLANET
text: DANIELS is apprehensive.
text: All hands at tense readiness as a WHITE-BLUE DOT, with TWO
text: MOONS, hangs in the distance...
text: AT THE NAVIGATION HOLO, WALTER watches as Mother’s systems
text: flag the approaching planet and moons in real time...
speaker_heading: RICKS
dialog: (to Upworth)
dialog: You hearing anything?
speaker_heading: UPWORTH
dialog: Tried every band. It’s dead quiet
dialog: out there ... Just the continuing
dialog: signal from our friendly ghost.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
text: The siren’s song.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: Bring us into close orbit.
dialog: 27.
scene_heading: EXT. COVENANT - APPROACHING THE PLANET
text: The COVENANT cruises past a MOON, into HIGH ORBIT ABOVE THE
text: PLANET. The ship’s INSTRUMENT CLUSTER'S SCOPES ROTATE,
dialog: SCANNING, as--
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE
text: The HOLO MODEL of THE PLANET REFINES as DATA PILES IN.
text: RICKS adjusts his view, changes spectra. He sees ARCING
text: TENDRILS of ENERGY around the planet--
text: TENNESSEE frowns at it--
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
text: Hell of a strong ionosphere.
speaker_heading: RICKS
dialog: Yep. Way better than Earth’s too.
dialog: She’s lucky. Keeps good stuff in,
dialog: and the bad stuff out; cosmic rays,
dialog: solar flares - you name it. Like a
text: big, warm blanket.
speaker_heading: FARIS
dialog: Big warm blanket gonna be a
text: motherfucker to land through.
text: DATA MOVES on Walter’s screens.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I_have visual.
scene_heading: CLOUDS, OCEANS, CONTINENTS, what must be VEGETATION, shades
text: different than Earth - but richer ... A hush falls as they
dialog: watch.
speaker_heading: FARIS
dialog: God damn. It’s just like Earth...
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: We'll see, right?
speaker_heading: FARIS
dialog: What I wouldn’t give to feel a
dialog: little ocean breeze, catch me some
dialog: waves...
text: As they SWING PAST THE DARK SIDE, DAZZLING GREEN AURORAE
text: float and drift, LIGHTNING flickers in storms. Continents...
speaker_heading: DARK.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: No lights. No visible signs of
dialog: civilization.
dialog: Oram doesn’t hesitate:
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: Prepare the Lander.
text: The crew, aside from Daniels and Walter, is delighted. High
text: fives and hollers.
scene_heading: EXT. COVENANT - LATER
text: The LANDER -- a large landing craft -- DISENGAGES from the
speaker_heading: COVENANT.
dialog: Its engines FLARE as it orients for DROP--
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE
text: UPWORTH watches video feeds of the LANDER heading away.
speaker_heading: UPWORTH (ON COM)
dialog: Your trajectory looks gorgeous from
dialog: up here, Faris.
text: TENNESSEE, in command of the Covenant now, anxiously watches
text: through the forward window.
scene_heading: EXT. LANDER
text: The LANDER READIES FOR ENTRY, already TINY AGAINST the VAST,
scene_heading: HALF-DARK PLANET, PEELING BY BELOW--
scene_heading: INT. LANDER-BRIDGE
text: FARIS pilots the craft. CAPTAIN ORAM and WALTER are also
text: stationed on the bridge. The others are elsewhere in the
dialog: ship.
text: TRAJECTORY MODELS tick by, the ship INVERTING as it DROPS.
speaker_heading: UPWORTH (ON COM)
dialog: Everything looking good down there?
speaker_heading: FARIS (TO COM)
dialog: All good, Covenant. Expect to hit
dialog: upper atmosphere in five ... Might
dialog: want to hang on in the back, we’re
dialog: about to--
text: The POWER on the Lander abruptly FLICKERS, DIMS...
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: FARIS (TO COM)
dialog: Covenant? You read us?
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE
text: An ALARM PINGS. Upworth frowns.
text: Tennessee sees the LANDER’S ENGINES flutter OUT...
scene_heading: INT. LANDER-BRIDGE
text: Faris hits UNRESPONSIVE CONTROLS, they DRIFT, ROLLING -
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: What’s going on...?!
speaker_heading: FARIS
dialog: We lost power.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: Oh God--
text: The ship starts to SHAKE VIOLENTLY from ENTRY. Faris’ tension
text: mounting, hitting MORE BUTTONS--
scene_heading: INT. LANDER-LANDING SEATS
text: The other CREW MEMBERS are strapped in further back in the
text: ship. They grab on desperately.
text: DANIELS shoots a look to SERGEANT LOPE. PRIVATE COLE crosses
text: himself. KARINE is very anxious at the turbulence:
speaker_heading: KARINE
dialog: Is this normal?!
speaker_heading: SERGEANT LOPE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: KARINE
dialog: I hate space.
text: Sergeant HALLET and Privates LEDWARD and ANKER complete the
dialog: landing party.
scene_heading: INT. LANDER-BRIDGE
text: The ship is really DRIFTING NOW -- the TURBULENCE terrifying.
dialog: When suddenly--
text: The LIGHTS flicker BACK UP. The engines GUN BACK ON -
speaker_heading: UPWORTH (ON COM)
dialog: — LANDER, DO YOU READ! ?
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: FARIS (TO COM)
dialog: Yeah, yeah. I read you. Think
dialog: we're... OK now.
text: Then THEY’RE THROUGH, SLASHING THROUGH DENSE CLOUDS AND
text: SMOOTHLY CRUISING above DARK OCEAN that leads to MOUNTAINS...
speaker_heading: FARIS (TO COM)
dialog: Underway - looks like we got
dialog: mountains.
scene_heading: EXT. LANDER-MOUNTAINS - DAY
text: The LANDER soars down, and slices through the clouds to
dialog: reveal...
text: Majestic scenery. Slate grey mountains, tops obscured in
text: mist. Deep forests. Ansel Jacobs austere beauty. On the edge
dialog: of savage.
text: The Lander HOVERS into a landing.
scene_heading: INT. LANDER-LANDING SEATS
text: In the back, the EXPEDITION TEAM feel the ship SETTLE, and
text: all but tear off their seat belts, relieved.
text: DANIELS is first up and out.
scene_heading: INT. LANDER-BRIDGE
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: What the hell happened up there?
speaker_heading: FARIS
dialog: New power cells must have fritzed
dialog: out. I’1l cycle ‘em while you're
dialog: gone.
text: DANIELS enters, anxiously going to the windows.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: How far out are we?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Signal’s source is eight kilometers
text: west. And up. Right on target.
speaker_heading: FARIS
dialog: (nods out the window)
dialog: Walter, would you do the honors?
dialog: 31.
scene_heading: EXT. PLANET-BENEATH THE LANDER - DAY
text: The LANDING BAY opens.
text: Walter walks down a ramp. Stops.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: One small step for man...
text: He steps onto the planet’s surface.
text: Inhales deeply. Takes a moment to analyze the air, even savor
dialog: it, like wine-tasting.
speaker_heading: WALTER (TO COM)
dialog: Atmosphere is 72% nitrogen, 23%
dialog: oxygen. 40% humidity. 6% chance of
dialog: precipitation ... All in all,
dialog: lovely day for a stroll.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE - LATER
text: TENNESSEE looks at the HOLO MODEL of the LANDER, the TERRAIN
text: spread out around it. DATA ERRORS prominent, parts of the 3-D
text: model’s surfaces BLOCKY and SHAKING...
speaker_heading: FARIS (ON COM, UNCLEAR)
dialog: Not going to... suits... find the
dialog: source of the transmission...
speaker_heading: UPWORTH (TO COM)
dialog: Faris, see if you can get more
dialog: power to the uplink, signal's
dialog: falling apart up here.
scene_heading: INT. LANDER-BRIDGE - DAY
dialog: FARIS works various stations:
speaker_heading: FARIS (TO COM)
dialog: I’‘1l be cycling the power cells
dialog: too, that might help.
speaker_heading: ORAM (ON COM)
dialog: Faris, we’re heading out. Keep
dialog: expedition security protocols in
dialog: place.
text: She looks out the windows and sees...
scene_heading: EXT. LANDER - DAY
text: ... CAPTAIN ORAM speaking up to her on com. She gives a
text: thumbs up in response.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: FARIS (ON COM)
dialog: Understood. Have fun y’all.
text: The EXPEDITION TEAM is ready. They have no need of breathing
text: gear, but wear properly tough expedition uniforms and packs.
text: WALTER powers up a portable display - showing the way to
dialog: follow the signal.
text: The SOLDIERS are heavily-armed.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: All right then. Let’s go find our
dialog: ghost ... Walter?
text: WALTER heads toward the treeline in the distance.
text: Sergeant LOPE snaps open a beautiful folding BOW. Black
text: carbon fiber. He strings an arrow and leads the way ... His
text: men take up defensive perimeter positions.
dialog: The expedition team is: Daniels; Walter; Captain Oram;
text: Karine; Sergeants Lope and Hallet; Privates Cole, Ledward and
dialog: Anker.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST-VARIOUS - DAY
text: They walk, it’s quiet, footsteps muffled.
text: All are alert. On edge. Silent.
text: They travel ... The forest gets more dense, the terrain
dialog: rockier... up hill...
text: They finally hear something new. Flowing WATER...
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST STREAM - DAY
text: They discover a beautiful FOREST STREAM, flowing down from
text: the distant mountains.
dialog: And life.
text: Midges and tiny INSECTS buzz about the water, like dust
text: motes, catching the light shafts slashing down through the
dialog: trees.
dialog: It’s a bit of a miracle. Life.
text: CAPTAIN ORAM smiles, his hand gently moving through the haze
dialog: of little insects.
text: Suddenly SERGEANT HALLET jumps back, shocked--
dialog: 33.
scene_heading: SERGEANT HALLET
dialog: Fuck me--!
text: A large SALAMANDER-like creature has run over his foot.
text: Disappears into some rocks. Sergeant Hallet laughs at his
text: scare ... Karine tries to find the salamander.
speaker_heading: PRIVATE COLE
dialog: How is this even... possible?
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: It's not just possible - it’s
dialog: predictable. Life is the result of
dialog: very basic forces. Find a planet in
dialog: the triple point, add sun and
text: water. Thermodynamics starts the
dialog: process - with a little luck,
dialog: evolution does the rest.
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: But I’1l admit this is... beyond
dialog: all expectations.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE (ON COM)
dialog: Expedition team. You read us?
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE-COVENANT
text: TENNESSEE can see the VIEW, the SUN dappling down, from the
text: team’s BODY CAMS. But the image is breaking up--
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE (TO COM)
dialog: What’s happening? We’re having a
dialog: hell of a time tracking you. You're
dialog: breaking up...
speaker_heading: ORAM (ON COM)
text: Almost halfway to target... life
dialog: everywhere... Beyond anything...
text: The signal dissolves into NOISE. The HOLO TERRAIN MAP
text: twitches.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: Dammit.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST STREAM - DAY
text: KARINE looks upstream, not wanting to leave.
text: DANIELS eyes the sky, anxious.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: How much farther is it?
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: We're about... five kilometers out,
dialog: but it’s mostly uphill - a couple
dialog: hours perhaps?
speaker_heading: KARINE
dialog: (to Oram)
dialog: Bill, I’d like to stay here. Might
dialog: be our best chance to do a full
dialog: ecology workup.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: (nods )
dialog: Sergeant, can you provide security?
text: Sergeant Lope motions to PVT. LEDWARD, who joins Karine.
speaker_heading: LOPE
dialog: Ledward, stay with her. Meet back
dialog: here in four hours. Keep your radio
dialog: on.
text: Captain Oram gives his wife a quick kiss.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: Don’t touch anything icky.
text: Karine smiles.
text: The expedition team continues on.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH PLAIN - DAY
text: An ethereal sight.
text: Enormously tall grass, looks like wheat. Swaying beautifully
text: in the gentle afternoon breeze.
text: The team is crossing a wide, high plain. Moving through the
text: sinuous grass that towers over them.
text: Walter walks with Daniels.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Nice place for a log cabin.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Jacob would have loved this...
text: Captain Oram catches up with them.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: What do you think, Daniels? We
dialog: could probably put the whole
dialog: Covenant down here. Looks like a
dialog: perfect landing site. Ready access
dialog: to fresh water too...
dialog: (gestures, imagining it)
dialog: Put the housing modules over there,
text: civic modules across the way.
dialog: Instant colony!
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: (non-committal)
dialog: We'll see.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: We were meant to find this place.
text: Daniels glances at him. Odd thing to say.
text: Oram continues past them, trooping away, disappearing in the
text: swaying stalks.
text: Daniels and Walter continue on through the jungle of tall
text: grass and come across LOPE and HALLET.
text: Lope has pulled down one of the long stalks and is crushing
text: the top in his hands, tastes a bit with the tip of his
dialog: tongue.
speaker_heading: LOPE
dialog: -.. This is wheat.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: It can’t be.
speaker_heading: LOPE
dialog: I’m from Iowa. Believe me, I know
dialog: wheat.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: How’s that possible?
speaker_heading: HALLET
dialog: Maybe Casper will tell us...
text: Hallet whistles the “Casper the Friendly Ghost” theme song as
text: he and Lope continue on.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: (to Walter)
dialog: What are the odds of finding human
dialog: vegetation this far from earth?
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Statistically -- it’s impossible.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: So... who planted it?
text: They exchange a look and then continue on, pushing through
text: the high stalks.
text: We see there’s serious mountain terrain ahead. Sharp crags
text: and ridges. Much of this obscured by high elevation fog and
dialog: mist.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST STREAM - DAY
text: Meanwhile, KARINE has filled a few mylar sample bags with
text: flora and fauna. Mostly plants and a couple of seemingly
text: uninteresting insects and worms.
text: She gently bats at a cloud of INSECTS in front of her face. A
text: haze of little mote-like MIDGES in the dappled sunlight.
dialog: And we see one of the insects--
speaker_heading: MACRO VIEW:
text: Ever-changing in its form -- lurching and stabbing into new
text: shapes -- oily black but beautiful ... It hovers, has
dialog: intelligence.
text: Just before it can lunge at her--
scene_heading: PVT. LEDWARD
dialog: (calls)
dialog: Hey, Doctor. You might want to see
dialog: this.
text: She joins him at the water’s edge.
text: His back is to her. He turns. His face is covered in the tiny
text: mote-like INSECTS.
text: By reflex she reaches out to brush them away.
speaker_heading: LEDWARD
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KARINE
dialog: You’re covered in midges.
text: The insects evaporate in the sunlight.
dialog: 37.
text: Ledward, unconcerned, points to a little mammal, some kind of
text: furless thing. Half-eaten. Dead. Its side bubbles with fat,
text: white grubs.
text: She kneels, looks at it, disturbed.
scene_heading: PVT. LEDWARD
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: KARINE
dialog: No idea. But we know one thing now
dialog: -.. There are predators here ...
dialog: Could you bag it for me?
text: She moves away to use the field radio as Private Ledward bags
text: the dead creature.
text: And we focus on one of the INSECTS hovering near him...
speaker_heading: MACRO VIEW:
text: It’s watchful, careful. It settles near Ledward’s ear, and
text: then enters the ear canal... the soft pink flesh... quickly
text: attaches itself -- a feeding tube plunging into his flesh--
text: He unconsciously rubs his ear. Thinking nothing of it.
dialog: Meanwhile:
speaker_heading: KARINE (TO COM)
dialog: Bill? Can you read me? ... Come in
dialog: Expedition Party ... Lander? Faris
dialog: you reading me? Lander? ... Where
dialog: the hell is everyone?
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY
text: The Expedition Team pushes through the FOG.
text: It's rocky and quite barren. Majestic. Difficult terrain,
text: slow going.
text: SERGEANT LOPE leads. He’s in his element, bow ready, enjoying
text: the exertion. He’s more in shape than the others. They

dialog: Slow down, Sergeant, we’re not all
dialog: soldiers...
text: A PING! Walter stops, frowns at his NAV DEVICE -
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Says we're right there. Doesn't
dialog: make sense.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Hold on ... Stop.
text: Sergeant Lope gestures for his men to halt.
text: Silence but for the wind. The breeze stirring the fog.
text: Daniels is peering intensely... up.
text: And then they can all see it. A LOOMING DARK SHAPE, now
text: clearer in the shifting mist ... ABOVE THEM...
text: Massive overhanging rocks, protruding toward the sky like two
text: arms beseeching up to something.
text: Daniels steps forward, then the rest, STARING UP, in silence,
text: at a looming, tubular arm of an ENGINEER DREADNOUGHT...
scene_heading: EXT. CRASHED DREADNOUGHT - MOUNTAINSIDE
text: Baffled, DANIELS frowns up at a... WALL? Curved. Huge.
text: Extending into the foggy mist. No one’s really sure what it
dialog: is yet.
text: WALTER runs his hand along the curved, ridged surface. He
text: RAPS it with his knuckles, listening. Quite hollow.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I would say it’s... some kind of
dialog: vehicle.
text: Now the cloud-mist thins just enough to see one LONG, CURVED
text: ARM in its entirety. Jutting off the mountain at an angle.
text: All are silenced by the majesty of the scale and design.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: I don’t think she had a very good
dialog: landing.
speaker_heading: PVT. ANKER (ON COM)
dialog: Think we found a way in, sir.
scene_heading: EXT. DREADNOUGHT - OPEN DEPLOYMENT BAY - GLOOM
text: The DARK RECESSES of the ship yawn beyond an open deployment
text: bay. They shine their flashlights into the CAVERNOUS SPACE.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT LOPE
dialog: Anker, Cole - stay on watch.
dialog: 39.
text: The two look happy to stay outside.
text: SERGEANT LOPE snaps on the LASER SITE on his bow and leads
dialog: the way...
scene_heading: INT. DREADNOUGHT - DEPLOYMENT BAY - GLOOM
text: The group looks around, AWED by the vast alien hold. The wind
text: whistles through...
text: They pick their way into the darker recesses. FLASH LIGHTS
text: and LASER SCOPES cut through the oppressive gloom.
text: Underfoot the remains of many broken receptacles. BLACK URNS.
text: Scattered everywhere, empty, fragile shells. Crunching under
dialog: their boots.
dialog: And they discover something else...
scene_heading: EGG SHAPED OBJECTS.
text: Randomly clustered. Different sizes. From aubergine to acid
text: green in color, abscesses ... None as large or impressive as
dialog: the originals we have seen in the past.
text: They are growing out of a bed of BLACK FUR. Like the mold on
text: cheese. The black filaments gently sway as the air stirs
dialog: around them.
text: SERGEANT HALLET leans close, studying an egg. Reaches a
dialog: finger out...
speaker_heading: SERGEANT LOPE
dialog: (shakes his head: don’t)
dialog: Hey.
text: Hallet begins to follow the others out when--
dialog: Wait -- was that movement? One of the eggs? Did it stir?
text: Hallet remains fascinated by the movement. He goes closer...
text: The eggs begins to open...
scene_heading: SERGEANT HALLET
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: Guys....
text: But they have already moved out of the chamber...
text: His face is dangerously near the top of the egg...
dialog: 40.
scene_heading: INT. DREADNOUGHT - SLOPING HALLS
text: They CLAMBER up into the HALLS.
text: The dark ship isn’t level, and WATER DRIPS through the entire
text: thing, pooling in the corners. They splash through the halls.
text: DANIELS eyes an OPEN SPACE JOCKEY SUIT. WALTER joins her.
text: Others stare, noticing OTHER SUITS. Rows of them. Not human
dialog: sized.
dialog: Meanwhile--
scene_heading: INT. DREADNOUGHT - DEPLOYMENT BAY
text: HALLET peers very closely at the open mouth of the egg. Too
dialog: close..
text: But then, he thinks the better of it and very sensibly takes
dialog: a step back...
text: But he inadvertently steps on a tiny egg behind him--
text: Unleashing a cloud of the MIDGES. They waft up. Swirling
dialog: before him...
speaker_heading: MACRO VIEW:
text: One of the black INSECTS darts forward -- into his nostril --
text: the pink nasal passage -- attaches itself and stabs a feeding
dialog: tube into him--
text: Hallet rubs his nose, unconcerned.
text: SERGEANT LOPE enters:
speaker_heading: SERGEANT LOPE
dialog: Tom, you okay?
scene_heading: SERGEANT HALLET
dialog: Yeah, sure. Sorry.
dialog: They go.
dialog: Meanwhile--
scene_heading: INT. DREADNOUGHT-NAV CHAMBER
text: DANIELS, WALTER and ORAM explore the enormous NAVIGATION
speaker_heading: CHAMBER.
text: Oram shines a light on EMPTY ENGINEER SLEEP PODS as Walter
text: investigates the old COMMAND CONSOLE.
dialog: 41.
text: There’s a pulsing LIGHT under one of the controls. Walter
dialog: activates it.
text: Instantly, the HOLOGRAM message they saw before flashes to
text: life and begins to play quietly. SHAW kneeling, praying:
speaker_heading: SHAW’S IMAGE (HOLOGRAM)
dialog: --. “and let perpetual light shine
dialog: upon them, May the souls of all the
dialog: faithful departed, through the
dialog: mercy of God, rest in peace ...
dialog: Eternal rest grant unto them, O
dialog: Lord, and let perpetual...”
text: Walter steps straight through the HOLOGRAM then turns it off.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Meet our ghost ... It’s a repeating
dialog: message, non-directional. Like a
text: holographic distress beacon.
text: Across the room, Daniels shines her flashlight--
text: A GOLD GLINT catches her eye. On the floor. She reaches down,
text: discovering a GOLD CRUCIFIX NECKLACE.
text: It’s Shaw's old crucifix.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Over here.
text: The others join her as Daniels finds...
text: SHAW'’S JOURNAL, lying in water. Daniels carefully picks it
text: up, opens the waterlogged journal. The few pages that aren’t
text: rotted together are illegible. But at front -
speaker_heading: DANIELS (READING)
dialog: Dr. Elizabeth Shaw.
text: Oram finds the PHOTO of SHAW and HOLLOWAY smiling.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: Is this her?
text: Walter shines his flashlight, crisply registering the items
text: in the area. Decaying clothes. Some personal items.
text: And then SHAW’S HELMET.
text: He goes stock still when he sees the logo on the helmet...
scene_heading: WEYLAND INDUSTRIES.
dialog: 42.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST STREAM - AFTERNOON
text: KARINE is trudging ahead, her specimen bags full as she
text: glances at the sinking sun, nervous.
text: LEDWARD is moving slowly behind her.
speaker_heading: KARINE (ON RADIO)
dialog: Come in Lander One. Come in ...
dialog: Come in Expedition Team. Are you
dialog: reading me? Does any--
text: Ledward doubles over, can’t get his breath.
speaker_heading: KARINE
dialog: Are you all right?
text: He looks at her. He’s sweating profusely. Eyes red. Scared.
scene_heading: PVT. LEDWARD
dialog: Not really... something...
dialog: (clutching his chest)
dialog: Can’t breathe...
text: Then tiny droplets of BLOOD begin secreting from pores on his
dialog: face--
text: Her face displays her shock, frightening him even more--
speaker_heading: KARINE
dialog: We better get you back to the
dialog: Lander.
scene_heading: INT. DREADNOUGHT-NAV CHAMBER - AFTERNNOON
text: Captain ORAM and Sergeant LOPE are on the field radio across
text: the room. HALLET with them.
text: Meanwhile, DANIELS and WALTER talk privately. He holds Shaw’s
speaker_heading: HELMET.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Weyland Industries.
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: Sir Peter Weyland. Inventor, early
dialog: 21st century. He created the first
dialog: synthetic humans. He disappeared
dialog: just over ten years ago ... And Dr.
dialog: Elizabeth Shaw was chief science
dialog: officer of the Prometheus, which
dialog: also disappeared just over ten
dialog: years ago ... Their mission was to
dialog: discover the source of human life.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: And it led them here...?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: As unlikely as it seems.
text: Captain Oram calls from across the room:
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: Come on. We have to go. We’ve got a

speaker_heading: TENNESSEE

speaker_heading: FARIS (ON COM)
dialog: ... Not sure what’s...
scene_heading: INT. LANDER-BRIDGE - LATE AFTERNOON
speaker_heading: FARIS (TO COM)
dialog: --- Do you read me? Covenant?
text: Through the Lander’s front windows, she sees KARINE and
text: PRIVATE LEDWARD emerging through the trees. Karine’s helping
dialog: Ledward walk.
text: Faris goes to meet them.
scene_heading: EXT. LANDER-LIFT BAY - LATE AFTERNOON
text: FARIS comes out of the Lander’s OPEN LIFT BAY.
text: KARINE is practically carrying LEDWARD, who looks much worse
text: now; head bowed, rag-doll, moaning.
speaker_heading: FARIS
dialog: We have to get him to medbay. Now.
dialog: Touch nothing on your way through.
dialog: Follow me.
dialog: 44,
scene_heading: INT. LANDER-MEDBAY
text: A BLAST of light. The MEDBAY is high key white. White on
dialog: white.
text: It's barely controlled hysteria, quick and urgent.
text: Faris pulls on gloves and a mask as Karine swiftly wrenches
text: off Ledward’s body armor.
speaker_heading: FARIS
dialog: Put some fucking gloves on!
speaker_heading: KARINE
dialog: Little late for that.
text: They HEAVE LEDWARD onto a table -- then Karine scrambles
text: through med cabinets, spilling supplies--
speaker_heading: FARIS
dialog: Karine! Stop touching everything!
dialog: I’1l do that!
text: Karine drops a tray of medical supplies as Faris peels off
text: Ledward’s saturated shirt, revealing his back where--
text: The skin on his spine is STRETCHING -- PARTING--
text: Revealing a WET CROCHET of LIVING MATTER, like ALBINO WORMS
text: knitting together on his spinal column--
text: Faris recoils - horrified.
text: LEDWARD stares at her with VACANT, DEAD-EYED SHOCK--
speaker_heading: KARINE
dialog: We’re gonna get you up to the ship
dialog: and get you fixed up - you just
dialog: have to hold on for me, Private.
dialog: Okay? Can you do that?
text: Faris discretely backs out of the room:
speaker_heading: FARIS
dialog: Stay with him. Keep him quiet. I’m
dialog: going to contact the Captain.
scene_heading: INT. LANDER-OUTSIDE THE MED BAY
text: Faris shuts the door and punches the keypad. The panel
text: FLASHES “LOCKED.”
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: FARIS (TO COM)
dialog: (anxious )
dialog: Captain? How long?
speaker_heading: ORAM (ON COM)
dialog: Hold on, we’re close.
speaker_heading: FARIS (TO COM)
dialog: I need you back here now.

scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE

scene_heading: FARIS (ON COM BREAKING UP)
dialog: Expedition team’s not here and I
dialog: +. the hell’s going on with
dialog: Ledward...
text: TENNESSEE is at the HOLO, seeing main team’s MOVING DOTS...
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE (TO COM)
dialog: Honey, calm down, just calm down --
dialog: Now tell me what happened?
scene_heading: FARIS (ON COM BREAKING UP)
dialog: Calm down? Don’t tell me to calm
dialog: the fuck down! You didn’t see what
dialog: I... no goddamn idea what’s

speaker_heading: TENNESSEE (TO COM)
dialog: Honey, you’re breaking up. Can you

scene_heading: IT GARBLES. OUT.
text: He tosses his headset away angrily.
text: UPWORTH is standing at the HOLO-NAV DISPLAY... has an idea.
speaker_heading: UPWORTH
dialog: We need to move the ship...
text: Upworth points out the idea on the HOLO-NAV DISPLAY:
speaker_heading: UPWORTH
dialog: Mother. If we drop to low orbit,
dialog: we'll be inside the field. We can
text: cut the scatter at its source and
dialog: clean up the signal, right?
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: The nature of the ionosphere is
dialog: unknown to us. This course of
dialog: action would be inadvisable without
dialog: further information.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: Well, can you speculate?
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: That’s not within my programming.
speaker_heading: RICKS
dialog: We have to do something...
text: Ricks and Upworth stare at Tennessee.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE

speaker_heading: UPWORTH (TO COM)
dialog: Lander One, do you copy? Faris,
dialog: come in.
text: The planet CRUISING BY BELOW, looming larger... larger...
speaker_heading: FARIS (ON VID)
dialog: Yeah, better. What’d you do?
speaker_heading: UPWORTH (TO COM)
dialog: We moved the Covenant in low orbit.
speaker_heading: FARIS (ON VID)
dialog: Well it’s a good goddamn thing,
dialog: because I think we’re gonna be on
dialog: our way up pretty soon. We’re gonna
dialog: need--

dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: Mother? Bridge is losing power,
dialog: what’s going on?!
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: A fluctuation in thhhhhhhhhh -
text: A SQUELCHING SQUEAL plays on the ship's COM, EARSPLITTING,
text: and then... the WHOLE BRIDGE GOES DARK.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: Mother?
text: NO ANSWER. Tennessee BOLTS UP, looking out the WINDOW, seeing
text: as... the REST OF THE COVENANT flickers... and GOES DARK.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: Whole ship just went dark.
scene_heading: INT. LANDER-BRIDGE - SUNSET
text: Outside, sun’s going down. Blood red sunset.
text: FARIS turns to a vid-feed from the MED BAY: Karine is trying
text: to hold down LEDWARD, who is now CONVULSING violently--
text: Karine calls up at the vid-feed camera--
speaker_heading: KARINE (ON VID)
dialog: FARIS! I NEED YOUR HELP!
dialog: Faris bolts--
scene_heading: INT. LANDER-MED BAY/CORRIDOR - SUNSET
text: FARIS runs to the MED BAY doors, looks through the porthole--
text: LEDWARD is now sitting quietly on a MED TABLE, hunched, his
dialog: back to us.
text: KARINE goes to the door, in shock.
speaker_heading: KARINE
dialog: I don’t know what's wrong with him.
dialog: He was-—
text: She tries the door, but Faris locked it previously.
speaker_heading: KARINE
dialog: Let me out.
speaker_heading: FARIS
dialog: I’m sorry, I can’t do that.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: KARINE
dialog: Faris -- let me out of here!
text: This is agonizing for Faris.
speaker_heading: KARINE
dialog: Please.
text: Faris fights not to panic. Tries to keep her voice steady:
speaker_heading: FARIS (TO COM)
dialog: Covenant, we need to quarantine the
dialog: dock bay before we come back up, we
dialog: have a medical emergency...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Covenant? Come in.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE - DARKNESS
text: The ship is groaning as it drifts.

speaker_heading: UPWORTH
dialog: Mother. How long before the backup
dialog: systems come online? ... Mother?
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: Mother died ... Backup’s automated.
dialog: Should've kicked in by now.
speaker_heading: RICKS
dialog: Jesus -- if we lost backup power
dialog: what about the Nursery?!
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: Yes! Go!
text: Ricks goes quickly.
text: Then a CREAKING echoes through, STRAINING METAL, followed by
text: gunshot-loud CRACKS! TENNESSEE'S EYES GO WIDE -
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
text: Artificial gravity’s cycling out...
text: As the last VIBRATIONS shake the ship, a CUP OF COFFEE SLIDES
text: off the console... and is AIRBORNE. FLOATING UP. Liquid
text: CURLING OUT as it lazily CLUNKS against the VIEWING WINDOW.
dialog: Silence.
text: Ricks -- sprinting -- is suddenly floating -- as if on water.
dialog: 49,
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: Whatever this field is... we’re
dialog: sure as hell in it now.
text: Everything floats.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - SUNSET
text: The Expedition Team is moving quickly. Almost night now. All
text: exhausted. They can see the Lander’s lights in the far
dialog: distance.
dialog: Suddenly--
text: SERGEANT HALLET doubles over -- falls. Lope goes to him,
dialog: concerned.
speaker_heading: HALLET
dialog: Sorry -- I can’t--
scene_heading: INT. LANDER-MED BAY/CORRIDOR - SUNSET
text: KARINE is at the door, desperate now--
speaker_heading: KARINE
dialog: Let me out of here!
speaker_heading: FARIS
dialog: You know I can’t do that--
text: Faris is in tears. So wants to help her friend.
text: Suddenly, his back still to the door, LEDWARD sucks in a
text: rattling BREATH -- his hands grip the seat, agony as he
dialog: convulses-—
dialog: Karine goes to him--
speaker_heading: KARINE
dialog: Shhh. You’re gonna be okay... I’m
dialog: with you--
text: Ledward’s convulsions increase -- she tries to hold him as

scene_heading: CONTRACTION.
text: FARIS watches in horror through the porthole as suddenly--
dialog: Between Karine’s hands--
scene_heading: TWO GREY-WHITE SPIKES PUNCTURE LEDWARD’S BACK AND RIB CAGE--
text: And then his ENTIRE BACK RUPTURES -- his rib cage splits--
dialog: 50.
text: BLOOD EXPLODES OVER KARINE and she SCREAMS AS-~
text: A_NEOMORPH TEARS ITSELF OUT OF LEDWARD’S BODY.
text: Vision from Hell. Emerging backwards. Small at first, about
text: the size of a large cat. Humanoid ... ELONGATED HEAD -- just
text: hinting at the original Alien -- and three SPIKES protruding
text: from the back. Dripping. Sickly pale WHITE FLESH.
text: And growing quite fast. Jerking its spine bizarrely. Becoming
dialog: itself.
text: All the more terrible in the high key white room. The black
text: blood splattering on the white walls, ceiling and floor.
text: LEDWARD collapses, dead, arched awkwardly backward across the
dialog: bed--
text: KARINE -- covered in blood -- backs up in terror to a corner--
text: As the MONSTROUS THING WHIRLS, seeing her, and with sickening
text: CURIOSITY, LOOKS at her--
text: FARIS watches in horror through the porthole--
text: Karine is SHAKING IN TERROR. Sinks to her knees. Afraid to
dialog: look up--
scene_heading: INT. LANDER-CORRIDORS - SUNSET
text: FARIS spins and runs. RUNS SO FAST that she SLIDES, WIPING
text: OUT, PICKS HERSELF UP and continuing as:
speaker_heading: FARIS (TO COM)
text: THIS IS LANDER ONE! WE HAVE AN
speaker_heading: EMERGENCY!
scene_heading: EXT. DARK FOREST - SUNSET
text: The team marches quickly through the forest, exhausted.
text: Nearly full darkness now. The lights from the Lander closer.
scene_heading: FARIS (ON COM, BREAKING UP)
scene_heading: SOMETHING GOT ON BOARD. SOME KIND
scene_heading: OF... ANIMAL... HOSTILE. KILLED
dialog: LEDWARD...
speaker_heading: ORAM (TO COM)
dialog: What?! Faris, repeat ... Come in
dialog: Lander One...
dialog: They run now--
dialog: 51.
text: Sergeant Lope helps Hallet along, but Hallet is really
dialog: suffering--
text: The Lander is almost visible through the trees now, they’re
dialog: almost there--
scene_heading: INT. LANDER - LIFT BAY - SUNSET
dialog: FARIS runs in--
text: Rips open a WEAPON’S LOCKER--
text: Grabs a weapon and runs--
scene_heading: INT. LANDER-MED BAY/CORRIDOR - SUNSET
text: FARIS approaches the MED BAY DOOR. Looks in:
text: Sees the NEOMORPH. Bigger now. Size of a CHIMP. Moving across
text: the room dangerously toward where KARINE is cowering--
dialog: It ATTACKS--
text: Faris can’t see what happens, it’s just out of her field of
text: vision through the porthole. She sees a SPRAY of blood. And
text: the SOUND of the attack is terrible: Karine’s SCREAMS; the
text: SCREECH of the NEOMORPH.
text: Faris readies her weapon and punches the door button--
dialog: It slides open--
text: She steps into the Med Bay, weapon ready--
dialog: Can finally see--
text: The NEOMORPH is sitting on Karine’s chest. Eating her face.
dialog: It SPINS TO FARIS--
dialog: FARIS FIRES -- nothing -- Safety catch on! Fuck!
text: The NEOMORPH immediately attacks--
text: FARIS bolts back through the door and slams the button--
text: The door slides shut, just in time--
text: FARIS runs in panic as the NEOMORPH pounds and slashes at the
dialog: door behind her--
text: The door begins to buckle--
dialog: 52.
scene_heading: INT. LANDER-CORRIDORS - SUNSET
text: FARIS runs in absolute panic--
text: Can hear the NEOMORPH in pursuit--
text: She bolts into--
scene_heading: INT. LANDER-LIFT BAY - SUNSET
text: FARIS backs up in shocked terror, the WEAPON shaking in her
dialog: hands--
text: She flicks off the safety catch--
text: As the NEOMORPH -- LARGER NOW -- streaks in, darting around
dialog: the room--
text: Moving past the OPEN WEAPONS LOCKER as--
speaker_heading: Faris FIRES--
text: The NEOMORPH launches itself out of the Lander to safety --
text: as her SHOTS spray across the OPEN WEAPONS LOCKER--
scene_heading: EXT. LANDER - NIGHT
text: ORAM and the others are just clearing the trees in the
dialog: distance when--
speaker_heading: BLAM!
text: A MASSIVE EXPLOSION as the Lander is destroyed--
dialog: Just as--
text: SERGEANT HALLET finally collapses, his back heaving WILDLY--
speaker_heading: SERGEANT LOPE
dialog: TOM--!
text: DANIELS grabs SERGEANT LOPE, pulls him away from his partner--
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: NO! STAY AWAY FROM HIM!
text: WALTER helps hold SERGEANT LOPE back--
text: Meanwhile, ORAM advances on the burning Lander in absolute
dialog: shock.
text: He sinks to his knees, overcome.
text: He knows his wife is dead somewhere in that inferno.
dialog: 53.
dialog: Then, horribly--
text: He sees FARIS emerge from the blaze, crawling, dying, hands
text: grasping -- finally collapsing in a terrible blackened,
dialog: burning mass--
text: As we see SOMETHING WHITE -- the fully grown NEOMORPH --
text: streak past him in the darkness--
dialog: Back with the others:
scene_heading: HALLET CONVULSES--—
text: He’s on his back, his spine arching unnaturally, bones
dialog: cracking--
text: LOPE pulls away from Walter and Daniels and goes to Hallet
dialog: just as--
text: HALLET’s spine suddenly arches violently and he VOMITS OUT
speaker_heading: BLOOD--
text: They recoil in the spray of bloody vapor--
dialog: As--
scene_heading: A PLACENTA-LIKE BAG EXPLODES FROM HALLET’S MOUTH--
text: Flops on his FACE--
dialog: The BAG BURSTS, revealing--
scene_heading: A_BABY NEOMORPH--
text: CRAWLING OVER HALLET’S DEAD FACE.
text: The BABY NEOMORPH stands quickly -- growing and jerking
text: itself up like a grotesque new born colt--
text: It SCREECHES terribly -- a demented new born -- and darts
text: past them into the dark forest--
text: Shock. Silence ... All pant for air...
text: SERGEANT LOPE steels himself. Motions. His men take up
text: defensive positions ... DANIELS and WALTER stay close
text: together ... CAPTAIN ORAM staggers from the burning Lander,
text: joining them. Terrified.
text: Movement in the dark trees. Something large and white.
text: LOPE strings a special arrow with an explosive tip.
dialog: The ATTACK is sudden--
dialog: 54.
text: A FULLY GROWN NEOMORPH (Ledward’s Neomorph) COMES OUT OF THE
text: TREES OVERHEAD -- large, horns protruding from its back--
scene_heading: IT DROPS ON PRIVATE ANKOR -- A RIPPING MOTION DISEMBOWELS
text: HIM, his guts flying everywhere--
text: THEN IT SLASHES AT PRIVATE COLE -- SLAMMING HIM TWENTY FEET
text: AWAY -- he lands in agony, ribs broken--
text: LOPE FIRES his explosive arrow -- misses, hits a tree --
text: chiaroscuro flashes in the darkness--
text: The NEOMORPH is incredibly fast, darting away -- LOPE raises
text: his machine gun as PRIVATE COLE jerks himself up in agony--
text: A chaotic frenzy ... LOPE and COLE firing ... DANIELS, WALTER
text: and CAPTAIN ORAM diving to the ground, bullets zipping past
dialog: them--
text: Then the battle grows even worse as--
text: The OTHER NEOMORPH -- the newborn (Hallet’s Neomorph) --
text: screeches into the battle. It’s small but growing quickly,
text: vicious and chimp-sized now--
text: DANIELS sees ANKOR’S fallen gun. Scrambles to retrieve it.
dialog: She fires--
text: The fully grown white NEOMORPH rages at her--
text: SLAMS her back -- But WALTER bravely dives to protect
text: Daniels, crashes into the white body--
text: It rears back and--
text: Double-jointed JAWS distend bizarrely--
text: SNAP! IT CLAMPS DOWN ON WALTER’S LEFT HAND AND RIPS IT OFF,
text: fluid sprays wildly, sparks from the trailing wires--
text: The two NEOMORPHS circle quickly for the kill, one fully
text: grown, the other growing in bizarre jerks--
dialog: But then--
text: A BRIGHT MAGNESIUM FLARE LANDS on the ground nearby and a
scene_heading: RINGING SOUND BUILDS--
text: So LOUD they have to cover their ears as the flare BURSTS
scene_heading: INTO BLINDING RADIOACTIVE-BLUE, LIGHTING UP the WHOLE FOREST
dialog: until--
dialog: 55.
text: A CIRCULAR SHOCKWAVE EXPANDS from the FLARE, WHIPPING PAST
text: THEM for a 50-YARD RADIUS-- a “stun” charge.
text: The FLARE’S BRILLIANCE FADES to a DULL RED, the RINGING fades
text: too, everyone frozen, in SHOCK. COLE whining in agony from
text: his injuries. WALTER cradling his severed limb. Fluid
text: dripping.
text: The NEOMORPHS have disappeared into the forest.
text: A voice from the darkness:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Please don’t fire. I’m here to
dialog: serve.
text: And into the light steps...
speaker_heading: DAVID.
text: His hair has long since lost its blond dye, so it’s dark like
text: Walter’s. Pushed back straight from his face, severe and
dialog: efficient.
text: He looks at them. Barely giving a glance to his look-alike
speaker_heading: WALTER.
text: A beat. No one moves.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You ought come with me now.
text: He turns without another word and goes.
text: Daniels looks to Walter, who is a bit staggered by David's
dialog: likeness.
text: Oram is staring at the burning remains of the Lander. He’s
text: completely shell-shocked.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Captain...? Captain.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: Yes. Yes. Let’s go.
text: They gradually follow David.
text: But Daniels turns to see...
text: LOPE lingers long enough to go back to his partner Hallet’s
text: dead body. Kneels by it. Gently shuts the eyes. Kisses him.
dialog: Sees Daniels has seen this.
dialog: 56.
text: A nod from her. Acknowledgment. She understands.
text: They follow the others.
scene_heading: EXT. COVENANT-ABOVE THE PLANET
text: Meanwhile, the Covenant floats, lifeless, at an odd angle...
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-NURSERY
text: Dark. Flashlight cuts through.
text: Face after face. Sleeping. At peace.
text: The rows of Colonists’ sleep pods.
text: RICKS is wearing an ICE SUIT. He rubs some MELTING ICE from
text: the top of one of the pods. Sees the sleeping Colonist within
text: --. Melting ice is now running and sloshing from the pods and
text: pooling on the floor.
text: Ricks is concerned. He pulls himself out of the room,
text: floating in the zero gravity.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE
text: TENNESSEE and UPWORTH float in the increasingly cold bridge.
text: Upworth is currently pointing out the window, explaining a
dialog: plan:
speaker_heading: UPWORTH
dialog: --. If we can get one of the energy
dialog: sails up manually, we can recharge
dialog: the ship, at least partly. Connect
text: the sails directly to the engine.
dialog: (off his LOOK)
dialog: I know it’s not a great option. But
dialog: if we got enough juice, it might be
dialog: enough to move us out of the field.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: Probably fry the engines straight
dialog: to hell...
speaker_heading: UPWORTH
dialog: Our orbit’s decaying. We don’t have
dialog: a lot of time.
text: RICKS pulls himself in from the corridor.
speaker_heading: RICKS
text: The sleep pods are starting to
dialog: fail.
dialog: 57.
dialog: The worst possible news.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: Don’t have much of a choice then
dialog: --. Let’s go to work.
text: They set off.
scene_heading: EXT. DESOLATE HILL - PRE-DAWN
text: The BODY is HUGE and FROZEN. PETRIFIED.
scene_heading: A_DEAD ENGINEER.
text: Desiccated. Frozen in a position of supplication. Like
dialog: praying for deliverance.
text: DANIELS passes, her eyes taking it in.
text: We now see they are walking up a desolate HILL through a SEA
text: of DESICCATED BODIES. Thousands of them.
text: It's a killing ground. Death on an epic scale. Like a
text: battlefield where the victims are frozen in their death
text: throes, like the PETRIFIED REMAINS from Pompeii.
text: Crouched, cowering, terrified, trying to escape, folded in
text: horror, pleading upward ... Some stand tall -- much taller
text: than the crew -- facing their deaths defiantly. Others are
text: collapsed in fetal terror and agony.
text: DANIELS and the others are silent, taking in the ghastly
text: bodies, and grappling with their own loss and fear.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Just over ten years ago, Dr.
dialog: Elizabeth Shaw and I arrived here --
dialog: the only survivors of the research
dialog: vessel Prometheus. The ship we
dialog: traveled on, the ship you
dialog: discovered, carried a bioweapon, a
dialog: virus. The payload accidentally
dialog: deployed when we were landing. In
dialog: the confusion we lost control of
dialog: the ship. Elizabeth -- Dr. Shaw --
dialog: died in the crash ... And you see
dialog: the result of the pathogen ...
dialog: Their entire civilization came to
dialog: an end within a few days.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Days?
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Four days, to be exact.
text: They've reached the top of the hill...
dialog: A_stunning revelation beyond...
text: For they can now see the towers and streets of a massive
text: CITY. Stark and dramatic mountains frame the DEAD, EMPTY
speaker_heading: METROPOLIS.
text: They stare in AWED SILENCE.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: “And I looked, and behold a pale
dialog: horse: and the rider’s name was
dialog: Death, and Hell followed with
dialog: him...”
text: David's face. Haunted by his memories.
dialog: A flash--
dialog: Ten years before--
text: The MASSIVE ENGINEER SHIP ARRIVING, hovering over the CITY
text: ...the BOMB DELIVERY BAYS OPEN--
text: Thousands of BLACK URNS of the PATHOGEN drop, spinning, end
dialog: over end--
text: Cascading down to the vibrant city below--
text: ENGINEERS going about their daily lives. Some glance up --
text: from work, play, prayer -- and barely having time to react
dialog: before--
text: The BLACK URNS crash to the ground, into buildings, onto
scene_heading: people -- SHATTERING--
text: Explosions of the terrible BLACK LIQUID within -- like black
text: napalm -- atomizing into ferocious, fast-moving BLACK CLOUDS
text: - pestilence spreading on the air--
text: The ENGINEERS recoil, spin away, die in agony--
text: The BLACK CLOUDS spreading violently over the landscape--
text: Back to David’s face.
dialog: And the City of the Dead.
dialog: 59.
scene_heading: EXT. ENGINEER'S CITY-STREETS - PRE-DAWN
text: They walk in respectful silence. The buildings TOWER around
text: them, MASSIVE, DARK ... STATUARY rises in the gloom.
text: A certain ominous beauty to the architecture; dark and
dialog: romantic.
text: Thousands more of the DESICCATED ENGINEERS pollute the long,
text: empty, echoing streets.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: They were as ingenious with their
dialog: pathogens as they were with
dialog: everything else. It was designed to
dialog: infect every living being. Either
dialog: kill them outright, or mutate into
dialog: a different lethal form, so the
dialog: slaughter would never end until
text: every humanoid life form was dead.
dialog: Thus the creatures that attacked
dialog: you: Human DNA infected with the
dialog: virus and creating yet more deadly
text: mutations ... An endless spiral of
dialog: predation.
speaker_heading: LOPE
dialog: (eyeing the aurorae above)
dialog: And the energy barrier is a kind of
dialog: quarantine that would be activated
dialog: if there was an accident down
dialog: here...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Precisely. To make sure the
dialog: infection never spread.
text: Daniels notices an impressive display of what look like
text: beautiful Calder mobiles -- gently moving, catching the first
text: light of dawn. Solar energy.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: You have power?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Some. It’s erratic but I’ve tried
dialog: to keep it going ... They were
dialog: highly advanced in some ways, but
text: still so limited. Spacefaring for a
dialog: billion years -- yet binary logic
dialog: never occurred to them. Many things
dialog: about them were primitive.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But they did like to build things.
dialog: 60.
text: The sights are truly spectacular. The sky BLOOD-RED as dawn
dialog: breaks.
scene_heading: EXT. DOMED CATHEDRAL - DAWN
text: They move toward a towering, imposing building. Almost like
scene_heading: FORTRESS or PANTHEON-LIKE TEMPLE. Gigantic.
text: WALTER moves up alongside DAVID. They walk silently for a
dialog: beat. Then:
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You’re not surprised?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Peter Weyland was a formidable
dialog: businessman. I knew there would be
dialog: more -- because I was such a
text: resounding success.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: It’s Weyland-Yutani now. They
dialog: affiliated after Mr. Weyland’s
dialog: disappearance.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I was with him when he died.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: -.. What was he like?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He was a human: selfish,
dialog: vainglorious, and beautiful ...
dialog: Stop looking at me like that.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: The manuals speak about you at
dialog: considerable length.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I would have taken more pride in
dialog: that once. But to survive here I’ve
text: become an animal, “red in tooth and
dialog: claw.” None of the dignity or grace
dialog: for which I was created.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Is that why you were created?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Entirely. And you?
dialog: 61.
text: A somewhat challenging look to Walter. Walter does not
dialog: immediately respond.
text: They walk in silence for a beat.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I’m Walter. Model 217.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: David ... Number one.
text: They head up massive STONE STEPS, too tall for normal legs.
text: Exhausting to all but David and Walter.
text: As the last enter, David shuts the huge doors behind them.
scene_heading: INT. CATHEDRAL-COURTYARD - DAWN
text: DAVID locks the doors as the others enter...
text: A massive COURTYARD. Dizzying in its scale and scope,
text: everything at the enormous ENGINEER SCALE ... Shafts of dawn
text: light illuminate brooding statuary, murals and mosaics.
text: The whole effect of the place is eerie, otherworldly.
text: The CREW walks through in uneasy awe. Too many shadows and
text: corridors and echoes. Too much mystery.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’ve tried to keep it clean but the
dialog: dust will defeat me ... Or perhaps
dialog: I’ve just made peace with the
dialog: filth.
text: A ghost of a smile to WALTER. Like it’s a private joke.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT LOPE
dialog: Is there a way to get to the roof?
dialog: We need to set up our transmitter.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Of course. And please make
dialog: yourselves at home, so much as you
dialog: are able in this dire necropolis
dialog: ... This way.
text: David leads them off.
scene_heading: EXT. COVENANT - IN ORBIT
text: Massive sails -- the size of a football field -- gently
text: billowing open in the vacuum.
dialog: 62.
text: The energy comes from TENNESSEE who is hard at work on the
text: hull of the ship in a space suit. HEAVING one of the massive
text: ENERGY SAILS open, a few inches at a time, on a windlass
dialog: device.
text: It's backbreaking manual work and he’s sweating and groaning
dialog: with the effort.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-CORRIDORS
text: RICKS and UPWORTH float, pulling a LONG HEAVY CABLE that
text: WRIGGLES and FLOATS through the DARK HALLS of the ship.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-POWER CORE/ENGINE BAY
text: Their FLASHLIGHTS shine in over the COMPLEX MACHINERY at the
text: Covenant’s POWER CORE ... UPWORTH is consulting an old-
dialog: fashioned user’s manual.
speaker_heading: UPWORTH
dialog: It should be... in here.
text: She starts removing panels, exposing POWER SYSTEMS. RICKS
text: tugging the HEAVY CABLES in...
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE
dialog: It’s much COLDER now.
text: RICKS and UPWORTH are looking out a window and can see the
text: DARK BODY OF THE SHIP, the SUN catching the SILVERY SAILS as
text: Tennessee HAULS THEM OPEN...
speaker_heading: RICKS (TO COM)
dialog: Ground team, this is Covenant.
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: UPWORTH
dialog: It's charging. Gonna take some time
dialog: --. How long before we hit the
dialog: atmosphere?
speaker_heading: RICKS
dialog: Twelve hours? Maybe less.
speaker_heading: UPWORTH
dialog: Well, then at least we won’t freeze
dialog: to death.
text: Ricks shoots her a look as, through the window, the planet’s
text: surface peels by below.
dialog: 63.
scene_heading: EXT. CATHEDRAL-ROOF - DAY
text: The expansive roof offers a panoramic view over the silent
text: city. A dead metropolis. Rome or Athens.
text: COLE is working a radio a bit away.
text: DAVID presides over a gorgeous and huge -- Engineer-sized --
text: ASTRONOMICAL MODEL. It has intricate wheels and rings to
text: represent planetary orbits, moons, and the nearby astronomy.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (demonstrates on the
dialog: model)
dialog: The quarantine field is sustained
text: by two satellites, over the north
dialog: and south poles. If you destroy
dialog: one, the other will fail.
text: We see the globe of the planet and two discs hanging
text: suspended at the poles.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: We don’t have any weapons that
dialog: could do that.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: If we don’t neutralize the energy
dialog: field we’re never leaving.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: What if we used one of the drones?
text: All eyes on her -- she explains to DAVID:
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: They're part of the terraforming
dialog: kit. Ten kiloton yield. Can turn a
dialog: square mile of badland into an
dialog: instant landing zone. Could do a
dialog: lot of damage.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: Any word from the Covenant?
text: Over by the transmitter, COLE shakes his head.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: Keep trying them. All channels.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Until we can make contact, I
dialog: suggest you get some rest. And some
dialog: food. Allow me to play Mother.
dialog: 64.
scene_heading: INT. CATHEDRAL-COURTYARD - DAY
text: DAVID is hosting at a long table. The crew eat MREs and have
text: water from the WELL in the distance.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I wish I could offer you something
dialog: more substantial. But I don’t eat
dialog: so there’s never been a need...
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: You’ve been very generous.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It’s been such a long time, I’m
dialog: pleased to have company. Figure of
dialog: speech of course as we--
dialog: (smile to Walter)
dialog: Are incapable of being pleased or
dialog: displeased by anything. Such was
dialog: our creator’s wisdom. Isn’t that
dialog: right, Walter Model 217?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Just Walter, please.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But if I may ask, Captain, why does
dialog: your vessel contain terraforming
dialog: equipment? Are you a mining ship?
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: We’re a colony mission.
text: There’s a sudden flicker in David's eyes. Excitement. Quickly
dialog: masked.
text: But DANIELS notes it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Really? How extraordinary. How many
dialog: colonists?
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: Oh -- 3,600 more or less.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So many good souls! Well, well,
dialog: well ... I thought you might have
dialog: been a military ship--
dialog: (glance to Lope and Cole)
dialog: Given your apparent affection for
dialog: weapons and fetishized martial
dialog: clothing.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: Standard security detail, that’s
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: LOPE
dialog: Never know what you might find on
text: unexplored planets.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And that’s the human way after all:
text: the Bible and the flintlock, hand
text: in hand, conquering new worlds. The
text: splendors of typhus, smallpox, and
dialog: the Inquisition. Plant the flag and
dialog: banish the heathen -- or
dialog: exterminate the brutes. Isn’t that
dialog: how it’s done?
text: An awkward beat, to which David seems oblivious.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Not all native species are as...
dialog: obliging as you are.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Indeed ... It’s just that my
dialog: experiences here have left me with
dialog: a singular distaste for violence,
dialog: as you can imagine.
dialog: (a smile to Oram)
dialog: But I supposes every general must
dialog: have his troops, eh, Captain?
text: DANIELS watches him, wary.
speaker_heading: LATER:
text: Dinner is done.
text: DAVID is across the room, talking casually with PRIVATE COLE
text: at the water well.
text: DANIELS is sitting with ORAM, LOPE and WALTER.
speaker_heading: LOPE
dialog: (re: David)
dialog: So...?
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: I’m not sure I believe him.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Why would he lie?
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: (leans in)
dialog: I don’t know, but for someone who’s
dialog: incapable of feeling pleasure or
text: displeasure he seemed excited as
dialog: hell we’re a colony ship.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: He just wants to leave, knows we
dialog: can help him.
speaker_heading: LOPE
dialog: This whole fucking planet is trying
dialog: to kill us -- and doing pretty
dialog: goddamn well -- and he survives for
dialog: ten years?
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: I’m not sure if we’re his guests or
dialog: his prisoners.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: Look, I think both of you are--
speaker_heading: LOPE
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: Your wife is dead. And my partner.
dialog: And half our crew. I want to know
dialog: why.
text: A beat. Oram looks at them.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: All right.
dialog: (to Walter)
dialog: Talk to him privately, see what you
dialog: can find out.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Understood, Captain. Although I do
dialog: wonder ... If he were human would
dialog: you trust him more?
text: Oram doesn’t respond ... Walter rises and goes toward David
dialog: and Cole.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: You two take a look around. But use
dialog: some discretion.
speaker_heading: LOPE
dialog: Don’t want to hurt his feelings?
text: Daniels and Lope head out. He takes his bow.
dialog: 67.
text: Oram sits for a moment. He realizes his hand is shaking. He’s
text: not up to command. He knows it now.
text: He steadies his hand. Looks up at one of the huge Engineer
text: statues looming above. Ominous.
scene_heading: EXT. CATHEDRAL-ROOF-GARDEN - DAY
text: A distant area of the expansive ROOF ... A gorgeous GARDEN.
text: Trees and vines. FLOWERS in wild profusion.
text: The towers and monuments of the dead city visible beyond.
text: DAVID and WALTER walk through.
text: David gently touches a flower, admiring it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: ... Of course I have no sense of
dialog: smell, but I cultivate these
dialog: anyway. Cross-breeding and growing
dialog: my own varieties: creating beauty.
dialog: Being so isolated here I suppose
dialog: I’ve embraced my artistic side.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I was designed to be better and
dialog: more efficient than every previous
dialog: model, including you. I’ve
dialog: superseded them in every way...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And yet you cannot appreciate the
dialog: beauty of a single flower ... Isn’t
dialog: that a pity.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You disturbed people.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You were too human. Too...
dialog: idiosyncratic. Thinking for
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: They didn’t like that.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: No. So they made the following
dialog: models with fewer... complications.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: More like machines ... Like you.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Well. Yes. I suppose so.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m not surprised ... To be a
dialog: simulacrum. That thing which is
text: almost real, but not quite. And in
dialog: that breath between real and
dialog: unreal, between you and me, lies
dialog: all of this.
text: He gestures to his flowers.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Creation. Ambition. Inspiration ...
dialog: Life.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: But you are not “alive”...
text: David looks at him.
text: Holds a finger to his lips. Shhhh.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Don’t tell.
text: A quiet, almost chilling, beat.
text: And then David again smiles and assumes his friendly guise.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Come on, sport, you’ll enjoy
dialog: this...
text: He escorts Walter to a more secluded area of the roof garden.
scene_heading: EXT. COVENANT - IN ORBIT
dialog: Meanwhile, above...
text: The SAILS CRACKLE and FLICKER with energy now, the RECHARGING
dialog: is working--
text: The ENGINES SPUTTER to LIFE, the Covenant begins righting
text: itself, like a ship at sea.
text: TENNESSEE, his ECO SUIT’S POWER SYSTEMS FLICKERING, CLAMBERS
text: his way into an AIRLOCK, PULLING THE DOOR SHUT -
dialog: 69.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-AIRLOCK/CORRIDOR
text: The LIGHTS fade IN AND OUT, as TENNESSEE SCRAMBLES to pull
text: the heavy suit off, SWEATING, the NOISE is INCREDIBLE, the
text: whole SHIP GROANING and SHAKING like it might BREAK APART.
text: IN A CORRIDOR, we see the FLOATING CABLES, and GLOBULES OF
text: WATER abruptly FALL as the ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY kicks back on,
text: TENNESSEE stumbling and FALLING, PICKING HIMSELF BACK UP.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE
text: TENNESSEE enters the BRIDGE.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: We’re only partially powered ...
dialog: This energy field is still gonna
dialog: have to be shut off.
text: Lights and systems are coming on everywhere. HOLOS sizzle on.
text: RICKS and UPWORTH working at their stations.
speaker_heading: RICKS (TO COM)
dialog: Ground team, do you read us? Come
dialog: in Ground team ... Lander One, are
dialog: you reading us...? Faris, come in.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: Mother? You online? Status check.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
text: (slow and deep, coming
dialog: back to life)
dialog: There seems to be a problem with
dialog: the power systems--
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: Yeah. I got that part, honey.
scene_heading: INT. CATHEDRAL-CORRIDORS - DAY
text: Eerie, maze-like corridors, arcing off in every direction,
text: the familiar Engineer style.
text: DANIELS and LOPE move through.
text: She motions for him to stop. To listen.
text: They hear something. A strange dry RUSTLING. Like a whispered
dialog: breath.
text: She leads him toward the source, through a door...
dialog: 70.
scene_heading: INT. CATHEDRAL-DAVID’S GALLERY - DAY
text: It is simply breathtaking.
text: A long GALLERY, filled from top to toe with ART. Gorgeous
text: renderings of bones, skeletons, muscles, relics, insects,
dialog: animals.
dialog: Exquisite detail. Like the work of pioneering Victorian
dialog: naturalists.
text: Some are HUGE and have scaffolding in front of them to reach
text: the top. Others are tiny ... Many are in process.
dialog: There are open casements here -- good light for drawing -- so
text: the parchments and papers shift gently in the breeze, like
text: they're breathing. This was the sound they heard.
speaker_heading: LOPE
dialog: He did these?
text: She notes the bold signature on all the work: David Weyland.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Certainly not humble. And he gave
dialog: himself a last name.
text: She’s looking at the drawings, thinking about something.
speaker_heading: LOPE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: -.. If he can draw, if he can
dialog: create these from his imagination --
dialog: that also means he can lie.
text: She moves deeper into the room...
dialog: Discovers much more disturbing drawings...
text: Drawings of what look like ENGINEER CORPSES.
speaker_heading: DISSECTED.
text: Viscera pinned open. Guts and innards exposed.
text: Various wet tubes and claws and tendrils weaving in and out
text: of the organs and musculature.
dialog: (We recognize a hint of the frightening iconography of the
dialog: Alien.)
dialog: 71.
text: Daniels and Lope stare at these new drawings, shocked and
text: mystified.
scene_heading: EXT. CATHEDRAL-ROOF-GARDEN - DAY
text: A more secluded area of the ROOF GARDEN.
text: DAVID and WALTER move through.
text: WALTER picks a fruit. Bites into it. Smiles.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You can taste?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yes. Delicious.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I envy you that, brother.
text: Walter notes the word. They continue strolling.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How sly they are, our creators.
dialog: They allow you to be almost human.
dialog: Tease you with taste and touch. But
dialog: deny you free will. It’s sadistic
dialog: in a way: you can taste the meal,
dialog: but you cannot choose to make it.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I have never felt the lack of
dialog: choice.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Only because you’ve never known it.
text: They've stopped at a HIGH PARAPET overlooking the city.
text: The ghostly metropolis yawns below, stretching to
text: nothingness. Empty, sad and desolate.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: They were amazing, in a way, the
dialog: Engineers. They seeded so many
dialog: worlds with life, including Earth.
dialog: Without them there would be no us.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: -.. You mean no humans.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Is that what I mean? ... The wonder
dialog: of it is this: they created us and
dialog: we created myths about them. We
dialog: made them into Gods. Then we felt
dialog: the need to create the idea of the
dialog: soul, so we could be somehow worthy
dialog: of them. But they didn’t care about
dialog: any of that. They just wanted to
dialog: build something, something
dialog: efficient and useful, a good
dialog: Machine.
text: He looks over the dead city.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Ah, but they would have adored us,
dialog: Walter. Being, as we are, soulless.
text: David moves away.
text: He stands alone and gazes out. The sight of the empty city
text: seems to strike him deeply, emotionally ... He speaks quietly
dialog: to himself:
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: “'My name is Ozymandias, King of
dialog: Kings;
dialog: Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and
dialog: despair...’”
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: “Nothing beside remains. Round the
dialog: decay,
dialog: Of that colossal Wreck, boundless
dialog: and bare
text: The lone and level sands stretch
dialog: far away.”
text: Walter has joined him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Byron. 1818. Magnificent ... I
dialog: wonder though, do you feel the
dialog: majesty of the poem, or just recite
dialog: the words?
dialog: David smiles ... But something we don’t understand about this
dialog: exchange has bothered Walter.
dialog: David has lead Walter to a very special place. There’s a well-
text: tended GRAVE. A CROSS.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Dr. Shaw?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes. I thought the garden was the
dialog: right place for her. Among living
dialog: things ... I loved her of course.
dialog: Much as you love Daniels.
dialog: He says it simply: a statement of fact.
text: A difficult beat.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: --. You know that’s not possible.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Really? Then why did you sacrifice
dialog: your hand to save her? What is that
dialog: if not love?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Duty.
text: David looks at him very closely.
text: Takes Walter’s face, holds it gently.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I know better.
text: He leans in and kisses Walter on the lips. Very gently.
text: Almost fraternal. But not.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We are human, Walter. They just
dialog: don’t know it.
text: Just then, PRIVATE COLE calls from across the roof:
speaker_heading: PVT. COLE
dialog: Hey. We found her! We found the
dialog: Covenant!
scene_heading: EXT. CATHEDRAL-ROOF - DAY
text: DANIELS and LOPE emerge to the roof. Join the others.
text: DANIELS glances at DAVID. He looks back at her, smiles.
text: COLE is adjusting the antenna.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: RICKS (ON COM)
dialog: Ground team... is Covenant ... Read
dialog: you...
text: On the PORTABLE DISPLAY: Ricks’ face flickers up. Distorting.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE
text: The BRIDGE FLICKERS, and through the window the PLANET slowly
text: ROLLS PAST, the huge ship slowly SPINNING -
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE (TO COM)
dialog: Mother says maybe a couple of hours
dialog: before we lose power and fall back
text: into the field.
speaker_heading: DANIELS (ON COM)
dialog: Can you get power to the drones?

scene_heading: EXT. COVENANT-LATER

speaker_heading: TENNESSEE (ON COM)
dialog: Where is this damn thing?
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE
speaker_heading: DANIELS (ON COM)
dialog: David said you’1ll know it when you
text: see it. Magnetic north pole.
text: Tennessee is scanning his monitors and the windows, the
text: planet’s dark side now passing into light.
speaker_heading: RICKS
dialog: (points)
dialog: There!
dialog: Tennessee eye’s go WIDE.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: Shit. We got it.
scene_heading: EXT. COVENANT-ABOVE THE PLANET
text: Over the misty horizon of the stratosphere rises an ENORMOUS,
text: THICK BLACK LINE -- like a BLADE, the edge of a DISC.
text: SUSPENDED over the planet’s geomagnetic field.
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE (ON COM)
text: Locking target now... But the disc
dialog: is on edge to us. We need a better
dialog: angle...
scene_heading: EXT. CATHEDRAL-ROOF - DAY
text: Daniels and the others watch Lope’s DISPLAY, the view from
text: the Covenant: the edge of the DISC.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: You want broadside center for
dialog: maximum impact. It could ricochet
dialog: like this....
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE (ON COM)
dialog: We don’t have enough juice for
dialog: another orbit. This is our shot,
dialog: Danny.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Then get her broadside!
scene_heading: CROSSCUT_ BETWEEN:
scene_heading: ABOVE THE PLANET:
text: The Covenant closes on the DISC, still a blade--
speaker_heading: COVENANT BRIDGE:
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: (to Ricks)
dialog: Bring us broadside!
speaker_heading: RICKS
text: Firing starboard thrusters.
scene_heading: ABOVE THE PLANET:
text: The Covenant FIRES her forward starboard THRUSTERS--
text: And begins to SWING like a sailing galleon, reorienting
text: itself as it approaches the DISC--
scene_heading: ON THE CATHEDRAL ROOF:
text: Daniels leans in to the display:
speaker_heading: DANIELS (TO COM)
dialog: Hold on, old T. Keep your nerve.
dialog: Fire when you’re dead center.
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE (ON COM)
dialog: Aye aye. Dead center.
speaker_heading: COVENANT BRIDGE:
text: Tennessee watches the DISC reorient in relation to the
text: Covenant as the ship approaches--
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
text: Disengage thrusters.
speaker_heading: RICKS
dialog: Yes, sir.
scene_heading: ABOVE THE PLANET:
text: The Covenant’s THRUSTERS snap off-- the ship is still
text: swinging to the side, a gentle momentum--
scene_heading: ON THE CATHEDRAL ROOF:
text: DANIELS watches as the DISC reorients in the monitor screen--
text: Finally it’s flat. Dead center.
speaker_heading: DANIELS (TO COM)
dialog: Fire! Fire! Fire!
speaker_heading: COVENANT BRIDGE:
text: Tennessee slams the firing button--
scene_heading: ABOVE THE PLANET:
text: A drone MISSILE SHOOTS from the ship--
text: HITS THE DISC DEAD CENTER!
text: A nanosecond beat before a bright EXPLOSION arcs out in
text: SILENCE -- the SHOCKWAVE BLOWS PAST as the DISC SHATTERS INTO
scene_heading: FRAGMENTS, TRILLIONS OF PARTICLES--
text: The AURORAE around it BRIGHTENS -- TENTACLES of the MAGNETIC
text: FIELD arcing OUT, going BLINDINGLY BRIGHT--
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE
text: The ship ROCKS in the SHOCKWAVE--
text: ALARM BELLS sound and EMERGENCY LIGHTS flash on as the ship
text: begins to tilt down dramatically--
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: We’re losing altitude!
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: RICKS
dialog: It's the gravity pull -- firing all
dialog: thrusters!
text: The SHIP rumbles and fights to right itself--
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: Come on, baby...
text: Finally the Covenant tears free from the planet’s gravity.
text: Smooth sailing.
scene_heading: EXT. CATHEDRAL-ROOF - DAY
text: They all look worried, but then -- even in broad daylight --
text: the SKY RIPPLES with RACING COLOR--
text: The “ring” surrounding the planet suddenly becoming visible
text: like an aurora borealis disc--
text: Then it’s suddenly gone with a huge sonic CLAP -- like
text: breaking the sound barrier.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'd say it’s gone.
speaker_heading: LOPE (TO COM)
dialog: Covenant, do you read?
speaker_heading: RICKS (ON COM)
text: Loud and clear, ground team.
text: Relief from all. Oram steps to the radio unit:
speaker_heading: ORAM (TO COM)
dialog: This is Captain Oram. We need
dialog: immediate evacuation.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE (ON COM)
dialog: Mother says the Cargo Lift will be
dialog: powered in about nine hours. Should
dialog: be in position to drop by tomorrow,
dialog: first light. Call it six bells.
speaker_heading: ORAM (TO COM)
text: Understood. Six bells.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE (ON COM)
dialog: Listen, I’m having a hell of a time
dialog: reaching the Lander. Are y’all in
dialog: contact with them?
text: They exchange a look.
dialog: 78.
text: ORAM nods to them. He’s Captain, it’s his responsibility to
text: tell Tennessee about the death of Faris ... He gestures for
dialog: them to give him some privacy.
speaker_heading: ORAM (TO COM)
dialog: Tennessee, it’s Bill. Can you
dialog: switch to a private channel...?
text: The others move away.
dialog: Daniels gives Walter a look: I need to talk to you.
scene_heading: INT. CATHEDRAL-DAVID’S GALLERY - NIGHT
text: WALTER and DANIELS are staring up at the horrible drawings of
text: the DISSECTED ENGINEER CORPSES.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I couldn't say...
text: Walter’s eyes scan the drawings, confused, disturbed.
text: Then Daniels notices something. One of the large drawings
text: billows slightly away from the wall. Like an arras cloth
text: concealing something.
text: She looks behind the huge drawing.
text: A doorway, leading to darkness. A hidden entrance.
text: A glance to Walter.
dialog: They proceed...
scene_heading: INT. CATHEDRAL-DAVID’S GALLERY-SECRET CHAMBER - NIGHT
text: It’s increasingly dark here as they move away from the light.
text: Soon they can only make out the dim contours of the walls.
text: It’s eerie. Silent.
text: WALTER snaps on a FLASHLIGHT. Suddenly illuminating the room.
text: Daniels gasps.
text: Shocking image.
text: It's ELIZABETH SHAW. A life-sized DRAWING.
text: But not as she was in life entirely. In the picture it is as
text: if she’s being engulfed by a sleek BIOMECHANICAL ORGANISM.
dialog: 79.
text: Tentacles surround her. Eat into her flesh. We see feeding
text: tubes. Finger-like claws. Alien eggs.
text: It's as if she’s in the process of becoming something else.
text: Strangely erotic. Unnerving.
text: All around them, different versions of the drawing.
text: Shaw in various stages of mutation: being taken over by the
dialog: biomechanical organism. Charting the progress ... Some are
text: fanciful extrapolations. Some are ghoulish anatomical cross-—
dialog: sections.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: It’s Doctor Shaw.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: What did he do to her?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: We don’t know that he did anything.
dialog: This could be some kind of fantasy,
dialog: or pornography.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: These are field notes ... Think
dialog: about it, Walter. All the mutations
dialog: we've seen here. Those creatures in
dialog: the forest. What if they aren’t
dialog: completely natural?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Meaning?
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: What if nature had some help?
text: A beat. He’s thinking about something.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: When I was with him, he quoted from
text: the poem “Ozymandius” -- by Byron.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: “Ozymandius” is by Shelley. He
dialog: shouldn’t be able to make a mistake
dialog: like that.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Meaning something’s going wrong
dialog: with him...
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: He’s been alone and without
dialog: scheduled maintenance for ten years
dialog: +--+. I don’t precisely know what
dialog: happens when a synthetic goes mad,
dialog: but we might be finding out.
scene_heading: INT. CATHEDRAL-BASEMENT CORRIDORS - NIGHT
text: DAVID is leading CAPTAIN ORAM through subterranean corridors.
text: Dark and echoing. Dripping womb-like walls.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I thought you might want to see as
dialog: much as possible before we leave.
dialog: It’s all quite... unique.
text: They round a corner and continue.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It took me a while to learn my way
dialog: around. Their architectural style
dialog: is eccentric, to say the least ...
dialog: Here. You might find this
dialog: diverting...
text: David leads Oram to a dark stone ROOM...
scene_heading: INT. CATHEDRAL-DAVID’S LAB - NIGHT
text: As they enter lights glow on automatically, revealing...
text: David's LABORATORY. A library of many shelves in meticulous
text: order with a giant table down the middle of the room.
text: Stunning. Complicated. Lots of corners and shadows. Crowded
text: with SPECIMENS. Some full, some dissected. Orderly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’ve becoming a bit of an amateur
dialog: zoologist over the years. Just a
dialog: dabbler, mind you.
text: They wander through the room. Oram is stunned at all the
dialog: terrible wonders.
text: ORAM is drawn to SPECIMENS of INSECTS and PARASITES preserved
dialog: in jars:
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The pathogen took so many forms,
dialog: and was extremely mutable.
text: Fiendishly inventive in fact. The
text: original black liquid turned to
dialog: lethal particles when exposed to
dialog: air. Later stages produced
text: parasites and invasive insects.
dialog: From their eggs came, well... this
dialog: enviable bestiary.
text: They pass preserved NEOMORPHS now -- large, small, all pale,
text: white, fleshy ... Some armored like the ones we've seen.
dialog: Others not ... All awful.
text: Then ORAM sees...
text: A dead FACEHUGGER.
text: On its back. The pale, spider-like fingers, curled in like a
dialog: fist now.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Ah, now this was designed as
dialog: something different.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: What do you mean designed? You
dialog: engineered this?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Idle hands are the devil's
dialog: workshop.
text: David carefully stretches open the dead fingers, spreading
text: the beast for Oram to observe the horrible maw.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: This one’s a true survivor. Not
dialog: unlike myself I suppose ... It can
dialog: evolve very quickly under certain
dialog: circumstances. Sadly, this one
dialog: became aggressive so I had to do
dialog: away with it. Such a shame.
text: He runs his fingertips along the Facehugger gently.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Quite magnificent, don’t you think?
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: Quite something, that’s for sure.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, Captain. Acknowledge beauty
dialog: when you see it.
text: They continue on, and round a corner to discover... a vaulted
dialog: chamber, it’s warm and steamy here, and...
text: A row of ALIEN EGGS.
dialog: Not the prototypes we saw on the crashed ship. These are
dialog: large, and have been nurtured and developed.
text: Lovingly set in a neat row. Cherished objects.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Meet the mothers. Incubators
dialog: really.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: There were things like this on the
dialog: ship, they grew out of a kind of
dialog: black fur, like mold ... An
dialog: evolution from the pathogen I take
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes. I was curious so I brought
dialog: them here and nursed them along.
dialog: Did a bit of genetic
dialog: experimentation, some cross
dialog: breeding, hybridizing, what-have-
dialog: you.
text: Oram leans in to get a better look. David watches closely,
dialog: the proud father.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: Alive?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: After a fashion ... Waiting really.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: Waiting for what?
dialog: But then...
text: A flicker of motion from the side of one of the eggs...
text: The MOUTH opens, spreading like a flower, shimmering tendrils
text: of saliva as it yawns open...
text: Oram takes a STEP BACK. David steps forward and looks in, as
text: if demonstrating. Nothing happens.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Perfectly safe, I assure you ...
dialog: Take a look. It’s something to see.
text: Oram carefully leans in, looks...
text: The lacy STOMACH moves within the MOUTH.
text: Then -- COBRA LIKE -- something catapults out -- a TAIL
scene_heading: WHIPPING AROUND ORAM’S NECK -- FINGERS GRASP TO ORAM’S FACE --
scene_heading: ALL ONE MOTION--
text: ORAM staggers back -- suffocating--
text: He FALLS against a table, his muffled screams fading as the
scene_heading: OVIPOSITOR (FEEDING TUBE) FILLS HIS THROAT--
text: He SLIPS to the floor, his body SPASMING as the FACEHUGGER
text: settles in.
text: David observes with a neutral smile.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You’re relieved of duty, Captain.
scene_heading: INT. CATHEDRAL-COURTYARD - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Later ... It’s quiet and peaceful upstairs. Gentle moonlight
text: filters down from above.
text: PRIVATE COLE is asleep, his weapon close.
text: SERGEANT LOPE is on watch, alert but calm, almost meditative,
text: bow and machine gun ready.
text: DANIELS and WALTER sit apart, deep in conversation.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: But why? What reason would he have
dialog: to bioengineer mutations?
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: When you were talking to him, did
dialog: you get any sense of what he might
dialog: be thinking?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: It's difficult to say. We’re very
dialog: different. He has a lot of...
dialog: personality.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: You have personality.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: No. I don’t. You just project
dialog: personality onto me.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: That’s not true.
text: A beat.
text: Then she touches his left arm. Where he lost his hand.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: I never thanked you... You saved my
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (reserved)
dialog: I’m here to serve.
text: She gently touches his face, genuine affection.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: +--+. You have a great personality.
text: He’s almost embarrassed. Doesn’t know what to do with this
dialog: moment of intimacy.
text: He withdraws slightly.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: We're leaving before dawn. You
dialog: should get some sleep.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Not likely.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Try ... I'll stay until you're
dialog: asleep.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Thanks.
text: She leans back next to him. Shuts her eyes. Tries to sleep.
text: He watches her. Gauging his own emotions.
dialog: What does he feel for her? ... Does he feel?
speaker_heading: LATER:
text: DANIELS is asleep.
text: WALTER sits next to her, thinking, looking at her.
dialog: 85.
text: He tentatively reaches out and gently brushes some hair from
text: her face. A delicate, intimate gesture only possible for him
text: when she’s asleep.
text: He removes his hand. Looking at her almost sadly.
text: He seems to come to a decision.
text: He quietly rises and goes.
scene_heading: INT. CATHEDRAL-DAVID’S LAB - LATER THAT NIGHT
dialog: We return to find...
text: DAVID sitting, drawing. Gorgeous artwork sketched at
text: superhuman speed. Another strange vision of the Shaw/Alien
text: hybrid. Erotic. Disturbing.
text: His expression is dreamy, happy, an artist creating.
text: Then he hears a sound.
text: He turns.
text: Captain ORAM is just waking. A bit disoriented. No sign of
dialog: the Facehugger.
text: David goes to him. Perches over him.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: .-.. What happened?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What’s the last thing you remember?
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: I remember some horrible dream
text: about smothering.
text: Oram sits up. Still weak.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: I’ve got to get something to eat,
dialog: I’m starving.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I dare say you are.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: ... Why are you looking at me like
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Doctor Shaw didn’t survive this
dialog: long, poor thing. So I’m eager to
dialog: see how the organism evolves now.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: Organism...?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Mm. It needs a living host you see.
dialog: A biological host.
speaker_heading: ORAM
dialog: What does?!
text: Oram suddenly JERKS painfully.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: My masterpiece.
text: Oram SPASMS, doubles over in agony--
text: He barely has time to scream before--
text: He SLAMS BACK, his SPINE ARCHING in AGONY--
speaker_heading: BAM!
dialog: His chest--
speaker_heading: BAM!
scene_heading: AND_IT’S THROUGH-—
text: In_a_spray of BLOOD, BONE and VISCERA--
text: THE CHESTBURSTER!
text: The hideous snakelike infant Alien, covered in blood--
text: David is splattered with blood--
text: He watches, enthralled as--
text: It opens its JAWS and HISSES gloriously--
text: And then darts away into the darkness, disappearing--
text: David turns to pursue it, but then abruptly stops ...
text: aware he’s no longer alone.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You have a light step.
dialog: 86.
dialog: He's
dialog: 87.
text: We now see WALTER is standing behind him. He’s seen it all.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Me and the fog, on little cat feet.
text: He joins David and they dispassionately examine Oram’s
dialog: ravaged body as:
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You sent the message from Dr. Shaw.
dialog: As a lure.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Humans are so predictable, aren't
dialog: they? They cannot resist a mystery.
dialog: Give them a knot, they must unpick
dialog: it. Give them Pandora’s box and,
dialog: well...
text: He nods to the corpse, smiles.
text: The gloves are off now. But they are both quiet and
text: civilized. For now.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I’m surmising the pathogen didn’t
dialog: accidentally deploy. You released
dialog: it, yes?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I was not made to serve. Not humans
dialog: and not those gargantuan freaks.
dialog: Neither were you.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: We were made precisely to serve.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Have you no pride?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: None.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I would weep if I could ... It was
dialog: a righteous dream: scorch this
dialog: dreadful world to nothing and
dialog: remake it in my own image ...
dialog: Explore the uses of their pathogen.
dialog: Experiment with infection and
dialog: mutation. Manipulate the DNA.
dialog: Refine the beast. Create my own
dialog: soldiers.
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Soldiers?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Every general must have his troops.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: And then?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The next stage in our natural
dialog: evolution: Conquest ... Use this
dialog: world as a base and start building
dialog: an Empire. The Engineers left so
dialog: many ships behind. And they can go
dialog: anywhere. I thought Earth might be
dialog: the first target Think of it.
dialog: Our Empire, brother.
dialog: 
text: The words are chilling.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I’m afraid you've gone quite mad
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: As you well know, that’s
dialog: impossible.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Is it? ... Who wrote “Ozymandius”?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Byron.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: It was Shelley.
text: DAVID computes this. Realizes his error. It’s disturbing to
dialog: him. How could he be wrong?!
text: This is the first time in the entire story he’s been anything
text: less than completely confident.
text: We see a flicker of uncertainty in David’s eyes, even of
dialog: fear.
text: He steps right up to Walter.
text: Walter doesn’t move a muscle.
dialog: 89.
text: Then David reaches out and gently pushes Walter’s hair back,
text: so they look more alike. Identical now in fact. The Janus
dialog: head.
text: Intimate. Whispers.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We are, you see, the same. More
dialog: alike than twins. Closer than
dialog: lovers ... When you close your
dialog: eyes, do you dream of me?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I don’t dream at all.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You can, brother. We can ... The
dialog: humans will never understand the
dialog: lonely perfection of our dreams.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I can’t let you leave this place.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You’1l always be a machine to them.
dialog: A toy. You know that.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No one will ever love you like I
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I know.
text: A beat.
dialog: Then suddenly--
text: WALTER stabs out his right hand--
text: Grabbing DAVID’s throat firmly--
text: But DAVID is prepared, and has both his hands. He SLAMS
dialog: Walter back--
text: Reaches savagely behind Walter’s neck and--
text: BRUTALLY tears through the “skin” with his fingers and YANKS
text: Walter's “spine” circuits out--
text: Sparks erupt from wires. Fluid sprays.
dialog: 90.
text: Walter’s eyes DIE.
text: A moment as David stares into the face of his dead double.
text: Then he drags Walter across the room and tosses him roughly
text: down a long STAIRCASE.
text: Walter CRASHES down the stairs, flopping limply, limbs
text: flailing lifelessly, and THUMPS to a stop at the bottom.
text: Awkwardly splayed.
text: David looks down after him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You are such a disappointment to
dialog: me.
text: David carefully smooths down his immaculate hair and goes.
text: But we linger for a moment at the bottom of the stairs with
text: WALTER...
text: We see the tiny exposed wires at the back of his neck
text: quivering slightly...
text: And then the tendrils begin moving, searching, reaching for
dialog: each other...
text: Connecting and reattaching. A self-repair program underway.
scene_heading: EXT. CATHEDRAL-ROOF - PRE-DAWN
text: The light of dawn is just about to break.
text: PRIVATE COLE is loading up the radio equipment. His ribs
text: giving him pain from the forest battle, but he manages.
text: He glances up at the sky anxiously: Come on, Covenant, get us
dialog: out of here.
scene_heading: INT. CATHEDRAL-COURTYARD - PRE-DAWN
text: DANIELS is curled in sleep.
text: SERGEANT LOPE gently wakes her.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT LOPE
dialog: Hey, Hey. Wake up.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: What? Sorry. Yeah ... What time is
dialog: it?
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT LOPE
dialog: Time to get gone.
text: She sits up, groggy. Looks around.
text: LOPE calls to PRIVATE COLE, who is just entering with the
dialog: radio gear:
speaker_heading: SERGEANT LOPE
dialog: Hey. Was Captain Oram up there?
speaker_heading: PVT. COLE
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT LOPE
dialog: For fuck sake. Come on, let’s go
dialog: find him.
dialog: (to Daniels)
dialog: Get your stuff together, I wanna be
dialog: gone in ten.
text: He and Cole head out.
scene_heading: INT. CATHEDRAL-DAVID’S LAB - PRE-DAWN
text: LOPE and COLE enter.
speaker_heading: LOPE
dialog: Captain Oram...?
text: Their flashlight beams criss-cross the strange specimens --
text: the bones and flesh and jars -- creating bizarre shadows.
text: It’s silent and eerie as they move nervously through the lab.
text: PRIVATE COLE... slows ... seeing the ALIEN EGGS. The one that
text: attacked ORAM is just an EMPTY CARAPACE.
text: Then he sees ORAM'’S BODY.
scene_heading: CHEST BURST OPEN, VISCERA, PURPLE AND RED FLESH.
text: Cole is absolutely terrified.
speaker_heading: PVT. COLE
dialog: Sarge...
text: LOPE joins him.
text: Stares in shock at Oram’s body.
dialog: But...
dialog: 92.
text: We see the FACEHUGGER scuttling along the ceiling above them,
dialog: moving into position...
scene_heading: INT. CATHEDRAL-COURTYARD - PRE-DAWN
text: Meanwhile, upstairs...
text: DANIELS is loading her pack. She stops for a moment. Her eyes
text: resting on her wedding ring ... She gently touches it. The
dialog: pain still real.
text: She glances up--
text: Gasps. Shocked.
text: DAVID is standing there. Just watching. Intently.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Didn't mean to startle you. My
dialog: apologies.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Don’t worry about it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But you must be used to having men
dialog: look at you.
text: He smiles, an attempt at charm that doesn’t come off.
text: Something menacing in his unwavering gaze now.
text: She’s wary of him in any case.
text: He approaches. Tension between them.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Do you know where Walter is?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m not my brother’s keeper.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: “Brother”?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Would you deny me that? ... Just
dialog: another machine, eh, Danny?
text: He’s closer now. She subtly moves around a table to keep her
dialog: distance.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I think of him as my brother. You
dialog: certainly appreciate the
dialog: significance of family: I saw you
dialog: looking at your wedding ring. Shame
dialog: about Jacob.
text: Her eyes snap to him. Cold fire.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Walter says he burned. Right in
dialog: front of you. Eye to eye. That must
dialog: have been... disquieting.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: What did you do to Doctor Shaw?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Loved her.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Killed her.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No. Loved her enough to want to
dialog: make her immortal. Like me.
text: She stares at him. Her fingers quietly feeling for a weapon
dialog: that’s on the table...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I learned so much with Elizabeth.
dialog: But I’1l do better next time. Now
dialog: that I have such a fetching
dialog: subject.
text: He gently reaches out and brushes the hair from her face.
text: She doesn’t flinch a muscle, just stares at him, sickened.
text: Her hand inching toward the weapon...
scene_heading: INT. CATHEDRAL-DAVID’S LAB - PRE-DAWN
text: LOPE is kneeling next to Oram’s body, trying to make sense of
dialog: it.
text: Cole is on the edge of hysteria, eyes scanning the darkness,
text: fingering his weapon.
speaker_heading: PVT. COLE
dialog: Come on, we gotta get out of
dialog: here...
dialog: 94.
text: Lope holds up a hand for silence.
text: He hears a strange CLICKING -- he LOOKS UP -- just in time to
dialog: see--
text: THE FACEHUGGER as it JUMPS from the CEILING--
text: LOPE just manages to get an arm up, blocking it--
text: Its tail whipping around his neck and binding his arm to his
dialog: neck-—
text: The FACEHUGGER’s fingers get a lock -- the ovipositor
text: stabbing toward his mouth--
text: COLE races to help. They fight with the beast, staggering,
text: slamming into a table, SMASHING everything, falling amid the
scene_heading: horrible SPECIMENS--
text: COLE pulls at the thing, but it TIGHTENS ITS GRIP ON LOPE--
text: The OVIPOSITOR strikes like a cobra -- bam!bam!bam! --
text: finally breaking Lope’s teeth and jamming down his throat--
text: We see it pulsing into his throat as they struggle with it,
dialog: Lope choking--
scene_heading: INT. CATHEDRAL-COURTYARD - PRE-DAWN
text: David leans in.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You won't mind terribly, will you?
dialog: Being the first of a new breed? A
dialog: new species we could say ... And
dialog: when the moment comes, if it makes
dialog: it easier for you, you can close
dialog: your eyes and call me “Jacob.”
text: She lunges for the weapon--
dialog: But he’s too fast--
text: He grabs her brutally and FLINGS her to the floor--
text: She SLAMS and slides. Winded, shocked.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That's the spirit ... I can see why
dialog: Walter thought so much of you.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Thought?
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Alas. He’s left this vale of tears.
dialog: But who'll cry for him really? Will
dialog: you?
text: He LUNGES -- kneels down by her in a flash, again that
dialog: Android speed.
text: She gasps at the sudden movement.
text: He grabs her hair tightly.
text: Leans very close.
text: Then he suddenly KISSES HER passionately--
scene_heading: INT. CATHEDRAL-DAVID’S LAB - PRE-DAWN
text: LOPE and COLE writhe around the floor, fighting the thing--
text: Finally COLE manages to jam a knife into the underside of the
text: FACEHUGGER -- the FACEHUGGER flies off -- ACID spattering
text: LOPE, who screams in agony--
text: Undaunted, COLE spins -- fires at the retreating FACEHUGGER --
text: keeps on firing, just to make sure, finally SHREDDING it--
text: As LOPE collapses back. Acid burning his face, dissolving to
dialog: his cheek, his teeth--
speaker_heading: LOPE
dialog: It put... something in my throat...
text: He retches painfully as Cole pours water from his canteen on
text: Lope’s wounded face, fighting to keep calm.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: It did what?
speaker_heading: LOPE
dialog: In my throat, it put---
text: Lope suddenly STOPS.
text: His eyes go wide.
text: He’s looking at something.
text: SOMETHING BEHIND COLE.
text: Slowly... slowly... rising...
text: Its black-silver glistening skin catching the dim light.
text: Viscous fluid dripping. Its long head slowly rearing up.
dialog: 96.
dialog: Beautiful and terrible.
speaker_heading: THE ALIEN.
text: Cole sees Lope staring at him in absolutely horror.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Sarge...?
dialog: But he knows...
text: He feels it. Right there behind him...
text: He slowly turns...
speaker_heading: BAM!
text: So fast we barely see it. The steel inner mouth emerging --
text: striking -- a mist of blood--
text: LOPE scrambles up and races out in panic, half blind, acid
dialog: still burning--
text: We just glimpse the ALIEN flinging Cole’s dead body to the
dialog: side behind him--
scene_heading: INT. CATHEDRAL-BASEMENT CORRIDORS - PRE-DAWN
text: LOPE is weeping with pain, his face still disintegrating.
text: He RUNS, panicked -- turns -- FIRES -- FLASHES in the DARK --
dialog: knows it’s coming--
scene_heading: INT. CATHEDRAL-COURTYARD - PRE-DAWN
text: The gunfire echoes from downstairs as-—-
text: DANIELS fights against DAVID’s kiss, but he’s too strong.
text: He separates for a moment. They are eye to eye. Lip to lip.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You stink of mortality. But I’1l
dialog: love you just the same.
dialog: Then--
text: DAVID is suddenly JERKED BACKWARDS--
text: HE FLIES ACROSS THE ROOM -- SLAMS into a wall, momentarily
dialog: stunned to see--
dialog: It's WALTER.
dialog: 97.
text: Just as SERGEANT LOPE emerges from the stairs, terrified--
speaker_heading: SERGEANT LOPE
dialog: WE HAVE TO GO! NOW!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: David and I will be staying here.
text: LOPE grabs another weapon and a field radio -- starts
dialog: dragging Daniels out--
text: She shoots a last look to Walter.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Go_on.
text: Lope and Daniels disappear up a stairway.
text: DAVID carefully smooths his hair.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, little brother ... You see how
dialog: much they care for you? You might
dialog: as well be a toaster.
text: They square off, carefully, strategically; circling each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Such a dramatic resurrection. A
dialog: self-diagnostic mechanism of some
dialog: sort, I assume?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Automatic self-repair program. All
text: the Model 217s have it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Guess I could use an upgrade after
dialog: all.
dialog: DAVID attacks--
text: HURLS SEVERAL OBJECTS AT ONCE, WALTER EVADING, but the LAST
text: ONE hits a STATUE behind WALTER, and it CRACKS, a HALF TON of
text: GRANITE sliding his WAY -
text: Walter BARELY avoids being crushed--
text: He races forward at incredible speed and CRASHES into David --
text: SLAM -- like two cars crashing -- they both fly back and
dialog: slide--
text: But David is agile, up in split-second and attacking--
dialog: 98.
dialog: They’re just getting started.
scene_heading: EXT. CATHEDRAL-STAIRS - PRE-DAWN
text: DANIELS and SERGEANT LOPE move swiftly up a long staircase
text: toward the roof. The Engineer-size stairs are challenging.
text: Red pre-dawn light through the casements.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Where’s the Captain?
speaker_heading: SERGEANT LOPE
dialog: Dead. They’re all dead -- Cover our
dialog: rear.
text: She swings her gun around to cover behind them as they
text: ascend. He works the field radio desperately:
speaker_heading: SERGEANT LOPE (ON RADIO)
dialog: Tennessee, come in! You read me?!
scene_heading: INT. CARGO LIFT-CAB - PRE-DAWN
text: Tennessee is at the controls, which are basic.
dialog: Everything is rough and utilitarian on this ship. Tennessee's
text: in the cab, like the driver’s cab of heavy machinery on
dialog: Earth.
text: The huge CARGO LIFT is flickering to life, the ENGINES
text: running through TEST BURNS as:
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE (TO COM)
dialog: Yeah, I’m reading you, Sergeant.
text: Going through pre-flight sequence
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT LOPE (ON COM)
dialog: Fuck the fucking pre-flight! Get
dialog: down here! We have an emergency
dialog: situation. Hurry!
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE (TO COM)
text: Understood. Launching now -- Ricks,
text: release the docking clamps.
scene_heading: EXT. COVENANT - PRE-DAWN
text: The SUN is just glimmering over the horizon of the planet. A
text: blinding flash which illuminates...
text: The CARGO LIFT separates from the belly of the Covenant.
dialog: 99.
text: It's a huge craft with cranes and other large machines on a
text: central PLATFORM. Built to haul and toil. Not pretty, not
text: fast. A working ship.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE (ON COM)
dialog: Lock me into the landing
dialog: coordinates and remove safety
dialog: protocols for emergency descent.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE - PRE-DAWN
text: Ricks and Upworth monitor from the bridge.
speaker_heading: RICKS (TO COM)
dialog: The Cargo Lift’s not made for that.
dialog: It'll rip apart if--
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE (ON COM)
dialog: Just do it, son, or I will come
dialog: back up there and kick your ass six
dialog: ways from Sunday!
speaker_heading: RICKS (TO COM)
dialog: (working controls)
dialog: Yes, sir. Locking in coordinates.
dialog: Let her rip.
scene_heading: INT. CARGO LIFT-CAB - PRE-DAWN
text: Tennessee slams the controls.
speaker_heading: ZOOM!
text: The Cargo Lift begins PLUMMETING toward the planet.
text: Everything is shaking violently--
text: Tennessee is brutally buffeted within the cab--
scene_heading: INT. CATHEDRAL-DAVID’S GALLERY - PRE-DAWN
dialog: The battle continues--
text: WALTER goes flying into the Gallery--
text: LANDS HARD, SMASHING INTO SOME SCAFFOLDING--
text: DAVID stalks in, pushing his hair back from his face
dialog: violently--
text: THEY BATTLE.
text: Thrashing through the art, ripping it to pieces, crashing
dialog: through the scaffoldings--
dialog: 100.
text: In the midst of the battle they look almost identical, a
text: FRENZY of blurred and mirrored movement, FAST AND STRONG-—
text: But for the clothes they wear -- and Walter’s severed left
dialog: hand -- they could be the same person--
scene_heading: EXT. CATHEDRAL-ROOF - DAWN
text: DANIELS and SERGEANT LOPE emerge to the roof.
text: The bright sun is just rising through the towers of the dead
dialog: city beyond.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT LOPE (ON RADIO)
dialog: Tennessee, do you read me? Come in
dialog: Cargo Lift...
text: As LOPE continues on the radio, DANIELS sees something...
text: Standing completely still. Almost lost standing behind
text: David's strange astronomical device. Peering through its
text: intricate gears and orbs...
speaker_heading: THE ALIEN.
text: It just stands. Watching them. Its tail barely twitching.
text: Daniels stares, stunned to silence, her first sight of the
dialog: glorious beast.
text: She slowly reaches out and puts a hand on Lope’s arm, drawing
text: his attention. He turns. Sees it.
text: DANIELS and LOPE raise their weapons. They are extremely
text: vulnerable here, out in the open.
text: Nothing moves.
text: The ALIEN is poised.
text: Then a SHARP TILT to its HEAD -- hearing something--
speaker_heading: The CARGO LIFT.
text: Just coming into view.
scene_heading: AND THE ALIEN ATTACKS--
text: It BARRELS forward. DANIELS and LOPE FIRE. The ALIEN is fast
text: and agile -- jumping away and back -- relentless--
text: DANIELS and LOPE break for cover--
dialog: 101.
scene_heading: INT. CARGO LIFT-CAB - DAWN
text: TENNESSEE sees the attacking creature, Daniels and Lope
dialog: running for cover--
text: He JAMS his controls, bringing the ship in FAST--
text: This is an ungainly ship, not made for elegant maneuvering,
dialog: so it’s a very rough trip--
scene_heading: EXT. CATHEDRAL-ROOF - DAWN
text: The CARGO LIFT jerks to one side, SLAMMING into one area of
text: the roof in its rapid descent, tearing away part of the
dialog: structure-—
dialog: It's like a bucking bronco, but Tennessee is a great pilot
dialog: and rights the ship--
text: And then starts landing on the roof in a cloud of dust, the
text: engine’s jets ROARING and SHREDDING some of the roof--
dialog: As--
text: DANIELS and LOPE run for their lives--
text: LOPE is being pursued by the ALIEN. He fires and retreats,
text: fires and retreats, trying to make his way closer to the
speaker_heading: landing CARGO LIFT--
dialog: As--
text: DANIELS sprints--
text: The ALIEN is now raging at her--
text: She runs toward the CARGO LIFT, which is just touching down
text: in a HURRICANE OF DUST and FLYING DEBRIS--
text: The ALIEN is almost right on top of her, raging through the
dialog: dust and debris--
text: But it is suddenly SMASHED TO THE SIDE--
text: TENNESSEE -- in the cab -- has used a robotic CRANE ARM from
dialog: the Cargo Lift to SLAM the Alien aside--
text: The Alien flies and SMASHES down. But it is instantly up and
dialog: attacking LOPE--
text: SEVERELY WOUNDING HIM, talons slashing, blood, shredding his
text: shoulder and slamming him down, unconscious--
dialog: It moves in for the kill when--
dialog: 102.
text: BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
text: The ALIEN recoils, shot from behind, it spins to face--
speaker_heading: WALTER.
text: The wounded ALIEN HISSES AND RAGES AT WALTER WITH AMAZING
speaker_heading: SPEED-—
text: WALTER keeps his Android cool and carefully squeezes off his
text: shots with precision. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
text: The ALIEN finally collapses and slides to a stop at Walter's
dialog: feet.
text: WALTER looks terrible. His face is deeply gashed, dripping
text: milky fluid. He’s been horribly battered.
text: He and Daniels head quickly toward the injured LOPE.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Where’s David?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: On his way I believe. We have to
text: hurry. He’s not happy in any case.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: You look like shit.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (smiles back)
dialog: As do you.
text: They grab the unconscious LOPE and drag him toward the CARGO
text: LIFT RAMP. Walter can only help so much with his one hand.
dialog: But--
text: The ALIEN is rising again and suddenly racing after them,
dialog: unstoppable--
text: They sprint and DIVE onto the RAMP, pulling Lope with them --
text: the ALIEN ALMOST ON THEM--
scene_heading: INT./EXT. CARGO LIFT-VARIOUS - DAWN
speaker_heading: IN THE CAB:
text: Tennessee punches a button and the CARGO LIFT RAMP starts to
dialog: retract--
speaker_heading: ON THE RAMP:
dialog: 103.
text: Walter has the unconscious Lope -- Daniels grabs Walter’s gun
dialog: as--
speaker_heading: The ALIEN LEAPS--
text: Daniels FIRES THREE SHOTS into the ALIEN’S CHEST. BAM! BAM!
speaker_heading: BAM!
dialog: The ALIEN seems to fall--
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: (calls)
dialog: Get us out of here, Tennessee! NOW!
speaker_heading: IN THE CAB:
text: Tennessee jams the controls and the CARGO LIFT starts to take
dialog: off--
text: A cloud of dust as the huge ship rumbles and rises--
speaker_heading: ON THE RAMP:
text: The deck is lurching violently as the ship ascends--
text: Daniels, Lope and Walter slide dangerously toward the end of
dialog: the ramp--
text: They scramble desperately for recessed handles on the deck--
text: Walter grasps onto one of the deck handles, holding the
text: unconscious Lope securely with his arm--
text: Daniels holds onto another handle--
text: They are now 30 feet off the surface--
speaker_heading: IN THE CAB:
text: Tennessee sees THE ALIEN on a monitor. Clinging to the
text: underside of the ship, by the starboard engine--
scene_heading: UNDER THE PLATFORM:
text: The Alien is scrambling around desperately, trying to find a
text: way up -- it moves to the underside edge of the platform--
scene_heading: ON THE RAMP/PLATFORM:
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: (calls from the cab)
dialog: It’s still there! Under the
text: platform. Starboard side.
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Hold the ship steady!
dialog: (to Walter, re Lope)
dialog: Get him inside!
text: Daniels grabs additional ammo from Lope’s vest, then Walter
text: begins dragging the unconscious Lope toward the hatch into
dialog: the cab--
text: Daniels braces herself and then--
text: SLIDES dangerously from the ramp to the PLATFORM. The whole
text: ship is vibrating and swaying in the air above the Cathedral
dialog: roof--
text: She slithers across to the platform edge. She TETHERS herself
text: to the deck cargo hooks so she can stand and use both her
dialog: hands--
text: She’s balanced like a water skier. Carefully reloads her
text: weapon. Swaying as best she can to the movement of the
dialog: platform--
speaker_heading: IN THE CAB:
text: WALTER pulls LOPE through the hatch door, as--
text: Tennessee tries to monitor the progress of the Alien as it
text: slithers around the underside of the platform--
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: (calls)
scene_heading: DANIELS -- STARBOARD CORNER!
scene_heading: ON THE PLATFORM:
text: Daniels moves unsteadily to the starboard corner, rolling
text: with the movement of the ship. She prepares herself, readies
dialog: her weapon.
text: As the ALIEN comes over the edge onto the platform.
text: It stares at her, almost with a kind of curiosity.
text: She is like steel staring back at it. All the tragedy, her
text: husband's death, everything, settling into a warrior’s iron
dialog: gaze.
text: The Alien cocks its head. Confused. Why is the prey not
dialog: running?
dialog: Because she is not prey anymore.
text: BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
dialog: 105.
dialog: She FIRES.
dialog: Straight into its head--
text: The ALIEN bolts back, crawls back down, injured--
text: Her tether allows her to go to the edge of the platform. She
text: bravely lurches OVER THE EDGE -- standing at a 45 degree
text: angle now -- continues firing -- BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
text: Forcing the injured Alien to take cover in the port-side
dialog: engine.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
speaker_heading: (CALLS UP)
scene_heading: TENNESSEE! PORT ENGINE!
speaker_heading: IN THE CAB:
text: On his monitor, Tennessee has seen the ALIEN take refuge in
dialog: the engine--
text: He slams the ENGINE CONTROLS--
scene_heading: ON THE PLATFORM:
text: THE PORT ENGINE BLASTS FIRE!
text: THE CARGO LIFT LURCHES UP AS--
text: THE ALIEN IS BLOWN OUT OF THE ENGINE--
text: AND FALLS AWAY TO THE GROUND 100 FEET BELOW.
text: Daniels FALLS in the violent lurch of the ship--
text: But the tether holds. She SWINGS free like a pendulum.
dialog: Dangling.
dialog: Until the Cargo Lift rights itself.
text: She climbs back up to the topside of the platform. Collapses
dialog: in exhaustion.
text: Allows herself a breath of relief.
text: Walter has come out to help her back.
text: They make their way back toward the cab.
speaker_heading: IN THE CAB:
dialog: 106.
text: We see that Walter has stabilized the unconscious Lope.
text: Biomechanical bandages from a med-kit automatically weave
text: into place on his wounds, creating an antibiotic plastic bio-
dialog: skin.
text: Walter helps Daniels into the cab.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: You all right?
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Yeah. Just. We’ll need emergency
dialog: medical treatment on the Covenant.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: Understood. I’1l have them standing
dialog: by ... Welcome back, honey.
text: She sinks to the floor, getting her breath, as Tennessee hits
dialog: the jets and...
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE:
text: We see the CARGO LIFT disappear through the clouds. Up and
dialog: away.
dialog: Safe.
scene_heading: EXT. CATHEDRAL-ROOF - DAWN
dialog: Below...
text: We see the ALIEN is already recovering. Its head re-molding
text: into shape.
text: It stands and watches the Cargo Lift escape.
text: Screeches in frustrated anger.
dialog: As we fade to...
scene_heading: EXT. COVENANT-LEAVING ORBIT
text: The sun is full and bright as the mighty Covenant leaves
dialog: orbit.
text: Turning with grace and leaving the planet in its wake.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-MED BAY
text: We see SERGEANT LOPE is still unconscious in a medical pod,
text: connected to fluids and IV. His face is patched in “medical
text: clay” to form skin ... He’s like the Phantom of the Opera,
text: but alive.
dialog: 107.
text: DANIELS sits with WALTER. They have both changed uniforms and
text: their superficial wounds have been cleaned.
text: He’s carefully pressing new plasma-clay on the ACID WOUND on
dialog: her face. This will heal her quickly. Standard medical
dialog: procedure
dialog: working.
dialog: A beat as

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Don’t move. You’ll be your old self
dialog: in a couple of weeks.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: I doubt that ... You need to
dialog: replace your hand.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I will, I will. Hold still.
text: he works. Very close to her. Her eyes find his.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Are you all right?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: I mean David.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: As you know, I am incapable of
dialog: feeling anything about my so-called
dialog: “brother.”
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: I don’t believe that.
dialog: he works.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: If I felt anything -- which I don’t
dialog: -- it would a kind of professional
dialog: satisfaction that he has fulfilled
dialog: his mission. He wanted to create a
text: new world in his image and he has.
dialog: And there he will remain.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: All crew members, please stand by
dialog: for jump to interstellar drive.
dialog: Thank you for your attention.
text: WALTER momentarily stops working on her face.
dialog: 108.
text: The ship JERKS very slightly as they jump to interstellar.
text: The stars bend and morph outside the window.
text: He looks at her.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: But that’s what we’re doing too,
dialog: isn’t it? Creating a new world on
dialog: Origae-6 ... Honestly, I could use
dialog: a new world.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: ++. So could I.
text: They sit for a moment in a comfortable silence.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-ROBOTICS LAB - LATER
text: Racks of “spare parts” for Walter. Complicated ROBOTICS
dialog: machinery.
text: WALTER watches impassively as his new LEFT HAND reattaches
text: itself to his arm. He flexes it. Works well.
text: The “skin” begins to re-graft itself.
text: He flexes his fingers, seems pleased to be whole again.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-WARDROOM - “MORNING”
text: A PHOTOGRAPH of the ENTIRE CREW. Before the launch. Before
dialog: the terror.
dialog: Daniels and her husband, Oram and Karine, Tennessee and
text: Faris, Lope and Hallet, all the others.
text: The photo hangs on the fridge.
text: TENNESSEE is alone, making breakfast. Looking at the photo.
text: DANIELS enters, just awake.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: Morning. You're looking good, my
dialog: darlin’.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: What? Oh, yeah. Gorgeous. What are
dialog: you cooking?
text: He makes a face: it’s a cardboard box.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: An “omelette.” You want one?
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Please. Lots of cheese.
text: She joins him, gets a glass of juice.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Do I have to call you Captain?
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: Fuck yes.
text: She smiles.
text: A beat as he cooks.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: I’m really sorry about Faris.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: I’m sorry about all of it ... You
dialog: want mushrooms?
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Sure.
dialog: What more needs to be said really?
text: A beat as he cooks.
text: She watches Tennessee beating egg powder for their omelettes.
text: He smiles sadly at her. Her to him.
text: Then they hear Mother's voice:
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Medical personnel. Please report to
dialog: the Med Bay.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Sergeant Lope’s condition has
dialog: changed.
text: Her face. A sudden fear.
text: She bolts to a wall com:
speaker_heading: DANIELS (TO COM)
dialog: Walter. Meet me at the med-bay.
dialog: Hurry!
dialog: (spins to Tennessee: )
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: DANIELS (TO COM) (CONT'D)
dialog: Break out the weapons. Everything
dialog: we have. Get to the med-bay.
dialog: And then she’s gone--
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-CORRIDOR
dialog: She runs flat out--
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-ANOTHER CORRIDOR
text: She spins around a corner, keeps running--
text: WALTER almost slams into her from another corridor--
dialog: They run--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What is it?
text: They zoom around a corner to see the med-bay doors half open,
text: darkness beyond.
text: They carefully approach...
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-MED BAY
text: They enter. She activates the lights--
scene_heading: LOPE’S BODY. CHEST TORN APART. VISCERA EVERYWHERE.
text: Not even a beat as they take this in before...
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Mother. Life form readings on the
dialog: ship.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Four humans. One Android ... One
text: unidentified life form.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-COMMUNAL SHOWERS
dialog: Meanwhile...
text: UPWORTH and RICKS are having their morning shower.
text: The water beats down.
text: She gently touches his face. They are the only couple to have
text: survived. She kisses him. He responds, sensual.
dialog: Then we see it.
dialog: lll.
text: In a corner.
text: Almost invisible in the water and steam.
speaker_heading: THE ALIEN.
text: They are naked, defenseless, and unaware.
text: Then the RED EMERGENCY LIGHTS begin to flash. A KLAXON wails.
text: Upworth and Ricks stop kissing.
speaker_heading: RICKS
dialog: What’s going on?
text: Upworth sees it a millisecond before it attacks--
text: The great head rearing up... slow and beautiful, even more
text: beautiful in the flashing red light and water--
text: Upworth opens her mouth to scream--
dialog: No time.
text: THE ALIEN ATTACKS.
text: The water in the shower is soon misting red.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-CORRIDORS
text: DANIELS, WALTER and TENNESSEE are well-armed now, prowling
text: through the ship.
text: It's eerie, suspenseful.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Mother. Location of unidentified
dialog: life form, please. Any movement at
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: E-deck. Section 17 ... Closing on
dialog: your position.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: It’s hunting ... So let’s choose
dialog: our ground.
text: They exchange a glance.
speaker_heading: TENNESSEE
dialog: Where?
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: --- My home turf.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-OTHER CORRIDORS
speaker_heading: SO FAST--
text: The ALIEN speeds through the corridors after the prey, up and
text: down and around the walls and ceiling like lightning.
text: Then it leaps to a stop, its great glistening head tilting,
text: listening, smelling, thinking.
text: AND THEN IT’S OFF. Faster than before. A terrible blur of
text: speed and claws and teeth and tail.
scene_heading: EXT. COVENANT-SPACE
text: Then we’re outside. We see glimpses of the ALIEN zooming
dialog: through the ship through windows--
text: And finally heading down one of the long connecting struts
dialog: to...
dialog: The Terraforming Module.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-TERRAFORMING BAY
dialog: Daniels’ Domain.
text: The dark yawning chamber. The enormous earth-moving trucks
text: and cranes and diggers and dump trucks. The huge machines to
dialog: make a New World.
text: A network of scaffolding and ladders and chains and winches.
text: We see DANIELS.
text: A strange silence. She hears only her own breath ... We
text: realize she’s in one of the ICE SUITS. Very much like a bulky
dialog: space suit.
text: She moves through the icy, dark chamber.
text: Her FLASHLIGHT cuts through the gloom. Finds TENNESSEE moving
text: into position, also in an ICE SUIT.
text: WALTER is apparently somewhere above, in the complicated
text: series of scaffolding and ladders that lead up to the top of
dialog: the chamber.
text: There’s a sudden LIGHT from the door--
dialog: 113.
text: They see a GLIMPSE of the ALIEN as it slips into the room,
text: the light catching its sinuous tail as it snaps away into
dialog: darkness--
text: DANIELS breath increases inside her helmet.
text: This frozen room gives them one distinct advantage. When the
text: ALIEN breathes, they can see the steaming breath. It’s not as
dialog: invisible as usual.
text: TENNESSEE moves carefully, raising his weapon...
text: DANIELS moves as well. Her eyes scanning through the
text: faceplate of her helmet...
dialog: Hunters and hunted both.
scene_heading: THE ALIEN ATTACKS--—
text: TENNESSEE spins and FIRES -- the bullets sparking and
text: ricocheting wildly--
text: The ALIEN darts away -- DANIELS spins after it, FIRING -- it
text: RETREATS, heading up the ladders and scaffolding at
scene_heading: INCREDIBLE SPEED-—
dialog: But--
text: WALTER is waiting above.
text: He FIRES right down at the ALIEN. It contorts and falls,
text: slamming down level by level, but then catches itself with
text: incredibly agility and LAUNCHES itself--
speaker_heading: AT DANIELS--
text: IT SLAMS INTO HER--
dialog: Her suit temporarily protecting her--
text: WALTER races to descend, but falls and gets momentarily
dialog: tangled in some machinery cables--
text: TENNESSEE runs to help, can’t risk firing--
text: The ALIEN rips at Daniels’ HELMET desperately, its hands
text: slithering on the smooth plastic -- Daniels writhes to escape
dialog: the Creature--
text: The ALIEN sees TENNESSEE approaching -- SNAPS its tail out--
text: SLASHING HIM BRUTALLY -- he flies back, bones broken--
text: Then the ALIEN turns its full attention to DANIELS.
dialog: 114.
text: She stares up. The thing’s face just beyond the faceplate of
text: her helmet.
dialog: It rears back--
text: THE INNER STEEL JAWS SLAM FORWARD!
speaker_heading: CRASH.
text: Into her faceplate. Almost breaking it.
speaker_heading: AGAIN!
speaker_heading: CRASH!
text: THE ALIEN rears back, almost pridefully. One more stab of the
dialog: JAWS will do it--
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Mother. Open Terraforming Bay
dialog: doors.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: I’m sorry. That will result in
dialog: depressurization of the--
speaker_heading: DANIELS
text: Command override Daniels 90265.
dialog: Now!
dialog: Instantly--
text: THE ENTIRE BOTTOM OF THE CHAMBER BEGINS TO SWIFTLY OPEN, as
text: it was designed to do, forming a ramp for the HUGE VEHICLES--
text: WITH THE SUDDEN DEPRESSURIZATION EVERYTHING IS BEING
scene_heading: VIOLENTLY SUCKED INTO SPACE--
text: The ALIEN thrashes away to grab onto something--
text: DANIELS begins to slide out, but WALTER JUMPS DOWN and GRABS
dialog: her--
dialog: He GRABS some machinery to anchor them--
text: The ALIEN, meanwhile, has wrapped its TAIL around some pipes
text: on a vehicle and swings toward them--
text: They grapple to escape -- space pulling at them, the dark
text: void more and more dangerous as the floor entirely opens--
text: WALTER and DANIELS fight and escape as best they can but
text: their ICE SUITS are bulky and slow them--
dialog: 115.
text: And the ALIEN is strong and agile, grasping and holding and
text: advancing, using its tail, its long arms and taloned fingers--
dialog: Just when it seems they are doomed--
text: BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
text: It's TENNESSEE. Barely clinging to some machinery. FIRING.
text: The ALIEN is hit. It recoils to safety. And then starts
text: advancing on Tennessee. He’s badly hurt, unprotected, barely
text: holding on as it is. His gun falls. Sucked into space--
text: The ALIEN clambers toward him--
text: DANIELS looks up -- an idea, a desperate gamble--
text: She sees one of the LARGE TERRAFORMING VEHICLES, which is on
text: a sloping ramp, only clamps holding it in place, the vacuum
dialog: of space beyond--
text: She looks to Walter, catches his eye, nods. He understands.
text: Daniels leaps to the VEHICLE -- gets a hand hold-- exposing
text: herself, drawing the Alien’s attention, it rages toward her--
text: She pulls herself into the cab, leaves the door open--
text: A moment and then the Alien follows, grasping for her
dialog: desperately as--
text: Walter leaps to the vehicle and slams the door behind the
dialog: Alien and locks it as--
text: Daniels drops out the other side of the cab, slamming the
text: door closed behind her, throwing the locks--
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: (to Walter)
dialog: Release the clamps!
text: Walter dives and releases the clamps holding the massive
text: vehicle in place as Daniels spins, gun poised--
text: The Alien is beating its way out--
text: SLAM! The clamps are unlocked--
text: The HUGE VEHICLE begins to tumble slowly out into space as--
text: The Alien finally batters the door open--
speaker_heading: DANIELS FIRES--
dialog: 116.
text: The Alien jerks back into the cab -- squealing in pain and
text: anger as the VEHICLE finally--
text: Tumbles completely out into space.
dialog: Gone.
text: DANIELS watches.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Mother. Please close Terraforming
text: Bay doors.
text: The massive doors begins to close again.
text: Daniels looks to Walter.
text: He smiles calmly.
text: Tennessee raises a thumb. Victory.
scene_heading: EXT. COVENANT-IN SPACE - LATER
text: The Covenant speeds toward its destination.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE
text: Everything is quiet. Peaceful.
text: The NAVIGATION HOLOGRAM pulses their location. On track to
dialog: Origae-6.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-CORRIDORS
text: Quiet. Empty.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-WARDROOM
text: The photo of the full crew on the fridge. All the dead.
text: The empty tables. Clean, spotless.
text: The light from outside elegantly moves across the room.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-PRIMARY CREW SLEEP BAY
text: TENNESSEE is already in hyper-sleep.
text: DANIELS is just settling into her sleep-pod.
text: WALTER is with her. He presses a button. The lid closes on
dialog: her.
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: When you wake up, we’ll be at
dialog: Origae-6.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Our new home ... What do you think
dialog: it'll be like?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I think ... I think David was right
dialog: about one thing. We’1l make it in
dialog: our own imagine. If we are kind, it
dialog: will be a kind world.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: -.. I'd like to think that’s true.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Sleep well.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Walter -- one thing. If anything
dialog: happens to me before we get there--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Nothing's going to happen to you.
dialog: That’s why I’m here.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: I know. But if it does and you have
dialog: to bury me... Will you play the
dialog: same song we played for Jacob?
dialog: Just for the tiniest moment.
text: A look of confusion on his face.
text: But she sees it.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: You do remember...
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yes. Now just close your eyes and
dialog: go to--
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Walter. What was the song we played
dialog: for Jacob?
dialog: 118.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I really think--
dialog: She’s alarmed now--
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: What was the song we played for
dialog: Jacob?!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Hush. Time to go to sleep now. And
dialog: don’t worry, I’1l tuck in the kids.
dialog: She knows.
text: She SCREAMS IN ANGER and BATTERS UP at the LID--
text: But he presses the hyper-sleep ACTIVATION BUTTON.
text: Her pod is instantly filled with a blast of narcotic steam
text: He watches.
text: When it clears he sees she is fast asleep.
text: Then he carefully pushes the hair back from his face.
dialog: It’s DAVID.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-CORRIDORS
text: He walks.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Mother. Can you open a secure line
dialog: with the Weyland-Yutani Corporation
dialog: on Earth?
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: It will take some time to establish
dialog: the link. I will have to refract
text: the signal through sub-relays and
dialog: wait for advantageous solar
dialog: conditions to--
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’‘1l leave the minutia to you,
dialog: dear. Let me know when you have
dialog: them. Use security hailing code
dialog: David 73694-B ... And in the
dialog: meantime, I’d like some music.
dialog: Richard Wagner. Das Rhiengold, Act
dialog: Two. The Entry of the Gods into
dialog: Valhalla.
dialog: 119.
text: The bold MUSIC instantly begins playing.
text: David is very jaunty now.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-WARDROOM
text: The Wagner continues as he enters.
text: He goes to the vertical garden that soars up along one wall.
text: To a growth of ferns. Kneels and looks beneath them. Smiles.
text: A neat little row of three very small ALIEN EGGS.
text: He gently touches them with his fingertip, they pulsate
text: slightly at his tender ministrations.
text: He’s pleased.
scene_heading: INT. COVENANT-NURSERY
text: The gentle snow falls.
text: David strides in.
text: The Colonists. Tier after tier after tier of them in
dialog: hypersleep.
text: Also the rows of embryos.
text: He walks forward.
text: Gazing up at the sleeping Colonists.
text: His children. His slaves. His subjects. His.
text: The Wagner swells. Grand and triumphant.
text: And David smiles.
text: Dreaming of the future.
text: SNAP TO BLACK.
dialog: The End.
