scene_heading: 3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07
text: A dark room in a small ranch house.
text: A desert wind blows in gusts.
text: WILLIAM EVANS (14), lies awake. Not a boy and not a man,
text: there’s a restlessness in his eyes. He lights a match,
text: watching it blow out in his fingers.
text: His brother, MARK (7), lies beside him, his breathing
text: labored, asthmatic. A medicine bottle and spoon sit on the
text: table beside a folded tearsheet for the ‘Colt Peacemaker’
text: William stares at the engraving of a gunslinger, brandishing
text: the fancy weapon, a smile of confidence on his face.
text: Suddenly William turns, alert. There is a faint sound.
text: ...a gate creak... a latch clink.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: IN ANOTHER DARK ROOM-- CONTINUOUS--
text: ALICE EVANS, 32, beautiful but care-worn, opens her eyes.
text: Groggy, she reaches reflexively for--
text: DAN EVANS, 36, her husband. But he isn’t against the pillow
text: where her hand expects him. He is upright on the edge of the
text: bed, tense, sweaty, eyes on a window as he LOADS HIS PISTOL.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Dan...
text: He signals silence. Alice holds her breath, listening to the
text: air... nothing... The clock on the dresser reads 3:45...
speaker_heading: ALICE (CONT'D)
dialog: ...-Maybe it’s the wind...
text: Dan shakes his head. He glances to WILLIAM, who arrives in
text: the bedroom door, in his longjohns, holding AN OLD RIFLE.
text: The snort of a horse outside. Men whisper. Hooves.
text: DAN BOLTS FROM THE BED, crossing to the window on one leg,
text: using the beamed roof for support. He pushes back the drape
text: with his pistol.
text: A HORSEMAN ENCIRCLES THE BARN OF THIS HOMESTEAD, UNHOOKING A
text: CORRAL, LETTING LOOSE A HERD OF CATTLE.
dialog: Then Dan notices--
text: ANOTHER HORSEMAN at the corner of the barn, LIGHTING A FIRE.

scene_heading: EXT. EVANS RANCH-- CONTINUOUS
text: Wearing longjohns and boots, DAN BUSTS OUT THE DOOR, moving
text: toward the man fanning fire at the barn--
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: No-- Please-- stop!--
text: A RIFLE BUTT SMASHES DAN’S HEAD. He tumbles off the porch to
text: the dirt, losing his gun, one boot coming off, revealing--
text: A MISSING LEFT FOOT.
text: William runs past Alice and Mark on the porch and his father
dialog: on the ground as--
text: THE BARN EXPLODES IN FLAMES. Dan jerks back on his rigged
text: boot, gets upright and lunges toward the barn.
text: THE FIRST HORSEMAN, bears down on him.
speaker_heading: HORSEMAN (TUCKER)
dialog: -- You have a week, Evans. Then we
dialog: burn the house.
text: THE HORSEMEN RIDE AWAY AS WILLIAM ENTERS THE FLAMING BARN.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: William!
scene_heading: INT./EXT. BARN-- CONTINUOUS--
text: FLAMES LICK THE RAFTERS. SMOKE.
text: FOUR HORSES tied in stalls, crazy with fear.
text: William frees two of them, Dan untangles the others and leads
text: them out, grabbing equipment, tossing saddles out the door...
text: Then Dan notices WILLIAM HAS TURNED BACK INSIDE.
text: William struggles to drag A HUGE SACK OF FEED and some tools--
text: We see above him, the burning roof sags, flaming pieces of
text: wood raining-- it’s about to collapse--
text: DAN LEAPS AND GRABS HIS BOY and drags him toward the door,
text: fists swinging.

speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: --Let go! It’s the last we got!
text: They fall to the ground as THE BARN COLLAPSES in a fiery
text: mass, sparks showering down. Alice and Mark run toward them.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: ..-You alright?
text: Will turns from his father to see- THE TWO HORSEMEN riding
text: away. Dawn light beginning to touch the sky.
text: WILLIAM LUNGES FOR THE REMINGTON on the ground--
text: --but Dan is faster and puts his hand on the weapon.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ll take care of this.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: No you won’t. ...You don’t take
dialog: care of nothing.
text: Tears stand in William’s eyes.
text: Dan takes the gun and starts walking back toward the house.
text: He passes Alice and Mark, avoiding their eyes.
speaker_heading: DAN
text: The herd is over the ridge by now.
dialog: Get cleaned up.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. FOLLOWING DAN -- EVANS RANCH -- DAYBREAK
text: Dan yanks open a drawer and grabs a shirt. His arms and chest
text: streaked in SOOT... Out the bedroom window the sun is
text: creeping over the rocky horizon.
text: His eyes fall upon a beautiful ANTIQUE BROOCH in a drawer.
text: He examines it. It is gold. And he pockets it and turns,
text: finding himself looking at William, watching him.
text: William turns away, and crosses to his bedroom.
text: Dan moves to a basin at the back of the house.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: You lied to me, Dan.
text: Dan turns to face Alice.
speaker_heading: ALICE (CONT’D)
dialog: You told me we made payments to

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We did. Some.
dialog: (off look, heading inside)
dialog: How do you think we bought feed,
dialog: Alice? Three months water. Medicine
dialog: for Mark. I had a choice between
dialog: our family and paying it down.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: We’ re supposed to make decisions
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Would you have made it different?
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Dan.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We can’t make it rain together. Or
dialog: turn dust into grass. And we can’t
dialog: hold back winter. It’s too bad the
dialog: doctors at Essex saved so much of
dialog: my leg. I read the pension act
dialog: pays by the pound now.
text: Dan leans against the wall, pulling on his boots.
text: Tears come to Alice’s eyes.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Stop looking at me like that.
text: Mark appears in the hall. Dan crosses back to his bedroom,
text: pulling on a clean shirt.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (as Dan passes)
dialog: .»..You gonna tell the Marshal what
dialog: those men did?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: (from his bedroom)
dialog: Marshal ain’t doing shit.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: William.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: First thing I’m gonna do, Mark, is
dialog: take you boys and round up the

text: CLOSE ON-- WILLIAM in his room, gettting dressed, listening
text: with jaundice as his father reassures Mark. He pockets a deck
dialog: of cards and his dime novel.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What you gonna do in town?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I’m gonna tell Hollander to make
dialog: this right. I’m gonna tell him he
dialog: needs to pay for a new barn.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Maybe we should just shoot him,
dialog: like Will says.
text: Alice meets eyes with Dan who grabs HIS SPENCER RIFLE and
text: brushes past William on his way to the door.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: ....-Let’s go. We got cattle to get.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON: BEN WADE (38)
text: --atop a magnificent BLACK MARE, staring at something. Ben
dialog: has a ruggedly handsome face, but what strikes you first is
text: his focus. He’s very still, eyes on fire, low to the horse.
text: The horse inches forward. Hooves hardly make a sound.
text: REVERSE TO REVEAL-- A RED-TAILED HAWK, perched only fifteen
text: feet away on the limb of a dead tree.
scene_heading: WE ARE: EXT. BOULDER CLUSTER, DESERT VALLEY-- CONTINUOUS
text: ANGLE ON-- WADE makes a low ‘s’ sound and his horse halts.
text: Wade sketches the bird on A SMALL LEDGER PAD with a PENCIL,
text: capturing its form with quick gestures. Suddenly: A noise.
text: The hawk FLIES OFF. Wade watches it shrink into the sky.
text: A darkness fills his eyes.
text: PULL BACK TO REVEAL: CHARLIE PRINCE (31), a pale eyed outlaw,
text: coming up behind Wade. A PAIR OF SCHOFIELDS on his legs.
text: ...he stops his horse respectfully, a few yards back.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE PRINCE (CONT'D)
text: Coach is headed for Bisbee, Boss.
text: Girded with iron. Pinks on top.
dialog: Double shotguns and a Gatlin--
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10
scene_heading: 3:10 TO YUMA - TAN - 1.23.07
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Charlie trails off as Wade rides to the tree, tears his
text: SKETCH and pins it to a BRANCH where the hawk had been
text: perched. His eyes flick to--
text: A DISTANT STAGECOACH, a speck in the valley, kicking dust.
text: Wade turns his horse and trots past Charlie...
text: Charlie Prince glances at the drawing. HOLD ON: THE SKETCH
text: FLUTTERING IN THE BREEZE as Prince follows down the hill.
speaker_heading: OMITTED
scene_heading: EXT. BOULDER CLUSTER, DESERT VALLEY - DAY
text: Charlie Prince follows as-- Ben Wade rides down past a
text: CLUSTER OF BOULDERS where his outfit awaits him:
text: JORGENSEN (45): Massive arms and legs. A bear of a man.
text: CAMPOS (38): The marksman. Loads a cradled MONSTER RIFLE.
text: KINTER (34): A soulless butcher with deadened eyes.
text: SUTHERLAND (42): An explosives expert. He supervises as--
text: TIGHE (28): his protege, loading TNT in a saddle bag.
dialog: JACKSON (35): Powerful and dangerous. A friend and former
dialog: cellmate of --
text: TOMMY DARDEN (28): Battle-scarred handsome face. A BOWIE
text: KNIFE in his hand. He is looking to replace Wade and lead the
text: gang someday, soon. But in the meantime, he amuses himself
dialog: making trouble with--
text: NEZ (32): An Apache renegade. He speaks little English and
dialog: uses it rarely. But he is a great shot, a brilliant rider and
text: a merciless fighter. He’s been with Wade since the beginning.
text: Darden taunts Nez with his long knife, oblivious to Wade’s
text: approach-- He and Jackson trade a chuckle.
text: Nez looks at Wade. And Wade looks at Darden hard.
speaker_heading: DARDEN
dialog: Ben.
text: Darden slips the knife back in the sheaf.
text: Wade turns his eyes to the road below.
text: ...and here comes the STAGECOACH, GETTING CLOSER.

text: Wade turns to Charlie and gives a nod...
text: ...and the gang surges behind Charlie Prince. As everyone
text: rides past him, Campos the marksman looks back to Wade. Wade
text: nods to a CLUSTER OF BOULDERS nearby.
text: Campos climbs off his horse and scales the rocks.
scene_heading: EXT. STAGECOACH, DESERT VALLEY - DAY
text: CLOSE ON: GALLOPING HOOVES thundering down a desert road.
text: A team of FOUR HORSES pulling an ARMORED STAGECOACH through a
text: barren stretch of land.
text: We see a fancy EYE LOGO stamped upon the door with the famous
text: Pinkerton slogan printed below: The Eye That Never Sleeps...
text: There are SIX PINKERTONS riding. Two in front, two ona
text: mounted “tailgun” platform and two inside, peering out slits.
text: THE VETERAN DRIVER pushes the horses.
text: Sitting beside him is the sixth man and the group’s leader--
text: BYRON McELROY (55). McElroy is clearly not a Pinkerton, and
text: hardly dressed or groomed like one. He’s got snake-like eyes.
text: He holds a mean-looking, twelve-gauge HAMMER SHOTGUN.
scene_heading: EXT. FOOTHILLS, DESERT VALLEY - DAY
text: Dan’s crouched next to his horse, gazing at one of his cows
text: which has collapsed upon the arid earth, gasping...
text: Dan glances up at the sky, then he pulls out the BROOCH in
text: his grimy hands.
text: Twenty feet away, William sits on his horse behind Dan,
text: shuffling HIS DECK OF CARDS.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: You gonna hock that?
text: Dan pockets it.
speaker_heading: DAN

scene_heading: CLOSE ON-- WADE, WATCHING COACH FROM HILLTOP
text: The SHOT ECHOES faintly through the foothills. Wade peers
text: around behind him. He shrugs it off, focusing back on his
dialog: outfit below.
scene_heading: EXT. STAGECOACH, DESERT VALLEY - DAY
text: McElroy stiffens as-- WADE’S GANG appears suddenly on the
text: road ahead coming straight at the coach, head on. McElroy
text: sees them and grimaces. Cocking both pins on his SHOTGUN.
speaker_heading: MCELROY
dialog: Here we go.
text: With proficiency, the other Pinkertons flip down or slide
text: across several ARMORED STEEL PLATES in front of them..
text: ...and in the next second, the outlaws and the Pinkertons
text: clash in a violent FUSILLADE OF BULLETS.
text: TWO PINKERTONS MAN THE GATLIN mounted at the rear.
text: Unfortunately it is exactly where the gang isn’t (they’re
text: coming from the front) and they have no shot.
text: The Pinkertons fire as Wade’s gang rides straight at them, a
dialog: game of chicken.
text: Bullets exploding around him, McELROY AIMS AT ONE OF THE
text: OUTLAWS RIDING IN FRONT.
text: -- BANG! -- With one shot he blows the outlaw off his horse.
text: As the gang swarms around them -- RATATATAT. PINKERTONS FIRE
text: THE GATLIN, spraying the gang, mowing down another outlaw.
text: Suddenly, one of the Pinkertons on the gatlin falls back,
text: shot by-- CAMPOS, at his sniper’s perch-- rifle smoking.
text: The remaining Pinkerton cradles the ammo and swings the big
text: brass gun at Campos, twisting the crank.

speaker_heading: OMITTED
scene_heading: EXT. STAGECOACH-- CONTINUED
text: McElroy and the Pinkertons defend the coach valiantly. Taking
text: cover behind their ARMORED PLATES as the coach rattles along
text: the road. Another Pinkerton climbs from a hatch and re-mans
text: the Gatlin. He sends a spray of bullets toward the oncoming
text: gang-- another man falls.
text: The last Pinkerton (MOONS) inside the stagecoach takes aim
text: through the gun slit. He manages to HIT JORGENSEN.
text: The big man snaps backwards, falling to the ground, while

text: CLOSE ON -- MCELROY’S EYES watching Sutherland and Tighe

speaker_heading: MCELROY
dialog: (to driver)
dialog: Get. Down. Now!
text: McElroy swings his shotgun over the driver, who ducks, and
text: aims at Tighe but then aims lower, at his saddle bag--
text: He fires and-- BOOM!-- TIGHE AND HORSE EXPLODE IN MID-STRIDE.
text: THE COACH LURCHES INTO A NARROW PASS, making it hard for the
dialog: gang to follow.
scene_heading: EXT. BOULDER CLUSTER, DESERT VALLEY - DAY
text: Wade watches, amused, his eyes on McElroy as he directs the
text: coach to make a run for a narrow pass.
text: Wade smiles. These two have history. Then, he notices-- A
text: SCRAWNY HERD OF CATTLE on the other side of an outcropping.
text: Forty cows and bulls nibbling on what little they can find.
text: A thought flickers across Wade’s mind.
text: And he abruptly wheels his horse towards the animals.

speaker_heading: MCELROY
dialog: Pull up, kid. Pull up!
text: The driver stares at the cattle, frozen. Imagine the bull run
dialog: in Pamplona, only you’re driving into it. McElroy lunges for
text: the reins pulling hard as HOOVES and HORNS collide.
text: The STAGECOACH lists to one side, you can feel the weight of
text: this iron carriage. The FRONT AXLE SNAPS. Horses break free--
text: The STAGECOACH NOSES INTO AN EMBANKMENT AND FLIPS, rolling
text: end over end like a semi on the turnpike. McElroy, the
text: driver, and injured Pinkertons catapult to the air.
text: ANGLE ON: THE OUTLAWS hounding unfortunate survivors.

speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Neither. Maybe both.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: What’s that mean?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I was a volunteer in the

speaker_heading: WADE

speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Maybe I don’t like the idea of men
dialog: like you on the loose.

speaker_heading: WADE

speaker_heading: DOC POTTER (O.S.)

speaker_heading: TUCKER

dialog: I wanna warn you fellas, tell you

text: SMACK! McElroy boots Wade savagely in the face. The outlaw
text: tumbles. And now McElroy starts to beat Wade, his vigorous
text: movements re-opening his own wounds.
text: Butterfield and Doc Potter hurry to pull McElroy back.
text: Wade notices Dan deliberately hanging back...
text: ...and a grin creases his bloody, battered face. That spurs

speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s enough, Mister McElroy.
text: McElroy stops, if only because he’s exhausted and weak...

speaker_heading: MCELROY

speaker_heading: CHARLIE PRINCE
dialog: Get you outta there in a second,
dialog: boss. Don’t you worry.

speaker_heading: CHARLIE PRINCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait.

speaker_heading: JACKSON

text: beside him, checking on his father. Dan’s wounded. The shot
dialog: clipped his skull...
text: ...no time to think, Wade and William grab Dan and begin to
text: drag him back towards the campsite. GUNSHOTS ripping through
text: the grass on all sides.
text: Wade catches glimpses of them in the brush. A flash of BATTLE
text: FEATHERS. A swish of RAWHIDE TROUSERS. A glint of a TOMAHAWK.
scene_heading: 94 EXT. CAMP #2, FIELD - NIGHT
text: The horses are freaking out. BULLETS whizzing past their ears
text: as Butterfield and Doc Potter help pull Dan into their camp.
text: Dan’s starting to regain his bearings, looking about...
text: ...the GUNFIRE is coming from three sides. They can’t see the
text: shooters through the grass. But the GUNFIRE is volcanic. Wade
text: keeps his head low, calculating.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: There’s three of them.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Yours.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: If they were mine, you’d be dead.

speaker_heading: WADE (CONT'D)
dialog: Give me a gun.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: You want them to scalp your boy.

text: Wade realizes he’s not getting any more ammo. He scoffs at
text: Dan, then cocks both barrels of the shotgun. Waiting for a
text: pause in the SHOOTING...
text: ...then he scrambles away and vanishes into the grass. The
text: others keep their eyes on the TALL GRASS. Praying. Hoping.
text: BOOM! They hear the SHOTGUN roar...
text: ...no more shooting from the left of them.
text: William dares to lift his head. Glancing around at the TALL
text: GRASS. Heart in his throat. Waiting. Watching. Lying still.
text: BOOM! Another SHOTGUN BLAST out there...
text: ...no more shooting from the right of them now.
text: Dan keeps his eyes on the RIFLE SHOTS from ahead...
text: ...and then all of a sudden, the rifle stops shooting.
text: Everyone in the camp listens now to the SOUNDS OF A STRUGGLE
text: somewhere out in the grass. Men GRAPPLING and WRESTLING with
dialog: each other...
text: ...there’s an ABRUPT GASP. The sound of METAL SLICING FLESH
text: and the fall of a body to the ground. Then there’s silence.
text: Everybody stares into the swaying TALL GRASS...
text: ...and then, a FIGURE appears. Walking towards them.
text: It’s Ben Wade. Covered in the blood of others. Looking like
text: death incarnate and furious for having been made to kill the
dialog: Apache warriors...
dialog: ...but most alarming is the fact that Wade now has one of the
text: feathered APACHE RIFLES in his MANACLED HANDS. The other two
text: are slung over his shoulder.
text: Butterfield reaches for his rifle...
text: ...-but a look from Wade makes his freeze.

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Give me the key.
text: Dan digs the HAND-CUFFS KEY out of his pocket...
text: ...then hurls it out into the field of tall grass.
text: Everybody watches the key sail through the air, swallowed up
text: first by the darkness, then by the endless field of grass...
text: ...and Wade just can’t believe it. He zeroes in on Dan. Lifts
text: his rifle. And ruthlessly wallops Dan across the jaw with the

scene_heading: 95 EXT. CAMP #2, FIELD - NIGHT

speaker_heading: WILLIAM

text: meticulously filing his nails. A BULLWHIP dangles on his hip.
text: Boles feeds his PET MONKEY as Zeke speaks long-sufferingly:
speaker_heading: ZEKE

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: You. Break the hand-cuffs. You help

text: ...WHACK! Straight into a RAILROAD ENFORCER’s face.
text: The man tumbles backwards, cradling his BLOODY NOSE.
text: Dan seizes the moment, spinning around. Catching Boles in the
text: stomach with a powerful right-hand punch. Boles doubles over,
text: gaping for air...
text: ...it’s all happening so quick, William doesn’t know what’s
text: going on. He glimpses Wade using his HAND-CUFFS to lift his
text: legs and kick Zeke in the chest.
text: The TELEGRAPH OPERATOR drops his pistol and runs...
text: ...while the other RAILROAD ENFORCER fires a shot at Dan. The
text: shot misses. Dan quickly lays a right hook across Boles’ jaw.

scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL, BLASTING CAMP - DAY
