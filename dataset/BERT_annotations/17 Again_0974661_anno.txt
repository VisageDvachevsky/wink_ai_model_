scene_heading: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: An empty gymnasium except for a shirtless MIKE O'DONNELL, 17.
text: Mike stands feet BEYOND the 3 point line, grabs balls from a
text: hopper and rapidly shoots, shoots, shoots.
text: SWISH...SWISH...SWISH. This kid's automatic.
dialog: 
text: Mike's hair, a pompadour mullet a la `21 Jump Street' and

dialog: 
text: Mustached and curly haired COACH HARVEY, 40, enters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COACH HARVEY
dialog: Hey, O'Donnell, save some for the

dialog: you want, Mike.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That's the plan coach.
dialog: 
text: The rest of the FITCH FALCONS basketball team jogs out from

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COACH HARVEY
dialog: Round up, Jock Straps! Picture
dialog: time.
dialog: 
text: The Team assembles in the middle of the court. A PLAYER
text: kneeling in front holds a sign, `FITCH FALCONS, 1989'.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Hold on. Ed's not here yet.
dialog: 
text: DOM, 17, handsome, tall, long rat tail, scoffs-

speaker_heading: MIKE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COACH HARVEY
dialog: Hey! Hey! Knock it off.
dialog: 
text: Coach Harvey pulls the Players apart just as the gym doors
text: burst open. ED FREEDMAN, 17, sporting a jacket over a WIZARD
text: costume, runs in, trips on his robe, gets up, peels his
text: clothes off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Sorry I'm late. I was locked in a

dialog: wizard...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COACH HARVEY
dialog: ...Fall in, Freedman. Hurry up.
dialog: 
text: Ed takes a spot next to Dom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHOTOGRPAHER
dialog: And 3, 2, 1-
dialog: 
text: WE see Dom reach behind Ed, grab hold of his

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The Falcons run, pass and shoot on one end of the court. On
text: the opposite end, a TEAM in BLUE warms up.
dialog: 
text: Lights dim. Cue MC Hammer's `Can't Touch This'. CHEERLEADERS
text: at center court perform the Hammer DANCE ROUTINE. PAN around
text: the gym, everybody's doing the Hammer dance.
dialog: 
text: Ed awkwardly tries to imitate Mike.
dialog: 
text: Coach shakes his head in disgust and when the routine ends-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COACH HARVEY
dialog: Alright, Ladies, bring it in!
dialog: 
text: The Falcons swarm to the bench, take seats. Ed hands waters
text: to the Players, skips Dom, stops at Mike.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Ed, I can't help you with the girls
dialog: if you keep showing up places

dialog: Okay? Dude, don't look now but I

dialog: you hard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: For real?
dialog: 
text: Ed jerks around to blatantly stare at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE

dialog: 
text: He kisses her cheek, starts off, turns back-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: What's wrong?
dialog: 
text: LONG SHOT: We hear nothing but see Mike's body deflate. He
text: steps away from Scarlet towards center court.
dialog: 
text: Muffy and her friends mock Ed and laugh hysterically
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Do you really think Muffy's in to
dialog: me?
dialog: 
text: Mike, in a daze walks right past Ed. Takes his place for the
text: jump ball. The Crowd stomps and cheers LOUDLY.
dialog: 
text: The Ref is about to toss the ball. Mike looks up at the
text: stands, sees a crushed Scarlet heading for the exit. Mike's
text: torn. Play or go after her. He goes after her.

speaker_heading: COACH HARVEY

text: A HOT, YOUNG ACUPUNCTURIST adds more to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACUPUNCTURIST
dialog: Can you feel your Qi flowing

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I'm not sure if its my Qi or

speaker_heading: ED
text: There he is. There's Mr. Sunshine.
dialog: Fei Jing Acupuncture. It's all the

dialog: younger.
dialog: 
text: Ed climbs slowly off the table, shuffles over, groaning in
text: pain the entire way. He pours himself a shot of BROWN LIQUID
text: from a pitcher, throws the shot back and immediately SPITS it
text: all over the place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Delish!

dialog: The girl has absolutely no clue
text: what she's doing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Then why are you letting her stick
dialog: needles in you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Because she's hot. But today's not
dialog: about me. It's about you becoming
text: the new regional sales manager.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I better be. I've invested 18
dialog: years of my life in that miserable
dialog: company.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No negativity. Negativity's for
dialog: the 800 pound fat lady who needs to
dialog: be airlifted out of bed. You,
dialog: Michael Shawn O'Donnell, are a
dialog: winner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: A winner doesn't have to crash at

text: was kicked out of his own house.

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Are you kidding?! It doesn't get
dialog: any better than this!

text: WOMEN, 20 to 35, in skimpy business suits, chatting away.
dialog:

dialog: Congratulations, Mike. You deserve

dialog: Good morning, peeps. As you all

dialog: take to be an RSM? Leadership
dialog: skills, a comprehensive knowledge

speaker_heading: ROGER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ROGER (CONT'D)
dialog: Now go out there and sell some

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: How could you do this to me? I've
dialog: been a salesman here 18 years.
dialog: Wendy's only been here 2 months!?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Look, your sales are admittedly
dialog: better but she has the college
dialog: degree. What can I do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You can give me the promotion,
dialog: Roger!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Things have changed. I couldn't

dialog: 
text: Mike peers around...nobody.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Alex?
dialog: 
text: No answer. A basketball sits in the middle of the floor.
text: Mike enters, picks up the ball, begins dribbling...faster,
text: between his legs, around his back, up to the 3 point line-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: 3, 2, 1-
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Mike hits a perfect jumper at the imaginary buzzer, smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: The kid's still got it.
dialog: 
text: Mike dashes for the bouncing ball, scoops it up, goes for a
text: reverse lay up, makes it but when he lands...he
text: lands...CRACK...hard. Mike grabs his lower back, groans-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ooooh. That was stupid.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/HALL - DUSK
dialog: 
text: Mike limps out of the gym, wanders over to a wall covered in
text: PHOTOGRAPHS...Fitch basketball teams of the past.
dialog: 
text: Mike searches the pictures until he finds it...the photo WE
text: saw being taken earlier...the team of 1989. Ed mid howl from
text: Dom's wedgy.
dialog: 
text: Mike stares at the photograph...lost in time and thought.
text: The smiling, confident image of his youth stares back at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (o.s.)
dialog: You know someone in that picture?
dialog: 
text: Mike startles from his daydream, turns. A kind-faced, old

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I do. Me. I'm in the center
dialog: there.
dialog: 
text: The Janitor leans in, takes a closer look at Young Mike.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANITOR
dialog: Adolescence can be so cruel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What are you talking about?
dialog: (lost in the picture
speaker_heading: AGAIN)
dialog: I had life by the balls in that
dialog: picture. Everything was possible.

speaker_heading: JANITOR

speaker_heading: MIKE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANITOR
text: Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.
dialog: Can't hurt to ask. You never know

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: SCARLET

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Doesn't he live 30 miles from here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCARLET
dialog: What's your point?

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: `In touch with the ground, I'm on

text: Scarlet shakes her head-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCARLET
dialog: Please, Mike. This isn't high

speaker_heading: MIKE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
text: `Mouth is alive, with juices like

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCARLET
dialog: You no longer have the right to

dialog: 
text: A chastised Mike eyes the yard...it's a WRECK...holes and
text: mounds of dirt everywhere, carcasses of dead plants, bushes
text: and flowers strewn about.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Why are you destroying the yard?
dialog: 
text: Scarlet stops shoveling, wipes dirt from her face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCARLET
dialog: I'm gonna use it as a showpiece for
dialog: clients. Thanks for asking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Kind of a big undertaking isn't it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCARLET
dialog: I am a landscape designer. Then
dialog: again you barely took an interest
dialog: in my work so I guess that's a fair
dialog: question.
dialog: 
text: An awkward silence. Then-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I didn't get it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCARLET
dialog: I'm sorry. But maybe this is what
dialog: you needed. Maybe it's time you
dialog: looked for something else?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That's a great idea, Scar. Because
dialog: there are so many options out there
dialog: for a 36 year old with only a high

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I didn't say that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCARLET
dialog: No, but it's what you think, right?

text: Mike's silence says it all. Scarlet fights back tears.

speaker_heading: SCARLET (CONT'D)
dialog: I never asked you to marry me.

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: ED

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: She's not your type. She's smart.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: As far as I can tell that's her

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: But, People, Stan's a bully. Why?
dialog: It would be way too easy to say
dialog: Stan preys on the weak because he's
dialog: simply a dick. No, Stan's more
dialog: complex than that. According to
dialog: leading psychiatrists Stan is a
dialog: bully for 1 of 3 reasons. 1, under
dialog: all that male bravado there's an
text: insecure little girl banging on the
text: closet door trying to get out. 2,
text: like a caveman, Stan's brain is
dialog: underdeveloped. Therefore Stan is
dialog: unable to use self-control so he
dialog: acts out aggressively. And the
dialog: third reason-
dialog: 
text: Mike holds up his pinky then spins the ball on it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'd argue that Stan suffers from
dialog: all 3.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: The beach is for the older, cool

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What are you talking about? You're

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I don't play basketball. I mean, I

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: She's so pretty it makes me gassy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Calm down. Here's what you're
dialog: gonna do. You're gonna go over
dialog: there and introduce yourself-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: She won't like me, Mark. I'm a
dialog: loser.
dialog: 
text: Mike grabs Alex by the shoulders.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Why? Because Stan says so? You
dialog: think Stan's a winner? He's going
dialog: nowhere. You're a great kid. Any
dialog: girl would be lucky to get your
dialog: attention.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Really?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Really. And right now, there's a

dialog: 
text: A determined look comes over Alex.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Okay. What do I say?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Just introduce yourself. Then
dialog: compliment her on something she
dialog: never gets complimented on. Like if
text: she has big, meaty, man hands tell
dialog: her she should be a hand model.
dialog: (Alex burps nervously)
dialog: And don't burp on her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I can do that.

dialog:

speaker_heading: LAUREN

dialog: 
text: A full blown ARGUMENT breaks out between the Bras. Mike sees

speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Hi.

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Hi, Alex. I'm Nicole.

text: Nicole and her Friends giggle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: You don't look like a Nicole.

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: GIRL 1

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Wait. I'm sorry. I'm just real

dialog: couldn't find anything because
dialog: everything's so...perfect.

speaker_heading: MIKE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Get to the point why don't you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I'm serious. He's not a nice guy.
dialog: Matter of fact he's a jackass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Don't talk about him like that.

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: The hell you are, Young Lady! If

dialog: 
text: Maggie jumps up. Kids all stare.

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Who do you think you are!? My
dialog: father?!
dialog: 
text: Maggie stomps over to the still bickering Bras.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Don't you walk away from me,
dialog: Margaret Sarah O'Donnell!
dialog:

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Who's Margaret?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREN
text: He doesn't even know her name.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAMIE

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: SCARLET

speaker_heading: ED

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You went through my room!?

speaker_heading: ED

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: JUDGE

speaker_heading: (READS)
dialog: September 7th, 1988 was the first
dialog: time I saw you. You were reading
text: `The Great Gatsby' and wearing a
dialog: Guns N Roses T-shirt. I'd never
dialog: seen anything so perfect. I
dialog: remember thinking I had to have you
dialog: or I'd die...not in a psycho kinda
dialog: way but in that beautiful,
dialog: innocent, unaffected way that way
text: only a 17 year-old kid can have.
dialog: You whispered you loved me at the
dialog: homecoming dance and I felt so
dialog: peaceful and safe because I knew no
dialog: matter what happened from that
dialog: night on nothing could ever be that
dialog: bad because I had you. And then I
dialog: grew up, lost my way and blamed you
dialog: for my failures. But I was never
dialog: lost. I'd just forgotten the way
dialog: life makes you forget as you grow
dialog: older. And I never failed at
dialog: anything because on that September
dialog: day you said `yes' to me. And at
dialog: that dance you said you loved me.
dialog: And as I stand here...as I write
dialog: this, I want you to know if I don't
dialog: have you I'll die...not in a psycho
dialog: way but in that beautiful,
dialog: innocent, unaffected way only a 17
dialog: year old kid can have....oh
dialog: and...P.S...I'm `Hungry Like the
dialog: Wolf'.

speaker_heading: SCARLET

dialog: 
dialog: 96.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A tearful Scarlet starts to leave, stops, picks up Mike's

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Maybe it wasn't a spell of
dialog: enlightenment.
dialog: 
text: Mike looks to Ed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What are you talking about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: According to the website once
dialog: you've learned your lesson you'd
dialog: turn back. That speech should've
dialog: broken the spell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Enough with the magic crap, Ed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You know what this means? You need
dialog: to let them go. You need to let
dialog: them get on with their lives and
dialog: you need to get on with yours.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - NIGHT
dialog:

speaker_heading: COACH HARVEY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COACH HARVEY
dialog: Son, I haven't seen anyone with
dialog: your shooting ability in, well, in
dialog: a long time. I called a couple
dialog: college scouts I know. They're
dialog: coming to the game tonight...to
dialog: watch you. If you have half the
dialog: season I think you're capable of,
dialog: you can play anywhere you want.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That's the plan, Coach.

speaker_heading: COACH HARVEY
dialog: Round up, Jock Straps! Picture

speaker_heading: PHOTOGRPAHER
dialog: 3, 2, 1-
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - LATER
dialog: 
text: A POPULAR SONG rocks the gymnasium. CHEERLEADERS dance on

text: packed stands.
dialog: 
text: Julie gabs with a group of TEACHERS.
dialog: 
text: On one end of the court, the Falcons run a pass and shoot
text: drill. On the opposite end, a TEAM in BLUE shoots around.
dialog: 
text: Mike sees Scarlet and Maggie enter. He smiles apologetically
text: to them. Both turn away, climb the bleachers, join Nicole
dialog: and the Wonder Bras.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (to Scarlet)
dialog: I thought he was hanging out with
dialog: Alex to get to me- not you.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE...Coach Harvey claps loudly-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COACH HARVEY
dialog: Alright, Ladies, bring it in!
dialog: 
text: The Falcons swarm the bench, take their seats. Mike takes a
text: deep breath, sits next to Alex. Alex looks down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
speaker_heading: ALEX-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I have nothing to say to you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I never meant to hurt you-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Then why'd you kiss my mom!?
dialog: 
dialog: 99.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Alex, I'm your fa...I don't know.
dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: 
dialog: Alex stands-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You're lucky I don't punch you out.
dialog: 
text: Alex moves down the line, takes another seat.
dialog: 
text: Ed strides through the door spots Julie, makes his way over
text: to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Julie, can I talk to you?
dialog: 
text: Julie excuses herself from the Teachers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What is it, Ed?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I've seen a good friend of mine
dialog: lose everything that means anything
dialog: to him. And maybe we'll never be
dialog: there but...I just really want to
dialog: play D &amp; D with you.
dialog: 
text: Julie can't help but smile, sizes Ed up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You can raid my dungeon anytime.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I'll bring my long bow.

text: A REFEREE blows his whistle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COACH HARVEY
dialog: Let's go! Remember, Boys, winners
dialog: get the girls. Losers please
dialog: themselves!
dialog: 
text: Mike and the Falcons jog onto the court. Mike takes his
text: place for the jump ball. The Crowd stomps, cheers LOUDLY.
dialog: 
text: Mike looks around the gymnasium...it almost seems to SLOW
text: UP...the sound deafening. He finds Alex on the bench...his
text: hopeful face. Mike looks into the stands...Maggie and
text: Scarlet. Scarlet abruptly stands, climbs back down the
text: bleachers and exits the gym.
dialog: 
dialog: 100.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The Ref readies to toss the ball. Mike takes a deep
text: breath...and walks off the court.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REFEREE
dialog: Son! Come back here! You're gonna
dialog: get a delay of game!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COACH HARVEY
dialog: This can't be happening again.
dialog: 
text: Mike steps over to Alex-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: It's your turn now. Good luck.
dialog: 
text: Mike rushes off the court. As Mike disappears into the
text: tunnel, WE see the OLD JANITOR amongst the crowd. He smiles.
dialog: 
text: Coach Harvey turns to Alex-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COACH HARVEY
dialog: Get off your butt, O'Donnell! Get
dialog: in there!
dialog: 
text: Alex leaps off the bench.

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: SCARLET
dialog: What took you so long?
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON: Mike and he's 36 years-old again, bursting out of

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: The best choice I ever made was
dialog: you.
dialog: 
text: Scarlet and Mike walk towards one another, picking up their

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCARLET
dialog: How did this happ-

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Mike wraps his arms around her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Don't ask.
dialog: 
text: They lock lips.
dialog: 
text: Mike takes Scarlet's hand and as they walk out of the tunnel-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: I think it's best if we don't tell
