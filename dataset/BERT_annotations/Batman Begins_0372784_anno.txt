text: projections). Ducard SKIDS left, breath STEAMING, feinting
text: with his sword.
text: Wayne steps sideways on the ice, his foot landing on a thin

speaker_heading: DUCARD
dialog: Mind your surrounding. Always.

speaker_heading: DUCARD
dialog: Would that stop you?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I’ve had training-
speaker_heading: DUCARD
dialog: The training is nothing. The will

dialog: the attacker and could simply give

text: Wayne considers this... breathing slowing... CALMER... they

speaker_heading: DUCARD (CONT’D)
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Your father did not understand the

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Beyond saving? You believe that?
text: Ducard regards the harshly beautiful landscape.
speaker_heading: DUCARD
dialog: It is not right that one must come

dialog: What Chill did is unforgivable-
speaker_heading: BRUCE

speaker_heading: EARLE

speaker_heading: EARLE

speaker_heading: WAYNE

text: belt buckle- it CLICKS into place.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Too expensive for the army?
text: Fox takes it back from Wayne. Sardonic.
speaker_heading: FOX

speaker_heading: FOX (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: What kind of shapes can you make? Fox releases the tent,

speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: It could be tailored to any

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: WAYNE
