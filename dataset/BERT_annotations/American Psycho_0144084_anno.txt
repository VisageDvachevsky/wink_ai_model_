scene_heading: INT. PASTELS RESTAURANT- NIGHT
text: An insanely expensive restaurant on the Upper East Side.
text: The decor is a mixture of chi-chi and rustic, with swagged
text: silk curtains, handwritten menus and pale pink tablecloths
text: decorated with arrangements of moss, twigs and hideous
text: exotic flowers. The clientele is young, wealthy and
text: confident, dressed in the height of late-eighties style:
text: pouffy Lacroix dresses, slinky Alaïa, Armani power suits.
text: CLOSE-UP on a WAITER reading out the specials.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: With goat cheese profiteroles and I also have an arugula
dialog: Caesar salad. For entrées tonight I have a swordfish
text: meatloaf with onion marmalade, a rare-roasted partridge
text: breast in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale...
text: Huge white porcelain plates descend on very pale pink linen
text: table cloths. Each of the entrees is a rectangle about four
text: inches square and look exactly alike.
text: CLOSE-UP on various diners as we hear fragments of
dialog: conversation. "Is that Charlie Sheen over there?" "Excuse
dialog: me? I ordered cactus pear sorbet."
speaker_heading: WAITER
text: And grilled free-range rabbit with herbed French fries. Our
text: pasta tonight is a squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth...
text: CLOSE-UP on porcelain plates containing elaborate
text: perpendicular desserts descending on another table.
scene_heading: PATRICK BATEMAN, TIMOTHY PRICE, CRAIG MCDERMOTT and DAVID
text: VAN PATTEN are at a table set for four. They are all wearing
text: expensively cut suits and suspenders and have slicked-back
text: hair. Van Patten wears horn-rimmed glasses.
text: The camera moves in on Bateman as his narration begins:
speaker_heading: BATEMAN (V.O.)
dialog: We're sitting in Pastels, this nouvelle Northern California
dialog: place on the Upper East Side.
text: The Waiter sets down plates containing tiny, elaborately
text: decorated starters. As he does so we hear Bateman's
text: description of each of the men at the table.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN (V.O.)
dialog: You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in
text: a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences
dialog: between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van
dialog: Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the
dialog: best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a
text: bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten
text: keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .
speaker_heading: VAN PATTEN
dialog: What are the rules for a sweater vest?
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Yes. Clarify.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Well, is it strictly informal-
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Or can it be worn with a suit?
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: Exactly
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: With discreet pinstripes you should wear a subdued blue or
dialog: charcoal gray vest. A plaid suit would cal I for a bolder
dialog: vest.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: But avoid matching the vest's pattern with your socks or
dialog: tie. Wearing argyle socks with an argyle vest will look
dialog: too studied.
speaker_heading: VAN PATTEN
dialog: You think so?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
speaker_heading: VAN PATTEN
dialog: Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.
text: Van Patten leaves the table. As he does so, a busboy
text: discreetly removes their largely untouched plates.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
text: Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: It looks that way, doesn't it?
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: (Staring at retreating waiter)
dialog: Did he just take our plates away?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: He took them away because the portions are so small he
dialog: probably thought we were finished. God, I hate this place.
dialog: This is a chicks' restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia?
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Because Bateman won't give the maitre d' head.
dialog: (He guffaws)
text: Bateman throws a swizzle stick at him.
text: McDermott scans the room, settling on a handsome young man
text: with slicked-back hair and horn-rimmed glasses.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Is that Reed Robinson over there?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Are you freebasing or what? That's not Robinson.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Who is it then?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: That's Paul Owen.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
text: That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the
text: room. Over there.
text: He points to another handsome young man with slicked-back
text: hair and horn-rimmed glasses.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Who is he with?
speaker_heading: PRICE
text: (Distracted by the waitress's
text: cleavage as she bends over to
text: uncork a bottle of wine  the
text: waitress glares at him)
text: Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.
text: Van Patten returns.
speaker_heading: VAN PATTEN
dialog: They don't have a good bathroom to do coke in.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Are you sure that's Paul Owen over there?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Yes. McDufus, I am.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: He's handling the Fisher account.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Lucky bastard.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Lucky Jew bastard.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Oh Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with
dialog: anything?
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Listen. I've seen the bastard sitting in his office on the
text: phone with CEOs, spinning a fucking menorah. The
dialog: bastard brought a Hanukkah bush into the office last December.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: You spin a dreidel, McDermott, not a menorah.
dialog: You spin a dreidel.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Oh my God. Bateman, do you want me to fry you up
dialog: some fucking potato pancakes? Some latkes?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: No. Just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Oh I forgot. Bateman's dating someone from the
speaker_heading: ACLU.
text: Price leans over and pats Bateman on the back.
speaker_heading: PRICE
text: The voice of reason. The boy next door. And speaking
dialog: of reasonable...
text: He shows McDermott the bill for the meal.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Only $470.
speaker_heading: VAN PATTEN
dialog: (Without irony)
dialog: Not bad.
text: The others murmur agreement. Four platinum Amex cards slap
text: down on the table.
scene_heading: INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
text: Bateman is pouring vintage champagne into flutes. Price is
text: lighting up a cigar.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Last week I picked up this Vassar chick-
speaker_heading: VAN PATTEN
dialog: Oh God, I was there. I don't need to hear this
dialog: story again.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: But I never told you what happened afterwards. So
dialog: okay, I pick up this Vassar chick at Tunnel-hot number, big
dialog: tits, great legs, this chick was a little hardbody-and so I
dialog: buy her a couple of champagne kirs and she's in the city on
text: spring break and she's practically blowing me in the
dialog: Chandelier Room and so I take her back to my place-
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Whoa, wait. May I ask where Pamela is during all
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Oh fuck you. I want a blowjob, Bate-man. I want a chick
dialog: who's gonna let me-
speaker_heading: VAN PATTEN
text: (Putting his hands over his ears)
dialog: I don't want to hear this. He's going to say something
dialog: disgusting.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: You prude. Listen, we're not gonna invest in a co-op
dialog: together or jet down to Saint Bart's. I just want some
dialog: chick whose face I can sit on for thirty, forty minutes.
text: Price throws a cigar at McDermott, who catches it.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Anyway, so we're back at my place and listen to
dialog: this. She's had enough champagne by now to get a fucking
dialog: rhino tipsy, and get this-
speaker_heading: VAN PATTEN
dialog: She let you fuck her without a condom?
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: This is a Vassar girl. She's not from Queens. She
dialog: would only-are you ready?
dialog: (Dramatic pause)
dialog: She would only give me a handjob, and get this...she kept
text: her glove on.
text: The men sit in shocked, horrified silence.
dialog: ALL IN UNISON Never date a Vassar girl.
scene_heading: EXT. TUNNEL NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
text: The limo pulls up to the sidewalk outside the Tunnel.
text: McDermott holds the door open for a passing HOMELESS MAN,
text: who looks confused.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: I suppose he doesn't want the car. Price, ask
dialog: him if he takes American Express.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: (Offering card)
dialog: You take Amex, dude?
text: The man stumbles away. The club DOORMAN, seeing the limousine,
text: unhooks the
text: velvet rope and welcomes them inside.
scene_heading: INT. LADIES ROOM, TUNNEL - NIGHT
text: Brilliant white light, a bemused elderly female attendant in a
text: black-and-white maid's uniform trying to give out paper towels.
text: MUSIC thuds through an open doorway. Trashed-looking girls
text: stare into mirrors repairing their eye make-up or sit on the
text: counter chatting to friends. There are almost as many men as
text: women in the room. Couples stand in line, twitching as they
text: wait to do coke. As soon as one bathroom door opens, a couple
text: lurches out rubbing their noses while another couple rushes
text: past them and slams the door.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: There's this theory out now that if you can catch the
dialog: AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected,
dialog: then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular
dialog: dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for
dialog: Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a
dialog: virus.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.
text: Price and Bateman finally get a stall and rush in. Price is
dialog: sweating.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I'm shaking. You open it.
text: Bateman opens a tiny packet of coke.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Maybe it's just the light.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Is he fucking selling it by the milligram? (He dips
text: the corner of his Amex card in the packet and takes a snort)
dialog: Oh my God...
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!
text: Bateman dips his Amex in the envelope and snorts.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do
dialog: enough of it we'll be okay.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it
dialog: on my fucking All-Bran.
text: The GUY IN STALL next door yells at them in an effeminate
dialog: voice:
scene_heading: GUY IN STALL
dialog: Could you keep it down, I'm trying to do drugs!
text: Price pounds his fist against the stall.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: SHUT UP!
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Calm down. Let's do it anyway
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I guess you're right...
dialog: (Raising his voice)
text: THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY!
scene_heading: GUY IN STALL
dialog: Fuck you!
speaker_heading: PRICE
text: (Trying to climb up against the aluminum divider)
dialog: No, FUCK YOU!!
text: (He collapses, panting against the stall door)
dialog: Sorry, dude. Steroids...Okay, let's do it.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: That's the spirit.
text: They both dig their platinum Amex cards into the envelope
text: of white powder, shoveling it up their noses, then sticking
text: their fingers in to catch the residue and rubbing it into
dialog: their gums.
scene_heading: INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
text: Bateman saunters toward the bar as "Pump Up the Volume"
text: plays in the background.
text: BATEMAN (to BARGIRL) Two Stoli on the rocks.
text: He hands her two drink tickets.
speaker_heading: BARGIRL
text: It's after eleven. Those aren't good anymore. It's
dialog: a cash bar. That'll be twenty-five dollars.
text: Bateman pulls out an expensive-looking wallet and hands her
dialog: a $50.
text: She turns her back and searches the cash register for
dialog: change.
dialog: BATEMAN You are a fucking ugly bitch I want to stab to
dialog: death and then play around with your blood.
text: The music muffles his voice. She turns around. He is
text: smiling at her. She gives him his change impassively.
scene_heading: INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT- MORNING
text: Tableaux of Bateman's apartment in the early morning light.
text: A huge white living room with floor-to-ceiling windows
text: looking out over Manhattan, decorated in expensive, minimalist
text: high style: bleached oak floors, a huge white sofa, a large
text: Baselitz painting (hung upside down) and much expensive
text: electronic equipment. The room is impeccably neat, and oddly
text: impersonal - as if it had sprung straight from the pages of
text: a design magazine.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN (V.0.)
dialog: My name is Patrick Bateman. I am
dialog: twenty-six years old. I live in the American Garden
text: Buildings on West Eighty-First Street, on the eleventh
text: floor Tom Cruise lives in the penthouse.
text: Bateman walks into his bathroom, urinates while trying to
text: see his reflection in a poster for Les Miserables above his
dialog: toilet.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (V.0.) I believe in taking care of myself, in a
text: balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine. In the
dialog: morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice
text: pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand
dialog: now.
text: Bateman ties a plastic ice pack around his face.
text: Bateman does his morning stretching exercises in the living
text: room wearing the ice pack.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A mirror-lined bathroom. Bateman is luxuriating in the
text: shower steam, scrubbing his body, admiring his muscles.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN (V.O.)
text: After I remove the icepack, I use a deep
dialog: pore-cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a
text: water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body
text: scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub.
text: Bateman stands in front of a massive marble sink applying a
text: gel facial masque.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN (V.O.)
text: Then I apply an herb mint facial masque which
text: I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my
dialog: routine.
text: Bateman opens the door of a mirrored cabinet, which is
text: stocked with immaculate rows of skin care products. He
text: begins selecting bottles jars and brushes, laying them in
text: readiness on the marble counter.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN (V.O.)
dialog: I always use an after-shave lotion with little
dialog: or no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes
dialog: you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye
text: balm, followed by a final moisturizing "protective" lotion...
text: Bateman stares into the mirror. The masque has dried,
text: giving his face a strange distorted look as if it has been
text: wrapped in plastic. He begins slowly peeling the gel masque
text: off his face.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN (V.O.)
text: There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some
dialog: kind of abstraction, hut there is no real me, only an
text: entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold
dialog: gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping you
dialog: and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably
dialog: comparable: I simply am not there.
scene_heading: INT. BATEMAN BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Another huge white room, equally minimal: a futon, rumpled
text: white sheets, a bedside lamp with a halogen bulb, and a large
dialog: expensive painting (Eric Fischl or David Salle) chosen by
text: Bateman's interior decorator.
text: Dressed in silk boxer shorts, Bateman stands in front of a
text: huge walk-in closet, filled with rows of expensive shirts,
text: shoes and designer suits, organized according to color and
dialog: tone.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN (V.O.)
dialog: It is hard for me to make sense on any given
dialog: level. My self is fabricated, an aberration. My personality
dialog: is sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes deep and is
dialog: persistent.
text: Fully dressed in Armani, Bateman stands in front of a
text: full-length mirror in the middle of his vast bedroom,
text: adjusting his cuff-links.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN (V.0.)
dialog: My conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared
dialog: a long time ago, if they ever did exist.
text: He gives a last look at the mirror and likes what he sees.
text: He gives his reflection a smile.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICES OF PIERCE &amp; PIERCE - DAY
text: As Bateman walks down the corridor, he passes another MAN who
text: looks just like him.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Morning, Hamilton. Nice tan.
text: Bateman walks past the desk of JEAN, his secretary, pulling
text: his Walkman from around his neck. Jean is attractive,
text: wholesome, earnest. She smiles shyly. She loves him.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Late?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what
dialog: he was canceling or why.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club.
dialog: Anyone else?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: After six.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Negative. Cancel it.
text: Jean follows him into his office.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Oh? And what should I say?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Just...say...no.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Just say no?
text: Jean stands at his desk, waiting for instructions.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols
dialog: at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (Playfully)
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: She turns to leave.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Oh wait. And I need reservations for two at Arcadia at eight
dialog: tonight.
text: Jean turns around.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Oh, something. . romantic?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I'll do it.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: You look nice today.
text: Jean exits. Bateman straightens some magazines in his
text: office, lifts a painting off the wall and puts it back at a
text: slightly different angle. He fiddles with some pencils in a
text: beer stein. He puts on some MUSIC and flips through a
text: Sports Illustrated. He buzzes Jean. She comes in a moment
text: later with the Perrier and a file.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that
dialog: outfit again.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a
dialog: dress. A skirt or something.
text: Jean stands there, then looks down at herself.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (Smiling bravely)
dialog: You don't like this, I take it?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Come on, you're prettier than that.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (Sarcastically)
dialog: Thanks, Patrick.
text: The phone RINGS and Jean turns to leave.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I'm not here. And high heels. I like high heels.
text: As Jean leaves, Bateman clicks on the TV set in one corner
text: of the room and starts watching Jeopardy!
scene_heading: INT. TAXI - EVENING
scene_heading: EVELYN WILLIAMS, Patrick Bateman's
text: fiancée, is making notes with a gold Cross pen and sipping
text: a bottle of mineral water. Evelyn is blonde, classically
text: beautiful, expensively educated, and utterly pleased with
text: herself. She usually addresses Patrick as if he were a
dialog: small child.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I'd want a zydeco band, Patrick. That's what I'd
text: want, a zydeco band. Or mariachi. Or reggae. Something
dialog: ethnic to shock Daddy Oh, I can't decide...And lots
text: of chocolate truffles. Godiva. And oysters on the halfshell.
text: CLOSE-UP on Bateman, who is wearing a Walkman and staring
text: out the window.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN (V.O.)
dialog: I'm trying to listen to the new George
dialog: Michael tape but Evelyn-my supposed fiancée-keeps buzzing
dialog: in my ear.
text: Evelyn continues to make notes.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
text: Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses.
dialog: Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz.
dialog: And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Removing his Walkman)
dialog: Do...what.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Get married. Have a wedding.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Evelyn?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Yes, darling?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Is your Evian spiked?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: We should do it.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: No-I can't take the time off work.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Your father practically owns the company. You can do
dialog: anything you like, silly.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I don't want to talk about it.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just
dialog: quit? You don't have to work.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Because I...want...to...fit...in.
text: The taxi bumps to a halt.
scene_heading: INT. ESPACE RESTAURANT- NIGHT
text: A cavernous garage, harshly spot-lit, decorated in
text: self-conscious brutalist chic. Iron girders, walls of waxed
text: plaster featuring exposed rusted pipes, a huge Schnabel
text: smashed-plate painting on one wall. The tables and chairs are
dialog: made of extremely uncomfortable
text: bolted steel.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN (V.O.)
text: I'm on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at Espace
dialog: since I'm positive we won't have a decent table, but we do,
text: and relief washes over me in an awesome wave.
text: Tm Price and two downtown types, STASH and VANDEN, are
text: already seated. Vanden is about twenty, pretty and sullen,
text: with green streaks in her black hair. Stash is pale, with
text: ragged black hair and bad skin.
text: They are all trying to read large stainless steel menus
text: that look like minimalist art.
speaker_heading: PRICE
text: The menu's in braille.
text: He gets up to greet them, giving Evelyn a suspiciously long
dialog: kiss.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I have to talk to you.
text: He drags her away, half giggling and protesting.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (Over her shoulder)
dialog: Pat, this is my cousin Vanden
text: and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
text: (After smiling at his own reflection in the mirror and
dialog: checking his hair)
dialog: Hi. Pat Bateman.
text: Vanden takes his hand reluctantly, says nothing.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Let me guess-you live in the East Village?
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: STASH
dialog: SoHo.
text: COURTNEY RAWLINSON and LUIS CARRUTHERS arrive at the table.
text: Courtney is blonde, classically beautiful and from
text: precisely the same social background as Evelyn, but she is
text: considerably more fragile and neurotic. Luis is
text: half-English, half-Argentinean, slightly overweight (a
text: rarity in this crowd), puppyish and eager to please. He
text: wears the same type of designer clothes as Price and
text: Bateman, but with foppish tendencies: velvet jackets,
text: bow-ties, boldly patterned vests.
text: They exchange air kisses. As soon as Luis turns his back,
text: Bateman sneaks a kiss on Courtney's neck.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: (Whispering)
dialog: Stop it!
text: Stash and Vanden watch them in silence.
speaker_heading: LATER:
text: Price is whispering in Evelyn's ear. Everyone else is
text: quietly eating, except Bateman, who is drinking and watching
dialog: Evelyn and Price.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN (V.O.)
dialog: I am fairly sure that Timothy and Evelyn
text: are having an affair. Timothy is the only interesting
dialog: person I know. Courtney is almost perfect looking. She s
dialog: usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs. Tonight
dialog: I believe it's Xanax. More disturbing than her drug use,
text: though, is the fact that she's engaged to Luis Carruthers,
dialog: the biggest dufus in the business.
text: Courtney rouses herself from her drug haze.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Tell me. Stash...do you think SoHo is
dialog: becoming to...commercial?
speaker_heading: CARRUTHERS
dialog: Yes, I read that.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Oh, who gives a rat's ass?
speaker_heading: VANDEN
dialog: Hey. That affects us.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: (Wired on coke)
dialog: Oh ho ho. That affects us? What
dialog: about the massacres in Sri Lanka, honey? Doesn't that
dialog: affect us, too? I mean don't you know anything about Sri
dialog: Lanka? About how the Sikhs are killing like tons of
dialog: Israelis there? Doesn't that affect us?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important
dialog: problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign
dialog: policy is important, but there are more pressing problems
text: at hand.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow
dialog: down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world
dialog: hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We
dialog: have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We
dialog: have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and
dialog: oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while
dialog: also promoting equal rights for women but change the
dialog: abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still
dialog: somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.
text: The table stares at Bateman uncomfortably.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: We also have to control the influx of illegal
dialog: immigrants. We have to encourage a return to traditional
text: moral values and curb graphic sex and violence on TV, in
dialog: movies, in pop music, everywhere. Most importantly we have
dialog: to promote general social concern and less materialism in
dialog: young people.
text: Price chokes on his drink. Everyone is silent and
text: mystified.
speaker_heading: CARRUTHERS
dialog: Patrick, how thought-provoking.
scene_heading: INT. EVELYN'S BEDROOM - LATER THE SAME EVENING
text: Bateman and Evelyn are lying on her bed watching television.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Why don t you just go for Price?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: He's rich.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Everybody's rich.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: He's good-looking.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: He has a great body
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Everybody has a great body now.
text: Bateman unbuttons his shirt and makes advances to get
text: Evelyn to have sex with him. She ignores him, watching the

dialog: What do you want to do with that, floss with it?
text: Bateman flops back down beside her and stares at the television.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Are you using minoxidil?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: No. I'm not. Why should I ?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Your hairline looks like it's receding.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: It's not.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: It is 3 a.m. Bateman is standing at an ATM, listening to the
text: comforting sound of fresh bills thudding out of the machine.
text: Bateman turns around and watches a solitary young woman walk
text: past him. He collects his money, placing it carefully in his
text: wallet, and then walks toward her, whistling. He catches up
text: to her as she pauses at a red light.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Hello.
text: The woman looks suspicious for a moment and then, seeing
text: his smile, smiles back.
scene_heading: INT. DRY CLEANERS - DAY
text: Bateman, dressed in an Armani suit
text: with an unlit cigar between his teeth is standing in a dry
text: cleaners, arguing with the Chinese woman behind the
dialog: counter.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Listen, wait. You're not...shhh wait...
dialog: you're not giving me valid reasons.
text: The woman continues to speak to him in another language,
text: grabbing at the sleeve of the jacket.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: What are you trying to say to me?
text: Her husband has taken Bateman's horribly bloodstained
text: sheets out of the bag and is staring at them.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Bleach-ee? Are you trying to say bleach-ee?
dialog: Bleach-ee. Oh my God.
text: She keeps pointing to the jacket and talking.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Talking over her)
dialog: Two things. One. You can't bleach a Soprani. Out of the question.
dialog: Two.
dialog: (Louder)
dialog: Two. I can only get these sheets in Santa Fe. These are very
dialog: expensive sheets and I really need them clean.
text: She keeps talking and Bateman leans into her.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: If you don't shut your fucking mouth I will kill
dialog: you, are you understanding me?
text: She talks faster.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Now listen-I have a very important lunch meeting
dialog: (Checks Rolex)
dialog: at Hubert's in thirty minutes, and I need those
dialog: ...no wait, twenty minutes. I have a lunch meeting at
dialog: Hubert's in twenty minutes with Ronald Harrison and I need
dialog: those sheets cleaned by this afternoon.
text: She keeps talking.
dialog: BATEMAN Listen. I cannot understand you.
text: Bateman starts laughing, slaps his hand down on the
dialog: counter.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: This is crazy. You're a fool. I can't cope with
dialog: this.
text: Bateman is on the verge of tears.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Stupid bitchee! Understand? Oh Christ!
text: Someone enters the store behind him. It's VICTORIA,
text: late-twenties, attractive but a little overweight, wearing a
text: tailored business suit with white sneakers and sports socks.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Patrick?
text: She takes off her sunglasses.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Hello
dialog: (Mumbles un incomprehensible name)
text: Awkward pause.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Well.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here,
dialog: but you
dialog: know. They really are the best.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk
dialog: to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere.
text: Victoria moves toward the sheet that the old man is holding
dialog: up. She
text: touches it and the woman behind the counter begins talking
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Oh my, I see. What are those? Oh my.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Um, well...it s cranberry juice. Cranapple.
speaker_heading: VICTORiA
dialog: (Skeptically) Really?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You
dialog: know, like...
text: like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
text: (As if sharing a secret joke) Oh yeah. Oh I get it.
dialog: Fun with chocolate.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Listen, if you could talk to them
text: (He yanks the sheet out of the man's hand)
dialog: I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a
text: lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.
text: Bateman turns to leave.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank
dialog: you, uh...
dialog: Victoria?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You
dialog: know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Checking his watch)
dialog: Next Saturday?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: (Shrugging)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matinée of Les Miserables.
text: Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Okay. Do.
text: Bateman glares at the woman behind the counter and rushes
text: out the door. Victoria stares after him as we hear the sound
text: of the bell on the closing door.
scene_heading: INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Bateman is sitting on the sofa watching a video, talking to
text: Courtney on a portable phone. He's holding a video box in one
text: hand, perusing the title: Inside Lydia's Ass. Offscreen we hear
text: the sounds of the porn movie as he talks.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Listen, what are you doing tonight?
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: What? Oh, I'm...busy.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me,
dialog: and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to
dialog: tonight?
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Stop it. I'm...
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: On a lot of lithium?
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call
dialog: tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: You should come have dinner with me.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: But-when?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I
dialog: need to be
dialog: home for that.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Pumpkin?
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New
dialog: York.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: I know. Stop it.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling
dialog: dickweed.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Courtney? Dinner?
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I'm thinking Dorsia.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Dorsia's nice.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Nice?
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: You like it there, don't you?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will
dialog: you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a
dialog: boyfriend to eat there tonight.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Okay. Yeah. What time?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Eight?
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Pick me up?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear
dialog: something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?
text: Bateman hangs up, opens up the Zagat's guide and dials the
text: number for Dorsia with trembling fingers. It's busy and so
text: he puts it on speakerphone, constant redial. He waits with
text: his head in his hands, sweating with anxiety, until there
text: is finally an answer.
speaker_heading: MAITRE D'
dialog: Dorsia. Please hold.
text: He is on hold for a long time, getting very tense.
speaker_heading: MAITRE D'
dialog: Dorsia.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Both of his eyes are closed)
dialog: Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to
dialog: reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
text: Long pause. The Maitre D' starts giggling quietly and then
text: more loudly until the laughter is almost hysterical and he
text: hangs up the phone.
scene_heading: INT. TAXI- NIGHT
text: Bateman and Courtney are in the back of a cab. Courtney is
text: heavily medicated.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
text: A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really
dialog: relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this
text: silver muffin dish.
text: (She starts to pass out)
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Is that Donald Trump's car?
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: (Thickly)
dialog: Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: You know, Courtney, you should take some more
dialog: lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you
dialog: out of this slump.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: I just want to have a child. Just...two...
dialog: perfect...children...
text: (Her voice trails as she descends back into a drug haze)
text: The cab draws up outside a restaurant. The awning reads
dialog: "Barcadia."
scene_heading: INT. BARCADIA - NIGHT
text: An insanely expensive nouvelle Italian restaurant all
text: polished natural brick, spotless white tablecloths,
text: minimalist flower arrangements, discreet lighting.
text: A waiter has come to take their drink orders.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: J&amp;B. Straight.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with
text: a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman
text: leans over and pulls her back up.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Are we here?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: This is Dorsia?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
text: (Examining a menu that says "Barcadia" in large script)
dialog: Yes, dear.
text: Courtney almost falls asleep while looking at her menu, and
text: starts to slide off of her chair. Bateman grabs her by both
text: shoulders and props her up.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter
text: soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine
dialog: called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll
dialog: love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and
dialog: pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
text: She falls asleep at the table.
scene_heading: INT. COURTNEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Bateman and Courtney are in Courtney's bed. Bateman is on
text: top of her, reaching for a condom in the ashtray. He tears
text: it open with his teeth, puts it on.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: (Dazed on lithium)
dialog: I want you to fuck me.
text: Bateman gets on top of her, starts to fuck her.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
text: Luis is a despicable twit.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
text: He keeps fucking her.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?"
text: Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip?
dialog: Get off me.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Is it a what?
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Pull out.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I'm ignoring you.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Pull out, goddamnit!
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Slowing down but not stopping)
dialog: What do you want, Courtney?
text: She pushes him away from her.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: It's a plain end. I think.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Turn the light on.
text: She tries to sit up.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Patrick. Turn on the Light.
text: He turns on the light.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: It's a plain end, see? So?
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Take it off.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip 
text: (She covers herself with her comforter)
dialog: to catch the force of the ejaculate!
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
text: Courtney throws a pillow over her head and starts crying.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: (Screaming)
dialog: Do you think you're turning me on by having unsafe sex?
text: Bateman pulls the pillow off her and slaps her face.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see,
dialog: Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.
text: (He slaps her again lightly)
dialog: Why is it pulled down half an inch?
dialog: So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: (Choking crying)
dialog: Well, it's not a turn-on for me.
dialog: I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
text: Bateman grabs her head and makes her look at the condom.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Oh God, just get it over with.
text: He fucks her quickly until he has a mediocre orgasm and
text: falls down next to her. They lie side by side with their
text: bodies not touching, eyes open, staring at the
dialog: ceiling.
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, PIERCE &amp; PIERCE - DAY
text: Bateman and Luis Carruthers are seated at a long table in
text: the conference room at Pierce &amp; Pierce, which looks out onto
text: a spectacular view of Manhattan.
speaker_heading: CARRUTHERS
dialog: Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney.
dialog: Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a
dialog: reservation there?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Lucky, I guess.
speaker_heading: CARRUTHERS
dialog: That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess,
dialog: Valentino Couture?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: CARRUTHERS
dialog: (Reaching out to touch it)
text: It looks so soft.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Catching Luis hand)
dialog: Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
text: Carruthers is distracted by a question from the colleague
text: on his left.Paul Owen enters, carrying the Wall St. Journal
text: under his arm. He is handsome, supremely confident and
text: self-satisfied; he sees himself as a leader among men.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: (To Bateman)
dialog: Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I've been great. And you?
text: Their conversation fades down as we hear Bateman's
dialog: thoughts.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN (V.O.)
dialog: Owen has mistaken me for this dickhead Marcus Halberstam.
text: It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&amp;P and in
dialog: fact does the same exact thing I do and he also has a
text: penchant for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples glasses.
dialog: Marcus and I even go to the same barber, although I have
text: a slightly better haircut.
text: During this voiceover the CAMERA WANDERS over to MARCUS
text: HALBERSTAM, who is conferring with a colleague in the
text: opposite corner of the room. He bears a
text: superficial resemblance to Bateman.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Nervous)
dialog: It's...it's...all right.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Really? That's interesting.
text: (He stares at Bateman, smiling)
dialog: Not great?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Oh well, you know.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
text: McDermott and Price enter.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Hey. Owen! Congratulations on the Fisher account.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Thank you, Baxter.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Listen, Paul. Squash?
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Call me.
dialog: (Hands him a business card)
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: How about Friday?
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: No can do. Got a res at eight-thirty at Dorsia. Great sea
text: urchin ceviche. There is a stunned silence as he walks away
text: and sits in a corner of the room, ostentatiously studying papers.
text: CLOSE-UP on Bateman's face, cold with hatred.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: (Whispering)
dialog: Jesus. Dorsia? On a Friday night? How'd he swing that?
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT (Whispering)
dialog: I think he's lying.
text: Bateman takes out his wallet and pulls out a card.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: (Suddenly enthused)
dialog: What's that, a gram?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: New card. What do you think?
text: McDermott lifts it up and examines the lettering carefully.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Whoa. Very nice. Take a look.
text: He hands it to Van Patten.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Picked them up from the printers yesterday
speaker_heading: VAN PATTEN
dialog: Good coloring.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: That's bone. And the lettering is something called
dialog: Silian Rail.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: (Envious)
dialog: Silian Rail?
speaker_heading: VAN PATTEN
dialog: It is very cool, Bateman. But that's nothing.
text: He pulls a card out of his wallet and slaps it on the
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: VAN PATTEN
dialog: Look at this.
text: They all lean forward to inspect it.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: That's really nice.
text: Bateman clenches his fists beneath the table, trying to
dialog: control his anxiety.
speaker_heading: VAN PATTEN
text: Eggshell with Romalian type.
dialog: (Turning to Bateman)
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
text: (Barely able to breath, his voice a croak)
dialog: Nice.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: (Holding the card up to the light)
dialog: Jesus. This is really super. How'd a nitwit like you get so
dialog: tasteful?
text: Bateman stares at his own card and then enviously at
dialog: McDermott's.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN (V.O.)
text: I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
text: He holds up his own card.
speaker_heading: PRICE
text: Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Choking with anxiety)
dialog: Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
text: Price pulls a card from an inside coat pocket and holds it
text: up for their inspection: "PAUL OWEN, PIERCE &amp; PIERCE,
text: MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS." Bateman swallows, speechless.
text: The sound in the room dies down and all we hear is a faint
text: heartbeat as Bateman stares at the magnificent card.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN (V.O.)
dialog: Look at that subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness
dialog: of it. Oh my God, it even has a watermark...
text: His hand shaking, Bateman lifts up the card and stares at it
text: until it fills the screen.
text: He lets it fall. The SOUND RETURNS TO NORMAL.
text: CARRUTHERS Is something wrong? Patrick...you're sweating.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET- EVENING
text: The financial district. The streets are eerily deserted.
text: Bateman stands at an ATM, enjoying the reassuring sound of
text: $500 in fresh bills thudding from the machine. As he turns
text: to leave, he notices someone across the street.
text: A HOMELESS MAN is lying in a doorway on top of an open
text: grate, surrounded by bags of garbage and a shopping cart. A
text: cardboard sign is attached to the front of the cart: I AM
text: HOMELESS AND HUNGRY PLEASE HELP ME. A small, thin dog lies
text: next to him.
text: He is black, dressed in a stained, torn, lime-green
text: polyester pants suit with jeans worn over the pants.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Offering his hand) Hello. Pat Bateman.
text: The Homeless Man stares at Bateman, struggling to sit up.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: You want some money?. Some...food?
text: The Homeless Man nods and starts to cry. Bateman reaches
text: into his pocket and pulls out a $I 0 bill, then changes his
text: mind and holds out a $5 instead.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Is this what you need?
text: The Homeless Man nods, looks away, wipes his nose.
speaker_heading: HOMELESS MAN
dialog: I'm so hungry.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: It's cold out, too, isn't it?
speaker_heading: HOMELESS MAN
dialog: I'm so hungry.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
text: (Holding the bill just out of the man's reach)
dialog: Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you
dialog: get a job?
speaker_heading: HOMELESS MAN
dialog: (Shivering and sobbing)
dialog: I lost my job...
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it?
dialog: Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on
dialog: the job?
dialog: HOMELESS MAN I was fired. I was laid off.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Gee, uh, that's too bad.
speaker_heading: HOMELESS MAN
dialog: I'm so hungry.
text: The dog starts to whimper.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
speaker_heading: HOMELESS MAN
dialog: I'm not...
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
speaker_heading: HOMELESS MAN
dialog: I'm hungry
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record.
dialog: I'm trying to help you.
speaker_heading: HOMELESS MAN
dialog: I'm hungry.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who
dialog: do have jobs? From people who do work?
speaker_heading: HOMELESS MAN
dialog: What am I gonna do?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Listen, what's your name?
speaker_heading: HOMELESS MAN
dialog: Al.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Speak up. Come on.
speaker_heading: HOMELESS MAN
dialog: Al.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude.
dialog: That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together.
dialog: I'll help you.
speaker_heading: HOMELESS MAN
dialog: You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind
dialog: man. I can tell.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Petting the dog)
dialog: Shhhh...it's okay.
speaker_heading: HOMELESS MAN
dialog: (Grabbing Bateman's wrist)
dialog: Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
text: (Stroking his face, whispering)
dialog: Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
speaker_heading: HOMELESS MAN
dialog: I can't...I can't find a shelter
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that?
dialog: (Shouting)
dialog: Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of
dialog: faggot. Al...I'm sorry.
text: Bateman carefully puts the money back in his wallet.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: It's just that...I don't know I don't have anything in common
dialog: with you.
text: He opens his briefcase and pulls out a long thin knife with
text: a serrated edge. He pushes up the sleeve of his jacket to
dialog: protect it.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Do you know what a fucking loser ,you are?
text: HOMELESS MAN'S POV as Bateman lunges at him with the knife.
text: EXTREME WIDE SHOT of the street. Bateman's shadowed figure
text: is hunched over the Homeless Man, stabbing him in the stomach.
text: The dog barks wildly and Bateman stomps on it until it is
dialog: silent.
text: LOW ANGLE shot of Bateman as he throws a quarter on the ground.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: There's a quarter. Go buy some gum.
text: Bateman walks calmly into the empty caverns of Wall Street.
text: Cars drift past, their headlights momentarily illuminating the
text: body left twitching on the ground.
scene_heading: INT. BEAUTY SALON - DAY
text: CLOSE-UP on Bateman's face and torso. His eyes are closed as a

speaker_heading: FACIALIST
dialog: What beautiful skin you have, Mr Bateman. So
dialog: fine, so smooth...
text: His eyes open to look up at the facialist and then he
text: closes them again.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN (V.O.)
dialog: I have all the characteristics of a human being- flesh, blood,
text: skin, hair-but not a single clear, identifiable emotion except
dialog: for greed ,und disgust. Something horrible is happening inside
dialog: me and I don't know why.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Bateman sitting in a chair, looking down at the
text: MANICURIST who is giving him a pedicure. She is cutting his
text: nails with tiny sharp scissors. He stares at them longingly.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN (V.O.)
text: My nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days. I feel lethal,
text: on the verge of frenzy.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: MAITRE D'

speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: No, I want to know. I came here for the cilantro
dialog: crawfish gumbo, which is after all the only excuse one
dialog: could have for being in this restaurant, which is by the
dialog: way, almost completely empty. Am I to believe that all ten
dialog: people in this restaurant have eaten your entire supply of
dialog: cilantro crawfish gumbo?
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: I'm very sorry sir. There was a fire in the kitchen
dialog: earlier today, and-
speaker_heading: BATEMAN

speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Would you like to hear-
speaker_heading: OWEN

dialog: This is a real beehive of, uh, activity, Halberstam.
dialog: This place is hot, very hot.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Yeah, well, you're late.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break
text: (Studying the menu; he's in a surprisingly good mood)
dialog: Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Nobody goes there anymore.
text: There is a long disgruntled silence.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Is that Ivana Trump over there? (Laughs) Jeez
dialog: Patrick I mean Marcus, what are you thinking? Why would Ivana
dialog: be at Texarkana?
dialog: Another pause.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the
dialog: Fisher account? How did you get it?
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have
dialog: to kill you.
text: He guffaws. Bateman laughs politely.
speaker_heading: LATER:
text: Paul Owen is very drunk. BATEMAN cold sober.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane?
text: Owen continues laughing and motions to the waiter for another
dialog: drink.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Great tan, Marcus. Really impressive. Where do you tan?
text: BATEMAN Salon.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: I've got a tanning bed at home. You should look into it.
text: Bateman nods, agitated.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Cecelia is, well...you know (Cecelia. I think
text: she's having dinner with...Evelyn Williams.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick
dialog: Bateman. What a dork.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Another Martini, Paul?
text: Owen nods drunkenly.
speaker_heading: LATER:
text: The end of the meal. Owen is squeezing a lime onto the
text: table, missing his beer, incredibly drunk. The check is laid
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Talking to Owen like a child)
dialog: Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy.
text: Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave
dialog: a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: No, man. I'm gonna bail.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.
dialog: (Helping him into his jacket)
dialog: I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a
text: bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
scene_heading: INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: The living room floor has been meticulously covered with
dialog: newspaper.
text: Owen is slumped drunkenly in a white Eames chair, a glass
text: in his hand. Bateman is looking through his CDs.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: You like Huey Lewis and the News?
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: They're okay.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Their early work was a little too New Wave for my
dialog: taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really
dialog: came into their own, commercially and artistically.
text: Bateman walks to his bathroom, taking a large ax out of the
text: shower. He takes two Valium.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Said partly from the bathroom)
text: The whole album has a clear, crisp sound and a new sheen of
text: consummate professionalism that gives the songs a big boost.
text: Bateman comes back out and leans the ax against the wall.
text: He walks to the foyer and puts on a raincoat, watching Owen
text: from behind ail the time.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: He's been compared to ELvis Costello but I think
text: Huey has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor.
text: Owen is absent-mindedly leafing through the Barneys
dialog: catalogue.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Hey, Halberstam?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Yes, Owen?
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Why are there copies of the Style section all over
dialog: the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: No, Owen.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: (Confused)
dialog: Is that a raincoat?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Yes, it is.
text: Bateman moves to the CD player. He takes a CD out of its
text: case and slides it in the machine.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: In 1987 Huey released this, Fore!, their most
dialog: accomplished album. I think I heir undisputed masterpiece is
text: "HiP To Be Square," a song so catchy that most people probably
dialog: don't listen to the lyrics. But they should because it's not
dialog: just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of
dialog: trends. It's al~ a personal statement about the band itself.
text: Bateman puts on "Hip To Be Square."
text: BATEMAN crosses the room and picks up the ax.
text: We follow BATEMAN from behind as he walks up to Owen, the
text: ax raised over his head.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Hey, Paul?
text: As Owen turns around, FROM OWEN'S POV we see Bateman swing
text: the ax toward his face.
text: Blood sprays onto the white raincoat.
text: FROM BEHIND OWEN, we see BATEMAN as he yanks the ax out.
text: Owen drops to the floor. His body falls out of the frame.
text: We stay on his legs twitching mechanically.
text: Blood pulses onto the newspaper-covered floor.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Raising the ax and screaming)
dialog: Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now, you fucking
dialog: stupid bastard!
text: LOW ANGLE ON BATEMAN as he beats Owen with the back of the
dialog: ax.
text: OFFSCREEN, the sound of the ax hitting Owen.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Panting)
dialog: Fucking bastard...
text: Bateman takes his raincoat off, still panting. He folds the
text: coat carefully in half, bloody side in, and drapes it neatly
text: over the back of a chair.
text: He sits back on the white sofa and surveys the scene. He
text: checks his Rolex and lights a cigar.
text: OFFSCREEN, Paul Owen's last faint sighs are heard.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY - NIGHT
text: BATEMAN drags a large, blood-soaked sleeping bag through the lobby,
text: past the bored doorman, who looks up from the Post for a moment.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: BATEMAN is trying to hail a cab. Owen's body is at his
text: feet. Luis Carruthers and a Japanese girl walk up to him.
speaker_heading: CARRUTHERS
dialog: Patrick? Is that you?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
speaker_heading: CARRUTHERS
dialog: This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good
dialog: friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to
text: Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.
dialog: (Looking down at the body)
dialog: Where did you get your overnight bag?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Commes des Garcon.
text: A cab stops. BATEMAN opens the door and manages to get
text: Owen's body into the backseat.
text: Bateman gets into the cab.
speaker_heading: CARRUTHERS
dialog: Call me please, Patrick.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Jesus lives, Luis.
scene_heading: INT. BATEMAN'S HELL'S KITCHEN APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: A bare room, lit by one light bulb. The walls are blank
text: except for a Les Miserables poster. There is one ratty chair.
text: Bateman pours lime over Paul Owen's body, which is lying in
text: a bathtub. He plays Huey Lewis, smokes a cigar, watches the
text: body dissolve.
scene_heading: INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Bateman is letting himself into the apartment. It is very
text: similar to Bateman's, but even more minimalist. The walls
text: are white-pigmented concrete with a large minimalist painting
text: on the wall. One wall is covered in a trendy, large-scale
text: scientific drawing above a long, black leather couch.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Where to send the bastard? Dallas? Pans?
text: He throws some clothes into a suitcase, randomly grabbing
text: toiletries and shoving them in.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Singapore? London. I'll send the asshole to London.
text: He puts some music on to help muffle his voice, then leans
text: over the answering machine.
text: He does a passable imitation of Owen's speech.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Hi, this is Paul. I've been called away to London
dialog: for a few days. Meredith, I'll call you when I get back.
dialog: Hasta la vista, baby.
scene_heading: INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - MORNING
text: Bateman is sitting at his desk, with the latest copy of
text: Sports Illustrated in front of him and his Walkman playing
text: Kenny G. We hear the MUSIC until Jean enters and he takes
text: the Walkman off.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Faintly irritable)
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Patrick?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Condescendingly)
dialog: Ye-es, Je-an?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Detective Donald KIMBALL?
text: Silence. Bateman stares out the window, then down at the
text: drawing of a headless woman he's been doodling on the back
dialog: cover of Sports Illustrated.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Tell him I'm at lunch.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Patrick, I think he knows you're here.
text: It's only ten-thirty.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
text: Send him in, I guess. As she exits, he picks up the cordless
text: phone and pretends to talk to someone at the other end.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Now, John, you've got to wear clothes in proportion
dialog: to your physique. There are definite do's and don'ts, good
text: buddy, of wearing a bold-striped shirt. A hold-striped shirt
text: calls for solid-colored or discreetly patterned suits and ties...
text: The door to the office opens and he waves in DETECTIVE DONALD
text: KIMBALL. KIMBALL is surprisingly young - about Bateman's age -
text: and good-looking, dressed in a crumpled linen Armani suit of
text: the type Bateman and his friends might wear.
text: Kimball sits down and crosses his legs with a
text: self-assurance that makes Bateman so nervous he forgets to
text: carry on with his fake conversation. Kimball looks up at
text: him curiously, noticing the silence.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
text: (Realizing that Kimball is staring at him)
dialog: Right. And yes...always tip the stylist fifteen percent.
text: Bateman shrugs at the detective, rolling his eyes in
text: exasperation.
text: KIMBALL nods understandingly.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just
dialog: walked in...
dialog: (He laughs inanely)
dialog: Just joking...
dialog: (Pause)
dialog: No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John,
dialog: right, got it.
text: (He hangs up the phone and pushes the antenna in)
dialog: Sorry about that.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.
text: (Gesturing toward the phone)
dialog: Was that anything important?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Oh that? Just mulling over business problems.
dialog: Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors...
text: Spreading gossip.
text: They laugh politely.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: (Holding out his hand)
dialog: Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Shaking firmly)
dialog: Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed
dialog: to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well,
dialog: you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get.
text: KIMBALL stares at the three open copies of Sports
text: Illustrated and the Sony Walkman lying on Bateman's desk.
text: Bateman sees the look and sweeps the magazines
text: into the top drawer along with the Walkman, which is
text: still running.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Forcing himself to sound friendly and relaxed)
dialog: So, what's the topic of discussion?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate
dialog: the disappearance of Paul Owen.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: So it's nothing that official. I just have some
dialog: basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Coffee?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: No. I'm okay.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Perrier? San Pellegrino?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: No, I'm okay.
text: KIMBALL takes out a small black notepad and the same gold
text: Cross pen that Bateman and his friends all use. Bateman buzzes
dialog: Jean.
speaker_heading: JEAN (O.S.)
dialog: Patrick?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Can you bring Mr...
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
speaker_heading: KIMBALL.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Oh no, I'm okay.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: It's no problem
text: Bateman watches intently as KIMBALL writes something down
text: in his notebook, then crosses something out. Jean enters
text: and places the bottle of San Pellegrino and a Steuben etched
text: glass on the table, shooting a concerned glance at Bateman.
text: He glares at her. KIMBALL smiles and nods at Jean as she leaves.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Well, what's the topic of discussion?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: The disappearance of Paul Owen.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the
dialog: disappearance or anything...
dialog: (Trying to laugh)
text: Not on "Page Six" at least.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: I think his family wants this kept quiet.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Understandable.
text: (Staring at the untouched bottle of San Pellegrino)
dialog: Lime?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: No, really. I'm okay.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: You sure? I can always get you a lime.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own
dialog: files, okay?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Shoot.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: How old are you?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: (Scribbling in his notebook)
dialog: Where did you go to school?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Your address?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
text: Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American
dialog: Gardens Building.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: (Looking up, impressed)
dialog: Nice. Very nice.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Flattered)
dialog: Thanks.
text: A pause as KIMBALL studies his notebook. Bateman closes his
text: eyes, as if in pain.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Pardon me, but are you okay?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Who do you ask?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: You seem...nervous.
text: Bateman reaches into his desk drawer and brings out a
text: bottle of aspirin.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Nuprin?
dialog: KIMBALL Uh...no, thanks.
text: Kimball takes out a pack of Marlboro's and lays it on the
dialog: desk.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Bad habit.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: I know. I'm sorry.
text: A pause, as Bateman stares at the cigarettes.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Would you rather I not smoke?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: No, I guess it's okay.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: No problem.
dialog: (Buzzing Jean)
speaker_heading: JEAN (O.S.)
dialog: Yes, Patrick?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please.
text: She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Well...
text: He coughs, shakes two Nuprin into his hand and swallows
dialog: them dry.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: How well did you know him?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing,
dialog: you know.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Yale thing?
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Yeah...Yale thing.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: What do you mean...Yale thing?
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Well, I think for one that he was probably a closet
dialog: homosexual. Who did a lot of cocaine...that Yale thing.
text: A silence during which the sound of the air conditioner
text: becomes deafening.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul
dialog: Owen?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He...
dialog: ate a balanced diet.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: What kind of man was he? Besides...
text: (He hesitates tries to smile)
dialog: the information you've just given.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Do you feel that way?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: No. Not really.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: (As he writes without looking up)
dialog: Where did Paul hang out?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Hang...out?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Yeah. You know...hang out.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine.
text: Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular
dialog: places.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: He had a yacht?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: No, he just hung out there.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: And where did he go to school?
text: A slight pause.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Don't you know this?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: I just wanted to know if you know.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's...
dialog: Listen, I just...I just want to help.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: I understand.
text: He makes another note.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: We were both seven in 1969.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: (Smiles)
dialog: So was I.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
text: Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he
dialog: went to London.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Well, maybe he did, huh?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
text: His girlfriend doesn't think so.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: But...has anyone seen him in London?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Actually, yes.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Hmmm.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification.
text: A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but
dialog: I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert
dialog: Ainsworth for Paul, so...
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan
dialog: worship?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I
dialog: know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't
dialog: know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was
text: recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano
text: girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced
dialog: diet and-
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.
text: A pause - the longest so far.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Have you consulted a psychic?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Had his apartment been burglarized?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
text: No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A
dialog: suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet
dialog: or anything, right?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But...
dialog: basically no one has seen or heard anything.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: That's so typical, isn't it?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: It's just strange.
text: (He stares out the window, lost in thought)
text: One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive,
dialog: and then...
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: People just...disappear.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
text: The earth just opens up and swallows people.
dialog: (He checks his Rolex)
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
text: Eerie. Really eerie.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Standing up)
dialog: You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting
text: with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I
dialog: mean aren't you going to be late?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Uh, no. There's one...down here.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Oh really? I didn't know that.
text: Bateman leads him to the door.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Yes. It's very good.
text: KIMBALL turns to face him.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information
dialog: at all...
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.
text: Bateman closes the door firmly on KIMBALL. He closes his
text: eyes and leans against the door, sweating.
scene_heading: INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON
text: A perfectly lit kitchen still-life - a bottle of Evian,
text: a white porcelain plate on which sits a sliced kiwi, some perfect
text: green grapes, a few berries.
text: OFFSCREEN, the SOUND OF SCREAMS AND A CHAINSAW can be heard
text: from the living room.
text: The living room: Bateman is maniacally doing abdominal
text: crunches as the television plays a video of Texas Chainsaw
text: Massacre. There is a pile of horror videos on his coffee table,
text: next to a copy of GQ.
speaker_heading: LATER:
text: Bateman is sitting in his armchair, phone book in hand,
text: jerking off. He is squealing into the phone and breathing.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: You like that, slut?
text: The person on the other end clearly hangs up.
text: CLOSE-UP on his fingers dialing the phone.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: You want to know what I'm wearing? Sixty-dollar
text: boxer shorts by Ralph Lauren, a hundred-and-fifty-dollar white
dialog: cotton T-shirt by
dialog: Commes des Garcons.
text: (He snorts like a pig)
dialog: My Rolex cost-
text: Another hang-up. He dials again.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Whipering)
dialog: I'm a corporate raider. I orchestrate hostile takeovers. What do
dialog: you think of that?
dialog: (Makes disgusting sucking noises and grunts)
dialog: Huh, bitch?
speaker_heading: GIRL (O.S.)
dialog: Dad, is that you?
text: Bateman hangs up, frustrated.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
text: Bateman cruises around in the limo. It pulls up alongside
text: CHRISTIE, a pretty blonde hooker in shorts and leather jacket.
text: Bateman opens his window to speak to her.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I haven't seen you around here.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIE
dialog: You just haven't been looking.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Would you like to see my apartment?
text: Bateman flips on the light inside the limo. He's wearing a
text: tuxedo.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIE
dialog: (looking away to some dark corner)
dialog: I'm not supposed to.
text: Bateman is holding out a $100 bill, which Christie now
text: notices, then takes.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
speaker_heading: CHRISTIE
dialog: I'm not supposed to.
dialog: (She pockets the bill)
dialog: But I can make an exception.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Do you take American Express?
text: Christie is still looking out behind her.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Do you take American Express?
text: Christie looks at him like he's crazy.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I'm joking. Come on, get in.
text: As they drive uptown, Bateman dials the cell-phone. He
text: reads off a credit card number.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I'd like a girl, early twenties, blonde, who does
text: couples. Couples. Fifty-five West Eighty-First, the
dialog: American Gardens Building. Apartment 7C. And I really
dialog: can't stress blonde enough. Blonde.
text: He hangs up.
dialog: BATEMAN I'm Paul. My name is Paul 0wen, have you'got that?
dialog: You are Christie. You are to respond only to Christie. Is
dialog: that clear?
scene_heading: INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Christie is in the bathtub, Bateman is pouring in white
text: milky bath oil.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: That's a very fine Chardonnay you're drinking.
text: Long pause, in which Christie is luxuriating in the tub and
text: Bateman is casually touching her breast.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I want you to clean your vagina.
text: Christie reaches for a washcloth.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: No. From behind. Get on your knees.
text: Christie shrugs.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I want to watch. You have a very nice body.
text: The doorman RINGS. Bateman answers.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Thank you. Send her up. Christie, get out and dry
dialog: off, choose a robe-not the Bijan and come and meet me and
text: our guest in the living room for drinks.
text: Bateman answers the door.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: You've arrived! How lovely, let me take your coat.
dialog: I'm Paul. How good of you to come.
text: The escort girl looks somewhat bewildered. Bateman takes
text: her coat and inspects her body and face.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Not quite blonde, are you? More dirty blonde. I'm
dialog: going to call you Sabrina. I'm Paul Owen.
text: Bateman escorts her into the living room and brings her a
text: glass of wine. Christie enters, sitting next to Sabrina on the
text: couch, and Bateman sits across from them. There is a
text: long silence.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: So, don't you want to know what I do?
text: The two girls look at each other with uncomfortable smiles.
text: Christie shrugs.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: No, not really.
text: Bateman is visibly irritated, recrosses his legs.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Well, I work on Wall Street. At Pierce &amp; Pierce.
dialog: (Long pause)
dialog: Have you heard of it?
text: Another long pause. They shake their heads. Christie stands
text: up and goes over to the CD collection.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIE
dialog: You have a really nice place here...Paul.
dialog: How much did you pay for it?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Actually, that's none of your business, Christie,
dialog: hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
text: Bateman leaves to refill his wine glass and Sabrina takes a
text: pack of cigarettes out of her purse.
text: Bateman returns, carrying a tray of chocolates.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: No, no smoking. Not in here.
text: He walks over to Christie.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Varda truffle?
text: Christie stares at the plate and shakes her head. Sabrina
dialog: takes one.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I don't want you to get drunk, but that's a very
dialog: fine Chardonnay you're not drinking.
text: Bateman goes over to his CDs and scans his vast collection.
text: He takes one out and examines it.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis
dialog: fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before
dialog: that I really didn't understand any of their work. It was too
dialog: artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins'
text: presence became more apparent. He puts aside the CD and takes out
dialog: another one.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I think "Invisible Touch" is the group's undisputed
dialog: masterpiece.
text: He puts on the song and gestures for them to follow him
text: into the bedroom.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
text: It's an epic meditation on intangibility, at the
text: same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding
text: three albums. Christie, take off the robe.
text: Bateman puts out a lace teddy. He motions to Christie to
dialog: put it on.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks,
dialog: Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance
dialog: of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress.
text: Bateman starts to undress.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: In terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer
text: songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism.
dialog: Sabrina, why don't you dance a little?
text: Sabrina dances awkwardly. Christie sits on the bed.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Take the lyrics to "Land of Confusion." In this
text: song, Phil Collins addresses the problem of abusive political
dialog: authority.
text: Bateman knots a silk scarf around Christie's neck - rather
text: menacingly - then helps her into some suede gloves.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
text: "In Too Deep" is the most moving pop song of the 1980s about
text: monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting.
text: Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything
dialog: I've heard in rock.
text: He turns on the video camera.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Christie, get down on your knees, so Sabrina can see your
dialog: asshole.
text: Bateman looks through the viewfinder.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
text: Phill Collins solo efforts seem to be more commercial and
dialog: therefore more satisfying in a narrower way, especially
dialog: songs like "In the Air Tonight" and "Against
dialog: All Odds." Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it.
text: He walks over to the sound system in his bedroom and slides in
dialog: the CD.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: But I also think that Phill Collins works better
text: within the confines of the group than as a solo artist-and
dialog: I stress the word artist. This is "Sussudio," a great,
dialog: great song, a personal favorite.
text: SEX MONTAGE CUT TO "Sussudio." We see this in WIDE SHOT, or
text: through the LENS OF THE VIDEO CAMERA.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Bateman asleep in his bed with Christie and Sabrina
text: on either side of him. Sabrina accidentally touches his
text: wrist. Bateman's eyes open.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Don't touch the Rolex.
text: Bateman gets up from his bed and goes over to his armoire.
text: He opens the drawer in which are a nail gun, a coat hanger,
text: a rusty butter knife and a half-smoked cigar. He turns
text: around to see Christie and Sabrina both starting to get up
text: and get dressed. He takes the coat hanger.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: We're not through yet...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Bateman ushering them out the door impatiently. They
text: are both sobbing, badly bruised and bleeding. Bateman has a
text: deep scratch on his hand and one on his shoulder. In the
text: b.g. Phil Collins' "In the Air Tonight" is playing.
scene_heading: INT. YALE CLUB  DAY
dialog: 
text: McDermott, Van Patten and Bateman are
text: having drinks. Price walks by with a gorgeous girl and
dialog: gives them the finger.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: What an asshole.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Why is Laurie Kennedy dating Price? He's a
dialog: fucking drug addict. No self-control.
speaker_heading: VAN PATTEN
dialog: But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do
dialog: you think, Bateman?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I know her. I knew her.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Why do you say it like that? Why does he say it
dialog: like that?
speaker_heading: VAN PATTEN
dialog: Because he dated her.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: How did you guess?
speaker_heading: VAN PATTEN
dialog: Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ,
dialog: Bateman.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy
dialog: personality.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: So what? It's all looks. Laurie Kennedy is a
dialog: babe. Don't even pretend you were interested for any other
dialog: reason.
speaker_heading: VAN PATTEN
dialog: If they have a good personality, then something
dialog: is very wrong.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: If they have a good personality and they are not
dialog: great looking-who fucking cares?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Well, let's just say hypothetically, okay? What if
dialog: they have a good personality?
dialog: (He smiles giving up)
dialog: I know, I know-
speaker_heading: ALL IN UNISON
dialog: There are no girls with good personalities!
text: (They laugh and high-five each other)
speaker_heading: VAN PATTEN
text: A good personality consists of a chick with a
dialog: little hardbody who will satisfy all sexual demands without
dialog: being too slutty about things and who will essentially keep
dialog: her dumb fucking mouth
dialog: shut.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Listen, the only girls with good personalities who are
dialog: smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or even
dialog: talented-though God knows what the fuck that means-are ugly
text: chicks.
speaker_heading: VAN PATTEN
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: And this is because they have to make up for how
dialog: fucking unattractive they are.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
speaker_heading: VAN PATTEN
dialog: Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was
dialog: an interesting guy.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: So what did Ed say?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: He said, "When I see a pretty girl walking down the
dialog: street I think two things. One part of me wants to take her
dialog: out and talk to her and be real nice and sweet and treat
dialog: her right."
text: Pauses, finishes his drink.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: What does the other part of him think?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
text: What her head would look like on a stick.
text: McDermott and Van Patten look at each other and then back
text: at Bateman. Bateman starts to laugh, and the other two uneasily
dialog: join In.
text: Luis Carruthers walks up to the table.
speaker_heading: CARRUTHERS
dialog: (Shyly)
dialog: Hi, guys. I wanna get your opinion on something.
text: McDermott rolls his eyes at the rest of the table.
dialog: McDERMOTT If it's about the bow-tie you're wearing, you
text: know how we feel about it. Luis laughs good-naturedly.
speaker_heading: CARRUTHERS
dialog: Yes, I do. No, it's my business card-I decided to
dialog: get a new one too.
text: He pulls out something incredibly tasteful. Everyone
text: compliments Luis except Bateman. The SOUND DROPS and all we hear
text: is the beating of his heart as he stares at the card enviously.
text: Luis plucks it from his hand and walks away, pleased with
dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: VAN PATTEN
dialog: Listen, what about dinner?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Suddenly angry)
dialog: Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about
dialog: fucking dinner?"
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Ah, cheer up, Bateman.
text: (Slaps him on the back, massages his neck)
dialog: What's the matter? No shiatsu this morning?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
text: (Watching Luis going into the men's room)
dialog: Keep touching me like that and you'll draw back a stump.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Whoa, hold on there, little buddy.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Excuse me.
text: He gets up from the table. As Bateman walks away, Van
text: Patten grabs a waiter.
speaker_heading: VAN PATTEN
dialog: Is this tap water? I don't drink tap water Bring
dialog: me an Evian or something, okay?
scene_heading: INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY
text: Bateman pulls on his gloves as he
text: enters the men's room. Carruthers is standing in a stall with his
text: back to Bateman. The sound of his urinating is heard until Bateman
text: approaches, then abruptly stops. Slowly, Bateman brings his hands
text: up over the collar of Carruthers' cashmere jacket, circling his
text: neck until both thumbs and index fingers meet. All we can hear
text: is the sound of Bateman's heavy breathing. Slowly he starts to
text: squeeze. Almost in slow motion, Carruthers turns around.
text: Carruthers looks down at Bateman's wrists as if lost in
text: thought. Then he lowers his head and kisses Bateman's
text: wrist. He looks back at Bateman with a shy, love-struck
text: expression, then reaches up and tenderly touches the side
text: of his face.
speaker_heading: CARRUTHERS
dialog: God, Patrick. Why here?
text: He strokes Bateman's hair.
speaker_heading: CARRUTHERS
dialog: I've seen you looking at me. I've noticed your hot body.
text: Carruthers tries to kiss him on the lips but Bateman backs
text: away. He drops his hands from Carruthers' neck. Carruthers
text: immediately takes them and places them back. Bateman drops
dialog: them again.
speaker_heading: CARRUTHERS
dialog: Don't be shy.
text: Bateman takes a deep breath, closes his eyes and tries to lift
text: his hands again, but abandons the attempt.
speaker_heading: CARRUTHERS
dialog: You don't know how long I've wanted it. Ever since that Christmas
dialog: party at Arizona 206. You know the one, you were wearing that
text: red-striped paisley Armani tie.
text: Bateman looks down and sees that Carruthers' pants are
text: still unzipped. He moves past him out of the stall and
text: stands by the sink and pretends to wash his hands until he
text: realizes he still has his gloves on. Carruthers comes up
text: behind him.
speaker_heading: CARRUTHERS
dialog: I want you. I want you...too.
text: Bateman storms out of the men's room, bumping into a waiter
text: and several customers and cursing. Noticing the maitre d'
text: and another waiter conferring and looking at him strangely,
text: Bateman straightens up and smiles and waves cheerfully at
text: them. Carruthers walks up behind him.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Hissing)
dialog: What...is...it?
speaker_heading: CARRUTHERS
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Stumbling away from him)
dialog: I've gotta...I've
dialog: gotta...return some videotapes.
speaker_heading: CARRUTHERS
dialog: Patrick?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CARRUTHERS
dialog: (Silently mouthing the words)
dialog: I'll call you.
text: Bateman storms out of the restaurant.
scene_heading: INT. COURTNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Bateman is lying on top of Courtney in her bed, after sex.
text: Still panting, he rolls off her, onto his back. He feels
text: something lumpy underneath him and pulls out a stuffed toy,
text: a black cat with blue jewel eyes. There is silence.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Maybe.
text: Courtney sighs and reaches for a bottle of pills on her
text: nightstand, swallowing several. Bateman gets up and begins
text: to dress, admiring himself in the mirror. Courtney watches
text: the TV at low volume.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: What are you doing tonight?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: That's nice.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: You and...Luis?
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: (Lighting a cigarette)
dialog: We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and
dialog: Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I never knew you smoked.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: (Smiling sadly)
dialog: You never noticed.
text: Bateman is making final adjustments to his tie.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're
dialog: going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: (Sarcastically)
dialog: Isn't that special?
dialog: (A pause)
dialog: Patrick?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Yes, Courtney?
speaker_heading: C0URTNEY
dialog: If I don't see you before Thanksgiving, have a nice one, okay?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Flatly)
dialog: You too.
text: Courtney picks up the black cat and starts petting its
text: head. Bateman heads down the hallway to the front door.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Patrick?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Nothing.
scene_heading: INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
text: A big eighties nightclub with a mixed crowd: hip-hop

text: I Bateman makes his way through the crowd to the bar, and
text: tries to attract the bartender's attention. He is wearing a
text: suit and his tie is loosened. Kimball approaches him.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Mr. Bateman?

speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Detective Kendall...uh Campbell?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Kimball.

speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Don.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: So...you hang out here a lot?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You
dialog: know.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: How's the investigation going? Taken anyone
dialog: in for "formal questioning?" (He makes quotation marks
text: in the air and laughs a not-so-relaxed laugh)
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: 0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: (Looking at his glass)
dialog: Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much
text: more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting,
dialog: don't you think?
text: Bateman is nodding nervously, idiotically.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Some people just can t help themselves. Another Stoli?
text: Bateman shakes his head.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: I mean they want to get caught.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need
dialog: anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean
dialog: Owen was a...complex man.
text: Bateman wanders away.
text: He looks back uneasily at KIMBALL, who is watching him from
text: the bar. A GUY WITH DREADLOCKS walks by.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
text: (Holding up his hand to high-five) Rasta Man!
text: The man stares at him.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I mean-Mon. We be jammin'...
text: The man walks by, shaking his head.
text: Bateman wanders into the next room, which is filled with a
text: more familiar crowd: young men in designer suits, girls in
text: black designer dresses. Across the room he spots McDermott
text: and Price sitting with three models, all wearing black
text: mini-dresses. Price and McDermott are having a whispered
dialog: argument.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I have to talk to these girls? They're models.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
text: Someone has to get the Bolivian marching powder.
dialog: You went last time. Stay here.
text: McDermott waves gaily to the girls and disappears.
text: Bateman looks at the models. DAISY and CARON are staring
text: into space, smoking. LIBBY is trying to work out how to
text: unfold her napkin. Price signals to Bateman for help.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: (Clapping his hands together)
dialog: Let's have a conversation. So...it was hot out today, no?
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: LIBBY
dialog: Where did Craig go?
speaker_heading: PRICE
text: Well, Gorbachev is downstairs. McDermott is going to
dialog: sign a peace treaty with him between the United States
dialog: and Russia. McDermott's the one behind glasnost, you know.
speaker_heading: LIBBY
dialog: Well...yeah. But he told me he was in mergers and acquisitions.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: You're not confused, are you?
speaker_heading: LIBBY
dialog: No, not really.
speaker_heading: CARON
text: Gorbachev's not downstairs.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: Are you Iying?
speaker_heading: PRICE
text: Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's
dialog: at Tunnel.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (To Daisy)
dialog: Ask me a question.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: So, what do you do?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: What do you think I do?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: A model? An actor?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
text: No. Flattering, but no.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Well...

speaker_heading: DAISY (Unfazed)
dialog: Do you like it?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Welt...it depends, why?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and

dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: So, where do you work out?
scene_heading: MUCH LATER IN THE EVENING:
text: The club is half-empty now. Price is leaning over a
text: balcony, messed-up on drugs. Bateman comes up behind him
text: in a menacing way that suggests he might push him over
text: the railing. Price turns around, wild-eyed, just as Bateman
text: is reaching for him.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: (Shouting)
dialog: I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Leaving what?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: This.
text: Bateman is confused, he thinks Price is referring to his
dialog: drink.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Don't, I'll drink it.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: (Screaming)
dialog: Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Don't tell me...merchant banking?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm
dialog: disappearing.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?
text: Price looks away.
text: McDermott and Daisy walk up to them.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Hey-don't worry, be happy.
text: Price lifts his arms up as if greeting the crowd and is
text: shouting something that can't be heard, then
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Goodbye! Fuckheads!
text: He climbs over the railing.
dialog: DAISY What is he doing?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Price! Come back!
text: Price leaps from the balcony. He disappears for a moment
text: then resurfaces and runs off into the crowd.
scene_heading: EXT. CLUB - NIGHT
text: Bateman and Daisy are waiting for a cab.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: My ex-boyfriend, Fiddler, who was in there, he plays

dialog: what I was doing with a yuppie.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Oh really?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: He said...
dialog: (She laughs)
dialog: He said you gave him bad vibes.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: That's...that's too bad.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: You think I'm dumb, don't you?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (insincerely) No. I really don't.
speaker_heading: DAISY

scene_heading: INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Bateman sits at his desk wearing Wayfarers doing the New York

text: a folder in her hand. Bateman ignores her.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Doin' the crossword?
text: Bateman nods without looking up.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Need help?
text: BATEMAN doesn't respond. We see that every space on the

text: drops the folder on his desk and then walks out.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Jean?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (Re-enters office)
dialog: Yes, Patrick?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN

speaker_heading: BATEMAN

dialog: Well, isn't this a coincidence.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Listen, where should we go?
text: He leans back and pulls a Zagat's from the desk drawer.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Anywhere you want?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Let's not think about what I want. How about
dialog: anywhere you want.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: No, come on. Anywhere you want.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Oh, I can't.

dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN

speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.

speaker_heading: MAITRE D'
text: There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is

speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: See you then.

text: desk, confused.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Yes? You're dressed...okay.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: You didn't give them a name.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: They know me.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Why don't you meet me at my house at seven o'clock

speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Jean? Sorbet?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
text: Bateman walks in with a bottle of wine and a corkscrew in

text: Jean is eating the sorbet.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Want a bite?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I'm on a diet. But thank you.
speaker_heading: JEAN

speaker_heading: BATEMAN
text: (Weighing the corkscrew examining the point for sharpness)
dialog: You can always he thinner. Look...better.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't

speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling
dialog: it anyway.
text: Silence, as Bateman walks around his apartment, opens up
text: his knife drawer, looking at the knives.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: So listen, what do you really want to do with your
dialog: life?
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: And don't tell me you enjoy working with children,

speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school,
dialog: but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life
dialog: where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so...

speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused

dialog: was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Who's Ted Bundy?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Forget it.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for...
text: taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the
dialog: nail gun.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
text: Jean puts her spoon down on the table.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
text: (Looking up from loading nails into the gun)
dialog: What...No! Put it in the carton.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Sorry.
text: (She puts the spoon in the carton)
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Jean? What?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
text: From behind, we follow Bateman as he walks across the room and
text: stands behind the couch.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just
dialog: want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Hmmmm.
text: He points the nail gun at the back of Jean's head.
text: The phone RINGS. Startled, Bateman hides the nail gun
text: behind his back. The answering machine picks up. As Bateman
text: listens he discreetly places the nail gun behind the couch.
text: He sits down opposite Jean, enjoying her discomfort as she
text: listens to the message.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Patrick I know you're there. Pick up the phone, you bad boy.
dialog: What are you up to tonight? It's me. Don't try to hide. I hope
dialog: you're not out with some little number you picked up because
dialog: you're my Mr. Bateman. My boy next door. Anyway you never
dialog: called me and you said you would and I'll leave a message for
dialog: Jean about this too to remind you but we're having dinner with
dialog: Melania and Taylor-you know Melania, she went to Sweet Briar,
dialog: auld Taylor, he went to Cornell-and we're meeting at the Cornell
dialog: Club, so l'll call you tomorrow morning probably-bye, honey-oopps!
dialog: You hate that. Bye Mr. Big Time CEO Patrick. Bye. Bye.
text: Silence. Jean is obviously embarrassed and upset.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Was that...Evelyn?
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Are you still seeing her?
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I'm sorry, I have no right to ask that.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Do you want me to go?
text: A long pause.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get
dialog: involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you
dialog: want me to go?
text: Another long pause.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I
dialog: think I might hurt you.
dialog: (Almost hopefully)
dialog: You don't want to get hurt, do you?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised.
dialog: You're right, I should go.
text: She gets up to leave.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with
text: Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.
text: He sinks back on the sofa and shuts his eyes.
scene_heading: INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Bateman enters P&amp;P, walks up the corridor and pauses outside
text: the door to his office. He sees KIMBALL in conversation with
text: Jean, and Jean looking through her date book. He watches for
text: a moment, frozen with anxiety. He then bursts in, shutting
text: the door behind him.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Kimball-I've been wanting to talk with you, Come
dialog: into my office. Jean, great jacket. Matsuda?
text: Jean looks flustered.
text: Kimball follows Bateman into his office.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's
text: taken a leave of absence.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.
dialog: (Hopefully)
dialog: Is he a suspect?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Not really.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Do you remember where you were on the night of
dialog: Paul's disappearance?
dialog: (He checks his notebook)
dialog: Which was on the twentieth of December?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: God...I guess...I was probably returning
dialog: videotapes.
text: He opens his desk drawer and pretends to search through his
dialog: diary.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Wait. That's not what I've got.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: That's not the information I've received.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Well...I...Wait...What information have
dialog: you received?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Let's see...
text: (He flips through his notebook)
dialog: That you were with-
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Well, I could he wrong.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Clearly nervous and under pressure)
dialog: We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It
dialog: was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner
text: at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I
dialog: physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't
dialog: remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.
text: Kimball is clearly giving up on Bateman for now. He opens
text: his briefcase to put away his notebook.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long
text: day-a bit scattered.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch
dialog: in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Great, yes, I'd like that.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: And if you could try and pin down where you were
dialog: the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a
dialog: lot easier.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
text: Kimball is rifling through his briefcase. He pulls out a
text: new shrink wrapped CD and holds it up.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Huey Lewis and the News. Great stuff. Heard it? I
dialog: just bought it on my way here.
text: Bateman stares at the CD - stunned, terrified.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Never. I mean...I don't really like...
dialog: singers.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Not a big music fan, eh?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too...
dialog: black sounding. For me.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll
dialog: call your secretary about reservations.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I'll be there.
scene_heading: EXT. MEAT PACKING DISTRICT/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
text: The same street corner where Bateman found Christie before.
text: The limo is kept idling as he talks to her through a
text: half-opened window.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIE
dialog: I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after
dialog: last time...
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIE
dialog: I don't think so.
text: He hands her a $500 bill.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute.
dialog: The driver's here, you'll be safe.
text: Christie gets in hesitantly.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Nothing like last time, promise.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIE
dialog: Alright.
text: He pours her a shot of vodka and makes her drink it.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
text: (Chatting as if they were at a cocktail party)
dialog: So, you're looking great, how have you been?
speaker_heading: CHRISTIE
dialog: (A little confused)
dialog: Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Mock shock)
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: CHRISTIE
dialog: My friend told me I should maybe even get a
dialog: lawyer.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.
text: He writes her a check for $I ,000 to cash and hands it to
text: her. She snatches the check out of his hand and gets
text: quickly out of the limo, walking hurriedly down the street.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Bitch.
text: He follows alongside her slowly in the limo, waving a huge
text: wad of cash at her. She hesitates; he uses the money to
text: lure her into the car. As she reluctantly gets into the
text: limo, she reaches for the money.
text: He snatches it away.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Uh uh uh. Half now, half later.
text: She takes the money and puts it inside her shirt.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Okay, your name is Christie. We're meeting a friend of mine,
dialog: Elizabeth. She'll be joining us in my new apartment shortly.
dialog: You'll like her. She's a very nice girl. Don't say anything
dialog: about yourself. Is that clear. Christie?
text: Christie nods.
scene_heading: INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: The living room: ELIZABETH has kicked off her shoes and flopped
text: down on the couch underneath the Baselitz. Elizabeth is an
text: attractive, dark-haired society girl who models occasionally.
text: Christie is sitting on the couch opposite her, pretending to
dialog: examine a CD.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You look really familiar. Did you you go to Dalton?
text: Christie shakes her head.
text: The kitchen: Bateman is grinding up tabs of Ecstasy and
text: putting them in a bottle of wine. In the living room, Elizabeth
text: is still staring at Christie as if she came from Mars.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I think I met you at Au Bar, didn't I ? With Spicey?
text: Christie looks blank.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Well, maybe not with Spicey but it was definitely at Au Bar.
text: Christie still blank.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You know, Au Bar?
text: Christie shakes her head.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Anyway, Au Bar sucks now, it's terrible. I went to a birth
dialog: day party there for Malcolm Forbes. Oh my God, please.
text: Bateman enters carrying the bottle of wine and two glasses.
text: Christie, who seems frightened, sips her wine and stares at
text: the floor. There is an awkward silence.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIE
dialog: This is nicer than your other apartment.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Offended that she prefers Owen's apartment)
dialog: It's not that nice.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIE
dialog: Where did you two meet?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Oh God! I met him at, oh God, the Kentucky Derby in '86-no,
dialog: '87, and...
dialog: (Turning to Patrick)
dialog: You were hanging out with that bimbo Allison Poole.
dialog: (Sarcastically)
dialog: Hot number.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: What do you mean, she was a hot number.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.
dialog: (To Christie)
dialog: Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need
dialog: I say more?...What do you do?
text: A long silence. Christie reddens and stares at the floor.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: She's my...cousin.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (Skeptically)
dialog: Uh huh?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: She's from...France.
text: A pause. Elizabeth looks at Bateman dubiously.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Where's your phone? I've got to call Harley.
text: Bateman hands her a cordless phone. She dials, and stares
text: At Christie while she waits for someone to answer.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Where do you summer? Southampton?
text: Christie looks at Bateman and then back at Elizabeth.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (Listening to the receiver)
dialog: Oh God, it's his machine.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
text: Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Don't tell him you're here.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Why would I?
text: Bateman has poured her another glass of wine. She downs the
text: whole glass, making a face.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: This tastes weird.
text: (She examines the label and shrugs)
dialog: Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway
dialog: you'd like. I'm at-
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Whispering)
dialog: You're at Paul Owen s.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Whispering)
dialog: Paul Owen.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I want the number, idiot.
text: (She waves him away and continues into the reciever)
dialog: Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I
dialog: don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my
dialog: hairdresser on you.
text: She hangs up.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce
dialog: &amp; Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.
text: Bateman sits next to Elizabeth on the couch and pours her
text: another glass of the drugged wine.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on.
dialog: What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: Patrick, you re a lunatic.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Let's not get lewd.
dialog: (Flirty)
text: I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (To Christie)
dialog: Does he do this all the time?
text: Christie shrugs.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Christie, you're not drinking your wine.
text: Christie looks at her wine and gingerly takes a sip.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (To Elizabeth)
dialog: Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me
dialog: feel weird.
speaker_heading: LATER:
text: Elizabeth is now writhing around on the couch and making
text: out with Christie. Bateman holds up a Whitney Houston CD,
text: showing them the picture of Whitney on the cover.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP
dialog: called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles
text: on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps
dialog: across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's
dialog: mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album
text: on a first listening.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You
dialog: actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
text: She giggles, rolling off the sofa onto the floor.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Ignoring her)
dialog: It's hard to choose a favorite track
dialog: among so many great ones, but "The Greatest Love of All"
dialog: is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about
dialog: self-preservation and dignity. It's universal message
dialog: crosses all boundaries, and instills one with the hope
dialog: that it's not too late to better ourselves. to act kinder.
dialog: Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in the world we live in
dialog: to empathize with others, we can always empathize with
dialog: ourselves.
text: As he speaks, he opens the case and carefully places the CD
text: in the player, admiring its pristine silver surface, and
text: watches it slide into the machine.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: It's an important message, crucial, really, and it's
dialog: beautifully stated on the album.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - LATER
text: AN OUT-OF-FOCUS HOME VIDEO SHOT of Elizabeth, Christie and
text: Bateman in the throes of sex, in the master bedroom.
text: CUT BACK TO WIDE SHOT of the bedroom, partially blocked by
text: the video camera in the foreground. Their bodies are an
text: incoherent tangle of arms and legs. The only sounds are
text: moans, heavy breathing and the slapping of flesh against
text: flesh. CLOSE ON Christie's head and shoulders. Her eyes are
text: shut as she grimly concentrates on giving a good professional
text: performance, turning her head every so often to check the
dialog: progress of her partners.
text: OFFSCREEN WE HEAR Elizabeth panting in genuine pleasure,
text: moaning loudly. Her voice gets louder and louder and then
text: shifts to actual pain.
text: Bateman rises up off the bed, suddenly appearing behind
text: Christie. There is blood on his face.
text: Christie turns her head and sees him. She screams and leaps
text: off the bed, running out of the room. She slams the
text: mirrored door behind her, and as it swings shut for a split
text: second we see Elizabeth writhing in pain on the bed.
text: We follow Christie out of the room, panicking, screaming.
text: Christie runs down a darkened hallway, frantically opening
text: doors, looking for an escape.
text: She hears the SOUND OF A CHAINSAW coming from the bedroom.
text: She opens a closet. The closet lights up as she opens the
text: door and sees two dead, women hanging inside. She screams,
text: then claps a hand over her mouth. She stops and listens. THE
text: DISTANT SOUND OF THE CHAINSAW.
text: She backs away slowly, into another dark room, lit only by
text: the light from a television set. Through the darkness she
text: sees a head on the top of the TV and starts to whimper.
text: She runs toward the nearest door. Finding herself in the
text: main hallway, she begins to jog toward the front door, then
dialog: runs.
text: Bateman appears from nowhere, holding the chainsaw,
text: spattered with blood.
text: Christie screams and changes direction. Bateman leaps at
text: her, bellowing.
text: They run through the bedroom and into the bathroom.
text: Christie trips over Elizabeth's body, which is half in the
dialog: bathtub.
text: Both are slipping on the floor, which is slick with blood.
text: Christie falls, tries to get up. Bateman grabs her leg. He
text: tries to bite it.
text: She kicks him in the face and gets up, running toward the
text: front door.
text: He runs after her.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Not the face, you bitch. Not the fucking face, you
dialog: piece of bitch trash!
text: Christie, screaming, makes it out the front door.
text: Bateman runs after her.
text: She runs down the hall screaming and banging on doors.
text: She moves to the elevator, pounding hysterically on the
text: buttons. She sees the stairwell and runs for it.
text: Bateman sees this and runs after her, revving the chainsaw.
text: She runs down the stairs, Bateman two flights behind her.
text: He stops, leans over the railing to look at her, then aims
text: the chainsaw at her and drops it.
text: Christie SCREAMS OFFSCREEN, then is suddenly silent.
text: FROM BATEMAN'S POV we see Christie's body sprawled facedown
text: at the bottom of the stairwell. The chainsaw sticks out of
text: her back like a sword.
scene_heading: INT. CRAYONS - EARLY EVENING
text: An insanely expensive restaurant with a childhood motif: paper
text: tablecloths and jars of crayons for drawing, lots of primary
text: colors, and a goldfish bowl on each table.
text: Bateman is at a table with Evelyn. They are both drawing on
text: the tablecloth. Bateman is drawing Christie with the
text: chainsaw in her back.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I want a firm commitment.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
text: Evelyn waves to a couple across the room.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (Distracted)
dialog: Why? What's wrong?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Speaking very carefully, measuring each word)
dialog: My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale
dialog: cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill
dialog: my needs.
text: The woman across the room holds up her hand, displaying a
text: new bracelet. Evelyn smiles and nods approvingly.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: We need to talk.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
text: It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (Motioning to the waiter for water)
dialog: Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just
dialog: avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This
dialog: is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: But your friends are my friends. My friends are your
dialog: friends. I don't think it would work.
text: (Reaching over to dab his face with a napkin)
dialog: You have a little something on your upper lip.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
text: (Brushing her hand away)
dialog: I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about
dialog: that. You can have them.
text: Evelyn stares at him, suspicious and bewildered, a
text: realization dawning.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: You're really serious, aren't you?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Yes, I am.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: But what about the past? Our past?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: We never really shared one.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: You're inhuman.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.
text: (He pauses, as if searching for the right words)
dialog: You're just not terribly important to me.
text: Evelyn begins to cry.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: No, no, no.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
text: She reaches desperately across the table and takes his
text: hand. Bateman pulls his hand away.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (Sobbing)
dialog: What do you want me to do, what is it you want?
text: The occupants of nearby tables begin to stare. Bateman is
text: becoming increasingly agitated and embarrassed.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Looking uncomfortably around the room)
dialog: If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making
dialog: this scene right now.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Oh God, I can't believe this.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.
text: Evelyn makes an effort to compose herself. She blots the
text: tears so they will not affect her make-up.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (Surprisingly calm)
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I'm just leaving.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: But where?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I have to return some videotapes.
text: He rushes out of the room.
scene_heading: EXT. TRIBECA STREET - EVENING
text: Bateman wanders into misty Tribeca streets, sees a stray cat.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Here kitty, kitty.
text: The small mangy cat rubs against him. He picks it up and
text: walks toward an ATM, holding the cat. He puts his card in
text: the machine. The screen reads: FEED ME A STRAY CAT.
text: Bateman begins to attempt to shove the kitten into the
text: deposit slot with some difficulty. The kitten squeals. He
text: takes a gun from out of his pocket and points it at the
text: kitten. He doesn't notice the woman waiting behind him.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Oh my God! Stop that! What are you doing?
text: Bateman wheels around and shoots her. She falls screaming
text: to the floor.
text: Responding to the gunshot, A POLICE CAR SIREN WAILS in the
text: distance. Bateman breaks into a run. The police car
text: screeches after him.
speaker_heading: COP CAR (O.S.)
dialog: HALT STOP. PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON.
text: Bateman ducks down an alley.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
text: A COP rushes toward him, seemingly from
text: out of nowhere, and tackles him, trying to get the gun away
dialog: from him.
text: Bateman manages to shoot the cop in the face while both of
text: them have their hands on the gun, then shoots him again. He
text: reloads the gun. The sound of more COP CARS arriving.
text: He runs out of the alley.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: As he reaches the street, he finds A PHALANX OF POLICE CARS
text: approaching.
speaker_heading: COP CAR
dialog: Halt. Put down your weapon.
text: The cops leap out and fire a warning shot in the air.
text: Bateman shoots at them. The police return fire.
text: Bateman ducks down behind a parked car and continues
text: shooting wildly. A bullet hits the gas tank of one of the
text: police cars. It catches fire and explodes. The flames light
text: up the scene, illuminating the bodies of policemen both living
dialog: and dead.
text: NEW ANGLE: Bateman flees from the scene. The camera follows
text: him as he runs along a row of Porsches, trying to open each
text: one, setting off a cacophony of CAR ALARMS.
text: THE SOUND OF POLICE SIRENS draws near.
text: NEW ANGLE: He runs, panting, until he ends up in front of a
text: tail, brilliantly lit office building. As he approaches,
text: the lights in the building are going off floor by floor.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT
text: He rushes into the lobby, running for the elevator.
speaker_heading: NIGHT WATCHMAN
dialog: Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Smith? You
dialog: forgot to sign in.
text: Bateman wheels around and shoots him. He runs toward the
text: revolving doors. As he swings around in the doors, he
text: notices a JANITOR who has witnessed the shooting. He
text: revolves back into the lobby and shoots the janitor.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE:
text: He runs out of the building and across the
text: street to an identical office building, the one that houses
dialog: Pierce &amp; Pierce.
scene_heading: INT. PIERCE &amp; PIERCE LOBBY - NIGHT
text: Bateman nods at the Pierce &amp; Pierce NIGHT WATCHMAN and signs
text: in. He breathes a sigh of relief as the elevator doors close
text: behind him.
scene_heading: INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Bateman stands looking out
text: through the floor-length windows at a panoramic night view
text: of the city and the river.
text: Below him he sees a SWAT TEAM swarming over the roof of the
text: opposite building. There are ambulances standing by, flares
text: everywhere, distant sirens.
text: Suddenly, THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER draws near. Frightened,
text: he drops to the floor behind his desk.
text: Helicopter searchlights scan the building, illuminating
text: Bateman's office for a few moments with a blaze of light.
text: He is crouched in one corner, half-sobbing, talking into
text: the phone, as the searchlight keeps circling.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN

dialog: in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen. I don't want to leave anything
dialog: out here...I guess I've killed 20 people, maybe 40-I have tapes
dialog: of a lot of it. Some of the girls have seen the tapes, I even...
dialog: well, I ate some of their brains and I tried to cook a little.
dialog: Tonight I just, well, I had to kill a lot of people and I'm not
dialog: sure I 'm going to get away with it this time-I mean I guess
dialog: I'm a pretty sick guy. So-if you get hack tomorrow, I may show
dialog: up at Harry's Bar, so, you know, keep your eyes open.
text: Bateman hangs up the phone. The helicopter searchlight
text: circles back, briefly illuminating the room. The camera rises
text: up over Bateman huddled in the corner, staring blankly at the
dialog: sky.
scene_heading: INT. SMITH AND WOLLENSKY RESTAURANT - DAY
text: KIMBALL and Bateman are sitting at a corner table.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: (Very surprised)
dialog: No hash browns?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Not in the mood, I guess.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I
dialog: mean- it's-have you been here before?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Deliberately nonchalant)
dialog: Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not...
dialog: ordering them.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: (Looking at him like he's nuts)
dialog: Suit yourself, I guess.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on
dialog: what you did?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some
dialog: sorbet?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: According to his date book, and this was verified by his
text: secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: I've questioned him.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Marcus?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
text: Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't
dialog: be sure.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: But Marcus denied it?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Yes.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: He does? You're sure?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I checked it out. It's clean.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Oh.
dialog: KIMBALL Now where were you?
dialog: (He laughs)
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Laughing with him)
dialog: Where was Marcus?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: He wasn't with Paul
dialog: Owen.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: So who was he with?
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble,
dialog: Harry Newman, George Butner and 
text: (He pauses, Then looks up)
dialog: - you.
text: A moment of stunned silence.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen
dialog: to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner
dialog: with Victoria...the following night.
speaker_heading: KIMBALL
dialog: Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for
text: a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking.
dialog: Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or
dialog: later.
dialog: (A pause)
dialog: I mean, to think that one of his friends
dialog: killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too
dialog: ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
text: McDermott stops by the table.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: KIMBALL! How's the investigation?
dialog: Talking to Bateman? Don't believe a word he says.
text: (Laughs uproariously slapping him on the back)
dialog: Bateman, what's wrong with ,you?
text: Bateman looks at him in silence,
text: panicking.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: You can't eat at Smith and Wollensky
dialog: without ordering the hash browns. Jesus, Bateman, you're a
dialog: raving maniac. Been at Pierce &amp; Pierce too long.
dialog: (He wanders off muttering)
dialog: No fucking hash browns...
scene_heading: INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
text: Bateman walks into the lobby of Paul Owen's building. He
text: has a surgical mask in one hand.
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: What can I do for you, sir?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: 20B.
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
text: Of course. Mrs. Wolfe is up there right now.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Mrs. Wolfe?
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: The real estate agent? You do have an appointment,
dialog: don't you?
text: Bateman steps out of the elevator and walks cautiously down
text: the hallway. Owen's door is open. The apartment is freshly
text: painted and has been immaculately redecorated in English
text: country-house style: overstuffed sofas, lots of chintz. There
text: are flowers everywhere, and a YOUNG YUPPIE COUPLE stands
text: admiring the place talkingto the realtor, MRS. WOLFE. Bateman
text: wanders down the hallway, looking for familiar signs. He stops
text: at the closet where we last saw two dead girls hanging. He
text: opens the door and the light switches on, but it is empty. Mrs.
text: Wolfe approaches, smiling.
speaker_heading: MRS. WOLFE
dialog: Are you my two o'clock?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: No.
text: Mrs. Wolfe eyes him strangely, then looks down at the
text: surgical mash clutched in his hand. Her expression changes.
speaker_heading: MRS. WOLFE
dialog: Can I help you?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
text: She stares at him impassively.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Doesn't he live here?
speaker_heading: MRS. WOLFE
dialog: No, he doesn't.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: MRS. WOLFE
dialog: You saw the ad in the Times?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But...
dialog: doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
speaker_heading: MRS. WOLFE
dialog: There was no ad in the Times.
text: Bateman is shaking as they continue to stare at each other.
speaker_heading: MRS. WOLFE
dialog: I think you should go now.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: But I think...I want to know what happened
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: MRS. WOLFE
dialog: Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
text: Bateman backs away slowly.
speaker_heading: MRS. WOLFE
dialog: Don't come back.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I won't...don't worry.
text: Mrs. Wolfe glares at him as he walks down the hall,
text: rattled, and gets into the elevator.
scene_heading: EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
text: Bateman enters the revolving
text: door of an office building, panicking and breathing
text: heavily. He is sweating, his hair is wild, and he looks
text: deranged. He goes around the revolving door twice and comes
text: out onto the street again, where he bumps smack into a GUY
dialog: just like him.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Hey, Kinsley.
text: Bateman looks up at him wild-eyed.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: See you at Fluties, okay?
text: The guy walks away, utterly unfazed. Bateman wanders down
text: the street, banging his briefcase against walls, garbage
dialog: cans, etc.
scene_heading: EXT. MIDTOWN PHONE BOOTH - DAY
text: Bateman searches his pockets
text: for pills. He finds three different pills and swallows
text: them. He's sweating, and takes his jacket off to wipe his
text: face, dialing a number.
speaker_heading: JEAN (O.S.)
text: Patrick Bateman's office.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Jean? Hello? Jean?
speaker_heading: JEAN (O.S.)
dialog: Patrick? Is that you?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Hello? Jean, I need help!
speaker_heading: JEAN (O.S.)
dialog: Where are you?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Jean-I'm not-
speaker_heading: JEAN (O.S.)
dialog: Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and
text: David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
speaker_heading: JEAN (O.S.)
dialog: Patrick? I can't hear you.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: What are I doing?
speaker_heading: JEAN (O.S.)
dialog: Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: ...to the office this afternoon.
speaker_heading: JEAN (O.S.)
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Screaming)
dialog: Just...say...no!
speaker_heading: JEAN (O.S.)
dialog: What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!
text: He hangs up. He throws the Walkman which is around his neck
text: into a nearby trash can, and wipes his face with his
dialog: jacket.
scene_heading: INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE- SAME DAY
text: Jean sits at Bateman's desk. She looks around, and then opens
text: his desk drawer and tentatively begins to search through it.
scene_heading: INT. HARRY'S BAR - EVENING
text: Bateman comes into the bar, a little cleaned up from the
text: previous scene (he's smoothed his hair), but still panicking
text: and disheveled. He spots his friends in a corner, sits down,
text: still breathing heavily.
text: Price is on his cell-phone, trying to get reservations.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Bateman, you're looking a little wild-eyed rough
dialog: day at the office?
text: They all laugh.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Hey, look-Price is back. And he's drinking
dialog: Perrier. He s a changed man. Except...he still can't
dialog: get a reservation to save his life.
text: Bateman sits down silently.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Why don't you try I 50 Wooster? Just fucking call them.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (On automatic)
dialog: I'm not going anywhere unless we
dialog: have a reservation.
text: VAN PATTEN Le Cirque, Flamingo East, Oyster Bar, come on,
dialog: faggots-just get a res.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Keep your shirt on. Maybe lose the suspenders.
text: Bateman spots HAROLD CARNES at the bar, tenses.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
text: (He downs his drink)
dialog: Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back.
text: He approaches Carnes cautiously.
speaker_heading: CARNES
dialog: Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the
dialog: end of the '90s.
text: Bateman approaches, trying to act casual.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Shut up, Carnes, they will not.
text: Carnes is surprised, turns around, looks vaguely confused.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: So, Harold, did you get my message?
text: Carnes lights a cigarette, stalling. Then laughs.
speaker_heading: CARNES
dialog: Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you,
dialog: wasn't it?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
text: (Waving smoke out of his face)
dialog: Yes, naturally.
speaker_heading: CARNES
dialog: Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s
dialog: fabulous. That's rich...
dialog: Pause
speaker_heading: CARNES
dialog: It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: What exactly do you mean?
speaker_heading: CARNES
dialog: The message you left.
text: Carnes is distracted, waving at people.
speaker_heading: CARNES
dialog: By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still
dialog: seeing her, right?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
text: Carnes isn't really listening.
speaker_heading: CARNES
dialog: Excuse me. Nothing. Good to see you. Is that Edward Towers?
text: He turns to go.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Carnes? Wait.
speaker_heading: CARNES
dialog: (Sighing)
dialog: Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing.
dialog: But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork,
dialog: such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully
dialog: appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said
dialog: Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's
dialog: have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
speaker_heading: CARNES
dialog: Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let
dialog: alone...what was it you said he did to her?
text: Carnes looks around the club, raises his glass to a passing
text: couple. He laughs politely.
speaker_heading: CARNES
dialog: Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: (Desperate, shouting)
dialog: Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really
dialog: comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes.
dialog: I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off.
dialog: I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your
dialog: machine was true.
speaker_heading: CARNES
dialog: Excuse me. I really must he going.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm
dialog: Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time!
dialog: Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
text: Carnes stares at him in confusion and annoyance.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed
dialog: Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
speaker_heading: CARNES
dialog: But that's simply not possible. And I don't find
dialog: this funny anymore.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
speaker_heading: CARNES
dialog: (Eyeing Bateman worriedly)
dialog: It's just not.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Why not, you stupid bastard?
text: Carnes stares at him.
speaker_heading: CARNES
dialog: Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in
dialog: London...just ten days ago.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: No, you...didn't?
speaker_heading: CARNES
dialog: Now, if you'll excuse me.
text: Bateman returns back to his friends' table, in a daze.
text: They are all looking at the television, where Ronald
text: Reagan is giving a speech about Iran Contra. They are
text: halfheartedly arguing about whether or not he's
dialog: lying.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?
speaker_heading: VAN PATTEN
dialog: What shit? Now where do we have reservations at?
dialog: I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have
dialog: reservations somewhere.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: (To Bateman)
text: I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so...
text: out of it. So...undangerous.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: He is totally harmless you geek. Was totally harmless.
dialog: Just like you are totally harmless. But he did do all that
dialog: shit and you have failed lo get us into I 50, so, you know,
dialog: what can I say?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that
dialog: way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so
dialog: fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
speaker_heading: VAN PATTEN
dialog: Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
text: Bateman laughs at this. Price shoots him a look.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'.
speaker_heading: VAN PATTEN
dialog: (To Price) Rehab's done wonders for you, pal.
dialog: Working for UNICEF now?
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Do you want another Perrier Timothy? Some seltzer water?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Oh brother look-he presents himself as a harmless
dialog: Old codger. But inside...
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: But inside...
text: The SOUNDS OF THE BAR FADE AWAY and we hear Bateman's thoughts:
speaker_heading: BATEMAN (V.O.)
dialog: But inside doesn't matter...
text: THE SOUNDS OF THE BAR RETURN.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: (Bored)
dialog: Inside? Yes, inside? Believe it or not, Price we're actually
dialog: listening to you.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Bateman? Come on, what do you think?
text: Bateman looks up and smiles at Price. Then shrugs.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN
dialog: Whatever.
text: The conversation breaks up as Van Patten takes out his phone.
speaker_heading: VAN PATTEN
dialog: Whose moronic idea was it to drink dry beers? I need a Scotch.
text: The sounds of the bar fade down. The following voiceover runs
text: over images of Bateman and his friends ordering drinks, talking
text: on portable phones, talking, laughing - combined with images of
text: other very similar young men at other tables drinking, talking
text: on portable phones, talking, laughing,
speaker_heading: BATEMAN (V.O.)
dialog: There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with
text: the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil,
dialog: all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward
dialog: it, I have now surpassed...
scene_heading: INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Jean is alone in Bateman's office, looking through his diary.
text: We see the pages that she is looking at. They are filled with
text: doodles of mutilated women and their names...Jean looks lost
text: and frightened, and begins to cry.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN (V.O.)
dialog: My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better
dialog: world for anyone. I fact I want my pain to be inflicted on
dialog: others. I want no escape.
scene_heading: INT. HARRY'S BAR - EARLY EVENING
text: As the film ends the camera moves CLOSE on Bateman. He is
text: leaning back in his leather armchair, drinking a double Scotch,
text: his eyes blank.
speaker_heading: BATEMAN (V.O.)
dialog: But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis. I gain no
dialog: deeper knowledge about myself, no new knowledge can be extracted
dialog: from my telling. There has been no reason for me to tell you any
dialog: of this. This confession has meant nothing...
text: The camera moves up to a sign on the wall behind him:
text: "THIS IS NOT AN EXIT."
