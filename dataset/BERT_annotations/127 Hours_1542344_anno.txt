dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: Yeah, I know, I mean there's no one

text: We've been moving towards him as he rushes towards us, spider
text: style. He's stripped to his underwear. He's lithe to say

speaker_heading: ARON

speaker_heading: ARON (CONT'D)
dialog: I hate this fucking mess.
dialog: 
text: Finally he stops but his fingers are paralyzed, fused rigid
text: around the rock. He pulls them off with his teeth and the
text: stone drops to his feet.
dialog: 
text: There's a thick layer of dust across the top of the stone and
text: his right arm. He tries to blow it away. He fails. Tired,
text: it's too thick and he's too dehydrated. He picks up his knife
text: and using this starts sweeping the grit off his thumb. As he
text: cleans up he accidentally rips away a thin piece of decayed
text: flesh. It peels back a long way like a skin of boiled milk.
text: The insects start to gather.
speaker_heading: ARON (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit.
dialog: 65.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He pokes the thumb with the stubbed point of the blade. On

dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ARON (QUIET, CLEAR) (CONT'D)
dialog: Get rid of it Aron, it's dead, it's
dialog: garbage.
text: He drops to his haunches but the webbing stops him at his
text: waist. He detaches it and drops down again, almost able to
text: squat. His trapped arm is the only thing preventing that.
text: His face is suddenly open.
dialog: 
text: He pushes and pushes with his left hand under the boulder to
text: create maximum downward force on his right arm. Hard, harder,
text: HARDER. It looks insane, unnatural and painful, but he says
dialog: nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POW
text: Like a gunshot in the canyon, the bone breaks. The sound
text: ricochets. He rises and sees the bone pushing up violently
text: against the skin. He feels it. It's a serrated, but clean,
dialog: successful break.
text: Still he says nothing.
dialog: 
text: Now he humps his body up and over the chockstone, smearing
text: his feet, one with a shoe, one without, against the wall, he

speaker_heading: BANG
text: A second gun shot smashes around the canyon. He's sweating

dialog: his wrist.
dialog: Fuck knows where the sweat is coming from but it's pouring
dialog: out of him.
text: Sawing downwards he makes as large a hole as he can without
text: tearing any of the noodle like veins. He puts the knife in
text: his teeth and pokes his left forefinger and thumb inside his
dialog: right arm.
text: Like a mechanic he looks to analyse and then he works by feel
dialog: only.
dialog: 
text: His sweat falls on his knife mixing with the blood.
text: He pulls muscle nearer the surface allowing his knife to
text: slice and pare away at a pinky 'finger-sized' fragment bit by
text: bit. It takes a dozen actions, each time the knife goes back
dialog: to his teeth.
dialog: Sort. Pinch. Rotate. Slice.
dialog: 
text: There's not a lot of blood. But he keeps working and working.

dialog: dry eyes.
text: He sees, for the first time in his new life, green. The deep
text: green of a healthy 50ft tree below him and to his left, and
text: he knows. He looks for the bolts drilled into the rock, and
dialog: he knows. Now he can look down. Right to the edge of
text: vertiginous drop and there below is a puddle of shallow
dialog: turgid water. Life itself. He wanted it to be there and now
text: he's mesmerized by it. A pair of swifts leave the tree and

dialog: 
text: Unravelling the rope of its knots, he's baking in blazing
dialog: 70.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: light. He can't go yet, every knot must be undone pulled open
dialog: between his teeth and his hand. But he'll die if he can't

text: licking and retching simultaneously he suddenly stops and
text: listens. He can hear a shuffling, a zip-zip... The rope is
text: uncoiling over the ledge. He put it down to drink. Picking up
text: speed the more it falls, there's only a few feet left. He

speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Are you Aron?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: Yes I am. Can I get a lift?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HELICOPTER. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Aron looks at the beautiful white leather seat before he gets
text: in the back of the helicopter. Surreal. It's a startling
dialog: contrast to his Frankenstein, and even now it's not lost on
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: I'm gonna make a terrible mess of
dialog: your seat.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Just get in buddy. We're all
dialog: looking for you.
dialog: 
text: The helicopter sucks upwards into the sky leaving Wayne,

speaker_heading: 1000 HOURS LATER
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDERWATER. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Underwater. A figure dives in, pulling strong breast strokes
text: down and towards us. Its Aron, fully recovered after surgery.
text: Eyes open, he pulls and pulls down through crystal clear,
dialog: oxygenated water.
speaker_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT/INT. HOSPITAL ROOM. DAY.
dialog: 
text: As the helicopter and gurney staff transfer him into the
text: medic room he's surrounded by vertical giants as he lies
dialog: horizontal for the first time in 6 days.
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: Thank you for bringing me back.
dialog: The most senior of the burly men says,
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURLY MAN
dialog: That's all your miracle days used
dialog: up kid. You need to rest. You can
dialog: stand everyone a beer later.
text: Aron is greeted by medics. Needles. Care. Machines. Tubes.
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: Will you look after this for me
dialog: please?
dialog: 
text: He opens his fist and there is the small folded up knife.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDERWATER. DAY.
text: He pulls again releasing a huge chunk of air into a metallic
dialog: bubble.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 76.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM. DAY.
text: A very soft voice reading.
speaker_heading: VOICE (MOM)
dialog: ...his love, the peace that passeth
dialog: all understanding...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: Mom.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: My boy. My only one. There you are.
text: She strokes his head so gently.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: Hey Mom.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: How are you feeling?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: OK. Are you okay...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: You've been asleep for 2 days. We
dialog: are so lucky...
text: She's a decent woman and a devoted mum. She looks weary, worn
text: out with worry and love for her boy.
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: Mom, I'm sorry I scared you.
dialog: 
text: Very soft voice (again) - Aron hears the same words as he
text: drifts back into drugged rest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE (MOM)
dialog: ...his love, the peace that passeth
dialog: all understanding...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDERWATER. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Face underwater. Pull and kick. Wanting oxygen now.
speaker_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PRESS CONFERENCE. DAY.
dialog: (all of this without
speaker_heading: SOUND)
dialog: 
dialog: Flash of celebrity. His first press conference. And boy, is
dialog: there a lot of press there!
dialog: 77.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Aron, of course has his camera with him as he walks out and
text: takes a snap of the noise and light. We see his still, it's
text: floor to ceiling, wall to wall journalists.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. POOL. DAY.
text: We can see him beneath, swimming along the floor of the pool,
text: like a diver building lung capacity.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VAST CROWD. STADIUM. NIGHT.
text: The vast crowd again, floodlit, ready to begin their evening.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ARON'S TRUCK. NIGHT.
text: In Aron's 4 x 4 somewhere in the endless parking lot outside
text: the stadium. Rana is wearing glasses, reading an SMS she's
dialog: just received.
speaker_heading: RANA
dialog: OK - he's got 3 vegetarian hotdogs
dialog: and the tickets and he'll be
dialog: outside Gate 6 in 5.
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: So are you guys ok with me?
speaker_heading: RANA
dialog: Yeah. We split up a while back when
dialog: you were in hospital.
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: Christine told me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANA
dialog: (always to the point)
dialog: Is that what this is about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
text: She laughs at him.
speaker_heading: RANA
dialog: What about the climbing?
text: Aron reaches in his bag and pulls out his scary looking
text: prosthetic arm / axe. He clinks the points together. She
text: doesn't laugh, maybe a smile.
dialog: 78.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANA (CONT'D)
dialog: Solo?
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: I'm gonna finish the 49ers this
dialog: winter or next.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANA
dialog: (to change it)
dialog: Well, all I can't figure out is
dialog: what took you so long to cut it off
dialog: and get one of these.
text: They both laugh. But he also answers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: Rana, before I did it I was
dialog: hallucinating, I saw this child, a
dialog: little blond boy -
speaker_heading: RANA
dialog: (over her glasses)
dialog: Not Jesus please...
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: 
dialog: No, he looked like my cousin
dialog: Charlie but way too young... and I
dialog: didn't know why but I knew he was
dialog: mine and that this was what lay in
dialog: front of me.
text: He looks at her.
dialog: 
dialog: Pause.
text: She doesn't say anything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARON (CONT'D)
dialog: But it's not going to be you, is
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: RANA
dialog: No Aron, it's not.
speaker_heading: ARON
speaker_heading: (HE KNOWS)
dialog: OK.
text: Rana leans over and tenderly kisses his cheek.
speaker_heading: RANA
dialog: You know, everyone who cares for
dialog: you, a little bit of them dies each
dialog: time you go back.
dialog: 
text: Before he can work out how to answer she breaks the door
dialog: open.
dialog: 79.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANA (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's go hero. If they do The Fly
dialog: first and we miss it we'll never be
dialog: forgiven.

scene_heading: EXT. CONCERT. NIGHT.

text: The concert explode into life.
scene_heading: THE POP SONG PLAYS OVER:
dialog: ` A man will rise, A man will fall...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDERWATER. DAY.
text: His face pushing for the surface. He surges up and out of the
text: water, to cling by his elbows on the side of the pool. No
dialog: prosthetic.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SONG CONTINUES OVER:
dialog: ...From the sheer face of love
dialog: 
dialog: Like a fly from a wall'
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. POOL. DAY.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: There in front of him on the grass by the pool is the same
text: sofa as in the canyon. On it and around it, his friends and
dialog: family, including Rana. There's so many of them they fill the
text: screen. Tucked deep into the sofa, is his son giggling away.
text: They smile, simple, silent support for him. He looks right
text: back at them.
