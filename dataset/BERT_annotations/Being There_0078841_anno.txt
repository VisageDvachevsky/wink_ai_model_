speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. TOWNHOUSE GARDEN - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON
text: An afternoon in late November, the leaves have left the
text: trees, and the early darkness of a winter dusk approaches.
text: The garden is long and narrow, guarded on either side by a
text: high brick wall. At one end stands the rear of a three-story
text: brick townhouse; at the other, a one story brick building.
text: CLASSICAL MUSIC is heard in the distance. A MAN, handsomely
text: dressed in a well-tailored suit of the 1920's, works in the
text: garden. A gardener's apron protects his suit from the earth
text: as he turns the loam along one of the walkways. He works
text: slowly,-precisely, obviously engrossed in his surroundings.
dialog: This man is called CHANCE.
text: Chance stops working for a moment, takes a pocket watch from
text: inside his coat, checks the time. He looks to the darkening
text: skies, returns the watch to his pocket. As Chance starts
text: toward the one story brick building, he takes a spotless rag
text: from his apron pocket and wipes the dirt from the tines of
text: his pitchfork.
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - AFTERNOON
text: The sound of the music increases as Chance enters the garage
text: from the garden. A gleaming 1921 TOURING CAR is revealed as
text: he walks through the garage and leans the pitchfork against a
text: wall. Chance takes a neatly folded cover from a shelf,
text: carefully puts it over the car. When he finishes covering the
text: car for the night, Chance picks up the pitchfork, leaves the
text: garage through a side entry.
scene_heading: INT. POTTING ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: The Potting Room is filled with the tools of the gardener,
text: everything arranged in an orderly fashion. Rows of small pots
text: are on tables, young plants sprouting from some of them. A
text: small, 1940's table model black-and-white TV rests on a
text: shelf. It is playing, tuned to the BOSTON POPS ORCHESTRA.
text: Attached to the front of the screen is a wheel containing
text: colored gels. The wheels spins, creates an early form of
text: color TV. As Chance enters, his attention is on the
text: television set. He watches it as he oils the tines of the
text: pitchfork and puts it away. Chance turns off the TV and
text: leaves the room, but the sound of the Boston Pops continues.
scene_heading: INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: A room adjacent to the Potting Room. A large screen remote
text: control color television set dominates the room. It is on,
text: tuned to the Boston Pops. In contrast to the new TV, the rest
text: of the room is sparsely but tastefully decorated with
text: expensive furniture of the twenties. There are no books,
dialog: magazines, newspapers or reading matter of any kind to be
text: seen. Chance comes in, watches the TV with a detached gaze as
text: he removes his apron. He changes the channel with the remote
text: control as he puts his apron and the pitchfork rag into a
text: laundry bag. He takes off his suit jacket, hangs it in the
text: closet where it is accompanied by several others, all of like
text: quality. Chance changes the channel once again.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN - NIGHT
text: Chance, wearing a different suit and carrying the laundry
text: bag, crosses from the rear building to the main house.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN HOUSE - REAR ENTRANCE/HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: The interior of the main house has the mustiness of age, the
text: warmth of oak. White dropcloths and sheets cover all of the
text: furniture. Chance enters, walks through the hallway.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: A large dropcloth is over the dining room table and chairs.
text: It is neatly folded back at one end, leaving one chair and
text: place setting uncovered. A small portable color TV is next to
text: the place setting.
text: Chance enters, puts his laundry bag on a covered table near
text: the doorway. He sits at the dining room table, turns on the
text: TV, and carefully unfolds his napkin, puts it on his lap as
text: he watches the screen. LOUISE, an elderly black maid, enters
text: with a tray of food and Chance's clean laundry.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: (sets dinner before
dialog: Chance)
dialog: ... Evening, Chance.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (slowly, perfect diction,
dialog: no accent of any kind)
dialog: ... Good evening, Louise.
text: Louise sets Chance's clean clothes on the small table, picks
text: up his laundry bag.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: ... The Old Man is getting weaker,
dialog: Chance.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (begins to eat)
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with
dialog: every hour that goes by...
text: Chance, his manners impeccable, concentrates on the TV as he
text: eats. A buzzer SOUNDS, Louise looks upstairs.
speaker_heading: LOUISE (CONT'D)
dialog: ... Back up those stairs - damn...
dialog: That Man's needin' me more and more
dialog: just before he never needs me
dialog: again...
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (still watches TV)
dialog: Is his back feeling better?
text: Louise gives Chance a look.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: ... Gobbledegook... You and your
dialog: gobbledegook. You're gonna be the
dialog: death of me yet, Chance...
dialog: (she turns to leave)
dialog: ... Unless those stairs are... The
dialog: Good Lord's liable to snatch up two
dialog: unwillin' souls at the same time if
dialog: I keep on trampin' up those
dialog: stairs... I don't want none of
dialog: that...
text: Louise disappears through the doorway. Chance continues to
dialog: eat and watch TV.
scene_heading: INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - DAWN
text: Chance is asleep, lying on his back. His eyes slowly open,
text: and, with no change of expression, he sits up and turns on
text: the TV with the remote control. Chance gets out of bed, goes
text: to the dresser and takes his pocket watch out of a drawer,
text: checks the time. He crosses to the closet, his eyes never
text: straying from an early morning show on television. He puts on
text: a bathrobe and leaves the room.
scene_heading: INT. POTTING ROOM - DAWN
text: Chance enters, turns on the TV with the spinning color wheel,
text: then waters a few of the pots with a sprinkling can. He turns
text: off the TV and exits.
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - DAWN
text: Chance comes into the garage, takes the cover off of the
text: touring car, folds it and puts it on a shelf. He leaves the
dialog: garage.
scene_heading: INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - DAWN
text: Chance returns to his room, changes channels on the
text: television, takes off his robe and hangs it back up in the
text: closet, then goes into the bathroom.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN - MORNING
text: A light snow is falling. The door to the small building
text: opens, Chance peeks out, then goes back inside. A few seconds
text: pass and Chance reappears, this time with an umbrella.
text: Smartly dressed in suit and tie, he crosses to the main
dialog: house.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN HOUSE - REAR ENTRANCE/HALLWAY - MORNING
text: Chance opens the door, shakes off and closes the umbrella
text: before entering. He hangs the umbrella on a doorknob, then
text: heads for the dining room.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING
text: Repeating his ritual, Chance enters the dining room, sits,
text: turns on the TV, carefully spreads his napkin on his lap. He
text: watches the screen for a moment, then turns, expecting
text: Louise. She doesn't appear, so he turns back, watches TV.
text: After a few beats, Chance hears Louise's footsteps hurrying
text: down the stairs. She comes into the dining room, visibly
text: distraught. Chance looks up, smiles.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Good morning, Louise.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: (out of breath)
dialog: He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's
dialog: dead!
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (flatly, turns back to TV)
dialog: ... I see.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Must of happened durin' the night,
dialog: I don't know... Lord, he wasn't
dialog: breathin' and as cold as a fish. I
dialog: touched him, just to see, and you
dialog: believe me, Chance - that's doin'
dialog: more than I get paid to do... Then
dialog: I just covered him up, pulled the
text: sheet over his head...
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Yes. I've seen that done.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Then I got the hell out of that
dialog: room and called the doctor and I
dialog: think I woke him probably, he
dialog: wasn't any too alert. He just said,
dialog: 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and
dialog: said he'd send somebody over...'
dialog: Lord, what a mornin'!
speaker_heading: CHANCE
text: (watches news, flashes of
dialog: season's first snowfall)
dialog: ... Yes, Louise, it's snowing in
dialog: the garden today. Have you looked
dialog: outside and seen the snow? It's
text: very white.
text: A beat of silence from Louise, then anger.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Dammit, Boy! Is that all you got to
dialog: say? More gobbledegook?
dialog: (Chance smiles, is silent)
dialog: That Old Man's layin' up there dead
dialog: as hell and it just don't make any
dialog: difference to you!
speaker_heading: CHANCE
text: (with a smile, accepting
dialog: death)
dialog: Yes, Louise. I have seen it often.
dialog: It happens to old people.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Well, ain't that the truth...
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. It is.
text: Louise throws back the cover from a chair next to Chance and
text: sits, softening a bit toward him.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know
dialog: what I was expectin' from you...
dialog: I'm sorry for yellin' like I did...
dialog: No sir, I just don't know what I
dialog: was expectin' ...
dialog: (Chance doesn't react,
dialog: watches TV)
dialog: ... I 'spose I'd better gather up
dialog: some breakfast for you...
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (a turn to her)
dialog: Yes, I'm very hungry.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: (rises, looks upstairs)
dialog: Well, no more stewin' those prunes
dialog: every mornin', that's somethin', I
dialog: guess...
text: (she starts out, stops by
dialog: the door)
dialog: ... what are you goin' to do now,
dialog: Chance?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (gazing at TV)
dialog: I'm going to work in the garden.
text: Louise gives Chance a long look, then turns to leave.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: (as she goes)
dialog: ... I'll get you some eggs.
text: Chance nods in approval, then changes the channel on the TV.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN HOUSE - SERVANT'S STAIRWAY - MORNING
text: An enclosed stairway. Chance enters, proceeds up the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MORNING
text: Chance comes out of a doorway adjoining the main staircase.
text: He moves off down the hall.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN HOUSE - OLD MAN'S ROOM - MORNING
text: The furniture in this room is not covered with sheets but the
text: Old Man is. There is a polite knock at the door, then Chance
text: enters the room. As Chance moves slowly to the Old Man's bed,
dialog: we sense a feeling of respect from Chance, as well as a bit
text: of curiosity. Chance stands by the side of the bed for a
text: moment, then he reaches down and gently pulls the sheet back
text: from the Old Man's face. He touches the man's forehead,
text: lightly, briefly, then replaces the sheet. Chance moves to
text: the TV (like the one in his own room) and turns it on. He
text: sits in an easy chair next to the Old man's bed and watches a
text: movie from the early forties. Chance puts an arm out, rests
text: it on the Old Man's covered body. With the other, he changes
text: the channels with the remote control.
text: He returns to the channel with the forties movie and seems to
text: become absorbed in a scene in which a gentleman tips his hat
text: to a lady. The scene seems to have 'sunk into' his mind.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN - MORNING
text: It has stopped snowing. Chance, wearing a hat, the gardening
text: apron over his suit and boots, putters in the garden. Louise
text: comes out of the main house. She is dressed warmly, a scarf
text: over her head, a heavy coat. Chance sees her, tips his hat to
text: Louise exactly like the man he saw on television.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: ... Well, ain't you the gentleman
dialog: this mornin'...
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: ... gotta go now, Chance...
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (resumes working)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: You're gonna need somebody,
dialog: someone's gotta be around for you,
dialog: boy...
dialog: (he keeps working)
dialog: ... You oughta find yourself a
dialog: lady, Chance...
text: (she smiles slightly, with
dialog: caring)
dialog: But I guess it oughta be an old
dialog: lady, 'cause you ain't gonna do a
dialog: young one any good, not with that
dialog: little thing of yours...
text: (she reaches out, puts a
text: hand on his shoulder)
dialog: ... You're always gonna be a little
dialog: boy, ain't you?
dialog: (he smiles, keeps working)
dialog: ... Goodbye, Chance...
text: Louise gives his shoulder a squeeze, turns and moves toward
dialog: the house.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (as she goes)
dialog: Goodbye, Louise.
text: Louise waves as she enters the townhouse. Chance tips his hat
text: once again as she disappears.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN HOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - MORNING
text: Louise enters the hallway, picks up a couple of suit cases
text: waiting by the door. She stops as she sees TWO MEN in white
text: carrying a stretcher down the main staircase. She notices the
text: ease with which they bring the Old Man's body down the
dialog: stairs.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: ... He used to be a big man...
dialog: 'Spose he wasted away to about
dialog: nothin'...
text: (a beat - then she talks
dialog: to the body of the old
dialog: Man)
dialog: ... I guess I'll be goin' off to
dialog: find me some folks, Old Man... I'm
dialog: not batty enough to stay around
dialog: this neighborhood any longer...
text: The stretcher bearers move to the front door. Louise steps in
text: front of them.
speaker_heading: LOUISE (CONT'D)
dialog: (to stretcher bearers)
dialog: Wait up! I'm goin' out that door
dialog: first.
text: Louise takes one more look at the covered body, then opens
text: the front door, leaves.
scene_heading: INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - DAY
text: The TV plays offstage as Chance washes up in the bathroom. He
text: finishes, comes into the bedroom, takes a pair of house
text: slippers from his closet, turns off the television and leaves
dialog: the room.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN - DAY
text: Chance, carrying his slippers, crosses through the layer of
text: fresh snow to the townhouse.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - DAY
text: Chance, wearing the slippers, enters and sits at his place.
text: He turns on the TV, puts the napkin on his lap. He watches TV
text: for a moment, then turns, looks for Louise. She does not
text: appear so he resumes watching TV. He changes channels, views
text: a wildly exciting FOOTBALL game. At a peak in the excitement,
text: he again switches channels. Chance watches TV News coverage
text: of the PRESIDENT of the United States greeting foreign
text: dignitaries at the White House.
text: CLOSE SHOTS on television reveal that the President uses a
text: two-handed handshake when meeting his guests. Unconsciously,
text: Chance grips one hand with the other, the scene on TV seeming
dialog: to have 'sunk into' his mind.
scene_heading: INT. TOWNHOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - DAY
text: A key is heard in the lock. The door opens and THOMAS
text: FRANKLIN and SALLY HAYES enter. Franklin, an attorney, is in
text: his late thirties, carries a large briefcase. Hayes is
text: younger, attractive, also an attorney. She totes a briefcase,
text: has the look of a modern, liberated woman. Hayes appears to
text: be surprised at the interior of the house.
speaker_heading: HAYES
dialog: (looks around)
dialog: ... This is another world, Tom - I
dialog: never would have believed it...
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Yeah... He and my father used to
dialog: ride together back in the
dialog: thirties... Fox hunting... Before I
dialog: was born...
speaker_heading: HAYES
dialog: ... Would you take me on a tour?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Gladly...
dialog: (he smiles)
dialog: ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings'
dialog: bedroom, that'll be stop number
dialog: one.
text: Franklin puts a hand on Hayes' shoulder as they,go off down
dialog: the hall.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - DAY
text: Chance still watches TV, waits for Louise to serve him.
text: Franklin and Hayes appear in the doorway of the dining room.
text: They are both surprised to see Chance.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: ... Why... Hello, we thought we
dialog: heard something...
dialog: (moves to Chance, hand
dialog: outstretched)
dialog: I'm Thomas Franklin.
text: Chance remains seated, takes Franklin's hand warmly in both
dialog: of his like the President did on TV.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the
dialog: gardener.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: ... The gardener?
dialog: (thinks it's a joke,
dialog: laughs)
dialog: ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance,
dialog: this is Ms. Hayes.
text: Hayes moves to shake Chance's hand.
speaker_heading: HAYES
dialog: Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to
dialog: meet you.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (doesn't rise, again
dialog: shakes with both hands)
dialog: Yes.
text: Chance turns back to the TV and Hayes and Franklin exchange
dialog: looks.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (after an uneasy pause)
dialog: ... We're with Franklin, Jennings
dialog: and Roberts, the law firm handling
dialog: the estate.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (a smile, totally at ease)
dialog: Yes, Thomas - I understand.
text: Another period of silence. Franklin and Hayes seem perplexed.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: ... Are you waiting for someone? An
dialog: appointment?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Your lunch? You have a luncheon
dialog: appointment here?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Louise?... The maid?...
dialog: (a look to Hayes)
dialog: But she should have left earlier
dialog: today...
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (smiles at Hayes)
dialog: I see...
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: ... You've quite a sense of humor,
dialog: Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside,
dialog: may I ask just what you are doing
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I live here.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: You live here?
dialog: (a look to Hayes)
dialog: ... We don't have any record of
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. It's very cold outside today,
dialog: isn't it, Thomas?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: ... How long have you been living
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Ever since I can remember, since I
dialog: was a child.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (doubting)
dialog: Since you were a child?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes, Thomas. I have always been
dialog: here. I have always worked in the
dialog: garden.
speaker_heading: HAYES
dialog: ... Then you really are a gardener?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HAYES
dialog: Your appearance doesn't suggest
dialog: that at all, Mr. Chance.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Oh. Thank you.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Do you have any proof of your
dialog: employment, Mr. Chance - any checks
dialog: from the deceased, any contracts or
dialog: documents?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: How were you compensated for these
dialog: duties you say you performed?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Compensated...?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: How were you paid?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I was given meals, and a home...
speaker_heading: HAYES
dialog: What about money?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I never needed money.
text: Franklin steps to the TV, turns it off.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show
dialog: us some identification with your
dialog: address -- a Driver's License, a
dialog: credit card, checkbook?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: No, I do not have any of those.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Then how about medical records?
dialog: Could you give us the name of your
dialog: doctor, or your dentist?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I have no need for a doctor or
dialog: dentist. I have never been ill. I
dialog: have never been allowed outside of
dialog: this house, and, except for Joe, I
dialog: have never had any visitors.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: ... Joe? Who's Joe?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (turns TV back on)
dialog: Joe Saracini. He was a mason that
dialog: did some repairs on the brickwork
text: at the rear of the house. That was
dialog: in 1952.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: 1952...?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (changes channels)
dialog: Yes. I remember when he came. He
dialog: was very fat and had short hair and
dialog: showed me some pictures from a
dialog: funny little book.
speaker_heading: HAYES
dialog: Some pictures...?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. Of men and women.
speaker_heading: HAYES
dialog: ... Oh.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven
dialog: years ago.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes and the Old Man used to come to
dialog: my garden. He would read and rest
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Come now, Mr. Jennings had been
dialog: bedridden for thirty-five years,
dialog: since he fractured his spine.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then
dialog: he stopped visiting my garden.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: ... We shall need some proof of
dialog: your having resided here, Mr.
dialog: Chance.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: You have me, I am here. What more
dialog: proof do you need?
text: Franklin and Hayes exchange looks.
scene_heading: INT. TOWNHOUSE - REAR ENTRANCE/HALLWAY - AFTERNOON
text: Chance puts on his snow-boots as Franklin and Hayes continue
dialog: their questioning.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Have you served in the Army?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: No, Thomas. But I have seen the
text: Army on television.
speaker_heading: HAYES
dialog: How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely
dialog: you must have paid taxes?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: No.
text: Chance picks up his slippers and leads the attorneys outside.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN - AFTERNOON
text: Chance describes his garden with pride as they walk toward
text: the rear building.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (points)
dialog: Those trees were very young when I
dialog: first arrived.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Are you related to the deceased,
dialog: Mr. Chance?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: No, I don't think so. And I have
dialog: planted and shaped all the hedges,
dialog: and in the springtime you will be
dialog: able to see my flowers.
speaker_heading: HAYES
dialog: Might you have a birth certificate,
dialog: Mr. Chance?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: No.
dialog: (points to wall)
dialog: That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
text: They arrive at the rear building and Chance opens the door to
text: the garage. Franklin and Hayes follow him inside.
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - AFTERNOON
text: Franklin and Hayes are taken aback by the touring car.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (admires car)
dialog: ... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: No, Thomas. I have never been in an
dialog: automobile.
speaker_heading: HAYES
dialog: (amazed)
dialog: You never been in a car?
text: Chance is silent for a moment, he blushes slightly.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: ... Well... From time to time I did
dialog: sit in it... Just in here... It
dialog: hasn't been outside since the Old
dialog: Man hurt himself.
dialog: (he turns)
dialog: I live in here.
text: Chance moves toward his room, Franklin and Hayes follow.
scene_heading: INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: Chance sits on the bed to remove his boots as Hayes and
text: Franklin inspect the room.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: The Old Man gave me nice television
text: sets, this one has remote control.
dialog: (he turns it on with the
dialog: remote)
dialog: He has one just like it.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Mr. Chance, the fact remains that
dialog: we have no information of your
dialog: having any connection with the
dialog: deceased.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes, I understand.
text: Chance puts on his slippers, crosses to the closet, opens the
text: door. It is filled with men's wear.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I am allowed to go to the attic and
dialog: select any of the Old Man's suits.
dialog: They all fit me very well. I can
dialog: also take his shirts, shoes and
dialog: coats.
speaker_heading: HAYES
dialog: It is quite amazing how those
text: clothes have come back into style.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. I have seen styles on
dialog: television.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (getting back to business)
dialog: What are your plans now, Mr.
dialog: Chance?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I would like to stay and work in my
dialog: garden.
text: Chance turns to watch TV. Franklin takes Hayes to a side of
dialog: the room.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: ... What do you make of all this?
speaker_heading: HAYES
dialog: I really don't know, Tom - he seems
dialog: so honest and simple... In a way,
dialog: he's quite charming...
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (looks at Chance)
dialog: ... Yeah...
speaker_heading: HAYES
dialog: ... It's very bizarre - I don't
dialog: know what to think...
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Well... He's either very, very
dialog: bright or very, very dense - he's
dialog: hard to figure...
dialog: (he unzips briefcase)
dialog: ... Let's just keep everything
dialog: legal.
text: Franklin takes out some papers, approaches Chance.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Mr. Chance, assuming what you say
dialog: is the truth, I would like to know
dialog: what sort of claim you are planning
dialog: to make against the deceased's
dialog: estate.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (does not understand)
dialog: I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a
dialog: healthy one. There is no need for a
dialog: claim.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Good. That's good. Then if you
dialog: would please sign a paper to that
dialog: effect.
text: Franklin hands the release to Chance but Chance does not take
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: No, Thomas. I don't know how to
dialog: sign.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Come now, Mr. Chance.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I have no claim, Thomas.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: But you won't sign, correct?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Correct.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Very well, Mr. Chance - if you
dialog: insist on dragging this matter
dialog: on... But I must inform you this
dialog: house will be closed tomorrow at
dialog: noon. If indeed, you do reside
dialog: here, you will have to move out.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Move out? I don't understand,
dialog: Thomas.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: I think you do, Mr. Chance.
dialog: However, I will reiterate, this
dialog: house is closed and you must
dialog: leave...
dialog: (he gives Chance his
dialog: business card)
dialog: Call me if you change your mind
dialog: about signing.
dialog: (turns to Hayes)
dialog: C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...
speaker_heading: HAYES
dialog: (a smile to Chance)
dialog: Good day, Mr. Chance.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (returns smile)
dialog: Good day, Sally.
text: Chance watches as they leave, then puts Franklin's card on a
text: desk without ever looking at it and turns to stare at
dialog: television.
scene_heading: INT. TOWNHOUSE - ATTIC - AFTERNOON
text: A large attic filled with the Old Man's possessions of the
text: past. Chance enters, turns on an old black-and-white TV with
text: a magnifying lens attached to the front. As it plays, he
text: selects a fine leather suitcase from several, takes a hand
text: made suit from a long rack.
scene_heading: INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: The TV is on as Chance packs his belongings.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN - AFTERNOON
text: Chance, very nicely dressed, comes out of the rear building
text: carrying his suitcase. He stops on occasion to inspect his
text: garden as he walks toward the townhouse.
scene_heading: INT. TOWNHOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - AFTERNOON
text: Chance is reluctant to open the front door. After some
text: hesitation, he gathers up his courage, opens it and steps
text: outside, closing the door behind him.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT OF TOWNHOUSE - AFTERNOON
text: Chance stops short on the front steps; the townhouse is
text: situated in a decaying ghetto.
text: The snow is a dirty grey, houses adjoining have their windows
text: shattered, are smeared with grafitti. Chance tries to return
text: to the safety of the townhouse, but the door is locked. He
text: stands on the steps for a moment, then moves to the trash
text: laden sidewalk. He stops, ponders which way to go, finally
text: makes up his mind and moves off to his left.
scene_heading: EXT. GHETTO STREET - AFTERNOON
text: The buildings are crumbling, rusted out cars line the street.
text: A group of Black people huddle together in threadbare stuffed
text: furniture on the sidewalk, a fire burning between them for
text: warmth. Chance rounds the corner, walks up to them. He stands
text: by them, smiles. They stare back, no sign of friendship in
text: their faces. Chance nods politely to them, then walks away
text: down the sidewalk.
scene_heading: EXT. GHETTO STREET - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON
text: A group of eight to ten hard-core ghetto youths hang out on a
text: corner. Other passersby give them a wide berth, they are
text: unapproachable. Chance nears the group, approaches.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (friendly)
dialog: ... Excuse me, would you please
dialog: tell me where I could find a garden
dialog: to work in?
text: They turn to him as one, silent, amazed that this White
text: trespasser would intrude on their jiving.
speaker_heading: CHANCE (CONT'D)
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: ... There is much to be done during
dialog: the winter, I must start the seeds
dialog: for the spring, I must work the
dialog: soil...
text: One of the Black youths, LOLO, interrupts Chance.
speaker_heading: LOLO
dialog: What you growin', man?
text: The leader of the gang, ABBAZ, shuts up Lolo with an elbow
text: and moves menacingly forward.
speaker_heading: ABBAZ
dialog: (nose to nose with Chance)
dialog: ... What you doin' here, boy?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I had to leave my garden. I want to
dialog: find another.
speaker_heading: ABBAZ
dialog: Bullshit. Who sent you here, boy?
dialog: Did that chickenshit asshole
dialog: Raphael send you here, boy?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: No. Thomas Franklin told me that I
dialog: had to leave the Old Man's house,
dialog: he's dead now, you know...
speaker_heading: ABBAZ
dialog: Dead, my ass! Now get this, honkie -
dialog: you go tell Raphael that I ain't
dialog: takin' no jive from no Western
dialog: Union messenger! You tell that
dialog: asshole, if he got somethin' to
dialog: tell me to get his ass here
dialog: himself!
dialog: (edges closer to Chance)
dialog: You got that, boy?
text: Chance smiles at Abbaz and reaches into his pocket.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. I understand.
text: (he takes out his remote
dialog: control TV changer)
dialog: If I see Raphael I will tell him.
text: Chance points the changer at Abbaz and clicks it three times,
text: tries to change the picture. Abbaz immediately pulls out a
text: switchblade, whips the blade open.
speaker_heading: ABBAZ
dialog: (holds knife at Chance)
dialog: Now, move, honkie! Before I cut
dialog: your white ass!
text: Chance, disappointed that the changer did not work, returns
text: it to his pocket.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. Of course.
dialog: (as he leaves)
dialog: Good day.
text: Abbaz, Lolo and the gang watch him go, then begin to buzz
dialog: with excitement: "Who the fuck died?" "Why'd he pull that
dialog: changer on us, man?" "The Old Man died, must be Papa Joe!"
dialog: "He's some weird honkie, man."
scene_heading: EXT. CHINATOWN - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON
text: A Bulletin board affixed to a storefront in Chinatown. Chance
text: gazes at the notes pinned to it, written in Chinese. Smiling,
text: he turns from it, walks on through the area.
scene_heading: EXT. PORNO AREA - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON
text: A street lined with adult book stores, X-rated movies and
text: strip joints. An elderly Black woman approaches carrying a
text: bag of groceries. Chance steps in front of the woman, stops
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I'm very hungry now. Would you
dialog: please bring me my lunch?
text: The woman looks up to Chance, becomes very frightened. She
text: turns and half-runs into a sleazy bar for safety. Chance
text: watches after her for a moment, then continues along.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON
text: Chance stands looking through a chain-link fence watching
text: some teenage boys playing basketball. He bangs on the fence,
text: calls to them.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I have seen your game! I have
dialog: watched Elvin Hayes play it many
dialog: times! They call him "Big E!"
text: The boys ignore him, Chance walks away.
scene_heading: EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Chance walks down the center meridian of a divided street. He
text: seems oblivious to the automobiles passing on either side. In
text: the background can be seen the Washington Monument.
scene_heading: EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Chance seems stumped on which way to go. He looks up one
text: street, then the other, has no idea where they lead. He
text: turns, looks behind him and sees a large statue of Benito
text: Juarez pointing. Chance smiles and goes off in the direction
dialog: that Benito points.
scene_heading: EXT. REAR OF THE WHITE HOUSE - DUSK
text: Tourists are gathered around gaping through the fence at the
dialog: White House.
text: Chance is turned the other way, inspecting the branches of a
text: dying tree. Chance moves to a POLICEMAN standing nearby.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Excuse me...
dialog: (points to tree)
dialog: ... That tree is very sick. It
dialog: should be cared for.
text: The Policeman looks at the tree, then at Chance, figures a
dialog: man dressed that well must be important.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Yes sir. I'll report it right away.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. That would be a good thing to
dialog: do. Good day.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Good day.
text: The Policeman takes out his walkie-talkie as Chance walks
dialog: away.
scene_heading: EXT. BUSINESS DISTRICT - EVENING
text: A fashionable area. Expensive shops, well-kept streets and
text: sidewalks. A television store has caught Chance's eye. He
text: stands by the display window, looks in at a dozen or so color
text: TVs, all turned on, playing various channels. A video camera
text: points outward from a corner of the window and is focused on
dialog: the sidewalk to allow potential customers to see themselves
text: live on an Advent TV. Chance is intrigued by his own image.
text: He poses, lifts one arm, then the other to make sure that it
text: is really him on television. He moves forward, smiles, then
text: moves slowly backward, notices himself become smaller on the
text: screen. He steps back off the curb, frowns as his likeness
text: disappears from frame on the Advent. Standing between two
text: parked cars, Chance takes out his remote control, clicks it
text: at the Advent. Four or five other sets in the window change
text: channels, but he does not reappear on the giant screen. As he
text: does this, the car to his,left, a large, American-made
text: limousine, backs up. The car bumps Chance, pins him against
text: the car to his right. Chance cries out in pain, drops his
text: suitcase, his changer, and bangs his hand on the trunk of the
text: limo. The chauffeur, DAVID, and the liveryman, JEFFREY,
text: immediately jump from the car, run back to Chance.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm very sorry, sir... I...
text: David and Jeffrey reach out to help, but Chance is wedged
text: solidly between the two cars.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (in pain)
dialog: ... I can't move... My leg...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (rushes back to limo)
dialog: ... My Lord...
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: This is terrible, sir - I hope
dialog: you're not badly injured...
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: No. I'm not badly injured. But my
text: leg is very sore.
text: David pulls the car forward, freeing Chance. A few bystanders
text: begin to gather as Jeffrey helps Chance to the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Can you walk? It's not broken, is
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
text: (leans against limo, holds
dialog: leg)
dialog: It's very sore.
text: David gets out of the car, comes back.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Perhaps I should call an ambulance.
text: A BYSTANDER interrupts.
speaker_heading: BYSTANDER
dialog: Somebody ought to call the police!
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (looks over, smiles)
dialog: There's no need for police, it's
dialog: just my leg.
text: During this, the rear door of the limo opens and EVE RAND
text: steps out. Eve is in her late thirties, has the look of a
text: traditional New England lady. She watches as Jeffrey tends to
dialog: Chance.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: I don't think we should call anyone
dialog: just yet, it may not even be all
dialog: that serious.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (obviously hurting)
dialog: I agree.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Let's have a look, do you mind?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Of course. I would like to look.
text: Chance bends, raises his trouser leg. A red-bluish swollen
text: bruise, three inches in diameter, is forming on his calf.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: It's starting to swell, is it
dialog: painful?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes.
text: Eve moves closer to Chance, looks at the bruise.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (to Chance)
dialog: ... Won't you let us do something
dialog: for you? Your leg should be
dialog: examined, we could take you to a
dialog: hospital.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (smiles at Eve)
dialog: There's no need for a hospital.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Why, there certainly is. You must
dialog: see a doctor, I insist on it.
dialog: Please, let us take you.
text: Eve turns to get back into the limo. David goes with her to
text: hold the door.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Rand, I
dialog: never saw the man.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Oh, I don't think it was anyone's
dialog: fault, David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thank you, ma'am.
text: Chance is hesitant about getting in the car. Jeffrey offers a
text: helping hand.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Please, sir.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I've never ridden in an automobile.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I assure you, sir, David is a very
dialog: careful driver. Please, won't you
dialog: let us take you?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
text: (looks at the car, then
dialog: decides)
dialog: ... Yes. You can take me.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Very good.
text: Jeffrey assists Chance into the rear seat of the limo.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (as he gets in)
dialog: ... My suitcase.
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Yes sir. I'll take care of that.
text: Jeffrey closes the door, goes back to pick up Chance's
text: suitcase, does not notice the remote control. As Jeffrey puts
text: Chance's bag into the trunk, we see the personalized license
dialog: plate "RAND l."
scene_heading: INT. LIMOUSINE - EVENING
text: Chance and Eve settle in the back seat. As they talk, David
text: starts up the limo, Jeffrey joins him in front and the limo
text: pulls out into traffic.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I hope you're comfortable.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. I am.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: These can be such trying situations
dialog: everyone seems to make such a to-do
dialog: over a simple little accident. Of
dialog: course, they can be very
dialog: frightening, and I must apologize
dialog: for David, he's never had an
dialog: accident before.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. He's a very careful driver.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: ... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg
dialog: feeling any better?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
text: It's feeling better, but it's still
dialog: very sore.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I see.
dialog: (a thought)
dialog: ... Say, would you mind seeing our
dialog: family doctor?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (doesn't understand)
dialog: Your family doctor?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Yes. My husband has been very ill.
text: His doctor and nurses are staying
dialog: with us. Those hospitals can be so
dialog: impersonal - why, it might be hours
dialog: before you are treated...
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I agree.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Fine, it will save a lot of
dialog: unnecessary fuss and it will be so
dialog: much more pleasant for you...
dialog: (leans forward)
dialog: David, we'll just go on home.
dialog: Jeffrey, would you call and let
dialog: them know?
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Yes ma'am.
text: Eve presses a button, the glass partition closes. As the
text: window rolls up behind him, Jeffrey dials the limo telephone.
text: There is a moment of silence. Eve, still a bit on edge from
text: the accident and feeling a bit uncomfortable with a stranger
text: in the car, presses another button. The limo's bar moves out,
text: revealing a row of decanters and glasses.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Would you care for a drink?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. Thank you.
text: As Eve pours cognac into a monogrammed crystal glass, Chance
text: notices the limo's TV set.
speaker_heading: CHANCE (CONT'D)
dialog: I would like to watch television.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (a bit surprised)
dialog: Oh? Certainly...
text: She hands Chance the cognac, turns on the TV.
speaker_heading: EVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Hello, Eve.
text: Chance takes a sip of the cognac, is not accustomed to
text: alcohol, coughs. There is another moment of silence.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: May I ask your name?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (with a slight cough)
dialog: My name is Chance.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (still indistinct)
dialog: No. I'm a gardener.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey
dialog: Gardiner... You're not related to
dialog: Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil
dialog: and Perdita.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful
dialog: couple, we've been friends for
dialog: years. We visit their island quite
dialog: often.
text: Chance reaches out to change the channel on the TV, suddenly
text: realizes he doesn't have his remote control. He starts going
text: through his pockets, searches for it.
speaker_heading: EVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you lose something?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. I lost my remote control.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Oh... Well, I'm very sorry...
text: Another pause, Chance reaches out, changes channels on TV.
speaker_heading: EVE (CONT'D)
dialog: ... I'll feel so relieved after Dr.
dialog: Allenby examines your leg. After
dialog: that, David can run you on home, or
dialog: to your office or wherever you'd
dialog: prefer...
dialog: (Chance still watches TV)
dialog: ... Is there anything special you
dialog: would like to watch?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I like to watch. This is fine.
text: Chance watches the news. Eve sips on her cognac as David
text: eases the limo out of the city of Washington.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - WOODED AREA - NIGHT
text: The limo approaches, then turns into the entrance-way of the
text: Rand Estate. Two guards stand on either side of the open
text: gate, salute as the car passes through.
scene_heading: EXT. RAND DRIVE - NIGHT
text: The drive runs alongside a stream, then turns and crosses a
text: large meadow. The limousine passes, still no sign of the
text: house. It is a very, very long driveway.
scene_heading: INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
text: Chance is glued to the TV, switches channels, again watches
text: the news. Eve takes his fascination with television as a sign
dialog: of intelligence.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I can see that it must be very
dialog: important for you to stay informed
dialog: of all the latest events.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I admire that in a person. As for
dialog: myself, I find there is so much to
dialog: assimilate that it can become quite
dialog: muddling at times...
text: Chance nods, changes the channel, watches a Mighty Mouse
text: cartoon. Eve looks at him perplexed, then takes it for a joke
text: and smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. RAND MANSION - NIGHT
text: Two uniformed valets, WILSON and PERKINS, await the
text: limousines by the front door of the Rand mansion. Wilson
text: stands behind a wheelchair. As the limo parks, Perkins and
text: Jeffrey assist Chance into the chair. Wilson turns to Eve as
text: she gets out of the limo.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Good evening, Wilson.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: I shall take the gentleman to the
dialog: third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr.
text: Allenby is standing by.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Thank you, Wilson. That will be
dialog: fine.
text: Perkins and Jeffrey carry Chance in the chair up the steps
text: and into the house. Eve and Wilson follow.
scene_heading: INT. RAND MANSION - FRONT HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Once inside the house, Wilson takes over wheeling Chance. A
text: lady, GRETA, is waiting to take Eve's coat.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Thank you, Greta.
dialog: (to Wilson)
dialog: I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm
dialog: needed.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (to Chance)
dialog: I'll see you after the doctor has a
dialog: look at your leg, Mr. Gardiner.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (looking around mansion)
dialog: Yes, I think he should examine my
dialog: leg.
text: Eve watches as Wilson wheels Chance around a corner.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
text: The doors open, Wilson pushes Chance into the elevator. As
text: Wilson pushes a button and the doors close on them, a strange
text: look comes over Chance's face.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (looks to Wilson)
dialog: ... I've never been in one of
dialog: these.
text: Wilson thinks that Chance is talking about the wheelchair.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: It's one of Mr. Rand's. Since he's
dialog: been ill...
text: Chance looks around the elevator.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Does it have a television?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: No - but Mr. Rand does have one
dialog: with an electric motor, that way he
dialog: can get around by himself.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I see.
text: Chance again checks out the elevator.
speaker_heading: CHANCE (CONT'D)
dialog: How long do we stay in here?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: How long? I don't know, see what
dialog: the doctor says ...
text: The elevator stops on the third floor.
scene_heading: INT. RAND MANSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: A hallway adjoining a large, glass-enclosed room. Eve passes
text: through the hall, enters the room.
scene_heading: INT. BENJAMIN RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Eve enters into a hermetically sealed area, set up with all
dialog: the latest hospital emergency gear; oxygen, EKG machine, X
text: ray machine, transfusion equipment, sterilizers, etc.
text: BENJAMIN RAND, wearing a silk bathrobe, lies in a king-sized
text: bed in the center of the room. A nurse, CONSTANCE, is
text: attending to her duties in the room, looks up as Eve comes
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Good evening, Constance.
text: Ben Rand perks up as he sees Eve crossing to him. He is in
text: his sixties, maintains an inner strength and dignity despite
text: the sapping effects of his illness.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: (with weakness)
dialog: ... Eve...
text: Eve kisses him, holds his hand.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm
dialog: out... How are you feeling?
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: Tired... And I'm getting tired of
dialog: being so tired. Other than that,
dialog: I'm doing very well.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: No headaches?
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: No, it's been a good day - better
dialog: than yours, from what I've been
dialog: told.
speaker_heading: EVE
text: (holds his hand against
dialog: her cheek)
dialog: You heard?
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: I may be a shut-in, but I do not
dialog: lack for news. I'm sorry you had to
dialog: go through all that.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Oh, it wasn't all that bad,
dialog: darling. We were fortunate that Mr.
dialog: Gardiner turned out to be so
dialog: reasonable.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet
dialog: a reasonable man. Why don't you ask
dialog: this Gardiner to join us for
dialog: dinner?
speaker_heading: EVE
text: (sits on the side of the
dialog: bed)
dialog: Do you feel well enough for that?
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if
dialog: I wait until I feel better, will I
dialog: ever meet the man?
text: There is silence from Eve. Rand squeezes her hand, turns to
dialog: Constance.
speaker_heading: RAND (CONT'D)
dialog: Constance! I want new blood
dialog: tonight, I'm getting up for dinner.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: But, Mr. Rand...
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: Don't argue, tell Robert I want new
dialog: blood!
dialog: (turns to Eve)
dialog: ... Ask him to dinner.
text: Rand pulls Eve's hand close, kisses it.
scene_heading: INT. EAST WING GUEST SUITE - NIGHT
text: An enormous bedroom, filled with 18th Century antique
text: furniture. DR. ROBERT ALLENBY dabs Chance's ass with a piece
text: of cotton soaked in alcohol, prior to an injection. Chance
text: stands with his pants to the floor, looks to the television
text: which is not turned on.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: The injection will ease the pain
text: and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I understand. I've seen it done
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: Now, you'll barely feel this. It
dialog: won't hurt at all.
text: Allenby administers the injection, Chance reacts from the
dialog: pain.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: You were wrong, it did hurt.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: (a chuckle)
dialog: But not for long...
text: As Allenby puts a band-aid on Chance's ass, Chance spots a
text: remote control for the TV on the bedside table. He reaches
text: out, picks it up.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY (CONT'D)
dialog: It's good that there was no
text: apparent damage to the bone.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. I think so, too.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: However, with injuries such as
dialog: this, I have run into minor
dialog: hemorrhaging, which really isn't
dialog: too serious at the time, but can
dialog: cause secondary problems if not
dialog: looked after.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I see.
text: Chance turns on the TV.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: (a look to the TV, then to
dialog: Chance)
dialog: You can pull your trousers up, now.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Oh, fine.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: (as Chance pulls up pants)
dialog: Just to take the proper
dialog: precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd
dialog: recommend we take you downstairs
dialog: and X-ray your leg.
dialog: (no reaction from Chance,
text: Allenby takes a long look
dialog: at him)
dialog: ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I
dialog: would like to ask you something
dialog: straight out.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (doesn't understand)
dialog: ... Straight out?
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: Yes. Are you planning on making any
dialog: sort of claim against the Rand's?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's
dialog: what Thomas asked me.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: Thomas? Who's Thomas?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: An attorney?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (turns back to TV)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: (suddenly very cold)
dialog: Then you wish to handle this matter
dialog: through your attorneys?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: There's no need for a claim, the
dialog: garden is a healthy one.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: (gives Chance a look)
dialog: Oh, I see...
dialog: (warms up)
dialog: ... Well, then... You're a very
dialog: funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught
dialog: me off guard, I must admit...
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (changes channels, sits on
dialog: bed)
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: Good, keep your weight off that
dialog: leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it
dialog: would be best if you could stay
dialog: here for a day or two, if that
dialog: would be would be possible. Since
dialog: Benjamin became ill we have our own
dialog: hospital downstairs. I can promise
dialog: you the finest in care, unless, of
dialog: course, you would prefer to go
dialog: elsewhere.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: Fine. Would you like me to speak to
dialog: your personal physician?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: No.
text: Allenby waits for Chance to say more, he does not. Finally,
text: Allenby picks up his bag, heads for the door.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: (stops by door)
dialog: I'll send Wilson up to take you for
dialog: X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to
dialog: use the telephone, and please let
dialog: me know if you have any discomfort.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (clicking changer)
dialog: Yes, I will.
text: Allenby gives him a look, then leaves. Chance watches an old
text: movie of a man lighting a cigar. The man enjoys the cigar,
text: blows out smoke. The scene seems to 'sink into' Chance's
dialog: mind.
scene_heading: EXT. MANSION - PATIO - NIGHT
text: Eve sits next to a roaring patio fireplace with a steaming
text: cup of tea. Allenby comes outside, joins her.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I wanted some fresh air, Robert.
dialog: How is Mr. Gardiner?
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: A rather large contusion, but I
dialog: don't feel there is any serious
dialog: damage. I'd like to keep an eye on
dialog: him, though - I suggested that he
dialog: stay here for a couple of days.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Stay here? Is that necessary?
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: Not necessary, but preferable. I
dialog: don't think he'll be a bother, he
dialog: seems like a most refreshing sort
dialog: of man.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Yes, he is different... Not the
dialog: kind of person one usually meets in
dialog: Washington.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a
dialog: welcome change of pace.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: He's very intense, and internal,
dialog: don't you think?
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: At times, yes. But that's not an
dialog: uncommon reaction to such an
dialog: accident. Actually, I found him to
dialog: have quite a sense of humor.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Good. It might be pleasant for a
dialog: couple of days.
dialog: (Eve puts down her tea)
dialog: ... Robert... Is there any
dialog: improvement...?
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: No, Eve... I'm sorry.
text: Eve is silent for a moment, looks out to the darkness.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: ... Sometimes when I see Ben I
dialog: could swear that he's getting
dialog: stronger... Something that he might
dialog: say, the way he moves, or a look in
dialog: his eyes - makes me feel that this
dialog: is all a nightmare and that he'll
dialog: be better soon... It's just so hard
dialog: to believe what's really
dialog: happening...
text: Allenby reaches out, holds Eve's hand.
scene_heading: INT. RAND MANSION - FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: The elevator door opens, Wilson guides Chance in the
text: wheelchair into the hallway.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (looks back to elevator)
dialog: ... That is a very small room.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Yes sir, I guess that's true
text: smallest room in the house.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (glancing around)
dialog: Yes. It seems to be.
text: Wilson takes this as another joke, chuckles as he wheels
text: Chance toward Rand's hospital room.
scene_heading: INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
text: CONSTANCE and another nurse, TERESA, stand by as Rand is
text: being given a transfusion. Rand lifts his head as Wilson
text: wheels Chance into the room.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital,
dialog: Mr. Gardiner.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (looks around room)
dialog: ... I see.
text: Wilson pushes Chance to the X-Ray machine, where the
text: technician, BILLINGS, a Black man, waits. As Wilson and
text: Billings help Chance onto the X-Ray table, Chance's face
text: brightens up.
speaker_heading: CHANCE (CONT'D)
dialog: I feel very good in here.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: Sure you do. This ward is air
dialog: tight, I have a little extra oxygen
dialog: pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. I like that very much.
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: (lining up Chance's leg)
dialog: This won't take long, Mr. Gardiner.
dialog: Please hold still when I ask.
text: Chance stares at Billings, reacts to him being Black.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (to Billings)
dialog: Do you know Raphael?
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: No sir, I don't believe I do.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Oh. I have a message for him.
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: A Black man gave me the message.
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: Well, I still don't believe I know
dialog: the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold
dialog: still.
text: Rand looks over as Billings takes the X-Ray.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: Aplastic anemia, Mr. Gardiner -
dialog: aplastic anemia.
text: Chance smiles to Rand.
speaker_heading: RAND (CONT'D)
dialog: Failure of the bone marrow to
dialog: produce red blood cells... Not a
dialog: damn thing they can do about it.
dialog: Oh, they can make me comfortable,
dialog: prolong my life with steroid
dialog: therapy and transfusions... And
dialog: what makes my blood boil, what
dialog: little I have left, that is, Mr.
dialog: Gardiner - is that it's generally a
dialog: young person's disease... Here I
dialog: am, getting on in years and about
dialog: to die of a young person's
dialog: disease...
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (still smiles at Rand)
dialog: Yes. You look very sick.
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: Hold still, please, Mr. Gardiner.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: (a laugh)
dialog: I am very sick, and, as you can see
dialog: by all this paraphernalia, I am
dialog: very wealthy. I think I would
dialog: rather be wealthy and sick than
dialog: poor and sick.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (looks around the room)
dialog: I understand. I've never seen
dialog: anything like this on television.
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: You too, Mr. Rand, you must stay
dialog: quiet.
text: Rand lays his head back.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: ... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner -
dialog: we're prisoners of tubes and
dialog: technology.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I agree.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: (flat on his back)
dialog: ... You will join us for dinner,
dialog: won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (also flat on his back)
dialog: Yes. I am very hungry.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: ... So am I, my boy - so am I.
scene_heading: INT. RAND DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: THURMAND, a waiter, and MARIANNE, a waitress, enter into the
text: Rand dining room carrying trays of food. The dining room is
text: immense, a 70-foot ceiling, huge fireplace. Allenby, Eve,
text: Rand, and Chance (both in wheelchairs) sit around the table.
text: Rand speaks slowly, with obvious weakness.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: I know exactly what you mean. Today
text: the businessman is at the mercy of
dialog: kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they
dialog: want to do is regulate our natural
dialog: growth! It's happening across the
dialog: country!
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: To everyone, I'm afraid. The
dialog: Government controls are so
dialog: restricting that the Medical
dialog: Profession, as we know it, is being
text: legislated out of existence.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: Of course! By kid-lawyers!
text: Eve turns to Chance.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Won't your injury prevent you from
dialog: attending to business, Mr.
dialog: Gardiner?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: No. It won't do that.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: ... Would you like us to notify
dialog: anyone for you?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: No. The Old Man died and Louise
dialog: left.
text: There is a moment of silence.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you
dialog: have any need for any of our
dialog: facilities, please do not hesitate
dialog: to ask.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: Do you need a secretary?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: No, thank you. My house has been
dialog: closed.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: Oh. When you say 'Your house has
dialog: been closed', you mean to say that
dialog: your business was shut down?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. Shut down and locked by the
dialog: attorneys.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The
dialog: S.E.C.! Damn them!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I hope that staying here won't be
dialog: an inconvenience for you.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: No. I like it here.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I
dialog: call you Chauncey?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (agreeable to being called
dialog: Chauncey)
dialog: Yes. Chauncey is fine.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: And I'm Ben.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: (smiles to Chance)
dialog: ... And please call me Robert.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes, Robert. I will.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: So tell me, Chauncey, what are your
dialog: plans now?
text: Chance looks around the room.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Does this house have a garden?
text: Allenby gives Chance a look.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow,
dialog: Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I see. I would like to work in your
dialog: garden.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I
dialog: sometimes enjoy puttering around
dialog: myself, such a pleasant way to
dialog: forget one's troubles.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I am a very good gardener.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: A gardener! Well put, Chauncey
dialog: excellent! Isn't that what a
dialog: businessman is? A gardener? A
dialog: person that makes flinty soil
dialog: productive with the labor of his
dialog: own hands, who waters it with the
text: sweat from his own brow, and who
dialog: creates a place of value for his
dialog: family and community? Yes,
dialog: Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor
dialog: -- yes, indeed, a productive
text: businessman is a laborer in his own
dialog: vineyard.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Thank you, Ben. The garden that I
dialog: left was such a place. Everything
dialog: which grew there was with the labor
dialog: of my own hands. I planted seeds
dialog: and watered them and watched
dialog: everything grow.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: Bravo!
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: But I don't have that any more...
dialog: (points to ceiling)
dialog: ... All that's left for me now is
text: the room upstairs.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: Now, wait a minute, Chauncey you
dialog: are young, you are healthy, for
dialog: God's sake don't give up on
dialog: yourself! You have to fight! You
dialog: can't let those bastards keep you
dialog: down! I don't want to hear any more
dialog: from you about the 'Room Upstairs'.
dialog: That's where I'm going soon.
text: There is a long pause. Chance looks up, then smiles at Rand.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what
dialog: they say, anyway.
text: Another period of silence. The servants bustle around the
text: room as Allenby studies Chance.
scene_heading: INT. RAND'S POOL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Allenby opens the door. Rand enters in his electric
text: wheelchair followed by Chance being pushed by Wilson.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: ... I don't know what you've heard
dialog: about me, Chauncey, but I'm sure
dialog: you know everything there is to
dialog: know. Cigar?
text: Rand holds out humidor to Chance.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes, thank you.
dialog: (takes cigar)
dialog: No Ben. I don't know everything
dialog: about you.
text: Rand smiles as he takes a cigar for himself.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: ... No, of course you don't. Excuse
dialog: me for being so presumptuous. No
dialog: man knows everything about another
dialog: man - however, very few are honest
dialog: enough to admit it.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: That is so true. You're different,
dialog: Chauncey... Quite different than
dialog: most men.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Thank you, Robert.
text: Rand lights his own cigar, then hands an ornate lighter to
dialog: Chance.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: (picks up pool cue, weakly
dialog: strokes the balls)
dialog: ... You know, Chauncey, there are
dialog: thousands of American businessmen,
dialog: large and small, that share your
dialog: plight. I've been concerned with
dialog: the situation for some time now.
text: Chance, not knowing to bite off the tip, tries to light the
text: cigar like the man on TV. It will not light.
speaker_heading: RAND (CONT'D)
dialog: So I've been thinking about
dialog: beginning a financial assistance
dialog: program, Chauncey, to help out
dialog: American businessmen that have been
dialog: harassed by inflation, excessive
dialog: taxation, unions and other
dialog: indecencies...
text: Allenby watches Chance trying to light the cigar as Rand
text: speaks on, shooting pool as he talks.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: ... I'd like to offer the decent
dialog: 'Gardeners' of the business
text: community a helping hand. After
dialog: all, they are our strongest defense
dialog: against the pollutants who so
dialog: threaten our basic freedoms and the
dialog: well-being of our middle class.
dialog: Tell me, would you have any
dialog: thoughts on such a program?
text: Chance puts the unlit cigar in the ashtray, smiles at
text: Allenby, then answers Rand.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: No, Ben.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: (a smile)
dialog: Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey?
dialog: Well, I can understand that. When a
dialog: man loses everything, anger has a
dialog: tendency to block out reason for a
dialog: time. Just give it some thought,
dialog: work with the idea, I'm sure you'll
dialog: have plenty to say in a few days.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I could give it some thought, Ben,
dialog: but my leg is very sore.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: ... Oh?
dialog: (looks to Allenby)
dialog: Robert, take a look, would you?
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: Some pain is to be expected...
text: (bends to Chance, looks at
dialog: leg)
dialog: ... And I think what would be best
dialog: for the two of you is a good
dialog: night's rest.
dialog: (checks watch)
dialog: ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time
dialog: for my patients to prepare for bed.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: (puts down pool cue)
dialog: We have common foes, Chauncey - kid
dialog: lawyers and our physician!
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I agree.
text: Allenby laughs as he takes Rand's cigar from him, snuffs it
text: in the ashtray.
scene_heading: INT. MANSION - ELEVATOR - NIGHT
text: Wilson stands behind Chance in the wheelchair. Chance glances
text: slowly and inquisitively around the elevator. When his eyes
text: meet Wilson's, the valet breaks out in laughter.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: (laughing, trying to
dialog: apologize)
dialog: ... Sorry, sir - I just couldn't
dialog: contain myself... I knew you were
dialog: going to come out with another one
dialog: of your jests about the elevator...
dialog: Excuse me, sir...
text: The elevator stops, the door opens.
scene_heading: INT. MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Wilson wheels Chance out of the elevator.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
text: (looks back as the door
dialog: closes)
dialog: ... Hmmm... Elevator.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (laughs again)
dialog: ... Yes sir - elevator!
text: Wilson stops laughing, becomes the stone-faced servant once
text: again as he notices Eve coming out of her bedroom. Wilson
text: stops wheeling Chance, stands stiffly at attention as Eve and
dialog: Chance talk.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how
dialog: dreadful I feel about the accident
dialog: today, but that I'm delighted that
dialog: you are staying with us.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Thank you, Eve - I like this house
dialog: very much.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: ... And Ben is just mad about you -
dialog: you've lifted his spirits so - it's
dialog: just... Well, it's just a real
dialog: pleasure having you with us.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen
dialog: that before.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Yes... I know, Chauncey.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I like Ben very much... He reminds
dialog: me of the Old Man...
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: He does...?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. Are you going to leave and
dialog: close the house when he dies?
text: Eve is not prepared for such a question.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: ... Why... No, I don't think so...
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: That's good.
text: Chance smiles at Eve and there is a moment of silence before
text: Eve steps back into her bedroom.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: ... Good night, Chauncey.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Good night, Eve.
text: Eve closes the door. Wilson wheels Chance down the hallway
text: toward the guest room.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT OF RAND MANSION - MORNING
text: Eve comes out of the house, Jeffrey holds the door for her as
text: she gets into "RAND l." Jeffrey gets in and the limo pulls
text: away. Chance comes out of the front door, walking with a
text: limp. His first view of the Rand grounds in the daylight, he
text: is taken by the extent of the greenery. An attendant, LEWIS,
text: hurries to Chance.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Did you want a car, sir?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. I would like a car.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Lewis goes to his post, picks up a phone. As Chance looks at
text: the surroundings, Allenby and Wilson, with Chance's
text: wheelchair, come out of the house.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
text: (frowns as he sees Chance
dialog: walking)
dialog: Chauncey, there you are. What are
dialog: you doing on that leg?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: It's fine today, Robert.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: Shame on you, Chauncey - you should
dialog: let me be the judge of that.
dialog: (motions to Wilson)
dialog: Please, sit in the chair.
text: Wilson pushes the wheelchair to Chance, he sits.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY (CONT'D)
dialog: (checks leg)
dialog: I swear, Chauncey, between you and
dialog: Benjamin, I've got my hands full...
dialog: (looks at calf)
dialog: ... Say, that is coming along, the
dialog: swelling has gone down
dialog: considerably...
dialog: (pokes a spot)
dialog: ... Any pain here?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.
text: A limousine pulls up to the front of the mansion, waits for
dialog: Chance.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: (continues examining)
dialog: ... Benjamin has been hounding me
dialog: to allow him to address the annual
dialog: meeting of his Financial Institute
dialog: today, but obviously, the strain
dialog: would be impossible... How about
dialog: here, Chauncey, any soreness?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Hardly any, Robert.
text: Lewis, the attendant, interrupts.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Your limousine, sir.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Oh, thank you.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: (reacting to limo)
dialog: ... Were you going somewhere?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: No, Robert.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: ... Oh.
dialog: (checks leg)
dialog: ... My God, I only wish that
dialog: Benjamin had your recuperative
dialog: powers... Anyway, the President
dialog: offered to sit in for Ben at the
dialog: meeting, quite a nice gesture, I
dialog: felt. He's due here soon, I
dialog: believe.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes, Robert. I know about the
dialog: President.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: (mildly surprised)
dialog: ... Oh? You've heard?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to
dialog: meet the President.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: (stands)
dialog: He does, does he?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes, Ben told me to be in his room
text: at ten o'clock.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: How do I know when it's ten
dialog: o'clock?
text: A long look from Allenby, then he looks at his watch.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: ... It's five of, you'd best get on
dialog: in there.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Thank you, Robert.
text: Wilson begins to push Chance.
speaker_heading: CHANCE (CONT'D)
dialog: I would like to walk today.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the
dialog: President, aren't you?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (gets out of chair)
dialog: Oh, really?
text: Allenby, a bit puzzled, watches as Chance goes into the
dialog: house.
scene_heading: INT. RAND MANSION - HALLWAY - MORNING
text: Chance limps aimlessly through a hallway. He stops, admires a
text: large tapestry on the wall. A servant, SMYTHE, notices Chance
text: appears confused, approaches him.
speaker_heading: SMYTHE
dialog: May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: Yes. I would like to go to Rand
dialog: Memorial Hospital.
speaker_heading: SMYTHE
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: ... Sir?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes.
text: There is another long pause.
speaker_heading: SMYTHE
dialog: ... Did you wish to see someone,
dialog: sir?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes, I would like to see Ben.
speaker_heading: SMYTHE
dialog: Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this
dialog: way, sir.
text: Chance follows Smythe down the hall.
scene_heading: INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING
text: Rand is in an easy chair, dressed for his meeting with the
text: President. The two nurses are working at the disinfecting
text: table. Rand smiles as Chance is shown into the room by
dialog: Smythe.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: Chauncey, up and around this
dialog: morning, are you?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: Well, that's good news, my boy.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: You're looking much better today,
dialog: Ben.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey...
dialog: I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up,
dialog: I didn't want the President to
dialog: think I was going to die during our
dialog: talk.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I understand.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: No one likes a dying man, my boy -
dialog: because few know what death is. All
dialog: we know is the terror of it. But
dialog: you're an exception, Chauncey -
dialog: that's what I admire in you, your
dialog: marvelous balance. You don't
text: stagger back and forth between fear
dialog: and hope - you're a truly peaceful
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Thank you, Ben.
dialog: (looks at Rand closely)
dialog: ... The nurse did a very good job,
dialog: Ben.
text: The nurses turn, look at Chance.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT RAND MANSION - MORNING

speaker_heading: WOLTZ
dialog: Good morning, Mr. Wilson.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Good morning, Mr. Woltz, nice to
dialog: see you again.
speaker_heading: WOLTZ
dialog: Thank you. How have you been?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Fine, thank you.

text: moment, then heads off down the hallway in the direction of
text: Chance's room.
scene_heading: INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING
text: Chance watches television as Rand speaks.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: Yes, when I was younger I had
dialog: thoughts about public office... But
dialog: I found, Chauncey - that I was able
dialog: to contribute more as a private
dialog: citizen... of course, my wealth
dialog: provided me with considerable
dialog: influence, but I've tried, believe
dialog: me, not to misuse that power...
dialog: It's extremely important, Chauncey,
dialog: when one is in a position of
dialog: eminence, that he does not allow
dialog: himself to become blinded to the
dialog: needs of the country... The
dialog: temptations are strong, and I've
dialog: been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many,
dialog: but I have tried to stay open to
dialog: voices of the people... I have
dialog: tried to remain honest to myself...
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (changing channels)
dialog: I see, Ben.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: ... Maybe one day you shall find
dialog: yourself in a similar position,
dialog: Chauncey... Maybe one day...
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT RAND MANSION - MORNING
text: Two black limousines followed by a station wagon with small

scene_heading: INT. RAND MANSION - MRS. AUBREY'S OFFICE - MORNING
text: The nerve center of the Rand Enterprises since he has become

text: desk, answers her phone.
scene_heading: MRS. AUBREY

speaker_heading: RAND

dialog: minutes.
text: Rand hangs up the phone, turns to Chance with a twinkle in
text: his eyes.
speaker_heading: RAND (CONT'D)
dialog: It's an old habit that goes along
dialog: with power -- keep them waiting...
text: Teresa brings Rand's wheelchair to him.
speaker_heading: RAND (CONT'D)
dialog: (stands, very weak)
dialog: Not now, Teresa. I'm seeing the

speaker_heading: TERESA
dialog: But, Mr. Rand...
speaker_heading: RAND
text: (puts an arm around Chance
dialog: for support)
dialog: Shall we go, Chauncey?
speaker_heading: CHANCE

dialog: (seeing her for first
dialog: time)
dialog: I agree, Ben.
text: They shuffle off down the hallway. Chance smiles at the
text: Secret Service men that they pass.
scene_heading: INT. RAND MANSION - HALLWAY BY LIBRARY - MORNING
text: Woltz and Wilson wait by the library door. Woltz takes a
text: small metal detector from his pocket as Rand and Chance
dialog: approach.
speaker_heading: WOLTZ
dialog: Good morning, Mr. Rand.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: Woltz, how have you been?
speaker_heading: WOLTZ
dialog: (passes detector over
dialog: Rand's body)
dialog: Just fine, thank you, sir.
dialog: (turns to Chance)
dialog: And you must be Mr. Gardiner.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WOLTZ
dialog: (passes detector over
dialog: Chance)
dialog: Just a formality, Mr. Gardiner.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (as he finishes)
dialog: Thank you very much.
text: Wilson knocks lightly, then opens the library door, Rand and
text: Chance enter.
scene_heading: INT. RAND LIBRARY - MORNING
text: Rand and Chance come into the Library and the President goes
text: to Rand with both hands outstretched.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Ben!
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: (very weak)
dialog: ... Mr. President, how good to see
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: It's so good to see you too, Ben,
dialog: you look terrific!
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: (barely able to stand)
dialog: I'm not convinced of that, Mr.
dialog: President, but your visit has
dialog: raised my spirits...
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Well, I'm delighted to be here, my
dialog: friend. I've missed you.
dialog: (guides Rand to chair)
dialog: Here, sit down, get off your feet.
text: As Rand sinks into the chair, Chance approaches the President
text: with both hands outstretched.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Good morning, Mr. President.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: ... Hello.
text: Chance and the President exchange a two-handed handshake.
text: Rand, still weak from standing, catches his breath and
dialog: introduces Chance.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: Mr. President, I'd like you to meet
dialog: my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey
dialog: Gardiner.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: You look much taller on television,
dialog: Mr. President.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: ... Oh, really...
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: You will find that my house guest
dialog: does not bandy words, Mr.
dialog: President.
text: The President gives Chance a look, then laughs.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just
dialog: fine with me - I'm a man that
dialog: appreciates a frank discussion...
dialog: Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (sitting)
dialog: Yes, I will.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: (also sits)
dialog: Now, Ben, did you happen to get a
dialog: chance to...
text: Chance perks up at the mention of his name, interrupts.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes?
text: There is a beat as the President looks at Chance quizzically,
text: then he continues.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: I just wondered if you had gone
dialog: over my speech, Ben.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: Yes, I did.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: ... Well?
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: Overall - pretty good. But, Mr.
dialog: President, I think it's very
dialog: dangerous to resort to temporary
dialog: measures at this stage of the game.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Well, Ben... I...
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: I sympathize with your position,
dialog: Mr. President, I know how difficult
dialog: it is to be straightforward, the
dialog: reaction to such a speech could be
dialog: chaos.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: That's too big a risk, I can't take
dialog: the chance.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (again perks up)
dialog: Yes?
text: Once again, the President gives Chance a puzzled look.
scene_heading: INT. RAND MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - MORNING
text: Perkins accompanies Secret Service Agent RIFF as he checks
text: out the third floor. Riff knocks on each door, looks inside,
text: then moves in.
scene_heading: INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - MORNING
text: Allenby is searching through Chancels clothes looking for
text: some sort of identification. There is a knock at the door,
text: Allenby pulls back from the closet as Riff opens the door,
text: looks inside.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: Oh... Hello.
speaker_heading: RIFF
dialog: (entering)
dialog: Good morning. I'm Riff, Secret
dialog: Service.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: ... Yes. Of course.
text: Perkins watches curiously as Riff passes the metal detector
text: over Allenby's clothing.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - MORNING
text: The President is worried about what Rand is telling him. He
text: paces, smokes a cigarette. Chance smiles through it all.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: ... There is no longer any margin
dialog: for inflation, it has gone as far
dialog: as it can, you've reached your
dialog: limits on taxation, dependence on
dialog: foreign energy has reached a
dialog: crisis, and, from where I see it,
dialog: Mr. President, the Free Enterprise
dialog: System has reached the breaking
dialog: point. We are on the brink of
dialog: another crash from which recovery
dialog: might not be possible.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: It's that serious, huh?
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: I'm afraid so.
text: The President now looks nearly as bad as Rand. He sits, turns
dialog: to Chance.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Do you agree with Ben, Mr.
dialog: Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do
dialog: you think we can stimulate growth
dialog: through temporary incentives?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: As long as the roots are not
dialog: severed, all is well and all will
dialog: be well in the garden.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: ... In the garden?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: That is correct. In a garden,
dialog: growth has its season. There is
dialog: spring and summer, but there is
dialog: also fall and winter. And then
dialog: spring and summer again...
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: (staring at Chance)
dialog: ... Spring and summer...
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Yes, I see... Fall and winter.
dialog: (smiles at Chance)
dialog: Yes, indeed...
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Could you go through that one more
dialog: time, please, Mr. Gardiner?
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: I think what my most insightful
dialog: friend is saying, Mr. President, is
dialog: that we welcome the inevitable
dialog: seasons of nature, yet we are upset
dialog: by the seasons of our economy.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. That is correct.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: (pleased)
dialog: ...Well, Mr. Gardiner, I must
dialog: admit, that is one of the most
text: refreshing and optimistic
dialog: statements I've heard in a very,
dialog: very long time.
text: The President puts out his cigarette, rises.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
dialog: ... Many of us forget that nature
dialog: and society are one! Yes, though we
dialog: have tried to cut ourselves off
dialog: from nature, we are still a part of
dialog: it! Like nature, our economic
dialog: system remains, in the long run,
dialog: stable and rational. And that is
dialog: why we must not fear to be at its
dialog: mercy!
text: (he smiles at Chance, who
dialog: is absorbed in looking
text: around the room at the
dialog: books)
dialog: ... I envy your good, solid sense,
dialog: Mr. Gardiner - that is precisely
dialog: what we lack on Capitol Hill.
dialog: (glances at watch)
dialog: I must be going.
dialog: (holds out hand to Chance)
dialog: Mr. Gardiner, this visit has been
dialog: enlightening...
text: Chance rises and shakes the President's hand.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. It has.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: ... You will honor me and my family
dialog: with a visit, won't you?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. I will.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Wonderful, we'll all look forward
dialog: to seeing you.
dialog: (turns to Rand)
dialog: Is Eve around? I'd like to say
dialog: hello.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: No, she flew up to Boston for
dialog: another charity event. She'll be
dialog: sorry to have missed you.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted
dialog: me to send along her best to the
dialog: two of you - and, Ben, I want to
dialog: thank you for your time and
dialog: thoughts.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank
dialog: you for coming to spend time with a
text: dying man.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Now, Ben, I won't have any of that.
dialog: Why don't you listen to your good
dialog: friend Chauncey this is a time to
dialog: think of life!
text: The President clasps Rand's hand.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: You're right, Mr. President I don't
dialog: like feeling sorry for myself.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Take care of yourself, Ben.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: You take care too, Bobby.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
text: (as he turns to go, a
dialog: smile to Chance)
dialog: Mr. Gardiner...
text: The President leaves the library and Chance sits back down.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: (as the door closes)
dialog: He's a decent fellow, the
dialog: President, isn't he?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes, Ben - he is.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: He was quite impressed with your
dialog: comments, Chauncey - he hears my
dialog: sort of analysis from everyone, but
dialog: yours, unfortunately - seldom if
dialog: ever at all.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice
text: talking to the President.
scene_heading: EXT. RAND MANSION - MORNING
text: An aide, KAUFMAN, waits by the front door of the Rand
text: mansion. As the President comes out, he speaks quietly to
dialog: Kaufman.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Kaufman, I'm going to need
dialog: information on Mr. Chauncey
dialog: Gardiner's background.
speaker_heading: KAUFMAN
dialog: (makes note of name)
dialog: Gardiner, yes, sir.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: And put it through on a Code Red -
dialog: I want it as soon as possible.
speaker_heading: KAUFMAN
dialog: No problem, Chief.
text: They head toward the waiting limousines.
scene_heading: INT. RAND MANSION - HALLWAY - MORNING
text: Rand has an arm around Chance, hangs on for dear life as the
text: two of them walk through the hall. Behind them, Wilson and
text: Perkins push empty wheelchairs.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: (very weak)
dialog: ... You know, Chauncey, there's
dialog: something about you... You're
dialog: direct, you grasp things quickly
dialog: and you state them plainly. You
dialog: don't play games with words to
dialog: protect yourself. I feel I can
dialog: speak to you frankly... You know
dialog: what I was talking to you about
dialog: last night?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (blankly)
dialog: No, Ben.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: Oh, sure you do, the financial
dialog: assistance program. I think you
dialog: might be just the man to take
dialog: charge of such an undertaking. I'd
dialog: like you to meet with the members
dialog: of the Board, we'll be able to
dialog: discuss the matter at greater
dialog: length at that time.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I understand.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: (stops outside his door)
dialog: And, please, Chauncey - don't rush
dialog: your decision. I know you're not a
dialog: man to act on the spur of the
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Thank you, Ben.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: And now, Chauncey, I'm afraid you
dialog: must excuse me - I'm very tired all
dialog: of a sudden.
text: Wilson and Perkins leave the wheelchairs, assist Rand into
text: his hospital room.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (as they go in)
dialog: I'm sorry that you are so sick,
dialog: Ben.
text: The door closes, Chance limps off down the hall.
scene_heading: EXT. RAND MANSION - GARDEN - DAY
text: Chance, with a limp, walks down a pathway in the garden,
text: admires the greenery. In the background, coming from the
dialog: house, we see Eve.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (approaches Chance, calls)
dialog: Chauncey!
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (stops, turns)
dialog: Hello, Eve.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Your leg must be getting better.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
text: Yes. It's feeling much better now.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Good. I'm glad to hear that.
dialog: (they walk together)
dialog: ... How did you like meeting the
dialog: President?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Fine. He's very nice.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Yes, he is. I'm sorry I didn't get
dialog: to see him.
text: They walk along in silence for a moment. Chance sees a huge
text: greenhouse not far from them, heads toward it. Eve turns to
text: him, hesitates, then questions.
speaker_heading: EVE (CONT'D)
dialog: ... Chauncey... Last night you
dialog: mentioned an old man, that died.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Was he a relative? Or an intimate
dialog: friend?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (looking at greenhouse)
dialog: He was a very wealthy man, he
dialog: looked after me since I was young.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (quizzically)
dialog: ... Mentor...?
text: Eve takes his uncertainty as a reluctance to discuss the Old
dialog: Man.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't
dialog: mean to pry. You must have been
text: very close to him.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. I was.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I'm sorry...
dialog: (getting more to the
dialog: point)
dialog: ... And what about Louise? YOU
dialog: mentioned that she had gone, were
dialog: you close to her also?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. I liked Louise very much. She
dialog: was his maid.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I
dialog: thought perhaps she was someone
dialog: that you may have been romantically
dialog: involved with.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (pleased)
dialog: Of course.
text: Eve edges slightly closer to Chance. Chance edges slightly
text: closer to the greenhouse, is fascinated by it.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Our greenhouse.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (pleased)
dialog: Oh, I like that very much.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Yes, so do we.
text: Chance peeks through one of the windows.
scene_heading: INT. RAND'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: Rand is in bed. Eve, Chance and Allenby are seated around
text: him, the two nurses standing to one side. They all watch the
text: President's address to the Financial Institute on TV. Chance
text: inhales deeply, enjoys the oxygen in the room. Rand is
text: looking weaker. Every so often, Allenby casts a concerned
text: glance his way.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT'S VOICE
dialog: ... And there are so many of you
dialog: that have proclaimed that we are on
dialog: the brink of the worst financial
dialog: crisis in this nation's history.
dialog: And there are so many of you
dialog: demanding that we put into effect
dialog: drastic measures to alter its
dialog: course. Well, let me tell you,
dialog: gentlemen, I have been conducting
dialog: multiple-level consultations with
dialog: members of the Cabinet, House and
dialog: Senate. I have conducted meetings
dialog: with prominent business leaders
dialog: throughout the country. And this
dialog: very morning I had an in-depth
dialog: discussion with your founder and
dialog: Chairman-Of-The-Board, Mr. Benjamin
dialog: Turnbull Rand and his close friend
dialog: and advisor Mr. Chauncey
dialog: Gardiner...
text: Rand perks up a bit at this mention. Allenby manages a smile,
text: once again looks at Rand, checking his condition. Eve looks
text: proudly at Chance, who continues to enjoy the oxygen.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT'S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: ... Well, gentlemen, I found this
dialog: to be a most rewarding
dialog: conference... To quote Mr.
dialog: Gardiner, a most intuitive man, 'As
dialog: long as the roots of industry
dialog: remain firmly planted in the
dialog: national soil, the economic
dialog: prospects are undoubtedly sunny.'
text: Rand starts coughing, breathing heavily. Allenby and the
text: nurses rush to his bedside. Allenby shoots a quick look to
dialog: Eve and Chance.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: (motioning toward door)
dialog: Excuse us, please.
text: Eve and Chance leave the room as Allenby administers aid to
dialog: Rand.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT'S VOICE
dialog: Gentlemen, let us not fear the
text: inevitable chill and storms of
dialog: autumn and winter, instead, let us
dialog: anticipate the rapid growth of
dialog: springtime, let us await the
dialog: rewards of summer. As in a garden
dialog: of the earth, let us learn to
dialog: accept and appreciate the times
dialog: when the trees are bare as well as
dialog: the times when we pick the fruit.
scene_heading: EXT. RAND MANSION - PATIO - DAY
text: Eve and Chance sit in silence on the patio. Eve's eyes are
text: swollen, red, she has been crying. She turns to Chance,
text: reaches out, touches his hand.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: ... I'm...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: ... I'm very grateful that you're
dialog: here, Chauncey...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: ... With us ...
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: So am I, Eve.
text: Allenby comes out the door, his mood is serious,
text: professional. Eve turns quickly, awaits his news.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: (sits alongside Eve)
dialog: ... Eve - this has been an
dialog: exhausting day for Ben...
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (anxious)
dialog: ... But he's...?
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
text: He's resting comfortably now.
dialog: There's no cause for alarm, yet...
text: Mrs. Aubrey comes out of the house.
scene_heading: MRS. AUBREY
dialog: Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone
dialog: call for you. Sidney Courtney, the
dialog: financial editor of the Washington
dialog: Post.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (not moving)
dialog: Thank you.
scene_heading: MRS. AUBREY
dialog: Would you care to take it, sir?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes.
text: Chance still does not move. Eve mistakes Chance's not moving
text: for concern for herself. She puts a hand on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I'll be all right, Chauncey you go
dialog: ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (rising)
dialog: Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
text: Chance follows Mrs. Aubrey into the house. Eve watches him
text: go, then turns to Allenby.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: ... He's such a sensitive man, so
dialog: considerate...
scene_heading: INT. RAND MANSION - MRS. AUBREY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Mrs. Aubrey leads Chance to a phone at one of the desks. The

dialog: Hello.
scene_heading: INT. WASHINGTON POST - COURTNEY'S OFFICE - DAY

scene_heading: INTERCUT - MRS. AUBREY'S OFFICE / COURTNEY'S OFFICE
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Hello, Sid.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr.
dialog: Gardiner, I know you must be very
dialog: busy.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (looking from one TV to
dialog: the other)
dialog: No. I'm not busy.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Then, I'll be brief. I covered the
dialog: President's speech at the Financial
dialog: Institute today, and since the Post
dialog: would like to be as exact as
dialog: possible, we would appreciate your
dialog: comments on the meeting that took
dialog: place between Mr. Rand, the
dialog: President and yourself.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: The President is a nice person. I
dialog: enjoyed it very much.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Good, sir. And so, it seems, did
dialog: the President - but we would like
dialog: to have some facts; such as, uh...
dialog: What exactly is the relationship
dialog: between yourself and that of the
dialog: First American Financial
dialog: Corporation?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I think you should ask Mr. Rand
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Of course. But since he is ill I'm
dialog: taking the liberty of asking you.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes, that is correct. I think you
dialog: should ask Mr. Rand that.
text: Courtney doesn't understand but continues his questioning.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: I see. Then one more quick
dialog: question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at
dialog: the Post would like to, uh - update
dialog: our profile on you - what exactly
dialog: is your business?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I have nothing more to say.
text: Chance hangs up the phone, watches the TVs.
text: Courtney listens to the dial tone, then puts the receiver
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Typical - no wonder he's so close
dialog: to Rand...

speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Hmmm. Elevator.

scene_heading: INT. RAND MANSION - BASEMENT - DAY
text: One of Mrs. Aubrey's secretaries, JENNIFER, waits with an arm

speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (surprised to see him)
dialog: Why, hello, Mr. Gardiner - are you
dialog: looking for someone?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: No.

scene_heading: INT. MRS. AUBREY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Mrs. Aubrey is at her desk, buzzing her inter-house phone. As

speaker_heading: JENNIFER
text: He's in the basement.
scene_heading: MRS. AUBREY

scene_heading: INT. RAND MANSION - BASEMENT BOWLING ALLEY - DAY

scene_heading: MRS. AUBREY

speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes, I have seen that show on

scene_heading: MRS. AUBREY
dialog: Of course. They would like you to

dialog: he had to cancel, and they asked if
dialog: you would be interested.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. I would like to be on that
dialog: show.
scene_heading: MRS. AUBREY
dialog: Fine. They felt that since you had
dialog: such close ties with the President,
dialog: you would be a splendid choice.
dialog: (Chance nods, there is a

dialog: ... Can I help you? Are you looking
dialog: for something?

speaker_heading: KAUFMAN
dialog: Yes, sir - we are aware of all

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: (interrupts)
dialog: He's an advisor and close personal
dialog: friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes,
dialog: they have volumes of data on
dialog: Benjamin!
speaker_heading: KAUFMAN
dialog: Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to
dialog: contact Mr. Rand, but he was too
dialog: ill to...
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: (again interrupts)
dialog: I do not want Benjamin Rand
dialog: disturbed! You have other ways of

dialog: (a pause)
dialog: ... Good luck, Chauncey.
text: Eve impulsively steps forward, kisses Chance on the cheek.
text: Chance smiles at her, and Eve, slightly embarrassed, turns
text: and leaves the room. Chance sits back down, watches TV as
text: Perkins attends to his clothes with a whisk broom.
scene_heading: INT. WASHINGTON POST - STAFF ROOM - NIGHT
text: Courtney heads a meeting of his four staffers. One man,
text: KINNEY, a research assistant, sits behind a stack of
text: paperwork, has a downcast expression as he listens to
dialog: Courtney.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: ... Gardiner is laconic, matter-of
dialog: fact. The scuttlebutt is that he's
dialog: a strong candidate for one of the
dialog: vacant seats on the board of First
dialog: American. But before we can do any
dialog: sort of a piece on the man, we're
dialog: going to need facts on his
dialog: background...
dialog: (turns to Kinney)
dialog: ... Kinney, what did you come up
dialog: with?
speaker_heading: KINNEY
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: ... Nothing.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
text: (sighs, taps pencil on
dialog: table)
dialog: ... Skip the levity, Kinney - what
dialog: have you got?
speaker_heading: KINNEY
dialog: (another pause)
dialog: ... I realize this sounds banal but
dialog: there is no information of any sort
dialog: on Gardiner. We have no material on
dialog: him - zilch...
text: The room is quiet except for the tapping of Courtney's
dialog: pencil.
scene_heading: EXT. TELEVISION STATION - NIGHT
text: The RAND 1 limousine parks in front of the station. As
text: Jeffrey opens the door for Chance, MORTON HULL steps to the
dialog: limo.
speaker_heading: HULL
dialog: Mr. Gardiner, I'm Morton Hull, the
dialog: producer of 'This Evening.'
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (as they shake hands)
dialog: Hello, Morton.
text: Hull takes Chance into the station.
scene_heading: INT. RAND MANSION - CHANCE'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Constance, Rand's nurse, enters Chance's room, goes to the
dialog: closet.
scene_heading: INT. TV STATION - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: Chance is intrigued by the surroundings as Hull guides him
text: through the corridor.
speaker_heading: HULL
dialog: Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact
dialog: that you occupy such a position in
dialog: the world of finance makes you
dialog: ideally suited to provide our
dialog: millions of viewers with an
dialog: explanation of this nation's
dialog: economic crisis.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: HULL
dialog: Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that
dialog: more people will be watching you
dialog: tonight than all those who have
text: seen theater plays in the last
dialog: forty years?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. It's a very good show.
speaker_heading: HULL
dialog: I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner.
text: Hull takes Chance into the MAKE-UP room.
scene_heading: INT. RAND MANSION - CHANCE'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Constance is in the closet, searching through Chance's
text: pockets, finding nothing. She takes out a small knife, cuts a
text: label from one of the jackets. Quickly, she examines one of
text: Chance's shoes, copies the name of the shoemaker in a
text: notebook. Constance hurries to the dresser, continues her
dialog: search.
scene_heading: INT. TV STATION - CORRIDOR/MAKEUP ROOM NIGHT
text: COLSON, the makeup man, comes through the corridor carrying a
text: glass of water. He turns into the makeup room, goes to Chance
text: who sits in front of the lights. Hull sits next to Chance,
text: briefs him on the show. Chance has his eyes on a TV monitor,
text: watches the guest preceding him on "This Evening."
speaker_heading: COLSON
dialog: (gives Chance water)
dialog: Here you go, Mr. Gardiner.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Thank you. I'm very thirsty.
speaker_heading: COLSON
dialog: Yes, sir - it's hot under those
dialog: lights.
text: Colson applies finishing touches to Chance.
speaker_heading: HULL
dialog: Now, if the host wants to ask you a
dialog: question, he'll raise his left
text: forefinger to his left eyebrow.
dialog: (Chance watches TV)
dialog: Then you'll stop, and he'll say
dialog: something, and then you'll answer.
text: On the TV, WILLIAM DUPONT, the host, wraps up his talk with
dialog: his guest.
speaker_heading: COLSON
dialog: (a last-minute dab)
dialog: Okay, Mr. Gardiner, you're all set.
text: Hull leads Chance out of the makeup room. Colson closes the
text: door, then carefully picks up Chance's water glass, wraps it
text: in Kleenex, puts it in his overcoat pocket.
scene_heading: INT. TV STATION - "THIS EVENING" STUDIO - NIGHT
text: William Dupont introduces Chance.
speaker_heading: DUPONT
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, our very
dialog: distinguished quest, Mr. Chauncey
dialog: Gardiner!
text: The BAND plays as Chance comes onto the stage. An audience of
text: about three hundred applauds Chance as he appears. Two TV
text: cameras move with him as he walks, with a smile and a limp,
text: to center stage. Dupont shakes Chance's hand, Chance holds
text: Dupont's hand with both of his own.
speaker_heading: DUPONT (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have
dialog: you with us this evening.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DUPONT
dialog: (showing Chance to chair)
dialog: I'd like to thank you for filling
dialog: in on such short notice for the
dialog: Vice President.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (sits)
dialog: You're welcome.
speaker_heading: DUPONT
dialog: (also sitting)
dialog: I always find it surprising, Mr.
dialog: Gardiner, to find men like
dialog: yourself, who are working so
text: intimately with the President, yet
dialog: manage to remain relatively
dialog: unknown.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. That is surprising.
speaker_heading: DUPONT
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: ... Well, your anonymity will be a
dialog: thing of the past from now on.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (doesn't understand)
dialog: I hope so.
speaker_heading: DUPONT
dialog: Yes... Of course, you know, Mr.
dialog: Gardiner, that I always prefer an
dialog: open and frank conversation with my
dialog: guests, I hope you don't object to
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: No. I don't object.
speaker_heading: DUPONT
dialog: Fine, then let's get started. The
dialog: current state of our country is of
dialog: vital interest to us all, and I
dialog: would like to know if you agree
dialog: with the President's view of the
dialog: economy?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Which view?
text: Applause and laughter from the audience. Dupont accustomed to
text: parrying with his guests, asks again.
speaker_heading: DUPONT
dialog: Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his
dialog: speech at the Financial Institute
dialog: the President consulted with you
dialog: and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. I was there with Ben.
speaker_heading: DUPONT
dialog: I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DUPONT
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Well, let me rephrase the question;
dialog: the President compared the economy
dialog: of this country to a garden, and
dialog: stated that after a period of
dialog: decline a time of growth would
dialog: naturally follow. Do you go along
dialog: with this belief?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes, I know the garden very well. I
dialog: have worked in it all my life. It
dialog: is a good garden and a healthy one;
dialog: its trees are healthy and so are
dialog: its shrubs and flowers, as long as
text: they are trimmed and watered in the
dialog: right seasons. The garden needs a
dialog: lot of care. I do agree with the
dialog: President; everything in it will
dialog: grow strong, and there is plenty of
dialog: room in it for new trees and new
dialog: flowers of all kinds.
text: The audience applauds Chance's apparent metaphor. Dupont
text: waits for it all to subside, then asks another question.
scene_heading: INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Rand is in bed. Eve sits in a chair next to the bed, squeezes
text: Rand's hand in excitement as they both watch Chance on
text: television. Teresa, the nurse, watches in the background.
speaker_heading: DUPONT
dialog: (over TV)
dialog: ...Well, Mr. Gardiner, that was
dialog: very well put indeed, and I feel it
dialog: was a booster for all of us who do
dialog: not like to wallow in complaints or
dialog: take delight in gloomy predictions.
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The President and First Lady are in bed together watching the
dialog: show.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Gloomy predictions? That insolent
dialog: son of a bitch!
speaker_heading: DUPONT
dialog: (over TV)
dialog: Let's make it clear, Mr. Gardiner,
dialog: it's your view that the collapse of
dialog: the Stock Market, the dramatic
dialog: increase in unemployment, you feel
dialog: that this is just another season,
dialog: so to speak, in the garden?
text: The First Lady cuddles close the President, ruffles his hair,
text: tries to cheer him up.
scene_heading: INT. TV STUDIO - "THIS EVENING SHOW" - NIGHT
text: Chance answers.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
text: In a garden, things grow - but
dialog: first some things must wither; some
dialog: trees lose their leaves before they
dialog: grow new leaves...
scene_heading: INT. CIA ROOM - NIGHT
text: A small, dark room. A videotape machine is running. Also, a
text: machine is turning that records the harmonics of Chance's
text: voice. TWO CIA MEN run the equipment, watch as a needle
text: charts Chance's voice onto paper.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (over TV)
dialog: ... Then they grow thicker and
text: stronger and taller. Some trees
text: die, but fresh saplings replace
dialog: them. Gardens need a lot of care
dialog: and a lot of love.
scene_heading: INT. THOMAS FRANKLIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Franklin, the attorney that evicted Chance, comes out of the
text: bathroom brushing his teeth. His wife, JOHANNA, is in bed
text: absorbed in "This Evening." Franklin sits on the end of the
text: bed, watches the show.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (over TV)
dialog: ... And if you give your garden a
dialog: lot of love, and if you work very
dialog: hard and have a lot of patience, in
dialog: the proper season you will see it
dialog: grow to be very beautiful...
text: More applause from the TV. Franklin leans closer to the set.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: It's that gardener!
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: No! He's a real gardener!
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: He does talk like one, but I think
dialog: he's brilliant.
speaker_heading: DUPONT
dialog: (over TV)
dialog: I think your metaphors are quite
dialog: interesting, Mr. Gardiner, but,
dialog: haven't we seen seasons that have
dialog: been devastating to certain
dialog: countries?
scene_heading: INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The President and First Lady continue to watch.
speaker_heading: DUPONT
dialog: (over TV)
dialog: Such as disasterous winters,
dialog: prolonged droughts that have wiped
dialog: out crops, hurricanes that have all
dialog: but swept away island communities?
dialog: Doesn't a country need to have
dialog: someone in charge that can see it
dialog: through such crises?
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: ... That bastard...
text: The First Lady moves closer to him.
scene_heading: INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: The TV, its volume low, plays in the background as Constance,
text: with a pair of tweezers, plucks a hair from Chance's pillow,
text: puts it into a small vial.
speaker_heading: DUPONT
dialog: (over TV)
dialog: Don't we need a leader capable of
dialog: guiding us through the seasons? The
dialog: bad as well as the good?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (over TV)
dialog: Yes. We need a very good gardener.
scene_heading: INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT
text: Dupont continues his questions.
speaker_heading: DUPONT
dialog: Do you feel that we have a 'Very
dialog: good gardener' in office at this
dialog: time, Mr. Gardiner?
text: At the end of the question, Dupont glances over Chance's
text: shoulder to look at the monitor.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I understand.
text: Chance turns to see what Dupont is looking at, sees the back
text: of his own head on the TV screen.
speaker_heading: DUPONT
dialog: I realize that might be a difficult
dialog: question for you, Mr. Gardiner -
dialog: but there are a lot of us around
dialog: the country that would like to hear
dialog: your thoughts on the matter.
text: Chance is still turned to the monitor.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Oh, yes. It is possible for one
dialog: side of the garden to be flooded,
dialog: and the other side to be dry...
scene_heading: INT. RAND MANSION - ALLENBY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Allenby watches Chance on television. The camera that covered
text: Dupont in close-up has now pulled back, includes Dupont and
text: Chance, both looking into camera. Allenby is concerned, he is
dialog: unsure of Chance.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (over TV)
dialog: ... Some plants do well in the sun,

dialog: of the shade.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
text: A group of ELDERLY BLACK PEOPLE sit in the lobby, watch "This

speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (over TV)
dialog: ... It is the gardener's
dialog: responsibility to take water from
dialog: the flooded area and run it to the
dialog: area that is dry. It is the
dialog: gardener's responsibility not to
text: plant a sun-loving flower in the
text: shade of a high wall...
text: During the preceding speech, Louise, the maid from the Old
text: Man's house, chatters.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Gobbledegook! All the time he
dialog: talked gobbledegook! An' it's for
dialog: sure a White man's world in

dialog: since he was the size of a pissant
dialog: an' I'll say right now he never
dialog: learned to read an' write - no sir!
dialog: Had no brains at all, was stuffed

text: There is a chorus of "Amens" as she finishes.
scene_heading: INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT
text: Chance continues.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: ... It is the responsibility of the
dialog: gardener to adjust to the bad
dialog: seasons as well as enjoy the good
dialog: ones. If the gardener does his job,
dialog: everything will be fine.
scene_heading: INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Audience applause is heard over TV. Rand claps weakly along

speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Splendid. Just splendid...
text: Rand looks up as Constance comes into the room.
speaker_heading: RAND (CONT'D)
dialog: Damn, Constance, get in here! You

text: Constance hurries to Teresa's side. Rand turns to Eve.
speaker_heading: RAND (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm becoming quite attached to

dialog: ... And so are you, aren't you,
dialog: Eve.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: ... Yes, I am, Ben.
speaker_heading: RAND
text: (reaches out, takes her
dialog: hand)
dialog: That's good... That's good.
speaker_heading: DUPONT
dialog: (over TV)
dialog: Well, Mr. Gardiner, from the sound
dialog: of our audience, I'd say that your
dialog: words are a most welcome respite
dialog: from what we've been hearing from
dialog: others...
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (over TV)
dialog: Thank you.
scene_heading: INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT
text: Dupont asks another question.
speaker_heading: DUPONT
dialog: I'm sorry to say that our time is
text: running short, but before we close,
dialog: I'd like to ask one final question.
dialog: What sort of gardener, sir, would
dialog: you be?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (with confidence)
dialog: I am a very serious gardener.
scene_heading: INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: More applause over the TV. The President pales.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Oh, Jesus...
text: He rolls over in bed. The First Lady reaches out, puts a

scene_heading: INT. FRANKLIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Franklin holds a phone to his ear with one hand, shuts off
text: the TV with the other.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Okay, I'll see you in twenty
dialog: minutes.
text: Franklin hangs up the phone, scurries around getting dressed.
text: His wife, Johanna, sits grimly in bed.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: (coldly)
dialog: ... Business, bullshit! Going out
text: in the middle of the night to meet
dialog: that bitch in a bar...
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's
dialog: a damn fine attorney! I've got to
dialog: talk to her about this Gardiner...
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: (turns over in bed)
dialog: Good night.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Look, Johanna...
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: (cuts him off)
dialog: I said good night!

scene_heading: INT. TV STATION - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

speaker_heading: COLSON
dialog: Marvelous! Just marvelous, Mr.

dialog: what confidence! Exactly what this
dialog: country needs!
text: Chance smiles at well-wishers as they continue on through the
dialog: corridor.
scene_heading: INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The First Lady is snuggled up close to the President,

dialog: that he is not up to the occasion.
speaker_heading: FIRST LADY
dialog: ... Darling... What's wrong?
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT,
dialog: ... I can't... I just can't right
dialog: now... I'm sorry, dearest... I just
dialog: can't...
text: The First Lady looks at him for a beat, then turns, lies on

scene_heading: INT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: An 'in' meeting place for the upper-middle Washington, D.C.
text: crowd. Thomas Franklin and Sally Hayes sit at a table, drinks
text: in front of them.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: ... It didn't make any sense to me
dialog: at all. I didn't know what the hell
dialog: he was talking about...
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: He wasn't making a speech to us,
text: Tom - he was talking to the masses.
dialog: He was very clever, keeping it at a
dialog: third grade level - that's what
dialog: they understand...
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Yeah? Well, I don't understand what
text: was up his sleeve when he pulled
dialog: that stunt with us? What was he
dialog: doing? And why?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Who knows...? Maybe the government
dialog: had something to do with it.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: You know, Sally - I really feel
dialog: like I've been had, and you know
dialog: what that means, don't you?... It
dialog: means that any political future I
dialog: had is right down the toilet!
text: The CAMERA begins to slowly move away from the table, the
text: sound of Franklin's voice continues.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN (CONT'D)
dialog: ... Jesus, the thought of spending
dialog: the rest of my life as an attorney,
dialog: that is really a downer... And,
dialog: Christ, Sally, I almost forgot
dialog: Johanna is starting to think
dialog: something's going on between...
text: Franklin's voice fades into the background hubbub. The voice
text: of Kinney, the research assistant from the Washington Post is
text: heard as the camera settles on a table occupied by Sidney
text: Courtney and his staff.
speaker_heading: KINNEY
dialog: ... Sid, be reasonable - I've been
dialog: everywhere, there's no place left
dialog: to check!
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Try again.
speaker_heading: KINNEY
dialog: Sure, try again - where? There's
dialog: nothing, it's like he never

speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Try again.
speaker_heading: KINNEY
dialog: Sid, it's useless!
speaker_heading: COURTNEY

scene_heading: EXT. RAND MANSION - NIGHT

speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: An outstanding speech, sir.
speaker_heading: PERKINS
dialog: May I take your coat, Mr. Gardiner?
speaker_heading: CHANCE

speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: (with some effort)
dialog: ... You possess a great gift,
dialog: Chauncey, of being natural. And
dialog: that, my boy, is a rare talent, the

text: Allenby crosses to Rand, needle in hand.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY

speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: (holds up hand)
text: In a minute, Robert - in a

dialog: Certainly, Ben.
speaker_heading: RAND
text: Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is

dialog: to attend, so - would you go in my
dialog: place, and escort Eve?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: Good. Together, the two of you

speaker_heading: RAND

speaker_heading: EVE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: KAUFMAN
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: What the hell are you talking
dialog: about, Kaufman?
speaker_heading: KAUFMAN
dialog: Well, we do have data from

dialog: accent may be northeastern, but
dialog: they will not commit to that.
dialog: ... Fingerprint check proved
dialog: negative, no identification
dialog: possible.

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT

dialog: Well, sir - it occurred to us that
dialog: he might be an agent of a foreign
dialog: power. But, we ruled that out, as
dialog: they invariably are provided with
dialog: too much documentation, too much
dialog: American identity... We, uh...don't
dialog: quite know what to make of it yet,
dialog: sir... But we'll keep on top of it,
dialog: Mr. President - we'll come up with
dialog: the answer.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT

dialog: I would appreciate that.

scene_heading: INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - MORNING
text: Chance is in bed, a bed tray on his lap, eating breakfast. A
text: pile of the morning's newspapers lies at the foot of the bed,
text: untouched. The TV is playing, Chance watches as he eats.
text: There is a knock at the door.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (without turning from TV)
dialog: Come in!
text: Eve enters, wearing a robe over her nightgown.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (moving to bed)
dialog: Well, it seems you've been
dialog: described as one of the architects
dialog: of the President's speech. And your
dialog: own comments from the 'This
dialog: Evening' show are quoted side by
dialog: side with the President's.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I like the President. He is a very
dialog: nice man.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (sits on bed)
dialog: I know...
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: ... So are you, Chauncey ...
dialog: (another moment, Chance
dialog: watches TV)
dialog: ... Do you mind my being here, like
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (a bite of toast)
dialog: No, Eve. I like you to be here.
text: Eve smiles, moves a little closer to Chance.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: ... You know, Chauncey... I want us
dialog: to be...
dialog: (with difficulty)
dialog: I want us... You and I to become...
dialog: close... I want us to become very
dialog: close, you know...?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes, Eve. I know that.
text: Eve suddenly begins to cry, sobbing quietly at first, then
text: losing control, the tears flowing freely. To comfort her,
text: Chance puts his arm around her shoulder, nearly tipping his
text: breakfast tray. Eve responds to his touch, draws closer,
text: holds Chance tightly. Chance does his best to avoid spilling
text: his breakfast, keep an eye on the TV, and to comfort Eve. She
text: gives in to her desires, begins to caress Chance, running her
text: hand over his body. She kisses him, his eyes, his neck, his
text: lips, his ears. Chance does not return the lovemaking, and
text: Eve eventually catches hold of herself, stops. She lies
text: quietly beside Chance for a time, regains her demeanor, then
dialog: speaks.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: ... I'm grateful to you,
dialog: Chauncey... I would have opened to
dialog: you with a touch, and you know
dialog: that...
text: (Chance,confused, turns to
dialog: her)
dialog: ... But you're so strong - I can
dialog: trust myself with you. I'm glad,
dialog: Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed
dialog: so much restraint...
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you
dialog: didn't open.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I know you are, Chauncey...
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: ... You conquer a woman from within
dialog: herself, you infuse in her the need
dialog: and desire and the longing for your
dialog: love.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (another bite of toast)
dialog: Yes. That could be true.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (sits up)
dialog: ... I guess I may as well be honest
dialog: about my feelings, Chauncey, as I
dialog: know you are I am in love with
dialog: you... I love you and I want you...
dialog: And I know that you know it and I'm
dialog: grateful that you've decided to
dialog: wait until... Until...
text: Eve cannot bring herself to finish the sentence. She rises,
text: straightens her robe and moves toward the door.
speaker_heading: EVE (CONT'D)
dialog: (stopping by door)
dialog: ... I do love you, Chauncey.
text: A knock at the door startles Eve. She turns, opens it to
text: MAGGIE, the seam tress. Maggie carries one of Rand's tuxedos.
speaker_heading: EVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, come in, Maggie.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (entering)
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Chauncey, Maggie will alter Ben's
dialog: tuxedo for you now.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Fine.

speaker_heading: REPORTER #1
dialog: Mr. Gardiner, what did you
dialog: think of the Post's editorial on
dialog: the President's speech?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (smiling for photogs)
dialog: I didn't read it.
speaker_heading: REPORTER #2
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: But air - you must have at least
text: glanced at it.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: No. I did not glance at it.
speaker_heading: REPORTER #3
dialog: Mr. Gardiner, the New York Times
dialog: spoke of your 'Peculiar brand of
dialog: optimism,' what was your reaction
dialog: to that?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (continues to pose for
dialog: pictures)
dialog: I did not read that either.
speaker_heading: REPORTER #3
dialog: Well, how do you feel about that
dialog: phrase, 'Peculiar brand of
dialog: optimism?'
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I do not know what it means.
speaker_heading: REPORTER #2
dialog: Sorry to persist, air, but it would
dialog: be of great interest to me to know
dialog: what newspapers you do read.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I do not read any newspapers. I
dialog: watch TV.
text: There is a moment of silence as the reporters digest this.
text: The TV Reporter smiles, questions Chance.
speaker_heading: TV REPORTER
dialog: ... Do you mean, Mr. Gardiner, that
dialog: you find television's coverage of
dialog: the news superior to that of the
dialog: newspapers?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (flatly)
dialog: I like to watch TV.
speaker_heading: TV REPORTER
dialog: (pleased) )
dialog: Thank you, Mr. Gardiner, for what
dialog: is probably the most honest
dialog: admission to come from a public
dialog: figure in years. Few men in public
dialog: life have the courage not to read
dialog: newspapers none have the guts to
dialog: admit it.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: You're welcome.
text: Eve and Chance walk toward the front door, leaving the

speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I've never seen anyone handle the
dialog: media as well as you, Chauncey.
dialog: You're so cool and detached -

speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Thank you, Eve.

speaker_heading: WATSON
dialog: Mrs. Rand, how good to see you.
speaker_heading: EVE

speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: EVE

speaker_heading: CHANCE

speaker_heading: SOPHIE
text: (steps back, admires

speaker_heading: SOPHIE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: (gluing the wing)
dialog: ... How are the kids getting along?
speaker_heading: FIRST LADY
dialog: Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy
dialog: this morning. She loves California,
dialog: but to quote her, she says, 'The
dialog: Secret Service is getting to be a

dialog: privacy...
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Huh... I'm glad they're along with
dialog: her, if you know what I mean... How
dialog: about Jack?
speaker_heading: FIRST LADY
dialog: Well, I think Jack needs some time

text: Kaufman enters.
speaker_heading: KAUFMAN
dialog: Sorry to disturb you, chief but we
dialog: have new developments.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Oh? What?
speaker_heading: KAUFMAN
dialog: We have word that the Soviets have
dialog: put out a top priority alert for
dialog: information on Gardiner's
dialog: background. So far, they haven't
dialog: come up with a thing - what's more,
dialog: as a result of their eagerness, one
dialog: of their ablest agents blew his
dialog: cover, we have him in custody at
dialog: this time.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Good. Anything else?
speaker_heading: KAUFMAN
dialog: Yes, chief - eight other foreign
dialog: powers have put Gardiner under
dialog: surveillance. We're around-the
dialog: clock now, sir - I'll keep you
dialog: posted.

speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: It seems like ages, Mr. Ambassador.
dialog: (a nod to his wife)
dialog: Mrs. Skrapinov.
text: Mrs. Skrapinov returns the nod as Sophie introduces Chance.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Mr. Gardiner, let me introduce you
dialog: to our guest of honor, His
dialog: Excellency Vladimar Skrapinov,
dialog: Ambassador of the Soviet Union.
text: Chance warmly shakes Skrapinov's hand with both of his own.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (stumbles over name)
dialog: Hello... His... His...
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Ambassador Skrapinov, this is Mr.
dialog: Chauncey Gardiner.
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV
text: Delighted. Delighted.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: And this is Mrs. Skrapinov.
text: Chance smiles at Mrs. Skrapinov as The Ambassador puts an arm
text: around him.
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV
dialog: You must sit with us, my friend, we
dialog: have much to discuss.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I agree.
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV
dialog: (to Eve)
dialog: How is my dear friend Benjamin
dialog: feeling?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: He's doing as well as could be
dialog: expected, Mr. Ambassador. He still
dialog: speaks of the stimulating
dialog: discussions he's had with you.
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV
dialog: Ah, Yes. Please give him my
dialog: regards.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: (tugs at Eve)
dialog: Come on, Eve. Let's let the men
dialog: talk, there are so many people that
dialog: have been asking about you.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (to Chance and Skrapinov)
dialog: Would you two excuse me for a
dialog: moment?
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV
dialog: Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall
dialog: yield the pleasure of your company
dialog: to others.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I'll be back soon...
text: Eve and Sophie leave. Skrapinov leads his wife and Chance to
dialog: their table.
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV
dialog: (as they walk)
dialog: I'm sorry we haven't met sooner,
dialog: Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of
dialog: seeing you on television last night
dialog: and I listened with great interest
dialog: to your down-to-earth philosophy.
dialog: I'm not surprised that it was so
text: quickly endorsed by the President.
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: ... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how
dialog: serious is Benjamin's illness? I
dialog: did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by
text: discussing it in detail.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
text: Ben is very ill.
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV
dialog: Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As
dialog: you know, we in the Soviet Union
dialog: have the keenest interest in
dialog: developments of the First American
dialog: Financial Corporation... We are
dialog: pleased to hear that you may fill
dialog: Benjamin's place should he fail to
dialog: recover.
dialog: (arrive at table)
dialog: Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner.
text: Chance sits between Skrapinov and Mrs. Skrapinov.
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV (CONT'D)
dialog: (moves chair close to
dialog: Chance)
dialog: ... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be
dialog: quite candid - considering the
dialog: gravity of your economic situation,
dialog: shouldn't we, the diplomats, and
dialog: you, the businessman - get together
dialog: more often?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes, I agree, I think so too.
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV
dialog: To exchange our thoughts - what
dialog: does a Russian know about business?
dialog: On the other hand, what does an
dialog: American know about diplomacy?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes, I understand.
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV
dialog: And I have noticed in you a certain
dialog: reticence regarding political
dialog: issues - so why not a coming
dialog: together? An interchange of
dialog: opinion? We may find, my friend,
dialog: that we are not so far from each
dialog: other, not so far!
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (an engaging smile)
dialog: We are not far...
dialog: (motions at nearness of
dialog: their chairs)
text: ... our chairs almost touch.
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed
dialog: almost touching! And we want to
dialog: remain seated on them, correct? We
dialog: don't want them snatched from under
dialog: us, am I right? Because if one
text: goes, the other goes, and then -
dialog: boom! Boom! And we are both down
dialog: before our time, you see? And
dialog: neither of us wants that, do you
dialog: agree?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I certainly do.
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV
dialog: Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you
dialog: by any chance enjoy Krylov's
dialog: fables? I ask this because there is
dialog: something... there is something
dialog: Krylovian about you.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Do you think so? Do you think so?
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV
dialog: So you know Krylov!
text: Skrapinov pauses, then leans close to Chance, speaks softly
text: in Russian. Chance, having never heard this language, raises
text: his eyebrows and laughs. Mrs. Skrapinov remains impassive.
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV (CONT'D)
dialog: (amazed)
dialog: So you know your Krylov in Russian,
dialog: do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must
dialog: confess I had suspected as much all
dialog: along - I know an educated man when
dialog: I meet one!
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Oh, good.
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV
dialog: Yes, it is very good!
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes, it is.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Would you tell me your name again,
dialog: please?
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV
dialog: (slaps Chance on the back)
dialog: Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor!
dialog: Vladimar Skrapinov!
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. I like that name very much.
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV
dialog: And yours, sir - Chauncey Gardiner!
dialog: (in Russian)
dialog: How poetic! Chauncey, a name of
dialog: uncertain meaning! And Gardiner, a
dialog: bit of the French, a suggestion of
dialog: a stroll through the flowers! A
dialog: beautiful name, my friend!
text: As he speaks in Russian, Eve comes to the table, taps
text: Skrapinov on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV (CONT'D)
dialog: (immediately rises)
dialog: Mrs. Rand! You have returned to us!
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Only to steal Mr. Gardiner away, if
dialog: I might.
dialog: (to Chance)
dialog: Everyone wants to meet you.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes, Eve. That would be good.
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV
dialog: (shakes Chance's hand)
dialog: We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner,
dialog: many times!
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Thank you.
text: As Eve and Chance leave, Skrapinov turns and nods to a MAN
text: standing a short distance away. The man, KARPATOV, hurries to
dialog: the table.
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV
dialog: Yes? What have you found?
speaker_heading: KARPATOV
dialog: (in Russian)
dialog: We have nothing on him, Ambassador
dialog: Skrapinov.
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV
text: (holds up hand, looks
dialog: around)
dialog: Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for
dialog: one, understands our language.
speaker_heading: KARPATOV
dialog: (in English, softly)
dialog: Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV
dialog: What do you mean there is nothing?
dialog: That's impossible.
speaker_heading: KARPATOV
dialog: There is no information available
text: on the man before he moved into
dialog: Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to
dialog: be such a difficult task that it
dialog: has resulted in the loss of one of
dialog: our agents to the United States
dialog: Government.
text: Mrs. Skrapinov strains to overhear the conversation.
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV
dialog: But... Where was this man Gardiner
dialog: before last week?
speaker_heading: KARPATOV
dialog: Apparently the White House shares
dialog: our curiosity - they have also
dialog: launched an investigation, and,
dialog: according to our sources, neither
dialog: the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met
dialog: with success.
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV
dialog: I see. Clearly, such interest on
dialog: their part is of great political
dialog: significance.
speaker_heading: KARPATOV
dialog: Clearly, yes comrade.
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV
dialog: Hmmm... Take this down.
dialog: (Karpatov takes out
dialog: notepad)
dialog: I want this quote included in the
dialog: Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner,
text: in an intimate discussion with
dialog: Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that
dialog: "Unless the leaders of the opposing
dialog: political systems move the chairs
text: on which they sit closer to each
dialog: other, all of their seats will be
text: pulled from under them by rapid
dialog: social and political changes."'
speaker_heading: KARPATOV
dialog: Very good, Your Excellency.
text: Karpatov leaves the table.
scene_heading: INT. WASHINGTON, D.C. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: The same lounge as before. Sidney Courtney sits at the same
dialog: table as earlier, only this time with the editor of the
text: Washington Post, LYMAN STUART. Courtney puffs on his pipe as
text: he speaks.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: ... It's strictly rumor at this
dialog: stage, Lyman - just something in
dialog: the wind...
speaker_heading: STUART
text: Something rather big in the wind,
dialog: I'd say. So whose files were
dialog: destroyed? The CIA's or the FBI's?
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: I don't know. Like I said, it's
dialog: just rumor so far, but we should
dialog: start nosing around, see if we can
dialog: talk to some people...
text: The CAMERA begins to slowly MOVE AWAY from their table.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: ... But why? The question is why?
dialog: Why would they destroy Gardiner's
dialog: files? What is it about his past
dialog: they are trying to cover up?
dialog: (his voice fades)
dialog: ... A criminal record? A membership
dialog: in a subversive organization?
dialog: Homosexual, perhaps?
text: The SOUND of Stuart's voice dissolves into Thomas Franklin's
text: as the CAMERA SETTLES on Dr. Allenby and Franklin sitting at
text: a table nearby.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: ... And he told us that he had been
dialog: living there since he was a child,
dialog: working as a gardener. He showed us
text: a room in the garage, where he said
dialog: he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't
dialog: really believe him, of course - but
dialog: why the act?
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: I have no idea...
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Another thing that baffles me,
dialog: Doctor - what was his connection
dialog: with the deceased? Major financial
dialog: dealings, obviously - but our firm
dialog: has no record of any such
dialog: transactions.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: Hmmm. You say he showed you his
dialog: garden?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Well, he said it was his, he walked
dialog: us through it.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: I see.
dialog: (leans close to Franklin)
dialog: Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and
dialog: Miss Hayes to keep this incident
dialog: with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves.
dialog: There's no telling what he was
dialog: involved in, and the matter may be
dialog: extremely confidential. So please,
dialog: not a word.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Of course, Doctor, I understand.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Certainly, glad to be of help.

speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (a two-handed handshake)
dialog: Hello, Ronald.
speaker_heading: STIEGLER
dialog: Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have
dialog: been wondering if you'd consider
dialog: writing a book for us? Something on
dialog: your political philosophy. What do
dialog: you say?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I can't write.
speaker_heading: STIEGLER
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Of course, who can nowadays? I have
dialog: trouble writing a post card to my
dialog: children! Look, we could give you a
dialog: six figure advance, provide you
dialog: with the very best ghostwriter,
dialog: research assistants, proof
dialog: readers...
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I can't read.
speaker_heading: STIEGLER
dialog: Of course not! No one has the time
dialog: to read! One glances at things,
dialog: watches television...
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. I like to watch.
speaker_heading: STIEGLER
dialog: Sure you do! No one reads!...
dialog: Listen, book publishing isn't
dialog: exactly a bed of roses these

speaker_heading: MONROE

speaker_heading: TOWNSEND
dialog: (drafting a will)
dialog: Right - everything.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: You two don't have to lecture me on
dialog: the complexities of the situation,
dialog: no one knows that better than
dialog: myself... But you must understand
dialog: that I have an endless faith in
dialog: Mrs. Rand's abilities - I know that
dialog: she will select the right person
dialog: for guidance when she has the
dialog: need... She has shared my life,
dialog: gentlemen, she has given me far
dialog: more pleasure than any of my so
dialog: called assets... Life has suddenly
dialog: become very simple for me now - I

speaker_heading: CHANCE

dialog: I like to watch.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Watch? You mean just watch me?
dialog: Doing it alone?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. I like to watch very much.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Well, if that's what you want, then
dialog: I want it too.
dialog: (takes Chance's arm)
dialog: We can go this way.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I want to tell Eve.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
speaker_heading: CHANCE

speaker_heading: DENNIS

speaker_heading: FIRST LADY
dialog: (after some time)
dialog: ... Maybe you should talk to

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: No, that won't do any good.
speaker_heading: FIRST LADY

dialog: I've done?
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not
dialog: you...
speaker_heading: FIRST LADY
dialog: (another pause)
dialog: It's your damn job. It never

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: It's not that, I just...
text: The inter-White House phone rings, the President reaches for
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yeah, Kaufman - what is it?
speaker_heading: KAUFMAN'S VOICE
dialog: (over phone)
dialog: Chief, we have a break in the case.
dialog: Our man at the Washington Post says
text: they are working on a story that
dialog: either the CIA or the FBI destroyed
dialog: Gardiner's files before anyone
dialog: could get to them.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: What? Why?
speaker_heading: KAUFMAN'S VOICE
dialog: (over phone)
dialog: I can't say at this time - neither
dialog: agency will admit to a thing.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: (getting out of bed)
dialog: Okay, get both Directors over here,
dialog: I'll be right down.
text: The President hangs up the phone as the First Lady stares at

scene_heading: INT. SOPHIE'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS ROOM - NIGHT
text: A small room exquisitely decorated in pale lilac tapestry.
text: The lights are very dim, and Dennis, who we cannot see, is
text: lying on the floor. Dennis' clothes are draped over a chair.
text: Chance sees a very small pocket television on a desk. He
text: turns the TV on.
speaker_heading: DENNIS' VOICE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Can you see well?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (squints at small screen)
dialog: Yes, very well, thank you.
speaker_heading: DENNIS' VOICE
dialog: Do you like it?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
speaker_heading: DENNIS' VOICE
dialog: (disappointed at it being
dialog: 'tiny')
dialog: ... Are you sure you like it?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes, I do, it's very good.
speaker_heading: DENNIS' VOICE
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Really? Really!!!
text: Chance reacts to the change in tone of Dennis' voice, turns
text: to look at him on the floor. Hearing the groans and heavy
text: breathing, Chance thinks Dennis is ill.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Do you need a doctor? I could call
dialog: Robert...
speaker_heading: DENNIS' VOICE
dialog: I don't want Robert.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: DENNIS' VOICE
dialog: (through the groans)
dialog: Your foot! Give me your foot!!
text: Dennis reaches out with his free hand, grabs Chance's foot,
text: pulls it to himself.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (some pain)
dialog: Thank you. But my leg is still a
dialog: little sore.
text: Chance watches as Dennis goes through some spasms, then his
text: body relaxes. Chance is concerned for Dennis' health.
speaker_heading: CHANCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you sure you're not ill?
text: We hear a contented sigh from the man on the floor.
scene_heading: EXT. SOPHIE'S - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. RED STAR LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

text: fresh from Moscow. They all drink vodka.
dialog: (Dialogue in Russian, English subtitles)
speaker_heading: NOVOGROD
dialog: The rank-and-file in the FBI feel
text: he is FBI, but others feel he is a
dialog: CIA man who knows how to destroy
dialog: FBI files.
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV
dialog: That could be possible...
speaker_heading: NOVOGROD
dialog: But we are quite certain, comrade,
dialog: that this man Gardiner is a leading
dialog: member of an American elitist
text: faction planning a coup d'etat.
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV
dialog: A coup d'etat! Of course, that was
dialog: foreseen by Lenin himself!
speaker_heading: NOVOGROD
dialog: That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov.
dialog: We have ascertained that Gardiner
dialog: heads a big-business power group
dialog: that will soon be taking over the
dialog: American government.
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV
dialog: Big business. I could work with
dialog: that faction quite nicely, Colonel
dialog: Novogrod.
speaker_heading: NOVOGROD
dialog: You have proven that already,
dialog: Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be
dialog: congratulated for recognizing the
dialog: importance of this man and
dialog: establishing an early friendship.
speaker_heading: SKRAPINOV
dialog: Thank you, Colonel.
speaker_heading: NOVOGROD

scene_heading: INT. SOPHIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The reception is breaking up. Eve, wearing her coat, searches
text: for Chance in the crowd. She sees him, taps him on the
text: shoulder from behind.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Chauncey, where have you been? I
dialog: was afraid you got bored and left,
dialog: or that you were with some
text: mysterious woman.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: No. I was with a man. We went
dialog: upstairs.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always
dialog: involved in some sort of
dialog: discussion...
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: He was very ill, I stayed with him
dialog: for a while.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: It must be the punch, and it is
dialog: stuffy in here -- I feel it a
dialog: little myself. You're an angel, my
dialog: dear - thank God there are still
dialog: men like you around to give aid and
dialog: comfort.
text: Eve and Chance leave the reception.
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

text: mussed. Standing before him are GROVER HONEYCUTT, the
text: Director of the F.B.I., and CLIFFORD BALDWIN, C.I.A. Chief.
text: Kaufman stands to one side. All are red-eyed, tired, and
text: frustrated.
speaker_heading: HONEYCUTT
dialog: I never gave such a directive, Mr.
dialog: President.
speaker_heading: BALDWIN
dialog: Nor I, sir - it would be out of the
dialog: question.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Gentlemen, I didn't call you here
dialog: at such an hour to make
dialog: accusations, I just want to explore
dialog: the possibilities. Now, I have
dialog: three questions; Is the man a
dialog: foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly
dialog: found that our methods of gathering
dialog: data are grossly inefficient? Or,
dialog: thirdly, have the man's files been
dialog: destroyed? Now, I'd like some
dialog: answers.
speaker_heading: BALDWIN
dialog: Gardiner is not a foreign agent,
dialog: there are now sixteen countries
dialog: investigating the man. We can rule
dialog: that out.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Very well... Can we rule out
dialog: inefficiency...?
text: There is silence in the room. A couple of looks, but silence.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
dialog: I see. What about question three?
dialog: Is it possible to erase all traces
dialog: of a man?
speaker_heading: HONEYCUTT
dialog: Highly unlikely, sir... In fact,
dialog: the boys around the Bureau feel
dialog: that the only person capable of
dialog: pulling it off would be an ex
dialog: F.B.I. man.
speaker_heading: BALDWIN
dialog: (a look to Honeycutt)
dialog: I don't think that's entirely true,
dialog: Grover.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: (to Baldwin)
dialog: And what do the boys around
dialog: Intelligence think?
speaker_heading: BALDWIN
dialog: Well, Mr. President... They don't
dialog: quite know what to think.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: (rising)
dialog: Gentlemen, needless to say, there
dialog: is going to be a full Congressional

speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (holding his hand)
dialog: I feel so close to you, so safe
dialog: with you, Chauncey...
dialog: (stops at her bedroom
dialog: door)
dialog: ... And Benjamin understands that,
dialog: dearest... He understands and
dialog: accepts my feelings for you...
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (opens her door)
dialog: ... Come in, Chauncey - please come
dialog: in...
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Thank you.
text: Chance enters, Eve closes the door behind them.
scene_heading: INT. EVE'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Eve turns on a soft lamp, Chance goes directly to her TV,
text: turns it on.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I can sense that you've been
dialog: through a lot, Chauncey. But one
dialog: day, when you feel like it, you'll
dialog: tell me all about your life...
dialog: (Chance watches an old
dialog: movie)
dialog: ... But, even if you tell me
dialog: nothing, even if it's too painful
dialog: for you to reveal your past...
text: As she talks, Chance watches a love scene on TV. The hero
text: gives his lady a passionate kiss and embrace. The scene seems
text: to 'sink into' Chance's mind. He abruptly turns, takes Eve
text: into his arms and kisses her full on the mouth. Just as
text: abruptly, he turns away and changes channels on TV.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (breathless)
dialog: Oh, Chauncey... I do love you so
dialog: much!
text: She takes Chance in her arms, kisses him wildly. They fall to
text: her bed in an embrace. As she holds him, kisses him, runs her
text: hands over his body, Chance watches television, neither
text: resists nor responds to Eve's caresses. Suddenly she stops,
text: lets her head fall on Chance's chest.
speaker_heading: EVE (CONT'D)
dialog: ... You don't want me, Chauncey...
dialog: You don't feel anything for me...
dialog: Nothing at all...
text: Chance sits up on the bed, then, feeling her sadness, gently
text: strokes her hair as he looks at TV.
speaker_heading: EVE (CONT'D)
dialog: I just don't excite you at all... I
dialog: don't know what you want... I don't
dialog: know what you like...
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: I like to watch.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (not understanding)
dialog: To watch...? To watch me...?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. I like to watch.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (uncertain)
dialog: ... Is that all you want...?
dialog: (a hesitation)
dialog: ... To watch me...?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. It's very good, Eve.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: ... But I've never done...
dialog: (another hesitation)
dialog: ... You mean...? When... When...
dialog: When I do it? ... When I touch
dialog: myself...?
text: Eve slowly gets up from the bed, nervously paces the bedroom
text: as Chance watches TV. She makes a decision, moves to Chance,
text: kisses him.
speaker_heading: EVE (CONT'D)
dialog: (getting aroused)
dialog: Oh, Chauncey...
text: She steps back, slips off her dress. She does not undress any
text: further, instead, leans close to Chance.
speaker_heading: EVE (CONT'D)
dialog: One of those little things you
dialog: don't know about me yet, darling -
dialog: I'm a little shy.
text: She smiles, gets in bed and pulls the covers over herself.
text: Chance divides his attention between Eve and the TV, watching
text: both with an equal detachment. Eve begins to respond to her
text: own touch, finds a heretofore undiscovered pleasure with her
text: own body. Chance changes the channel as she reaches orgasm.
text: As Eve's body trembles, Chance yawns, gets up from the bed.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (going to door)
dialog: Good night, Eve.
text: A low purr is heard from Eve as Chance leaves.
scene_heading: INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: No more, Robert... No more
dialog: needles...
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
text: (sits on the side of the
dialog: bed)
dialog: It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you
dialog: can feel it.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: I know, Robert... But, strangely
dialog: enough, I don't feel too bad about
dialog: now... I feel all right... I guess
dialog: it's easier... knowing Chauncey is
dialog: here... to take care of things...
text: Teresa is about to swab Rand's arm with alcohol but he pulls
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: RAND (CONT'D)
dialog: No, I don't want any of that...
dialog: Please... please, just get me Mr.
dialog: Gardiner, Teresa - please... he'll
dialog: head it up...
text: Teresa looks to Allenby, he nods to her. Teresa puts the

scene_heading: EXT. RAND MANSION - PATIO - MORNING
text: A light snow is failing. Eve is in a fur coat, holds a
text: steaming cup of coffee. Chance stands next to her, an
text: umbrella in one hand. He holds his other arm out, catching
text: the snowflakes as they fall.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: ... And I feel so free now,
dialog: Chauncey. Until I met you, I never
dialog: felt acknowledged by a man...
text: (Chance gazes out at the
dialog: falling snow)
dialog: ... I always had the feeling that I
dialog: was just a vessel for a man,
dialog: someone that he could take hold of,
dialog: pierce, and pollute. I was merely
text: an aspect of somebody's lovemaking.
dialog: Do you know what I mean?
text: Chance turns to her, says nothing, presses the cold
text: snowflakes to his face.
speaker_heading: EVE (CONT'D)
dialog: (presses close to him)
dialog: Dearest, you uncoil my wants;
dialog: desire flows within me, and when
dialog: you watch me my passion dissolves
dialog: it. You set me free. I reveal
dialog: myself to myself and I am drenched
text: and purged.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: That's very interesting, Eve.
text: Teresa appears in the doorway.
speaker_heading: TERESA
dialog: Mr. Gardiner. Mr. Rand would like
dialog: to see you.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. I would like to see Ben.
text: Chance gives Eve a warm smile, then follows Teresa into the
dialog: house.
scene_heading: INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING
text: Allenby, with nothing more he can do to prolong Rand's life,
text: sits on the bed close to him, grips his hand tightly. Teresa
text: shows Chance into the room and Allenby motions to the nurses
text: to leave. As they do, Chance, once again breathing the oxygen
text: with a smile, goes to Rand's bedside.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: ... Chauncey... Chauncey...
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes, Ben - are you going to die
dialog: now?
text: Allenby winces.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: (a weak smile)
dialog: ... I'm about to surrender the Horn
dialog: of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel,
dialog: my boy...
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Oh, I see.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: (reaches out to him)
dialog: Let me feel the strength in your
dialog: hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your
dialog: strength...
dialog: (holds Chance's hand)
dialog: Yes, that's good... I hope,
dialog: Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay
dialog: with Eve... Take care of her, watch
text: over her, she's a delicate flower,
dialog: Chauncey...
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: A flower...
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: She cares for you and she needs
dialog: your help, Chauncey... there's much
dialog: to be looked after...
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. I would like to do that.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: ... I've worked very hard and
dialog: enjoyed my life... I've known
dialog: success... and I've felt love... My
dialog: associates, Chauncey - I've talked
dialog: with them about you... They're
dialog: eager to meet you... very eager to
dialog: meet you... I'm very fond of you,
dialog: Chauncey... And I understand Eve...
dialog: Tell her that... tell her I'm madly
dialog: in love with her...
text: Rand slumps down, dead. Allenby checks his pulse, turns to
dialog: Chance.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: ... He's gone, Chauncey.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes, Robert. I have seen it before.
dialog: It happens to old people.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: (covers Rand's face)
dialog: Yes, I suppose that's true.
text: Chance reaches out, uncovers Rand's face, gently touches the
text: man's forehead, feels the coldness. Allenby eyes him as
text: Chance stays with Rand for a moment, then replaces the sheet.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (turns to Allenby)
dialog: Will you be leaving now, Robert?
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: In a day or two, yes.
speaker_heading: CHANCE
text: Eve is going to stay. The house
dialog: will not be closed.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: (a moment, a look)
dialog: ... You've become quite a close

dialog: (a beat)
dialog: ... Chance...?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Yes. I love Eve very much.
speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: I see...
dialog: (another beat)
dialog: ... And you are really a gardener,
dialog: aren't you?
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: (brightens)
dialog: Yes, Robert - I am.
dialog: (a smile at Allenby)
dialog: I'll go tell Eve about Ben now,

scene_heading: EXT. RAND MANSION - DAY

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: ... Millions of people across the
dialog: world have heard of the passing of
dialog: Benjamin Rand; but, unfortunately,
dialog: only relatively few will feel the
dialog: pain and sadness at such a loss. To
dialog: most, Benjamin Rand was a legend;

dialog: Benjamin was a beloved friend. My
dialog: personal association with Benjamin
dialog: dates back many years, and my
dialog: memories of our friendship will

text: Allenby watch as he goes into the trees surrounding the area.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
dialog: I initially came in contact with
dialog: the Rand name in 1943. 1 was a
dialog: young lieutenant in the Air Corps,
text: a navigator flying missions over
dialog: Europe. That plane that I learned
dialog: to know so well was manufactured by
dialog: the Rand Aeronautics Corporation.

dialog: Benjamin Rand was an industrial

dialog: his warmth and humor...
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: ... I would like to share with you
dialog: a few quotes, and a few feelings
dialog: from our dear friend.
text: (holds up paper, reads)
dialog: ... 'I do not regret having

dialog: I respect; I do regret, however,
dialog: that our philosophies kept us
dialog: apart.'
dialog: ... 'I have no use for those on
dialog: welfare, no patience whatsoever...
dialog: But, if I am to be honest with
dialog: myself, I must admit that they have
dialog: no use for me, either.'
dialog: ... 'I was born into a position of
dialog: extreme wealth, I have spent many
dialog: sleepless nights thinking about
dialog: extreme poverty - I do not know
dialog: the feelings of being poor, and
dialog: that is not to know the feelings of
dialog: the majority of people in this
dialog: world. For a man in my position,
dialog: that is inexcusable.'
dialog: 'Life is a state of mind.'

dialog: Nothing! We have no inkling of his

text: SEWELL NELSON, a corporation chairman, joins in.
speaker_heading: NELSON
dialog: Correct, and that is an asset. A
dialog: man's past can cripple him, his

text: invites scrutiny.
text: Another executive, PETER CALDWELL, agrees.
speaker_heading: CALDWELL
dialog: To this time, he hasn't said
dialog: anything that could be used against

text: CHARLIE BOB BENNET, a Texas oil millionaire;
speaker_heading: BENNET
dialog: Well, I'm certainly open to the
dialog: thought - it would be sheer lunacy
dialog: to support the President for
dialog: another term.
speaker_heading: NELSON
dialog: No one will go along with that...
dialog: Look at the facts, gentlemen, the
text: response from his appearance on
dialog: 'This Evening' was overwhelming; he
dialog: has excited and awakened the people
dialog: of this country at a time of
dialog: despair.
text: LYMAN MURRAY, a banker;
speaker_heading: MURRAY
text: He's personable, elusive, yet

dialog: on.
scene_heading: EXT. RAND'S FUNERAL - DAY
text: The majority of mourners have left. Eve and Allenby walk

speaker_heading: ALLENBY
dialog: I don't think so, he should be

speaker_heading: EVE

scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY
text: Chance happens on a tree with a cracked limb, hanging to the
text: ground. He stops, inspects the break, runs his fingers along
text: the split in the bark. He looks to the ground, notices that
text: an end of the limb has fallen on a seedling, bending it
text: double. Chance pulls the limb away, then kneels beside the
text: seedling. He removes an expensive paid of suede gloves, and,
text: with gentle fingers, brushes the dirt and snow away from the
text: seedling. Chance glances up to the remaining limbs of the
text: larger tree which could fall and threaten the emerging tree.
text: He unfolds his umbrella, places it over the seedling in a way
dialog: to give it protection, yet to still allow it to receive light
text: from the winter sun. Chance stands, puts his gloves back on
text: and continues his walk, disappearing into a remote section of
dialog: the woods.
scene_heading: EXT. RAND'S FUNERAL - DAY

speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I do - we do - both of us, Ben and
