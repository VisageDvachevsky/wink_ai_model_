scene_heading: BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - LONG SHOT - DAY
text: A brilliant yellow sun beats down on a vast orangeish
text: wasteland. As we begin a long, slow PAN of the desert, the
text: following is SUPERED onto the screen:
scene_heading: "SAN DIMAS, CALIFORNIA"
text: TITLE FADES, and is replaced by:
dialog: “2687 A.D."
text: Then that TITLE also FADES. Continue PANNING, and finally
speaker_heading: FINISH PAN ON:
scene_heading: _A CLUSTER OF FUTURISTIC DOMES
text: which shimmer in the distance.
text: Soon a distant SOLITARY FIGURE, dressed all in black,
text: silently strides INTO FRAME, dust kicking up behind ‘hin.
text: As the Figure approaches the largest of the domes, we begin
dialog: to MOVE IN, and we:
speaker_heading: cuT To:
scene_heading: INT. DOME
text: A magnificent, crystalline structure -- like a vast,
text: futuristic cathedral. Everything about this place implies
dialog: grandeur, solemnity and importance.
text: Deep, metallic MUSIC echoes through the dome as --
scene_heading: TWO HUGE DOORS
text: open, and the Figure enters. This is:
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: And he is the personification of everything that'is, has
dialog: been, or will be rock and roll. Cool, cavalier, and cocky,
text: he’ is dressed very stylishly and wears ultra-hip
dialog: sunglasses.
text: He steps inside the hall, the two huge doors shutting
text: solidly behind him. He begins walking, his footsteps
text: echoing loudly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: O
text: He stops in the middle of the room and nods respectfully
dialog: toward:
scene_heading: THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM
text: where, for the first time, we SEE three FIGURES, seated in
text: mid-air, as if suspended invisibly. All have long hair and
text: beards (sort of like the members of ZZ Top), wear white,
text: sport dark sunglasses, and slowly tap their feet in rhythm
text: to the echoing, metallic music.
dialog: These are the three most important people in the world.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Rufus stands, patiently, as the LEADER regally returns his
text: nod and begins to speak, his voice resonating through the
dialog: dome.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: It is time.
text: Rufus nods. The Leader motions toward:
text: THE CENTER OF THE ROOM : .
text: where the ceiling begins to iris open, BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT
text: . pouring through the widening chasm. Soon the light is
dialog: pierced by:
scene_heading: A LARGE, BLACK OBELISK
text: which, barely visible through the brightness, begins to
text: descend toward the floor.
text: This spectacular explosion of LIGHT and MUSIC reaches a
text: tumultuous crescendo, then suddenly stops. The ceiling
text: irises closed.
speaker_heading: THE LEADER
text: looks at the obelisk, then gestures with his hand and:
speaker_heading: THE OBELISK
text: begins a rapid and magical transformation.
text: When complete, the obelisk has taken the form of a 1987
text: PHONE BOOTH. Glass doors, a telephone, the works.
dialog: 
scene_heading: © RUFUS AND THE FIGURES
text: stare reverently at the booth. After a moment, Rufus flips
text: down his shades and turns to the Figures.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Gentlemen. Be excellent to
dialog: each other.
text: The Figures nod gravely back at Rufus.
speaker_heading: FIGURES
dialog: Party on, dude.
text: Rufus neds and enters --
scene_heading: THE PHONE BOOTH
text: where he flips through the attached PHONE BOOK and locates
dialog: a number.
text: As Rufus lifts the receiver, we SEE a small, two-pronged
text: ANTENNA rise out of the booth and begin to GLOW with a
text: bluish light.
text: Then, with each number Rufus dials, we SEE the BLUE LIGHT
text: from the antenna move down the side of the booth,
text: accompanied by a corresponding CHORD OF HEAVY METAL MUSIC.
dialog: 
text: Finally, we HEAR a DRUM BEAT, and as --
scene_heading: THE BLUE LIGHT
text: connects with the ground, the floor beneath the booth
text: suddenly opens up with a WHOOSH and, in a brilliant FLASH
text: of BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT and RAUCOUS ROCK AND ROLL ...
scene_heading: INT. DOME
dialog: «+. the booth disappears.
text: The floor immediately closes back up and the light in the
text: dome returns to normal. Now, for the first time, we become
dialog: aware of:
scene_heading: TWO TOWERING PORTRAITS
text: Which hang above the doors on the far side of the dome,
text: dominating the room. They are of two MIDDLE AGED MEN with
text: CD jong hair and black t-shirts.
scene_heading: THE THREE IMPORTANT PEOPLE
text: Gaze at the portraits, solemn, concerned, and we:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: O FADE TO:
speaker_heading: DARKNESS
text: We HEAR the VOICES of our two sixteen-year-old heroes, BILL
dialog: and TED. .
speaker_heading: TED (V.0.)
dialog: Ready, Bill?
speaker_heading: BILL (V.0.)
dialog: Ready, Ted.
speaker_heading: TED (V.0.)
dialog: Go for it, dude...
speaker_heading: BILL (V.0.)
dialog: One --
speaker_heading: TED (V.0.)
dialog: Two --
speaker_heading: BILL AND TED (V.0.)
dialog: One two three four --
text: = And they plunge into a riff of upbeat "AIR GUITAR" -- the
text: high-pitched falsetto squeal of voices imitating hard rock
text: guitar licks (sounding something like "nyow - nyow - nyow -
dialog: nyow").
text: After a few beats, the SOUNDTRACK MUSIC kicks in along with
dialog: them, and we:
scene_heading: FADE UP ON:
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL BUS STOP - DAY
text: BILL and TED jump INTO FRAME, land on the bus stop bench,
text: and do a series of spasmodic AIR GUITAR riffs. Then, as
text: they leap off the bench TOWARD CAMERA, we begin:
text: A QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS
text: In which Bill and Ted do a brief, MTV-type AIR GUITAR mini-
dialog: concert:
text: They spin around on their backs; play their air-guitars
dialog: with their teeth, feet, and ears; trade “solos"; and
text: oo finally, in a resounding conclusion, violently smash their
text: CD air-instruments against the ground, garnering strange looks
text: from the few people around them.
dialog: 
text: They guys look at each other, quite pleased, as the SCHOOL
text: BUS pulls up in front of them.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - MOVING
text: Bill and Ted crash into one of the back seats. As we will
dialog: soon see, they are not hard guys. They are, in fact;
text: remarkably benign and good-natured. Both wear rock and
text: roll t-shirts and jeans with boxers pulled out the back.
text: Of the two, Bill is shorter and darker, with a more angular
text: jaw and a more serious demeanor. He is the "thinker" of
dialog: the two.
text: Ted is the "dreamer". Taller and blondish, and with a
text: wide-eyed, romantic look, Ted is more into the immediate,
dialog: whether it be food, fun, or, especially, girls.
text: Ted pulls a construction paper “mock-up" out of his
text: rucksack and unrolls it.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON MOCK-UP
text: An amateurishly-drawn hard-rock insignia with rearing
text: stallions, devilish faces, flaming manes, phallic guitars
text: and bowing young women. Also on it is the name of the
text: band: "WYLD STALLYNS."
dialog: BACK TO SHOT
text: As the school bus drives through suburban San Dimas,
text: passing malls and. fast food joints, Bill and Ted, in the
text: back, peruse the drawing.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Ted, while I agree that your
dialog: T-shirts will be most
text: triumphant, the truth is that
dialog: Wyld Stallyns will never be a
dialog: super band until we have Eddie
text: Van Halen on guitar.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yes, Bill, but I do not
dialog: believe we will get Eddie van
dialog: Halen until we have triumphant
text: T-shirts.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Ted, it's pointless to have
text: triumphant T-shirts before we
dialog: even have instruments.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: How can we have instruments
dialog: when we don't even know how to
dialog: play?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: That is why we need Eddie Van
dialog: Halen.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: And that is why we need
text: triumphant T-shirts.
text: Beat. The two lock at each other, grin --
speaker_heading: BILL AND TED
dialog: Excellent!
text: -- and as they go into a reprise of AIR GUITAR, again
dialog: attracting the attention of those around them, we:
speaker_heading: cuT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SAN DIMAS HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING
text: Typical before-school activity. Students chat and walk to
dialog: class as: : :
scene_heading: THE SCHOOL BUS
text: rolls into the lot and stops. The doors open and students
text: get off. Among them are Bili and Ted, who bound out and
dialog: start. toward school.
text: ELSEWHERE IN THE PARKING LOT
text: is the "POPULAR GROUP" -- a half a dozen nice-looking
text: students who sit on and around a Trans-Am. Bill and Ted
text: approach on their way to class. Ted eyes two cute preppy
dialog: girls.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: How's it goin', Buffy and
dialog: Jodie?
text: No response. The guys pass Randolf, the group's "leader",
text: who eyes them with disdain. .
speaker_heading: BILL :
dialog: How's it goin', Randolf?
speaker_heading: RANDOLF
dialog: (nods; superior)
dialog: How's it goin', miscreants?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: S BILL
dialog: Excellent. Thank you.
text: Bill and Ted leave the group and continue toward school.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Bill, we're miscreants.
speaker_heading: BILL AND TED
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Excellent.
scene_heading: AIR GUITAR.
scene_heading: EXT. LOCKER AREA
text: Ted's locker is a total mess. There are no books; only
text: junk food wrappers and Heavy Metal stickers. Ted stuffs
text: his. rucksack in with all the other junk.
text: A couple of lockers away, Bill uses the mirror which is
text: attached to his locker door to study the progress of his
text: scrawny little peach-fuzz moustache.
dialog: s emu
dialog: Ted. I totally have a most
text: excellent moustache.
dialog: 
text: But Ted is not paying attention; rather, he has focused his
dialog: gaze on:
text: BUFFY and JODIE, the two cheerleader types we just met, who
text: now approach, chatting. They kneel down to their lockers,
text: which are between and below Bill's and Ted's.
text: Ted swallows, then turns to the girls.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Buffy. Excuse me. I would
dialog: like to know if you would be
dialog: my date for the San Dimas High
dialog: Prom this weekend.
speaker_heading: BUFFY
dialog: (“are you
dialog: kidding")
dialog: Thank you. No.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Jodie. Excuse me. I would
dialog: like to know if you would be
dialog: my date for the San Dimas High
dialog: Prom this. weekend.
speaker_heading: JODIE
dialog: (giggling)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Well...would either of you
dialog: like to be Bill's date?
speaker_heading: BUFFY/JODIE
dialog: No. |
text: And the two pretty girls shut their lockers and walk away,
text: giggling.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Bill. Are there any other
dialog: possible combinations I may
dialog: have missed?
text: But Bill is silent, engrossed in a piece of paper he has
text: found in his locker. He turns toward Ted.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Dude. We are in big trouble.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: We have a history review
dialog: session.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: When?
text: The BELL RINGS. The guys look around. They are the only
text: ones left in the hallway. As the guys amble away, Ted
text: looks at his watch.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: How can school be startin'
dialog: already? It's only five a.m.
text: Bill looks at Ted's watch.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: a,
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Ted. You forgot to wind your
dialog: watch. -
speaker_heading: TED -
dialog: Oh. Yah.
text: And as the guys turn the corner OUT OF FRAME, we:
speaker_heading: cuT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM - ANGLE ON CHALKBOARD
dialog: Listed on the board are four categories of history:
scene_heading: “ANCIENT" "“MEDIEVAL" "MODERN" "“AMERICAN"
text: Under each heading are listed several important FIGURES and
text: MOVEMENTS from within that time period. (For instance,
dialog: under "Ancient" are listed Rome, Greece, Egypt, etc.)
speaker_heading: TEACHER'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Bill, I'm waiting ...
scene_heading: CLOSE ON BILL
text: standing, facing the front of the room, totally confused.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Uh...short dude.
speaker_heading: TEACHER'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Anything else?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He's dead?
text: We HEAR snickering.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON CLASSROOM
text: The teacher, MR. RYAN, a sincere and serious man in his
text: forties, is in front of the chalkboard, pointing to the
text: name “NAPOLEON BONAPARTE."
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: So then, Bill. You're telling
dialog: me that Napoleon was,
dialog: essentially, a "short, dead
dialog: dude." Correct?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Well...Yah.
speaker_heading: O
dialog: 
text: More snickering from the class, especially Randolf, 0x,.
text: Buffy and Jodie, who've been watching all this,
text: entertained, from the front row.
speaker_heading: TED
text: Who's been drawing the "Wyld Stallyns" logo onto his
text: desktop, looks up and laughs at his buddy.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (sotto; to Bill)
dialog: You totally blew it, dude!
speaker_heading: RYAN
text: hears this, and looks at Ted.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Alright, Ted. Why don't you
dialog: stand up?
text: Ted gulps, and stands. Ryan points to the board.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Who was Joan of Arc?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Noah's wife?
text: The class laughs.. Ryan sighs. The BELL RINGS.
scene_heading: FRONT OF ROOM ~ AFTER CLASS
text: Bill and Ted stand at Mr. Ryan's desk.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Mr. Ryan, sir, before you say
dialog: anything, my distinguished
dialog: colleague, Ted, and I wish to
dialog: express to you our thanks for
dialog: all the things we have learned
dialog: in your class.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (looking at
dialog: papers)
dialog: Uh huh. And what have you
dialog: learned?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (improvising)
dialog: We have learned that the world
dialog: has a great history, and will
dialog: continue to have a great
dialog: history in the next one
dialog: hundred years, of which we
dialog: hope to be a part of, and
dialog: which we sincerely hope you
dialog: are as well.
text: Ryan looks at Ted, who adds --
text: Ryan rips
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yes, and that thanks to great
dialog: leaders, such as Genghis Khan,
dialog: Julius Caesar, and Socratic
dialog: Method, the world is...full of
dialog: history.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: It seems to me all you've
dialog: learned is that...
dialog: (glancing at
dialog: papers)
text: ...-Caesar is “a salad dressing
dialog: dude."
text: up the papers.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Bill. Ted. It's this simple.
dialog: You've flunked every section
dialog: of this class: Ancient
dialog: History, Medieval History,
dialog: Modern History, and American
dialog: History.
text: Bill and Ted stand silently.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: That means if you don't get an
dialog: A+ on your final oral report
dialog: tomorrow, I'll have no choice
dialog: but to fail you. Now, you
dialog: know your topics --
dialog: (he points to the
dialog: chalkboard)
dialog: “== and I would suggest that
dialog: you cover at least those
dialog: subjects if you want to pass.
dialog: Understand?
dialog: 
text: Bill and Ted nod. Ryan looks back down at his papers.
text: Then, as Bill and Ted turn to leave, Ryan looks up and
dialog: adds:
speaker_heading: RYAN" :
dialog: And boys...your report had
dialog: better be something very
dialog: special.
dialog: The guys gulp and we:
dialog: cut TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL LIBRARY - LATER
text: Bill and Ted, loaded up with books, walk across campus.
text: Bill looks at the paper that Mr. Ryan gave them.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Well, then, who was Noah's
dialog: wife?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I dunno, Ted. But I do know
dialog: we are in serious trouble.
dialog: Listen to this:
dialog: {reads) -
text: "HOW WOULD AN IMPORTANT
scene_heading: HISTORICAL FIGURE FROM EACH OF
text: YOUR TIME PERIODS VIEW THE
scene_heading: WORLD OF SAN DIMAS, 19877"
dialog: (looks up from
dialog: paper)
dialog: We are in danger of flunking
dialog: most heinously tomorrow, Ted.
text: The guys look at each other and gulp. Then we HEAR:
speaker_heading: A GIRL'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: (airy, sexy)
dialog: Hi Bill. Need a lift?
text: The guys look up.
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: A STATION WAGON has pulled into the lot in front of them.
text: In the driver's seat is MISSY -- 19 and gorgeous. The guys
dialog: approach.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Sure Missy...I mean Mom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: O
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (sotto; to Bill)
dialog: Your step-mom's cute.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Shut up, Ted.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Remember when she was a senior
dialog: and we were freshmen?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Shut up, Ted.
text: Bill opens the car door.
scene_heading: INT. STATION WAGON
text: Missy has a couple bags of groceries in front. Bili and
text: Ted climb in the back.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: To Ted's house, please, Mom.
scene_heading: EXT. TED'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER
text: A small, lower-middle class home in a not-so-great
dialog: neighborhood,
text: Missy's station wagon stops behind a POLICE CAR which is
text: parked in front of the house.
speaker_heading: TED (V.0.)
dialog: Bogus. My dad's home.
dialog: . (then)
dialog: Be right back, as soon as I
dialog: get my books.
scene_heading: INT. TED'S HOUSE
text: Ted closes the door and slips across the hall. He is about
text: to head up the stairs when we hear:
speaker_heading: A VOICE
dialog: Ted.
text: Ted stops in his tracks and looks over at --
speaker_heading: HIS FATHER
text: Captain Chet Williams, crew-cutted, unsmiling, standing in
text: the kitchen, arms crossed.
dialog: 
dialog: 14
speaker_heading: OQ TED
dialog: _ What are you doing home, Dad?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN WILLIAMS
dialog: I'm looking for my keys. You
dialog: haven't done anything with
dialog: them, have you?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: No, sir.
text: Ted starts upstairs, but is quickly stopped by his father.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: - I spoke to your principal
dialog: today, Ted. He said you're
dialog: failing history.
text: Ted attempts to speak, but Williams cuts him off.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: He also said that if you fail
dialog: history, you flunk out of
dialog: school. You know what that
dialog: would mean, don't you, Ted?
dialog: o
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: . (quietly; he's
dialog: _ said this
dialog: before)
dialog: That I would have to go to
dialog: Oats Military Academy, sir.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN WILLIAMS
dialog: (neds)
dialog: I spoke with Colonel Oats this
text: morning. He's anxious to meet
dialog: you, Ted.
scene_heading: EXT. TED'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Ted shakily exits, a couple of as-yet-unopened history
text: books under his arm.
scene_heading: INT. STATION WAGON
text: Ted gets inside and turns to Bill.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Dude. We gotta pass.

scene_heading: EXT. BILL'S HOUSE ~ MOMENTS LATER
text: A large, suburban home in a neighborhood quite a bit nicer
dialog: than Ted's.

text: Bill nods and the guys stand. They are about to begin
dialog: walking when --
text: 20 FEET ABOVE THEM
text: The air suddenly parts, brilliant white LIGHT and a gust of

speaker_heading: MUSIC and:
scene_heading: A TELEPHONE BOOTH
text: barrels through the opening and lands a few feet away from

speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: Not bad ...
text: Then, the doors of the booth slide open and Rufus, dressed
text: in the same ultra-cool outfit he was wearing in 2687, steps
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Greetings, gentlemen.
text: Bill and Ted stare at Rufus for a moment. Finally:
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Will you buy us a beer?
speaker_heading: RUFUS

scene_heading: ANOTHER PHONE BOOTH
text: dropping out of the sky and crashing onto the parking lot,

text: exactly like Rufus' booth, only is much worse for the wear

text: The guys look at each other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Bill.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ee TED
dialog: = Strange things are afoot at

text: Bill nods. Then the door to the new phone booth bursts

scene_heading: ANOTHER BILL AND TED
dialog: -- Exact replicas of our two guys in every way -- explode
text: out of the booth and dash excitedly toward Billi and Ted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEW BILL
dialog: Dudes! You guys are gonna go

speaker_heading: NEW TED
dialog: Yah! You are going to have a

speaker_heading: TED

dialog: are saying right now.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (skeptical)
dialog: Okay. Wait. If you're really
dialog: us, what number are we
dialog: thinking of?
scene_heading: NEW BILL AND TED
dialog: Sixty-nine, dudes!
text: Beat. Bill and Ted gape at each other, amazed. Then they

text: and thumbs up. AIR GUITAR. Then:
speaker_heading: NEW BILL
dialog: Listen dudes, we have to go.
speaker_heading: NEW TED
dialog: Yah. We gotta get back to the
dialog: history report.
text: New Bill and Ted are about to head back to the booth when

speaker_heading: NEW TED
dialog: Rufus! !
speaker_heading: NEW BILL
dialog: Oh! Bill and Ted -- listen to
dialog: this dude Rufus. He knows

speaker_heading: NEW TED

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEW TED
dialog: (grinning slyly)

text: backs away and New Ted sticks his head out the booth,
speaker_heading: NEW TED
dialog: Ted! Don't forget to wind
dialog: your watch!
speaker_heading: NEW BILL
dialog: Catch ya later, Bill and Ted!
speaker_heading: BILL AND TED
text: stare, dumbfounded, as: the antenna on the second phone

text: ground below opens up, and in a FLASH of MUSIC and LIGHT,
text: the phone booth disappears into the ground.
text: Bill and Ted look at each other, then at Rufus.
scene_heading: INT. PHONE BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER
text: While Rufus flips through the phone book, Ted taps Bill on
text: the shoulder.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Dude. Are you sure we should
dialog: be doing this?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Ted, you and I have witnessed
dialog: many things, but nothing as
dialog: bodacious as what just
dialog: happened. Besides, we told
dialog: ourselves to listen to this
dialog: dude.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Maybe we were lying.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Why would we lie to ourselves,
dialog: Ted?

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: How are you gonna help us,

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Are you gonna call someone and
dialog: get the answers?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: We're gonna do a lot better

text: Rufus begins dialing. With each number, we HEAR
text: corresponding HEAVY METAL GUITAR CHORD. Bill and Ted
dialog: respond to this.
speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: Excellent.
text: The booth begins to glow with bluish light.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Brace yourself, amigos.
speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: Wh -- 7?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Gentlemen ... we're history.
text: There is a sudden FLASH of BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT, a ROAR of
text: HEAVY METAL MUSIC, and ...
scene_heading: THE PHONE BOOTH
text: disappears into the ground with a WHOOSH.
dialog: cur TO:
text: THE “CIRCUITS OF TIME"
text: A complex system cf wires and circuits criss-crossing the
text: SCREEN. After a beat, we HEAR:
speaker_heading: BILL/TED (V.0.)
dialog: Whoocoaaaaa! !!!! .
text: And the phone booth shoots INTO FRAME, diving into one of
text: the opaque tube-like CIRCUITS.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 25
scene_heading: INT. BOOTH - MOVING INCREDIBLY FAST
text: Bill and Ted, eyes wide and amazed, peer through the glass
text: as the booth barrels down the circuit wire on a virtual
text: roller-coaster ride through time.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Rufus! Where are we, dude?!
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: These are the circuits of
dialog: history, gentlemen. They'll
dialog: take you almost anywhere you
dialog: want to go. At any time.
speaker_heading: - BILL
dialog: How?!
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: (smiles).
dialog: Modern technology, William.
text: The booth makes a sudden sharp drop OUT OF PRAME and we:
speaker_heading: cuT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. FRANCE (1804) - DAY
text: A large, grassy plateau, overlooking a broad valley.
text: We HEAR a pounding chord of HEAVY METAL MUSIC, the sky
text: opens up, there is a FLASH OF LIGHT, and --
scene_heading: THE PHONE BOOTH
text: drops from the opening in the sky and drops onto the
text: plateau. Some junk food wrappers from the 7/11 flutter
text: down behind it as the sky closes back up.
text: After a beat, Bill and Ted step out of the booth and look
text: around, very excited.
speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: Whoaaaa!!
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: That was most unprecedented,
dialog: Rufus.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Yah -- but where are we, dude?
dialog: 
dialog: 26
text: Rufus calmly glances at the phone book.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: France. 1804.
text: Bill and Ted's mouths drop open.
text: Suddenly a CANNON BLAST is HEARD and the guys look down
dialog: into --
scene_heading: THE VALLEY BELOW
text: where two opposing brigades af SOLDIERS have launched into
dialog: battle.
speaker_heading: BILL AND TED
dialog: could not be more thrilled.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Bill, check it out! We're
dialog: right in the middle of a war!
speaker_heading: : BILL
dialog: {waving at the
dialog: armies below)
dialog: Up here, dudes!
text: A BULLET whizzes past Bill's ear. Ted laughs, pointing at
text: Bill's head.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (calling down)
dialog: Just missed, dude!
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Rufus notices a group of SOLDIERS on a nearby bluff.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Time to depart, amigos.
text: Bill and Ted nod as --
text: THE GROUP OF SOLDIERS
text: looks their way.
text: At the head of the group, in command, is a small, arrogant
text: FRENCH GENERAL. The General lifts a pair of field glasses
text: to his face and gazes across the plateau.
dialog: 
scene_heading: His Pe 4m PHONE BOOTH
text: As Rufus dials, Bill and Ted peer out in the General's
text: direction and wave. We can read their lips as they say:
speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: How's it goin', dude?
speaker_heading: THE GENERAL
text: pusts down his field glasses and is shaking his head wiien:
text: an_EXPLOSION goes off behind him, tossing the General
text: through the air and onto the ground right next to the now-
dialog: lowin hone booth.
text: Suddenly the ground opens and both the booth and the
text: General are sucked down into the hole! The ground closes
dialog: up and we:
speaker_heading: cUuT TO:
text: THE CIRCUITS OF TIME
text: The phone booth bombs PAST CAMERA, an excited AIR GUITAR
text: emanating from within. It is soon followed by the
text: terrified General, hair shooting straight back, arms
text: flailing wildly as he barrels down the tube behind the
dialog: booth.
text: As the General hurtles PAST and OUT OF FRAME, we:
speaker_heading: cuT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. TED'S HOUSE - EVENING
text: There is a FLASH OF LIGHT and the Phone Booth suddenly
text: drops onto the front lawn next to a large oak tree.
text: Bill, Ted, and Rufus pile out, none of them noticing that:
scene_heading: ABOVE THEM ~- THE LITTLE FRENCH GENERAL
text: is dangling by his collar on a branch of the oak tree,
text: looking like a cat held up by the scruff of its neck.
speaker_heading: BILL AND TED
text: look around the yard, elated. (Throughout the following we
text: are occasionally aware of two FEET which helplessly dangle
scene_heading: INTO FRAME. )
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: C Now where are we?!
dialog: — (beat)
dialog: Oh. It's my house.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Rufus -- can we go anyplace we
dialog: want? At any time?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: (nods)
dialog: You can do whatever you want,
dialog: gentlemen, as long as you
dialog: ’ remember this: No matter what
dialog: happens, you have to get to
dialog: the report. Got it?
text: The guys nod.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: The report's tomorrow at 2:45,
dialog: right?
text: They nod again.
speaker_heading: ~ RUFUS
dialog: : Okay then, amigos...
dialog: {re: phone book)
dialog: This'1l1l tell you the number of
dialog: whatever place you want to go.
text: Rufus points to the numbers on the phone.
speaker_heading: RUFUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Just dial the area and the
dialog: time.
dialog: (re: a "special"
dialog: button)
dialog: And this is what activates the
dialog: time travel function.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Quite simple, William.
dialog: Through a retroactive cross-
dialog: referencing of the
dialog: intralateral continuum ...
text: C ) Rufus stops, noticing that Bill and Ted are totally lost.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Trust me, gentlemen. It
dialog: works.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Now remember, amigos: No
dialog: matter where you go, or what
dialog: you do, that clock --
dialog: (re; Ted's watch)
dialog: the clock in San Dimas -- is
dialog: always running. Got it?
text: Ted nods and looks at his watch. Bill looks at the phone
dialog: book.
text: Rufus bows his head and takes a step back.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Gentlemen, it's time for me to
dialog: leave you now.
text: Bill and Ted look at Rufus, surprised.
speaker_heading: : BILL
dialog: What do you mean, Rufus?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yah. Aren't you coming with
dialog: us?
text: Rufus backs into the phone booth and shakes his head.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: William. Theodore ... You're
dialog: on your own.
text: Bill and Ted watch, wide-eyed, as Rufus closes the door and
text: dials. We HEAR the same great heavy metal chords, and
text: then, in a FLASH of LIGHT --
text: -- the booth disappears.
text: A split second later, there is another FLASH and it
text: reappears, empty.
text: Bill and Ted look at each other.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: _ Ted.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: This has been a most unusual
dialog: day.
text: And as Ted nods in agreement, we HEAR a branch breaking
dialog: above and --
scene_heading: THE FRENCH GENERAL
text: falls from the tree and lands on his feet right in front of
text: them. He looks around, mutters something in French, then
text: topples to the ground, unconscious.
speaker_heading: BILL AND TED
text: are astounded.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Dude ... we saw that guy in
dialog: France.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (shaking his
dialog: head)
dialog: And just when we thought
dialog: things couldn't get any more
dialog: bodacious ...
scene_heading: A MOMENT LATER
text: Bill and Ted are standing over the unconscious General,
text: Bill frantically flipping through his history book.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: So who is he?
text: Bill stops and looks at the book.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Ted ... it's Napoleon.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Who's that?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You know -- the short dead
dialog: dude from our history review!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Whoa! Excellent!
dialog: (to the
dialog: unconscious
dialog: General)
dialog: Hey, you're famous, dude!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: O
dialog:

text: Bill snaps closed the history book and turns to his buddy.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Ted ... I have a most

dialog: And on Bill's excitement we:
dialog: cur TO:
scene_heading: INT. TED'S BEDROOM - CLOSE ON LITTLE Boy
text: Ted's little brother, DEACON, nine years old and bored,
text: listens as Ted explains the plan.
speaker_heading: TED (0.S.)
dialog: Deacon. You have to watch
dialog: this guy. His name is
dialog: Napoleon. He is a very famous
dialog: French dude.
text: PULL BACK TO REVEAL the rest of Ted's bedroom. It's a
text: total mess; covered with scrawled drawings, empty junk-food
text: wrappers and tons of Heavy Metal paraphernalia.
text: Napoleon lays unconscious on Ted's bed.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: We have decided to collect
dialog: other speakers from history
dialog: for a oral report we are
dialog: doing. While we are gone, you
dialog: are not to let him out of your
dialog: sight.
text: Ted hands Deacon some money.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Here is some money. Take him
dialog: to the movies or something.
text: Napoleon starts to come to. He looks around, baffled and a
text: bit angry. Bill notices him.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Napoleon, dude. I am Bill.
dialog: We will take you back to
dialog: France after you tell us what
dialog: you think of San Dimas. This
dialog: is Ted's brother Deacon.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Hi.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: He will take care of you.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Ready Ted?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Ready, Bill.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Let's go back into history!
text: A quick AIR GUITAR, and the guys dash out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
text: Bill and Ted, very excited, are bounding out the front door
text: when Captain Williams suddenly steps INTO FRAME, blocking
text: Ted's path.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: I want to speak with you, son.
text: Bill attempts to re-enter the house.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Alone, please, Bill.
text: And Ted gulps as Williams slams the door shut,
scene_heading: BILL ~ OUTSIDE
text: Alone. Silent. Lost.
text: After a beat, he. leans against the door and presse
text: up to it. His face goes ashen as he HEARS:
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS (0.S.)

scene_heading: INT. HOUSE

speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: When I get back from the

dialog: ready to go. Got it?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Captain Williams turns and heads upstairs. As he does, the

text: erosses to hin.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Dude, we are in serious

dialog: signed me up. My plane leaves

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But that's only if we fail,

speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: No way!!!

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Bill, my friend?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yes, Ted, my friend?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: May we have a most excellent

scene_heading: EXT. OLD WEST TOWN - DAY

speaker_heading: BILL AND TED
text: Sit rooted to their chairs, gaping at the melee developing

speaker_heading: TED

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: However, how would you

dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: Oh, no!

scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE BOOTH

scene_heading: THE HUGE HENCHMAN

speaker_heading: THE GROUND

speaker_heading: THE BOOTH

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: ‘ Dude, this is not San Dimas.

text: Bill and Ted shift nervously.
text: Behind them, Billy the Kid, John the Serf and Socrates look
text: on, impressed.
text: Then, the crowd begins to do a slow, oddly ritualistic
text: version of AIR GUITAR.
text: They stop and look at Bill and Ted, who shrug and do AIR
text: GUITAR themselves.
text: The crowd is deeply moved by this. They begin beckoning to

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Go ahead, dude.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What'll I say?
speaker_heading: TED

speaker_heading: OFFICER JAMES
dialog: Oh -- hello, Ted. I'm sorry,

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: That's okay, Officer James.
dialog: Oh, hey, how come there's a

speaker_heading: BILL

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Let's go, dude!

speaker_heading: THE CELLS

speaker_heading: BILL AND TED

speaker_heading: TED

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Sorry, Dad, but we gotta get

scene_heading: THE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM

speaker_heading: RYAN

dialog: early today. I hope this was
dialog: as valuable and informative
dialog: for all of you as it was for
dialog: us.
text: Behind Ryan, the clock nears 2:45.

dialog: and --
scene_heading: IN THE AUDITORIUM
text: The audience and students stand and are beginning to mill
dialog: about when --
text: -- there is the SOUND of a HUGE CRASH outside. Tires

scene_heading: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL
text: The car skids to a halt in front of the school. Bill jumps

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Thanks for the ride, Mom.
text: As the excited Historical Figures begin to file out and
text: mingle around, Bill darts toward the auditorium.
text: Ted joins the Historical Figures and begins organizing
dialog: them, like a first grade teacher, and we:
dialog: curt TO:
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM
text: Students, parents, and faculty members look around. Then --
text: JUST_AS THE CLOCK HITS 2:45 °--
speaker_heading: BILL

text: All heads turn toward him as he collects himself and faces
dialog: Mr. Ryan.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: O
dialog: So
scene_heading: IN THE AUDITORIUM
text: There is nervous laughter and whispering.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Mr. Ryan, we are ready with

speaker_heading: MR. RYAN
dialog: Bill, I think you should go
dialog: see the Principal.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (emphatic)
dialog: Mr. Ryan, we have our report.
text: Snickers from -Randolf and Ox.
text: People slowly start to sit, amused and curious.
speaker_heading: MR. RYAN
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Okay, Bill...Where is it?
text: Bill clears his throat and gestures grandly toward the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: BILL :
dialog: My distinguished colleague,
dialog: Ted "Theodore" Williams,
dialog: Esquire, will now bring in our
dialog: report.
dialog: Beat.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE AUDITORIUM
text: Ted moves down the line of Historical Figures, giving them
text: each a final look. He smooths down Genghis Khan's hair,
text: straightens Lincoln's coat, picks a bit of hot dog out of
text: Freud's beard.
text: Freud whispers something to Ted.
speaker_heading: TED :
dialog: (reassuring)
dialog: Yes, Sigmund Freud, you look
dialog: very nice.
speaker_heading: INSIDE
text: Bill, still gesturing to the door, is beginning to feel a
text: bit uneasy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: O
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 107
text: People begin to giggle. Ryan shakes his head. Randolf and
text: Ox smirk.
speaker_heading: BILL.

dialog: Ted!
dialog: And finally -~-
speaker_heading: THE DOORS

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED -
dialog: (grandly)
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen of
dialog: History. Please come in,
dialog: single file, in chronological
dialog: order.
text: Then, Ted motions to the door and:
scene_heading: IN THE AUDITORIUM
text: There is UTTER SILENCE as --
text: -- THE HISTORICAL FIGURES BEGIN TO FILE IN.
dialog: 
text: Every jaw in the class, including Mr. Ryan's, drops, as
dialog: Abraham Lincoln, Sigmund Freud, Napoleon Bonaparte, and all
text: the other Great Historical Figures, led by Billa and Ted,
text: parade down the aisle. — ee _ oe
text: Some of the students look down at their own makeshift
dialog: costumes as:
scene_heading: THE TRUE HISTORICAL PERSONAGES
text: Grandly march past them, forming a line at the front of the
dialog: auditorium.
scene_heading: ON STAGE ~- BILL AND TED
text: proudly step up to the podium and face the audience. Bill

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Mr. Ryan, teachers, fellow
dialog: distinguished classmates...it
dialog: is indeed a pleasure to
dialog: introduce to you, to tell us
dialog: what they think of San Dimas,
dialog: the San Dimas Mall, Raging
dialog: Waters, and other elements of
dialog: modern life...some of the
dialog: ‘Greatest Human Beings Who Have
dialog: Ever Lived.
dialog: 
text: And on the packed audience's absolute astonishment, we
dialog: slowly:
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: THE REPORT - A BRIEF MONTAGE
dialog: The following should flow together and overlap fluidly:
dialog: -- A selection of Historical Figures addresses the
text: class. Some use the chalkboard, others are soft
text: spoken, yet others gesticulate wildly and thrash
dialog: about. Those who can, speak English.
dialog: 
text: +- Joan of Are speaks quietly in French. Bill stands
text: beside her, coaxing her along.
text: -- Freud holds a Hot-Dog-on-a-Stick, pontificating
text: grandly. Abe Lincoln reads from his Gettysburg
dialog: Address envelope. Julius Caesar, surprisingly
dialog: ——~nervous, Can't think of anything to say. Some of the
text: other Figures laugh at him.
dialog: 
text: -- In line, Genghis Khan tries to cut in front of
text: Lincoln, but is rebuffed.
text: As it goes on, the report becomes more and more of a
text: "discussion." The Figures agree, disagree, urge each other
text: on, interject respectfully, etc. Most seem to be enjoying
text: themselves. Some open Pudding Cups, Ding Dongs, etc.
text: And by now, the room is jammed with literally hundreds of
text: people, all of whom watch in total, awed silence, as:
speaker_heading: NAPOLEON
text: of tanned and smiling, comes to the end of an animated account
dialog: \ ) of his adventures at Raging Waters.
text: He finishes, and Ted leads him back into the line.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: Ne
dialog: 109
speaker_heading: THE AUDIENCE
text: continues to watch in total, stunned silence. Mr. Ryan's
text: jaw hangs open. Randolf and Ox stare, awed and humbled.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN WILLIAMS
text: Rushes in, stopping in his tracks when he sees:
speaker_heading: BILL AND TED
text: In total control of the rapt crowd. Ted steps out for the
dialog: final introduction.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: And now, our last speaker --
dialog: one of the greatest presidents
dialog: in American history ... Mr.
dialog: Abraham Lincoln.
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
text: steps out of line and moves toward
speaker_heading: THE PODIUM
text: where, with a supportive nod from Bill and Ted, he turns
text: toward the audience.
speaker_heading: LINCOLN :
dialog: On behalf of my colleagues, I
dialog: would like to say thank you to
dialog: Bill and Ted, for this
dialog: wonderful adventure.
text: Bill and Ted beam as the Historical Figures all nod assent.
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: And, I would like to close
dialog: with what I feel is a fitting
dialog: coda to all that you have just
dialog: heard.
text: Lincoln looks to Bill and Ted, who grin proudly.
speaker_heading: LINCOLN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Be excellent to each other,
dialog: and ... Party on, dudes.

scene_heading: INT. SAN DIMAS HIGH GYM - THAT EVENING

text: banners, and romantic lighting. Couples in formal dress
text: dance to rock and roll MUSIC.
scene_heading: EXT. GYM
text: It's about seven p.m. and the sunset sky is a beautiful
text: deep blue.
text: After a beat, we HEAR MUSIC, the sky opens, and, along with
dialog: some miscellaneous debris from history --
scene_heading: THE. PHONE BOOTH
text: appears and drops right in front of the gym. The booth,
text: charred and blackened, appears to be on its last legs. its
text: makeshift Pudding Cup antenna looks about ready to fall
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: BILL AND TED
text: wearing tuxedos, their boxers coming out the backs, step
text: out of the booth. They look tired and weary.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Did we put everything in the
dialog: right place at the police
dialog: station?
speaker_heading: . TED
dialog: Yah, I think so.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We forgot the ladder...
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: That's okay. Good work
dialog: anyhow.
text: Bill looks at Ted, who is now staring at one of the several
text: COUPLES passing by on their way into the gym.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: We traveled through time, we
dialog: met lots of great leaders, we
dialog: got a A+ in History, we broke
dialog: the Guinness Book of World
dialog: Recerd for most people ina
dialog: phone booth ... and we still
dialog: don't have prom dates.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Sorry, dude. We looked all
dialog: ever England for them, but
dialog: they weren't there.
text: But Ted's still down. Bill attempts to cheer him up:
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Hey, at least we can get going
text: with the band now.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yah, I guess. Maybe we should
dialog: start trying to get t-shirts. *
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Ted, before we get t-shirts,
dialog: we should probably try and
dialog: line up Eddie Van Halen.
text: The guys are about to argue when they stop and look at each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Bill. Maybe it's time we
dialog: started learning how to play.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (beat; nods)
dialog: Maybe so, Ted.
text: A Moment passes. Then --
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: c'mon, dude. Let's go inside.
text: The guys move away from the phone booth and are headed
dialog: inside when --
text: The phone booth DISAPPEARS.
text: The guys stop and look at each other.
dialog: TED .
dialog: Dude -- where'd it go?
text: Bill shakes his head. Then we HEAR MUSIC and the guys'
text: eyes widen as, in a blur of LIGHT:
dialog: 
text: The phone booth RE-APPEARS, directly in front of them.
text: After a beat, the doors to the booth open and Rufus
dialog: emerges. -
speaker_heading: O
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Greetings, gentlemen.
text: Bill and Ted are blown away.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Rufus!
speaker_heading: BILL

speaker_heading: RUFUS

dialog: Excellent work, amigos.
text: Bill and Ted beam proudly.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: So -- are you here to go to
dialog: the prom with us, Rufus?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: I'm afraid I can't, gentlemen.
text: Rufus opens the door to the phone booth.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: However ... I know a couple of
dialog: pretty ladies who might --
text: Bill and Ted gape as --
speaker_heading: THE PRINCESSES
text: step out of the booth, looking timelessly beautiful.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: You remember Joanna and
dialog: Elizabeth, don't you?
speaker_heading: JOANNA

speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Can't gentlemen. It's time
dialog: for me to go home.
speaker_heading: BILL/TED
dialog: Home??
speaker_heading: RUFUS

dialog: San Dimas.

speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: You guys were there.
dialog: Remember?

speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: You know that music you were
dialog: talking about?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yah! It's most triumphant.
text: Rufus pulls a cassette tape out of his pocket and shows it
text: to Bill and Ted.
speaker_heading: BILL

speaker_heading: CLOSE ON CASE

speaker_heading: BILL AND TED

speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: You guys are gonna be the

dialog: 
dialog: Oo
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: That's why I was sent to make
dialog: sure you passed the report.
dialog: If you'd been separated, it
dialog: might have been disastrous for
dialog: life as we know it.
dialog: Long beat. Then:
speaker_heading: BILL AND TED
dialog: Excellent!!
text: AIR GUITAR. Then:
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Gentlemen, it's time for me to
dialog: depart.
text: The guys looks at Rufus.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Well...so long, Rufus. Thanks
dialog: for everything.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yah, thanks, Rufus.
dialog: Beat.
text: Bill and Ted move to hug Rufus, look at each other, then

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: We'll never forget you, Rufus.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yah. Never.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Rufus enters the phone booth, closes the door, and dials.
text: Then he smiles, winks, and in a glorious burst of F light,
text: color and music ... Rufus is gone.
text: We HOLD on the two happy, waving couples.
text: Then Bill and Ted escort the Princesses toward the door.
scene_heading: EXT. GYM
text: While the girls head inside, Bill and Ted stop in the

speaker_heading: TED

scene_heading: THE TWO PORTRAITS
