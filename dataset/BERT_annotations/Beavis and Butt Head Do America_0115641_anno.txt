dialog: 
dialog: Mike Judge and Joe Stillman
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The movie begins with scenes of people screaming in horror
text: and running down the streets of a big city. The ground shakes from
text: what seems like giant footsteps. There are pieces of building
text: debris falling everywhere, people getting crushed, power lines
text: coming down, etc. - complete pandemonium. It all looks very much
text: like a Japanese animated King-Kong or Godzilla movie. We hear the
text: footsteps getting closer and the ground shaking becomes more
text: intense - more debris falling. Then we see a HUGE BLACK TENNIS
text: SHOE come into frame and smash a National Guard truck. As we pan
text: up, we see the white socks, then the red shorts, the AC/DC T-
text: shirt, then we hear the familiar, "Huh huh huh." - only it's a
text: huge sound...this is a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT TALL BUTT-HEAD. "Butt-
text: Kong" continues his path of destruction - stomping on cars and
dialog: buildings and saying, "This is cool. Huh huh huh."
text: Airplanes and tanks start firing at Butt-Head (Butt-Kong).
text: He looks irritated and says, "Cut it out butt-munch!" Butt-Head
text: swats at the planes, sending them crashing to the ground and
text: stomps on the tanks. Then, something catches his eye. Butt-Head
text: reaches into a skyscraper and picks up a nice looking woman - a
text: lot like the one from the King Kong movie. He looks down at her in
text: his hand and goes wide-eyed, "Whoa! Huh huh huh." The woman
text: screams in terror as Butt-Head looks down at her and tries a few
dialog: lame pick up lines. "Uuuuh...Hey baby. I'm like, pretty tall. Huh
text: huh huh." He swats down a helicopter that is circling his head,
text: "Dammit, I'm trying to score!" The helicopter goes down in flames.
text: We CUT TO some guys sitting on a tank firing at him. They notice
text: giant footsteps coming from the other direction and turn the tank
text: around. Through their binoculars we see a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT
text: BEAVIS coming from the horizon. The giant Beavis is even more
text: destructive than Butt-Kong (maybe he could be breathing fire).
text: Beavis starts trying to pick up on Butt-Head's woman. Butt-Head
text: puts the woman down and he and Beavis begin to go at it, leveling
text: the city with one of their stupid juvenile smack-fights.
text: We CROSS-DISSOLVE from three-hundred foot Beavis shaking
text: Butt-Kong to Butt-Head asleep on the couch with Beavis shaking
dialog: him.

speaker_heading: BEAVIS (O.C.)
dialog: Butt-Head! Butt-Head! Hey, Butt-Head!
dialog: 
text: Butt-Head is dead asleep on the couch. Beavis shakes him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: Butt-Head, wake up, wake up!
dialog: 
text: Butt-Head comes around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: Dammit, Beavis, I was about to score.
dialog: Huh huh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: Yeah, but check it out. It's gone!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: What's gone?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: The TV.
dialog: 
text: Beavis is making STRANGE NOISES, in a state of shock.
dialog: 
text: Butt-Head rubs his eyes and looks at the empty space where the TV
dialog: was.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: Uuuuuuh, huh huh. Uuh,...
dialog: 
text: Out the window, we see two YOUNG MEN carrying B&amp;B's TV into their
dialog: van.
dialog: 
text: Still on the couch, Butt-Head looks over at the broken window. We
text: see a CROWBAR lying on the floor, and the front door left open.
dialog: 
text: Butt-Head looks at the BROKEN WINDOW, at the CROWBAR, the OPEN
text: DOOR, then back at the EMPTY SPACE where the TV was. He does this
text: a couple of times - piecing it all together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
dialog: Whoa! I think I just figured something
dialog: out Beavis.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: This sucks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: Yeah, heh heh.
dialog: 
text: Beavis is still in shock. They both stare at the empty space where
text: the TV was for a beat, not quite sure what to do.
dialog: 
text: Beavis is SHAKING AND MAKING WEIRD NOISES. He presses buttons on
text: the remote a few times, as if it might help somehow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: This sucks more than anything that
dialog: has ever sucked before. We must find
dialog: this butt-hole that took the TV.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bad neighborhood. 70's music blares.
dialog: 
text: A fast driving car drives right at us and stops. Punks run in
text: fear. Beavis hops out of the driver's seat, wearing bell-bottoms,
text: chain jewelry and a 70's afro. Into a dramatic CLOSE-UP, he takes
text: off his glasses.
dialog: 
scene_heading: FREEZE ON BEAVIS
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: Beavis!
dialog: 
text: FRAME UNFREEZES. Beavis whips out a huge gun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: Freeze, butt-wipe!
dialog: 
text: An attacker comes from one side. Beavis uses Judo. Another tosses
text: a knife. Beavis ducks, then shoots with two hands, police style.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Swinger's pad. Totally 70's. A group of bikini'd girls on a

scene_heading: FREEZE ON BUTT-HEAD
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER

text: ACTION MONTAGE BEGINS. Styled like a 70's cop show opening.
dialog: 
text: OPENING CREDITS to the movie appear just as cop show credits
dialog: would.
dialog: 
text: Beavis does a Starsky and Hutch-style roll with a gun.
dialog: 
text: Butt-Head slaps a pimp.
dialog: 
text: Beavis drives, chasing a car.
dialog: 
text: Butt-Head is slapped by a girl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: Huh huh huh. That was cool.
dialog: 
text: Beavis and Butt-Head are in a warehouse shoot-out.
dialog: 
text: A black police chief rises from a desk to yell at B&amp;B.
dialog: 
text: B&amp;B dive for cover just before a building explodes.
dialog: 
text: In CLOSE-UP, Beavis smiles for an ID shot.
dialog: 
text: Butt-Head does the same.
dialog: 
text: Beavis, in a rooftop fight, kicks his opponent over the edge.
dialog: 
text: A beautiful woman, back to us, takes off her dress for Butt-Head.
text: FINAL OPENING CREDIT APPEARS. Butt-Head and the woman fall into
text: bed. Suddenly...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY/DOOR TO A.V. ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: From inside, SOUND of equipment crashing.
dialog: 
text: B&amp;B come out wheeling a TV on one of those carts. There are cables
text: attached to it still leading back into the A.V. room. As they push
text: the cart we hear more equipment falling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: Dammit, it's stuck.
dialog: 
text: They give it one big push and it finally breaks free. We see that
text: the cables are tangled with cables from other TVs and VCRs, which
text: all come crashing to the ground.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
dialog: Huh huh huh. That was cool.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this

speaker_heading: VAN DRIESSEN
dialog: Ah, excuse me boys. What's going on
dialog: here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: Uh, someone stole our TV.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: Yeah. We're just gonna use this one.
dialog: Get outta the way. Heh heh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VAN DRIESSEN
dialog: I'm afraid that TV belongs to the school.
dialog: Mmmkay? You know, this could be a positive
dialog: experience for you guys. There's a
dialog: wonderful world out there when we discover
dialog: we don't need TV to entertain us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh

speaker_heading: VAN DRIESSEN
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: Have you guys heard a word I've said?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: Yeah, "anus." Huh huh huh huh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VAN DRIESSEN
dialog: Look, guys, just take the TV back to the
dialog: A.V. room right now. And try to be a little
dialog: more open-minded. Mmkay?
dialog: 
text: Van Driessen leaves. B&amp;B continue to wheel the cart home.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: What a dork. Huh huh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: Yeah, heh heh. He's a anus. Heh heh.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL/STAIRWAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: B&amp;B arrive with the cart at the top of a stairway. They lamely
text: attempt to let it slowly down the steps. The cart is too top-heavy
text: and goes tumbling to the bottom of the stairs, shattering the TV.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: Huh huh huh. That was cool.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: No it wasn't!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD

dialog: 
text: B&amp;B stand at the top of the stairs looking down at the wrreckage.

speaker_heading: McVICKER

speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't
dialog: know Anderson had a Camper.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV.
dialog: Heh heh. TV.
dialog: 
text: B&amp;B walk up to the camper and start to open the door just as MARCY
text: ANDERSON opens it. (As usual, she doesn't recognize them.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCY
dialog: Oh, hello. Are you guys here to look
dialog: at the refrigerator?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: Uh, no.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: We're here to look at the TV. Heh heh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCY
dialog: Oh, I didn't realize it was broken.
dialog: Come on in.

speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD

dialog: 
text: Tom is adjusting the trailer-hitch. Marcy watches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Well that oughtta hold her. Ya know,
dialog: the most important thing you can have
dialog: on a camper is a good propane regulator,
dialog: and this here's the best one they make.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCY
dialog: I sure hope we can get the 'fridge fixed
dialog: before we leave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Now Marcy, we've been savin' for this trip
dialog: our whole lives and we're gonna go come
dialog: Hell or high water...
dialog: 
text: Through the camper walls, we hear the faint sound of B&amp;B
scene_heading: AIR/MOUTH-GUITARING "IRON MAN."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT.)
dialog: What the hell is that noise?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ANDERSON'S CAMPER - DUSK
dialog: 
text: B&amp;B watch a "Cops"-type show. Beavis gets up, goes to the
text: refrigerator and grabs a soda. The refrigerator is under the
text: counter on which the TV is sitting.
dialog: 
text: Beavis takes a sip and then does a SPIT TAKE, SPRAYING SODA ALL
text: OVER THE TOP OF THE TV.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: AAAAAAGH!!! This crap is warm!
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON TV: The soda Beavis spit out drips into the inside of the
text: TV. We see smoke and hear SIZZLING AND SHORT CIRCUIT SFX. The TV
text: goes dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: Beavis, you butt-hole! You broke it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ANDERSON'S CAMPER - DUSK

speaker_heading: TOM

speaker_heading: MARCY
dialog: They're here to fix the TV, Tom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: The TV ain't broken.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: Yeah it is. Huh huh huh.
dialog: 
text: Tom adjusts his glasses as he looks at B&amp;B.
dialog: 
text: TOM'S BLURRY P.O.V.: We see B&amp;B out of focus.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Hey wait a minute. You two look kinda
dialog: familiar. Ain't you them kids that've
dialog: been whackin' off in my tool shed?
dialog: 
scene_heading: BEAVIS &amp; BUTT-HEAD
dialog: Huh huh huh huh huh.

dialog: 
text: B&amp;B walk off, leaving Tom wondering.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET IN A SEEDY PART OF TOWN - JUST BEFORE DAWN
dialog: 
text: B&amp;B are having TV withdrawal. Butt-Head is bug-eyed. Beavis has
text: the shakes bad, arms folded like Dustin Hoffman in "Midnight
dialog: Cowboy."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: What's your problem Beavis?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: I need TV now! Now! NNNNDAMMIT!!!
dialog: 
text: Butt-Head stops short. He looks up. His face is bathed in a
text: golden, throbbing light.
dialog: 
text: BUTT-HEAD'S P.O.V.: We see a flashing neon sign that says, "TV".
text: Pull back to show B&amp;B are standing outside the Elite Motel Lodge,
text: featuring "Color TV" and "Air-Cooled Rooms", with "Special Nap
dialog: Rates."
dialog: 
text: B&amp;B stare up, as if at a god.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL COURT - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Butt-Head tries the first door. It's locked. He tries the second
text: door. It's locked. He tries the third door. It opens.
dialog: 
text: B&amp;B's eyes bulge. Inside, PRINCIPAL McVICKER is lying across the
text: legs of an obvious prostitute, his pants pulled down. She SPANKS
dialog: him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: McVICKER
dialog: Please mmm... may I have another?!
dialog: 
text: B&amp;B LAUGH. McVicker hears and looks up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: McVICKER (CONT.)

dialog: bastards.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: Can we watch your TV?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: McVICKER
dialog: Y... Y... You're expelled! Get out!
dialog: 
text: Butt-Head closes the door, laughing, and starts to walk towards
text: the next door. The muffled sound of a SPANK can be heard followed
text: by McVicker asking for another.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: Huh huh huh. That was cool.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing
dialog: everything!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The only light in the room is a flickering TV. Sitting on the bed,
text: talking on the phone is MUDDY. He's a tough, mean looking red-neck
dialog: - a Jack Ruby type.
dialog: 
text: On the nightstand next to him is a three-quarter drunk bottle of
text: bourbon and a manila envelope. On his lap is a big gun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: ...Are you sure these guys can pull this
dialog: off? It's gotta look like an accident...
dialog: 
text: We hear a knock on the door and muffled B&amp;B laughs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUDDY (CONT.)
dialog: Hold on a minute. That must be them now.
dialog: I'll call you back. (Hangs up phone)...
dialog: Come in!

speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: Yer late.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: Why? Did we miss American Gladiators?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MUDDY'S P.O.V.: B&amp;B are a drunken blur.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: Well, Earl said you guys were young, but
dialog: jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get
dialog: the job done. So what are your names?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: Uh, Butt-Head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: Beavis.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: That's alright. I'd rather not know your
dialog: real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm
dialog: gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you
dialog: ten grand plus expenses, all payable after
dialog: you do her...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: (full of innuendo)
dialog: Do her? Huh huh.

speaker_heading: BEAVIS

dialog: Uh, huh huh... We'll do it, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: Okay, then let's get down to business.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON THE BED. Muddy slaps down a picture of DALLAS, his wife.
text: Leather clad, biker, beautiful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUDDY (CONT.)
dialog: Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't
dialog: as sweet as she looks. She stole everything

speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
dialog:

speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: One more thing. Mah wife's got this

scene_heading: EXT. AIRPORT - EARLY MORNING
dialog:

speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: We're gonna get paid to score.

scene_heading: INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

speaker_heading: DOLORIS
dialog: Hi. Can I help you find your seats?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: Uuh, nah. These seats are OK.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOLORIS
dialog: I think your tickets have you seated
dialog: in row fourteen, coach. So why don't
dialog: you just go ahead and move back, OK?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: That's OK. Someone else can have those.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: Yeah, it's not that important to me,
dialog: really. Those seats are too small anyways.
dialog: 
text: Doloris yanks them out of their seats and leads them down the

text: woman, MARTHA, sits by the window. Next to her: Two empty seats.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOLORIS
dialog: Here you are.
dialog: 
text: She gestures to the seats and leaves. Beavis climbs in the middle,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Hi, I'm Tammy? Can I help you with that?
dialog: 
text: Butt-Head looks up.
dialog: 
text: From his P.O.V. we see a beautiful woman, TAMMY, smiling, her
text: hands reaching down. FALLING IN LOVE/HARP MUSIC STING plays.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE on Butt-Head's lap as two female hands reach down and pull
text: one strap from between Butt-Head's legs.
dialog: 
text: Butt-Head looks down at his lap as Tammy leans over him. A loud
text: CLICKING can be heard. Butt-Head stares blankly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMMY (CONT.)
dialog: There you go. You're all set.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: I love you.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: Wait, I wanted her to do it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN'S VOICE
dialog: Flight attendants, please prepare for
dialog: take-off.
dialog: 
text: The engines start to hum. The plane is rolling.
dialog: 
text: Butt-Head struggles to get his seat belt off. He does everything
text: but pull the handle. Beavis goes white with fear.
dialog: 
text: The plane starts to shake. The engines rumble. Beavis starts to
dialog: freak.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: Hey wait a minute. What's going on?!
dialog: 
text: Butt-Head bangs away at his seat belt. Beavis looks out the window

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS (CONT.)

scene_heading: ANGLE ON COUPLE IN FRONT OF B&amp;B:

dialog: 
text: The plane arcs upward. Butt-Head finally gets the belt off as the
text: plane is in full thrust. He rises and goes tumbling backward down
dialog: the aisle.
dialog: 
text: ON PEOPLE seeing Butt-Head flying, screaming in panic.
dialog: 
dialog: In free fall:
dialog: 
text: Butt-Head grabs the door to the hangable luggage. It all comes
text: tearing out.
dialog: 
text: Butt-Head flies up, hitting several overhead luggage racks, which
text: open and spill their contents.
dialog: 
text: Butt-Head lands in the galley, causing food to go flying and
text: coffee to pour freely.
dialog: 
text: ON THE CABIN as the plane starts to level out. People stop their
text: screaming.
dialog: 
text: ON BUTT-HEAD, underneath the rubble, poking his head out. He's
text: directly across from the flight attendant station where Tammy is
text: strapped in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: Uh, huh huh... could you, like, do that
dialog: thing with my belt again?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PLANE - LATER
dialog: 
text: All's in order. Flight attendants roll the beverage cart up the
text: aisle. People read, relaxed.
dialog: 
text: ON BEAVIS AND MARTHA. Martha is showing pictures of her
text: grandchildren. Beavis is showing the picture of Dallas that Muddy
dialog: gave him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: I'm probably going to make out with her
dialog: first before we, you know, get down...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: You'll have to speak up son. I have this
dialog: ringing in my ears. My doctor says it
dialog: could be related to my heart
dialog: palpitations. I've had two operations on
dialog: my heart.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: Really? I poop too much.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: Uh... No, (louder) I poop too much. Then
dialog: I get tired.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Well, if you find yourself getting tired,
dialog: take a couple of these.
dialog: 
text: She hands him a box of NoDrowz.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA (CONT.)
dialog: They perk me right up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: Heh heh, thanks.
dialog: 
text: He pours the contents into his hand and chews them like candy.
text: Then his eyes open wide.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS (CONT.)
dialog: (strange)
dialog: Uh, tastes like crap. Heh heh. Mmmmm.
dialog: 
text: Beavis starts wolfing them down.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PLANE - A BIT LATER
dialog: 
text: Tammy passes out meals from a rolling cart. She works with
text: Doloris. Butt-head stands behind Tammy, attempting to hit on her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: (to Tammy)
dialog: So, uh huh huh, are you going to Las
dialog: Vegas? Huh huh huh.
dialog: 
text: Tammy ignores him and moves on, leaving Butt-Head there.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON BUTT-HEAD, looking down at something.
dialog: 
text: PAN DOWN to reveal he's looking at a BEER on a fat guy's tray. The
text: guy's asleep.
dialog: 
text: Butt-head picks up the beer.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON BEAVIS, nearby. The NoDrowz is starting to take effect.
text: Beavis starts shaking, babbling, staring cross-eyed at his fist,
dialog: etc. (pre-Cornholio stuff)
dialog: 
text: Tammy reaches her next passenger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMMY
dialog: Hi, we're serving dinner. Our selections
dialog: tonight are chicken piccata or seafood
dialog: gumbo...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS (O.S.)
dialog: Piccata? Piccata! Picattatta tatta!
dialog: 
text: Tammy moves forward, leaving Butt-Head standing there. In the
text: background, we see Beavis starting to quake, on the verge of
text: Cornholio mode.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PASSENGER
dialog: Does the gumbo have corn in it?
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON BEAVIS: Turned, facing the cabin, T-shirt pulled over his
text: head in full Cornholio mode.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: I am Cornholio! I need picatta for
dialog: my bunghole!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMMY
dialog: You'll have to wait your turn sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: Are you threatening me? My bunghole
dialog: will not wait!
dialog: 
text: Beavis starts to wander down the aisle.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON CURTAIN TO FIRST CLASS CABIN. Beavis enters. From the
text: other side, SOUND of screams. We hear several CALL BUTTONS being
dialog: pressed.
dialog: 
text: ON BUTT-HEAD. He approaches Tammy from behind. She ignores him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: Uh, I got a beer. Want some? Huh huh.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE INSIDE THE COCKPIT.
dialog: 
text: The PILOTS are relaxed and settled in when the door to the cockpit
text: slams open. Beavis is in the doorway SCREAMING.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: Bargarajjjaaaahhh!!! I am Cornholio!!
dialog: 
text: The pilots SCREAM. The copilot jumps up so fast he causes coffee
text: to spill everywhere, including on the captain's lap. The captain
text: then jumps up, hitting the controls and SENDING THE PLANE INTO A
scene_heading: NOSE-DIVE.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON BUTT-HEAD
dialog: 
text: In the back of the plane standing next to Tammy. He starts to take
text: a sip of beer. The nose-dive of the plane causes Butt-Head to go
text: FLYING TOWARDS THE FRONT OF THE PLANE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
text: AAAAAHHH!!! Huh huh. AAAAHHH!!!
dialog: 
text: Butt-Head bounces all overthe plane and then gets tangled up in
text: the curtain that separates first class and coach. It tears off,
text: and he continues to fly forward.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COCKPIT
dialog: 
text: The captain is desperately trying to regain control of the plane.
dialog: 
text: Butt-Head slams into the cockpit, landing on the control panel
text: facing the captain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Get the hell out of the cockpit!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: Huh huh, you said...

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN

scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT DOOR - EARLY EVENING

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ATTENDANTS
dialog: Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
dialog: 
text: They grow silent and still as B&amp;B pass by. Beavis takes the T-

speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD

scene_heading: INT. TERMINAL/ARRIVAL GATE - DAY

speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?

speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be

dialog: 
text: People greet and walk away. The place starts to clear out.
dialog: 
text: One limo driver is left standing. He wears sunglasses and holds a
text: sign that reads: Beavis and Butt-Head.
dialog: 
text: B&amp;B look around. Except for the driver, they're alone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS (CONT.)
dialog: Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding
dialog: a sign?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check
dialog: this out.

speaker_heading: DRIVER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: And Boot-Head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it,

speaker_heading: BEAVIS

dialog: 
text: The limo driver rolls his eyes and walks away.

speaker_heading: DRIVER

scene_heading: EXT. MUDDY'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY

speaker_heading: ROSS

speaker_heading: HARLAN

speaker_heading: MUDDY

dialog: 
text: Harlan and Ross seem momentarily confused.
dialog: 
text: Muddy revs the engine, peels out backwards HITTING THE FRONT OF

dialog: With You" by Barry White or something obnoxious like

speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Don't worry, sir. Just stick to the main

speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my

dialog: 
text: BUTT-HEAD'S VISION. Through time-lapse dissolves we see him

speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: Whoa, my life is cool!
dialog: 
scene_heading: TIGHT ON BEAVIS:

speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: Uh... I think I'm seeing something too.
dialog: It's like a really long time ago...
dialog: 
text: BEAVIS' VISION: Beavis as a sperm cell swimming through a uterus.
text: It's a sperm cell with the face of Beavis on it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS/SPERM
dialog: Yeah, heh heh. This is gonna be cool.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS/SPERM (CONT.)
dialog: Hey, how's it goin'? Heh heh heh.
dialog:

scene_heading: BACK ON BEAVIS:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: Yeah, heh heh I scored.
dialog: 
text: Animated bubbles appear around Beavis' head.

speaker_heading: BEAVIS (CONT.)
dialog: Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird.
dialog: I think I'm freaking out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: Huh? Huh huh.

speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: Whoa, this is cool! Heh heh. It's like,

dialog: 
text: BEAVIS' P.O.V. OF BUTT-HEAD: His face starts to warp and colors
dialog: start shifting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS (CONT.)
dialog: ...and... Whoa!...and it's like there's
dialog: all these weird shapes and it's sort of
dialog: like,...it's like...like a MUSIC VIDEO!!!
dialog: 
text: Tight on Beavis' face staring in wonder.
dialog: 
text: THIS IS WHERE THE MUSIC VIDEO/HALLUCINATION SEQUENCE BEGINS. It
dialog: could even be so shameless as to actually have a chyron in the
text: lower left hand corner.
dialog: 
dialog: I would like to have a band (White Zombie?) do a version of
dialog: something like, "Fire," by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. This
dialog: is the song that begins, "I am God of Hellfire and I bring you...
dialog: fire!"
dialog: 
dialog: The concept of this will depend somewhat on which band we get, but
dialog: I would like to see it get pretty wild and surreal. (If it's White
dialog: Zombie, we could incorporate some of Rob Zombie's artwork.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS' P.O.V.:
dialog: 
text: We see the sun above the horizon turn into a giant ball of fire.
text: The ball of fire develops a face and speaks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FIRE
dialog: I am God of Hellfire and I bring
dialog: you...(music begins) Fire...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: Whoa!!! This kicks ass!!!
dialog: 
text: THIS IS THE GREATEST VIDEO BEAVIS HAS EVER SEEN. Out of the ball
text: of fire steps a beautiful woman in a bikini.
dialog: 
text: At first the video is mostly the God of Hellfire, chicks in
text: bikinis and various images of B&amp;B's TV in all its glory.
dialog: 
text: As the video/hallucination continues, it becomes a psychotic mass
text: of naked people, fire, TVs, vultures, B&amp;B head-banging, weird
dialog: stuff from my high school notebooks, etc.
dialog: 
text: At one point we see the God of Hellfire in a Burger World uniform.
dialog: 
text: As the song winds down, we incorporate Muddy's car into the
dialog: surreal imagery. (We should also incorporate their TV, as well as
dialog: maybe some of the characters from the show that aren't in the
dialog: movie.)
dialog: 
text: Then, we REVEAL Muddy's car actually pulling up to B&amp;B's near-dead
dialog: bodies.
dialog: 
text: The SONG ENDS as Muddy tosses water on B&amp;B. REVEAL they were not
text: far from the side of a road all along.
dialog: 
dialog: B&amp;B
dialog: Ahhhhghhhhgh!
dialog: 
text: B&amp;B snap out of it. They rise and find Muddy hovering over them
text: with a shotgun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: Aagh! I'm all wet!...(realizing) Oh, cool.
dialog: Heh heh heh. Water.
dialog:

speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD

dialog: his wife.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS

dialog: Washington? We're gonna meet her there

dialog: Aw right, in the trunk. You're gonna help

dialog: B&amp;B
dialog: Huh huh huh huh huh huh.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: This sucks. Let's get outta here.
dialog: 
text: They look out. The road behind them races past at 80 mph. Beavis

speaker_heading: BEAVIS
dialog: Uh, you first.

speaker_heading: BUTT-HEAD
dialog: C'mon, Beavis, just start running really

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEAVIS (CONT.)
dialog: Owwwwww, my butt!!!!!!
dialog: 
text: His body stops in the middle of the road. A huge truck, about to
