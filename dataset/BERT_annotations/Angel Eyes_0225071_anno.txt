scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS (LOS ANGELES) - NIGHT
scene_heading: CREDIT SEQUENCE.
text: As OPENING CREDITS play, we study the city's nighttime
text: pulse, ribbons of headlights moving and cross-connecting
text: like blood through the veins of a body --
dialog: impressionistic, even beautiful, but what we're hearing
text: is soulful trumpet-based MUSIC, mellow and haunting, the
text: modern classic -- JAZZ sound of a Wynton Marsalis,
text: putting a voice to our story. As CREDITS END, we...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: POV - EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT
text: Now the MUSIC is GONE, SOUNDS are MUFFLED and vision
dialog: blurred. We get the impression of urgent movement. We
text: hear BREATHING. There are VOICES, SHOUTS, even SCREAMS,
text: but MUFFLED, far away. Only the breathing is distinct.
text: We come to realize it is our breathing, and we are inside
text: someone, looking out. The man whose POV this is is on
text: the edge of consciousness and not far from death. He
text: lies on the pavement of a freeway at the site of an
text: accident only minutes after impact.
text: His VISION goes IN and OUT of clarity. People are
text: swarming around him and rushing by toward the carnage of
text: wrecked vehicles. A SIREN BLOOMS in the distance and
text: approaches haltingly. The man slips away, comes back
text: toward consciousness, slips again.
text: The crowd around the downed man parts to allow passage to
text: a police officer. It is a woman, Officer SHARON POGUE,
text: LAPD. She kneels at the man's side, taking charge,
text: speaking, but we hear only SLIVERS of SOUND. He sees her
text: face clearly now, close above him.
dialog: Sharon is a dedicated professional and more. We see down
text: into her to a place of real caring. She stares into our
text: eyes and connects. We begin to hear her now -- and there
text: are more SIRENS converging in b.g.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Can you hear me?
dialog: (shouting, off)
dialog: This one's conscious!
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Paramedics on the way!
text: We are slipping away again. Sharon holds us with her
text: eyes, and she grips our hand.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Wait. Wait. Listen to me. Can
dialog: you feel that?
text: She holds on tight. We see that our hand, held in her
dialog: own, is bloody.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: That's my hand. Hold it. Go on
dialog: -- as hard as you can.
text: We watch our hand gripping hers, and as we hold on, the
text: sights and sounds around us grow more clear.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: It's over, and I've got you, and
dialog: you're safe. You're safe now.
dialog: You got that? Don't let go.
dialog: Don't let me go.
text: But our eyes unlock from Sharon's and DRIFT TO a patch of
text: night sky. Her voice fades awawy. Our POV begins TO
text: LIFT, MOVING TOWARD that sky, as the blue-black night
text: begins to turn white. We GO INTO that white light and...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LOS ANGELES CITYSCAPE - DAY
text: We PICK OUT a police car from the traffic and FOLLOW.
text: The beat being patrolled is a mixed neighborhood with
text: some very rough edges.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE CAR - DAY
text: Officer Sharon Pogue is driving the car. It is two years
dialog: since we saw her at the accident site. Her partner,
text: ROBBY LEWIS, sips coffee and keeps one eye on the CAD
text: monitor which lists all area police calls. She slows
text: behind a car that is crawling along, an old 60s car,
text: driven by a young man and woman who sit very close on the
text: bench seat. The car's ENGINE is MISSING and smoking.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: That car is older than they are.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: '67 Chevy Impala.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: That's what I said.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Needs a servicing.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Don't we all.
text: Robby nearly spits his coffee, laughing at what Sharon
text: has said and trying not to choke. Sharon smiles, shaking
text: her head.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Get it together, officer.
text: As Robby smiles, Sharon looks ahead at the young couple
text: who each have an arm around the other. She is stroking
text: his neck. He is making gentle circles in her hair.
text: Sharon watches this, and for a moment her eyes reveal a
text: depth that may be loneliness, but she quickly pushes her
text: thoughts away and hits the HORN, startling Robby and
text: startling the people ahead who now disengage and drive
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Jesus, Pogo! Almost spilled my
dialog: coffee again! You didn't like his
dialog: hair, or what?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I love Elvis hair. They were
dialog: going two damn miles an hour.
text: But Robby's eyes have caught something on the monitor.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Let's roll to this -- fight in
dialog: progress.
text: As Robby secures that coffee cup, Sharon hits the SIREN
text: and speeds around the car in front of them.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
text: At the same time, a few blocks away, an OLD, FRAIL MAN is
text: carrying two plastic grocery bags that are too heavy for
dialog: him.
text: Walking behind this man is a younger man named CATCH
text: LAMBERT, an attractive man with some scarring on his
text: face. His eyes, deep down, are haunted by something, but
text: there is energy in his step. He is dressed in a relaxed
text: and stylish manner, not expensive. He begins to pick up
text: his pace to catch up to the old man.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: People glance at Catch, nad he glances back in an open
text: and unflinching way, ready for anything, a smile, a nod,
dialog: or -- because these are some of L.A.'s mean streets -- a
text: threatening or taunting look. These he also meets
text: openly, without a trace of fear. The man has been
text: through some kind of fire, and it has left him different
dialog: from us. Outside the usual boundaries.
text: Catch walks beside the Old Man, glancing at him.
text: Finally, the man glances back, wondering and suspicious,
text: but Catch has a slight, disarming smile, open and honest.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Y'know... since we're both walking
dialog: the same way, I could take one of
dialog: those bags for you. That way, I
dialog: do some upper body work while I'm
text: walking along. Helps my back.
dialog: What d'you say?
text: The Old Man trudges on, proud and suspicious, too.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Right now your mind's making
dialog: pictures of me robbing your
dialog: groceires, but, y'know, nine times
dialog: out of ten, people do the right
dialog: thing.
text: The Old Man glances at him, still not convinced, but he
text: soon has to stop and rest. Catch stops, too. The old
text: man looks at him, a bit embarrassed.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: It's the dog food that makes it so
dialog: heavy.
text: Catch nods, puts out his hand. The Old Man hesitates,
text: then decides and lifts a bag, and Catch takes it.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I guess it's worth it... for a
dialog: good dog.
dialog: Catch isn't kidding. He has that honesty. The Old Man
text: nods and starts trudging again. As they walk on
text: together, Catch reaches for that second bag. The man
text: relents and lets him take it. They continue on, Catch
text: carrying the bags and every now and then lifting them a
text: bit for his upper body work.
dialog: 5.
scene_heading: EXT. VIDEO GAME ROOM - DAY
text: This is the call Sharon and Robby have sped to. It is a
text: chaotic scene of cops breaking up a fight between eight
text: boys, 16-20. A big KID, 18 or so, is being pulled off
text: another by Sharon and Robby. The Kid is wild and
text: resisting and Sharon shows her toughness and
text: professionalism and some anger, too, as she slams him
text: into a fence -- and Robby holds him while she cuffs the
text: young man -- who is very mouthy, playing to his friends.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Look at this bitch. Whoo! Benny,
dialog: look at this!
text: Sharon and Robby are both very good at their jobs, taking
text: this Kid to their car while other cops contain the rest.
text: A crowd watches -- mostly teens.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: (to Sharon)
dialog: You come in with me. Hey, bitch.
text: Some of his bystanders friends howl at that.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: You're going to arrest me, you
dialog: come into the back seat with me.
dialog: Come on!
text: He resists a bit, but they're getting him into the car.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Come on. We'll have a good time.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE CAR - DAY (FEW MINUTES LATER)
text: Sharon's on the radio to dispatch as Robby drives and the
text: Kid keeps mouthing off.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: (to radio)
dialog: Three Adam Five -- show us 1019 to
text: the jail with one male prisoner.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Take off your uniform. Take off
dialog: my handcuffs, bitch, and come back
dialog: here. I want one touch.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Give it a rest!
text: Sharon is stone-faced through this.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: If you're going to put me away,
dialog: you gotta give me one sweet touch.
scene_heading: INT. JAIL BOOKING AREA - DAY
text: As Robby and Sharon bring their suspect to the booking
text: counter, each holding one of his cuffed arms. The Kid is
text: looking at Sharon's hand on his arm.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: That ain't the touch. That ain't
dialog: the touch I want.
text: They get him to the counter.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: As I remove your cuffs, I want you
dialog: to put your hands here. Spread
dialog: your legs. More.
text: As they remove the cuffs, the Kid makes a sudden move
text: toward Sharon, reaching between her legs -- but she was
dialog: not only ready for this, but hoping for it -- and the
text: stoniness of her face cracks into fierce anger as she
text: moves quickly and grabs the Kid by the hair, bringing his
text: face into her upraised knee. He cries out and goes down
text: on his knees, hurting and bleeding. The jailer rushes
text: over to help, but Robby grabs the Kid's wrists.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: That's it. Back off, John, we got
dialog: it.
text: Robby glances at Sharon -- a dark glance.
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE JAIL PARKING LOT - DAY (LATER)
text: as Robby and Sharon walk to their car. They are
text: interrupted by one of their lieutenants, SANDERMAN,
text: walking their way and stopping to stare at Sharon. She
text: meets his look.
speaker_heading: SANDERMAN
dialog: You trying to be a bad-ass, Pogue?
text: She is straightforward, not rebellious.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I just dealt with the situation.
dialog: The prisoner...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SANDERMAN
dialog: And you don't see a pattern here?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I want you to keep yourself way
text: inside the line instead of walking
dialog: on it. All right? Are you taking
dialog: notes?
text: He walks away, and Sharon and Robby walk on to their
text: car -- she is dark; he is glancing at her.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: You broke his nose.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: He grabbed me. End of story.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: And you were waiting for him. You
dialog: were hoping. You were making
text: long-range plans for his ass while
text: he was mouthing off in the car --
dialog: and you're supposed to be above
dialog: that shit.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: If you think I crossed the line,
dialog: put it in the report.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Pogo, stop the shit. What is it?
dialog: You pissed off at me, too?
text: They enter the car, Sharon behind the wheel.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Not you, Rob. You're a rare
text: unthreatened male cop with a good
dialog: marriage, and you like to eat
dialog: where I eat -- so everything's
dialog: code four.
text: She STARTS the CAR and starts to back out, and he reaches
text: over and turns OFF the IGNITION. She stares hotly at
text: him -- but then, slowly, she softens, takes a deep
dialog: breath.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Come over for dinner tonight.
dialog: I'll call Charlene. She'd like to
dialog: see you. It's been awhile. We'll
dialog: talk about it.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She STARTS the CAR again, more calm, starts to drive out
dialog: of the lot.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Thanks. But she'll invite
dialog: friends, try and fix me up. She's
dialog: always trying to fix me up so she
dialog: doesn't have to worry about you
dialog: and me.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: She doesn't worry about that.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: They all worry about that.
text: They both smile wryly, driving on.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: You don't need to fix me, Robby,
dialog: or fix me up. I don't want some
dialog: guy to heart and soul me and then
dialog: walk away 'cause he can't stand
dialog: the cop thing -- or worse: he
dialog: wants cop stories every night
dialog: 'cause it turns him on, and he has
dialog: no idea who I am inside my head.
dialog: Anyway, I'm busy tonight.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Got some action, huh? Well,
dialog: that's promising.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Yeah. Hot and heavy.
scene_heading: IMMEDIATE CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: She is on the floor using an exercise rig, sliding into
text: crunches, pushing herself, sweating, alone. We BEGIN
text: DRIFTING TO the rain-spattered window as night sounds
text: filter in, HORNS, SOMEONE SHOUTING, a CAR MOVING BY with
text: THUNDEROUS BASS MUSIC that pulses the very air and
text: RATTLES the LOOSE GLASS of her window.
scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHT
text: Catch Lambert is walking the wet streets, head down in
text: the rain. Far away we hear that car with a BASS-BLASTING
speaker_heading: RADIO.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: In the glow of a street lamp, Catch sees a bright-colored
text: object in the gutter. He picks it up out of the gurgling
text: rain water. It is a small toy, a discarded superhero.
text: He puts it in his pocket, walks on.
text: Now the car, the prowling, MUSIC-BLASTING, BASS-
text: THUNDERING CAR turns a corner and begins rollling along
text: slowly -- beside Catch. He glances over, walking on.
text: There are four tough-looking MEN in the car, looking for
text: trouble. The MUSIC is DEAFENING. Catch glances again,
text: walks on. Their eyes follow him like gun barrels. He
text: stops and walks out on the street, moving toward the car,
text: shouting over the music.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Hey! You want to turn that volume
dialog: down? What's your point?
text: The men, incredulous, stop the car and snap OFF the MUSIC
text: in order to make sure they're hearing right. They stare
dialog: death at Catch.
speaker_heading: DRIVER (MAN)
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: What's the point of blasting your
dialog: music through the whole zip code?
dialog: Don't you realize there are kids
dialog: trying to sleep in these
dialog: apartments -- old people, sick
dialog: people?
dialog: They can hardly believe this.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: You better watch your mouth,
dialog: asshole.
text: Catch meets the man's look with his own unflinching,
text: haunted eyes.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Why? What're you gonna do? Kill
dialog: me?
text: Catch's look is not a macho challenge. It's something
dialog: else -- beyond that, a man somehow without limits. One
text: of the riders in the backseat taps the Driver's shoulder.
speaker_heading: MAN #2
dialog: Guy's nuts. Let's go.
text: The Driver, never breaking his death stare, snaps on the
text: DEAFENING MUSIC and then slowly rolls on, still glaring
text: at Catch. Catch stands in the rain, watching them go.
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT CORRIDOR - SAME NIGHT
text: Catch is arriving home, soaking wet. He lives in a
text: slightly-seedy three-story. As he walks down the
text: corridor toward his apaprtment, he passes a neighbor's
text: door and notices a set of keys dangling from the lock.
text: He pauses -- and then knocks softly on the door.
text: Someone looks through the peephole and then opens the
text: door -- a young single mother, friendly but with a little
text: caution, too. She recognizes Catch. Behind her is a
text: little boy, (five). The woman's name is CANDACE. Her
dialog: son is TOMMY.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Hi. Your keys are in the...
text: He gestures, and she sees the keys and retrieves them,
text: more friendly now.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Oh, thank you. Thanks a lot.
dialog: God. I was trying to carry Tommy
dialog: and all these bags. He was so
dialog: tired. Of course, as soon as I
dialog: put him down he had all this
dialog: energy...
text: While she is talking, Catch is staring deeply at the boy,
text: who is shy. Catch almost speaks to the boy, wants to,
text: goes halfway to a smile -- but the sight of the kid stirs
text: that layer of darkness in Catch. He nods a good-bye to
text: the mother and is about to go. She thinks about this, as
text: he is turning, and pushes through her remaining caution
dialog: to say...
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Y'know, we were just baking
dialog: nectarine bars because the peaches
dialog: weren't ripe. Ever had a
dialog: nectarine bar?
text: He smiles and seems to want to stay, but he is already
text: retreating. His contact goes only so far -- and no
dialog: further.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Sorry. Gotta be going.
text: And with one more glance at the boy, he walks to his
text: apartment, unlocks it and steps in.
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: He walks into a bare living room -- no chairs, tables,
text: lamps, nothing on the walls. He walks into a spotless,
text: never-used kitchen and flips on the light, opens a
dialog: drawer.
text: In the drawer is a collection of kids' toys, some found,
text: some purchased, mostly plastic figures. The action of
text: opening the door has started some battery-operated
text: animals moving around in there. Now from his pocket he
text: takes the plastic superhero he just found and drops it in
text: and closes the drawer.
text: He walks back into the living room. He sits on the
text: floor, leans back against the wall, his clothes still
text: soaked from the rain. He stares at his thoughts, looking
text: a bit numb -- and lost.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. DRY CLEANERS SHOP - DAY
text: Sharon is just leaving with a clean uniform on a hanger
text: in a plastic bag. It's a neighborhood place where
text: alterations are done. As she is leaving, an older woman
text: is just entering. This is MRS. VANDER, beaming at
text: Sharon, a real talker.
scene_heading: MRS. VANDER
dialog: Sherry!
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Hi, Mrs. Vander. You're looking
dialog: good.
scene_heading: MRS. VANDER
dialog: Oh, you just wait. I splurged.
text: She is pulling a new blue dress out of a shopping bag.
scene_heading: MRS. VANDER
dialog: It's for the church and the party.
dialog: It's just a little too long.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Looks great.
scene_heading: MRS. VANDER
dialog: Y'know, I cried over the
dialog: invitation -- just imagine me in
dialog: church.
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: It'll be so good to spend time
dialog: with you.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Sharon forces a smile -- but is mystified. Mrs. Vander
text: is walking to the counter and pausing to say...
scene_heading: MRS. VANDER
dialog: You know Dan and I renewed our
dialog: vows last year. I bet that's
dialog: where your mom got the idea.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Their vows?
scene_heading: MRS. VANDER
dialog: Your mom and dad -- the
dialog: ceremony...
text: Mrs. Vander realizes what's going on and stammers on,
text: sympathetic and embarrassed.
scene_heading: MRS. VANDER
dialog: Oh, well... y'know, I just got
dialog: that invitation a few... just now,
dialog: so I'm sure you'll...
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Oh, yeah. We've had... there's
dialog: been some problems with the mail
dialog: in our building, so... I'll
dialog: probably get it today.
text: They're both covering like mad, both realizing Sharon's
dialog: been left out.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: So, I guess I'll see you.
scene_heading: MRS. VANDER
dialog: Sure, honey. I'll see you there.
text: Sharon leaves -- Mrs. Vander staring after her, feeling
text: bad. As Sharon walks away, we see her forced smile die,
text: replaced by an old pain and darkness.
scene_heading: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY
text: Robby and Sharon's unit pulls up at a house remodel with
text: a sign marked "POGUE CONSTRUCTION." Sharon exits the car
text: and walks onto the site, moves toward a man who is both
text: carpenter and supervisor on the job. This is her
text: brother, LARRY POGUE, 29. They are not comfortable with
text: each other -- an old wound. He gives her a wary nod.
text: She's trying a little harder, being a bit more friendly.
dialog: We can sense the strain.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I didn't see his truck, so...
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: He's not here.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: How you doing?
text: She touches his shoulder as she says this, a friendly
text: gesture, a reaching out. He doesn't respond, only
dialog: shrugs.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I'm okay.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Kathy and the boy? Bet he's big
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Growin' fast.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Is he looking more like you now --
dialog: or did he get lucky?
text: She has broken through a bit and they both smile a brief,
text: wry smile.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: He's got Kathy's looks and brains
dialog: and my strong back. You should
text: feel his grip.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You just passing by?
text: She looks about.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Place is coming along nice. The
text: octagon window. Dad's signature.
text: But Larry's look stays on her, wondering what's on her
dialog: mind.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Look, Larry, I shouldn't have to
dialog: hear it from Mrs. Vander -- about
dialog: what's happening.
text: He turns back to his work now as they speak,
dialog: uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: What's happening?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: (hurt)
dialog: So you really weren't going to
dialog: tell me? Nobody was going to tell
dialog: me? Mom and Dad renewing their
text: vows, the church, the party. Mrs.
text: Vander is all excited. She bought
text: a new dress. It's blue.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: We're workin' on Dad. We think
dialog: you should be there. We told him.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Mom told him?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: We mentioned it.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: He's holding out, hah?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: You want to come?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: It's my family. Jesus, Lar. It's
dialog: over ten years, and he won't let
dialog: go of it.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: You two were always head to head.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: For good reason. Remember?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Let's just leave it.
text: She stares, then...
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: You're still scared of him.
text: Pissed, he throws his hammer down on the plywood, turns
dialog: to her.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I don't think it's a good idea you
dialog: coming around here in uniform.
dialog: People see it, they think we're in
dialog: trouble here.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Nice seeing you, too.
text: She walks away. He frowns, picks up his hammer, goes
text: back to work.
speaker_heading: ON STREET
text: As Sharon walks towards the car, she sees a van
text: approaching and she holds up a hand to Robby and calls
dialog: out...
speaker_heading: SHARON
text: Two more minutes.
text: And she walks toward the oncoming van, which is parking
dialog: now.
scene_heading: EXT. VAN - DAY
text: The van is driven by KATHY, Sharon's brother's wife.
text: Beside her in a car seat is LARRY, JR., four years old.
text: Sharon comes to the rolled down window on the driver's
text: side. She has a warm smile for Kathy and the child.
text: Kathy smiles, too.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Hi! Look -- it's your Auntie
dialog: Sharon.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Hey, Champ, my God, look how big.
text: She has a special affection for the boy -- who is
text: subdued, but he smiles a small one for his aunt. She
text: takes one of his hands and they shake in mock formality.
speaker_heading: LARRY JR.
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Ow! You hurt my hand with that
dialog: grip. Whew.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She shakes her fingers, and he smiles a bit more. Sharon
text: reaches in and rubs his head in a mock knuckling move.
text: He laughs. She smooths his hair, affectionately.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: We're bringing Larry his lunch.
dialog: Hey, it's good to see you. It's
dialog: been awhile. What?
text: Sharon is staring at Kathy's badly bruised ear.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Oh, I went boom into a low shelf
text: -- chasing after him of course.
dialog: (nodding to the child)
dialog: How're you doing?
text: Sharon pulls her eyes off the bruise to meet Kathy's look
dialog: -- and connect.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I'm semi-okay. I heard about
dialog: the... ceremony and the party.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Oh. I hope you'll be there.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Really.
text: Sharon smiles a bit, appreciating the support. She pats
text: Kathy's arm.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Take it easy. You too, Champ.
text: The boy offers his little hand to shake again.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Oh, no. You're not breaking my

text: They smile and drive on and Sharon walks toward her car
dialog: and Robby.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY PARK - DAY (NEXT DAY)
text: We WATCH moms and kids and a basketball game in the park
text: and PICK UP Catch walking by. Two pre-teens are playing
text: bounce and catch with a rubber ball against a (tennis
text: practice) wall, and one of them misses, and Catch makes a
text: lunge and snags the ball. Instead of throwing it to one
text: of the boys, he fires it at the wall.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: One of the boys catches it, bounces it off the wall
text: toward Catch. Catch grabs it, and now he's part of this
text: rapid-fire game -- and he's athletic and funny, too,
text: playing hard and mugging and making them smile until... a
text: POLICE CAR comes ROARING down the boulevard, slowing a
text: bit to CHIRP its SIREN a few times -- clearing traffic.
text: Catch glances up and sees...
speaker_heading: CATCH'S POV
text: Sharon is in the car beside Robby.
speaker_heading: ON CATCH
text: Stunned by the sight of her -- and he doesn't know why.
text: He can't move, can't breathe, eyes fixed on her. The
text: POLICE CAR pulls around a truck and ROARS on -- and
text: that's when he is struck by a memory, a little like
dialog: lightning. It comes as a quick --
scene_heading: FLASHBACK - EXT. FREEWAY - ACCIDENT SITE - CATCH'S POV
text: -- The man near death. Sharon is bending close to him,
text: this all just a sliver of an image, and it jolts him.
speaker_heading: BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)
text: The police car is now converging with other squads just
text: half a block away. Catch throws the ball back to the
text: boys and runs toward the police incident. The boys watch
text: him go, wondering.
scene_heading: EXT. CLOSED STORE - DAY
text: A police car is parked askew near this closed store -- as
text: now Robby and Sharon's UNIT ROARS to a STOP beside it.
text: Two cops are calling and motioning to them, one holds a
text: shotgun. This is RAY JULIETTE.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Break-in alarm. One suspect in --
dialog: nobody out. Take the back.
text: And they are moving.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK OF CLOSED STORE - DAY
text: Robby and Sharon are hurrying around to the back as we
text: hear more POLICE UNITS CONVERGING in front.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - STREET
text: As Catch arrives on the scene and sees Sharon and Robby
text: moving around the building to the back. He is still
text: amazed at the sight of her. He decides to follow her,
text: keeping her in sight, driven.
scene_heading: ON SHARON, ROBBY
text: They are scouting through crates and weeds as a young man
text: is flushed from cover at the back of the store and runs
dialog: from them.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Freeze!
text: The man runs on, and Sharon chases with Robby close
text: behind her. Sharon speaks to her shoulder radio mike as
text: she runs.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: (to radio)
text: Three-A-5, foot pursuit. Suspect
text: fleeing south on Pico Place, young
dialog: man, green jacket. No visible
dialog: weapon...
dialog: (to Robby)
dialog: Robby!
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Right behind you!
dialog: (to man)
dialog: Stop and lie down with your
dialog: arms... shit.
text: The man has jumped a fence. Sharon follows.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Careful!
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I see him!
text: She goes over the fence, then Robby.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
text: The man runs and Sharon chases. Robby, not far behind
text: glances off to the side, seeing Catch, still following.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Citizen on your right! Hey!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: But Sharon is now closing on the fleeing man who turns
text: suddenly, pointing a handgun!
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Gun!
text: And Sharon, wide-eyed, is already pulling her weapon, but
text: not in time. The man is aiming at her and about to fire
text: when he is tackled by Catch.
text: Catch and the man go sprawling, and the gun flies out of
text: the man's hand, and Sharon is on him in an instant,
text: pointing her gun at him...
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Freeze! Right there!
text: Catch scrambles to his feet. Robby joins Sharon and puts
text: his knee in the man's back and cuffs him, then glances at
text: Catch. So does Sharon. But Catch starts to hurry off.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Hey! Wait!
text: Two other cops (Ray Juliette and SANCHEZ) rush toward the
text: suspect on the ground.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You got him?
speaker_heading: ROBBY
text: He was armed.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Citizen took him down.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: No shit!?
text: Sharon stares across the lot to where Catch has halted.
text: More cops are converging. Ray Juliette and Sanchez move
text: toward Catch, while a sergeant and others surround Sharon
text: and the suspect. In between the crowd of cops, Catch and
text: Sharon glance at each other, during...
speaker_heading: ON CATCH
text: as the cops reach him.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What happened here?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I... just saw it and... I saw the
dialog: gun, so...
speaker_heading: ON SHARON
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: You all right, Pogo?
text: She is shaken, speaks softly.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I was dead. Y'know.
text: She glances toward Catch. (She doesn't recognize him
text: from the accident.) Their eyes meet briefly, but then
text: their attention is pulled to the others. Sharon speaks
text: to her sergeant.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: He had me. I was dead.
speaker_heading: ON CATCH
text: He is shaken, too. Sanchez is taking notes as Ray checks
dialog: his I.D.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I was just walking by. I live
dialog: near here.
text: Ray nods, handing the I.D. to Sanchez.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: Sergeant's going to want to talk
dialog: to you, Mr. Lambert. We'll need a
dialog: statement.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Don't worry about it. That's just
dialog: procedure. Look -- we appreciate
dialog: what you did. No bullshit. Let
dialog: us buy you a drink tonight, all
dialog: right? You know where the Rib
dialog: House is?
text: Catch glances at Sharon again, and he nods.
dialog: 21.
scene_heading: EXT. UPSCALE RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY (SAME DAY)
text: Catch, a bit bruised and dirty from his tackle, is
text: carrying groceries up the walkway steps to a small, well-
text: kept home. He is taking out a key as he walks to the
text: covered portico.
scene_heading: INT. MRS. CHU'S HOME - DAY
text: ELANORA CHU, 60, is an attractive woman with warmth and
text: intelligence in her eyes. She is in a wheelchair, at a
text: writing table where she carefully translates an English
dialog: text into Chinese characters.
text: She glances up as Catch opens the front door and heads
text: for the kitchen, speaking as he goes, not looking at her
dialog: or into the living room at all.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I got you nectarines because the
text: peaches are hard as rocks.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: Your jacket's all dirty.
text: She rolls away from the table in her motorized chair --
text: and as they speak across the house, she performs a
dialog: ritual...
speaker_heading: CATCH (O.S.)
dialog: I tackled a guy.
text: Elanora is moving about the living room, picking up
dialog: framed photographs and turning them face down. We don't
text: see what -- or who -- is in these photos. She is turning
text: them all in a routine way, used to this.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: Why would you 'tackle' a guy?!
speaker_heading: CATCH (O.S.)
dialog: Why do you think?
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Catch is at the cupboards, putting away groceries as
text: Elanora rolls into the kitchen, her CHAIR HUMMING.
speaker_heading: CATCH
text: He had the ball. He was going for
text: a touchdown.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: Can you be serious?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: (as he works)
dialog: What day is today?
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: Wednesday.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: No.
text: They are not smiling at their little jokes, but they have
text: an ease with each other and the deep love of dear
text: friends. He doesn't pause in his work, but we can see
text: some nervousness in him as he says...
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Met somebody today.
text: Mrs. Chu is now taking some of the groceries out of the
dialog: bags to help.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: Oh? That's good. Ahh -- they had
dialog: the broccolini today. Thank you.
speaker_heading: CATCH
text: A woman.
text: Elanora is more interested and curious now, still helping
text: with the groceries and being casual.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: You didn't tackle her, too, did
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: Good, Catch.
speaker_heading: CATCH
text: She's a police officer.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: (stops; worried)
dialog: Are you in trouble?
text: Catch goes on working, a depth in his eyes.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: No. No trouble.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Elanora watches him work and gladdens slightly. We see
dialog: her own depth of feeling.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: Well... that's a good thing.
text: He is still working, but his eyes are on his thoughts,
dialog: his struggle.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I saw her once a long time ago.
text: Elanora stares a moment. This has meaning for her.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: Where?
text: He doesn't answer. He's nervous about this.
speaker_heading: CATCH
text: She looks the same.
text: Now she watches him as he moves to the refrigerator and
text: continues his work in silence.
scene_heading: INT. RIB HOUSE - THAT NIGHT
text: It's a noisy restaurant with a large bar area. We PAN TO
text: a booth of off-duty cops, out of uniform now, including
text: Ray, Sanchez, Sharon and a few more male officers.
text: They're all a bit high. Sharon shows the signs, too.
text: They are passing around a photo now as one COP looks at
dialog: it and says...
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Beautiful.
text: ... And Sanchez says proudly.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: Yeah. My wife's got him in
dialog: agility class.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: No shit.
text: Ray is handed the photo, and we see that they're talking
text: about Sanchez's dog, the name "REX" printed on the photo.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: 'Rex.' Rex is good. I wonder who
dialog: the first person was to name a dog
dialog: 'Fido,' and what the hell does it
dialog: mean?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I like how you're always asking
dialog: the big questions, Ray.
text: There is some laughter. Ray is a smart-ass and a flirt.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I got a big question for you, Pogo
dialog: -- but I can only ask it when
dialog: we're alone.
text: She moves some of the change on the table, sliding it
text: toward Ray.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Here -- use this -- call your wife
dialog: and ask her instead.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: I happen to know Ray's wife is
dialog: busy tonight.
text: They laugh and drink and Ray asks her...
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Why doesn't your partner ever come
dialog: out with us?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Robby's a family man.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I'm a family man.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Yeah, but his family actually
dialog: likes him.
text: More laughter. Sharon's eyes do a quick roam of the bar.
text: Ray catches this.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: That Lambert -- I guess he's not
dialog: showing either.
text: She shrugs this off like it's not important and starts to
text: slide out of the booth.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: The head. Do you mind?
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: She's just gonna freshen up her
dialog: makeup.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You're wearing makeup?
text: She leaves the booth with a wry frown.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: That reminds me, Ray. You still
dialog: have that eye-liner you borrowed
dialog: from me?
text: She grins, leaving the laughter behind her.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - DOOR
text: Catch has entered the bar. He is watching Sharon leave
text: the booth and walk to the rest rooms. He looks back at
text: the raucous booth and hesitates. He sits at a small
text: table near the door.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Sharon is drying her hands in the bar's bathroom, staring
text: into the mirror. No smile now. We see into her mind for
dialog: a second.
speaker_heading: FLASHBACK - MAN
text: Pointing the gun at her face today.
speaker_heading: BACK TO SHARON (PRESENT)
text: in the mirror and see how shaken she still is.
speaker_heading: ON CATCH
text: A waitress is leaving his table, and he looks back at
text: Sharon's booth and sees that she still isn't there. He
text: starts to turn, and then freezes as he hears...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON (O.S.)
dialog: There you are.
text: She has stepped out of the bathroom and spotted him. He
text: is surprised, face to face now.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: We thought you wouldn't show. Why
dialog: you sitting here?
text: He shrugs.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I don't talk to a lot of people.
dialog: Would you...?
text: He half rises and gestures to the other chair. She
text: glances back at her booth, then sits. She's nervous,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I didn't have a chance to thank
dialog: you. I'm Sharon Pogue.
text: She puts out her hand. He stares at that hand for just
text: half a beat before taking it. They shake. The feel of
text: her hand holding his evokes the memory of the accident,
dialog: but he covers this.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: You look familiar.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I guess I live on the beat you
dialog: patrol.
dialog: Her way to cover nervousness is to be blunt, even tough.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Why would you do that -- jump a
dialog: man with a gun?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: He was going to shoot you.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: He could've shot you. You have a
dialog: death wish? You a bungee jumper?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: No. I didn't have time to think
dialog: about it.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: What d'you think about it now?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I figure... it was worth the risk.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: For someone you don't even know?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Yeah -- and for what you do. I
dialog: think cops are great. Out there,
dialog: trying to keep it safe. You know?
dialog: Tough job. Firemen are
dialog: everybody's heroes. Kids wave at
dialog: firemen. People should wave at
dialog: cops. Did you ever think about
text: how many people are walking around
dialog: this town because you saved them?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I never thought about it.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: ... because you helped them or
dialog: because you arrested somebody who
dialog: would've hurt them or because you
dialog: just... did your job?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Now I'm walking around this town
dialog: because of you. Ever think about
dialog: that? Maybe you should be a cop.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I don't know... I look pretty dumb
dialog: in a hat...
text: He has made her smile.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: ... and I don't drive and, like I
dialog: said, I don't talk to many people.
dialog: Am I talking too much? I am. You
dialog: go ahead.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Okay. What d'you do? You
dialog: employed around here? Oh, God.
dialog: Sorry. Every time I try to talk
dialog: to somebody, it comes out like an
dialog: interrogation.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Where do you want to be ten years
dialog: from now?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Somebody taught that to me. Kind
dialog: of a shortcut. You ask somebody,
dialog: what are your plans for
dialog: tomorrow -- what're your dreams
dialog: for ten years from now. It's
dialog: supposed to get things started.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Does it work?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I never tried it.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Bullshit.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: No. Really. I just remembered it
dialog: -- God is my witness.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Not in here. It's mostly cops.
dialog: Now she has made him smile, the first real smile we've
text: seen from Catch. It's open and real and she is charmed
dialog: by it.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: You have a nice smile.
text: She's a bit self-conscious, saying that, and just as she
text: says it, the waitress arrives with shots and beers for
text: both of them. Sharon looks up, questioning, and the
text: waitress nods toward the booth. Catch and Sharon see the
text: cops, staring, smiling, raising their glasses. There is
text: a hint of teasing in their grins. And now Sharon is more
text: self-conscious, and a bit tough again, taking her drink
text: and turning back to Catch.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: So... what were we talking about?
dialog: Oh, yeah, you were giving me some
dialog: line about starting a
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: The shortcut.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Okay. I'll play.
text: They clink glasses and drink. Then...
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Tomorrow I've got a night watch
dialog: shift. If the weather clears, in
dialog: the morning I'll go hiking. If it
dialog: rains, I'll go to the gym -- and
dialog: the laundromat. Ten years from
dialog: now... I want to be living in some
dialog: mountainous place.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Tibet?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Could be Tibet. Could be
dialog: Colorado. Your turn.
text: But now Ray Juliette is approaching the table.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Hey, Pogo -- don't keep him all to
dialog: yourself. Come on over, Lambert,
dialog: join the group. We'll buy you
dialog: dinner, give you a medal for
dialog: saving Pogo's ass.
text: Sharon drains her shot and stands.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Actually, I'm kind of tired, Ray.
dialog: I'm taking off.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Oh. I'll... walk you to your car.
text: Catch stands and turns to Ray.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Thanks for the drink.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Least we could do. We don't like
dialog: her very much -- but we don't want
dialog: to lose her.
text: Sharon frowns and waves to the booth of cops. Ray smiles
text: and shakes hands with Catch as a good-bye.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Take care.
text: And Catch and Sharon leave.
scene_heading: EXT. BAR - NIGHT
text: As Catch and Sharon exit the building, walk toward her
dialog: car.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: It's not a great neighborhood.
dialog: Maybe I should walk you to your
dialog: car.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I don't have a car.
text: They walk on, silent a moment. This doesn't come easy
dialog: for her.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Want a ride home?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Oh, thanks, but... I like to walk.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: It's starting to rain. Don't be a
dialog: hero.
text: He hesitates, nervous about it, but then...
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Yeah. If it's no trouble.
dialog: Thanks.
text: They walk to her car.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Okay... ten years from now, what
dialog: d'you want to be doing?
text: They walk side by side a moment. He shrugs. Then -- in
dialog: his open way...
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I don't know. This is pretty
dialog: good.
text: She glances at him, taking this in, then fumbles a bit
text: with her car keys, and he asks -- nervously again...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Can you drive okay?
text: She gets a little defensive.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I'm not drunk. You think I'm
dialog: drunk? I'm not. You'll know I'm
dialog: drunk when I'm throwing up, and I
dialog: never throw up, so don't worry
dialog: about it.
text: He nods, looks at her dead-on a moment.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: The only time I worry is when
dialog: people tell me not to worry.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Get in the car, will you?
scene_heading: INT. CAR - NIGHT
text: As they get in and she STARTS the ENGINE.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I'm on Lundy Street, just off
dialog: Pico.
text: They drive a while. She notices his anxiety. He grips
text: the armrest when she speeds up.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I'm good at this.
speaker_heading: CATCH
text: Streets are wet.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Are you one of those people who
dialog: drive ten miles an hour in the
dialog: rain? I hate that.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I never drive.
text: She glances at him, and he notices her glance.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I'll be alright.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He's forcing himself to relax. He takes a deep breath,

dialog: After a moment...
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Y'know, I can picture you in
dialog: Colorado.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Oh yeah? What am I doing there?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Driving around... pissed off.
text: She smiles in spite of herself, slows down.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I'm not pissed off at you.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Give me some time.
text: Now she laughs. She drives, not to his building, but to
text: her own street. She parks, takes a deep breath. This
text: sounds a bit hard-bitten because she's using her
dialog: toughness to cover.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Those guys in the bar are my
dialog: friends -- sort of. We work
dialog: together, we tell jokes and we
dialog: bullshit, but I can't say to
dialog: them...
text: She halts.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: What?
text: She says this clipped and fast and even tougher:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Every time I close my eyes, I see
dialog: that goddamn gun pointing at me
dialog: and I don't know why I'm telling
dialog: you unless it's because you were
dialog: there and because I had three
dialog: drinks, but I'm not ready to go
dialog: inside and close my eyes and I
dialog: don't want to go to your place and
dialog: I don't want to keep driving
dialog: around, so what the hell do we do?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Whew. I feel like we're boxing,
dialog: and you've got me on the ropes.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: We'll do whatever you want.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: What I want is to know how you
dialog: happened to be walking by that
dialog: parking lot at that minute. What
dialog: if you hadn' t been there?
text: For a moment, she shows her fear.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I guess we were supposed to meet.
text: They stare a while, then she opens her door.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: If you want -- you can come in for
dialog: a minute.
scene_heading: INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: As they walk in, she moves into the kitchen.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Want a drink?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: No thanks.
text: She pours one for herself while he looks about. It's a
text: stiff drink. Now that he's here, her I-don't-want-to-
text: make-a-fool-of-myself alarm is on. She flops on the
text: sofa, watches him.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Sit down or something.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I'm circling awhile.
text: He's looking around at the clutter of her life -- the
dialog: intimate details.
speaker_heading: SHARON

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CATCH

speaker_heading: SHARON

text: He turns to her.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Now that I'm in here, you seem mad
dialog: about it.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I'm not mad. You'll know when I'm
dialog: mad. I don't usually let somebody
dialog: in here, but here you are. That's
dialog: all. Let's talk about something
dialog: stupid.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: You first.
text: She smiles in spite of herself.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Okay -- one thing I don't believe
dialog: is that 'supposed to' business.
dialog: We were 'supposed to' meet. That
dialog: sounds a little fringy to me, like
dialog: something you might hear on public
dialog: access TV. You believe that?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Some people say we each give off a
dialog: particular odor -- that can only
dialog: be detected by one other person's
dialog: brain.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: So, we... smell each other? Who
dialog: says that?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I have no idea.
dialog: (as they smile)
dialog: I'm more in the destiny school,

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: SHARON

text: of her hand, puts it to his lips and drinks it all down.
text: He puts the glass on the table.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Why'd you do that?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: See? Now you're thinking about
dialog: me.
text: She gets a half smile, assessing him. Her look is
text: direct, and the attraction is there. He feels it, too,
text: and he deflects it, nodding toward a large photomural of
text: snowcapped mountains.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Let me guess. Colorado.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: It's Austria, but I can't picture
dialog: myself in Austria. I'm not good
dialog: with languages, so I couldn't
dialog: qualify for the departments over
dialog: there.
text: She rises and goes to a desk and takes the holstered gun
text: off her ankle. She takes the cuffs off her belt, the
text: mace from her jacket, the shield from her shirt pocket,
text: puts them all in a desk drawer. She takes off her jacket
text: and throws it over a chair. Disarmed, she turns to him.
text: Her look is all wanting and pushing away, almost fierce
text: in her struggle. He sees this.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Thanks for... coming up here.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Does that mean I'm going?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: No. You don't have to. I...
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: You okay now?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Her eyes grow a bit hard, defensive.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Oh. You're here as a medic.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Is this the mad part?
text: She smiles in spite of herself -- again. He has gotten
dialog: to her. She wants to fall into this guy, but she's
text: pumping those brakes. They are standing close together.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Maybe going is a good idea.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Can I come back some time?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Must be the smell.
text: That makes her laugh, and her resistance falls away with
text: her surprised laughter, and she puts her hands around the
text: back of his neck. Her touch is electric to him. She is
text: going in for a kiss, and he is retreating. They stare a
text: moment -- and then he suddenly takes her shoulders and
text: lets loose his own longing. It is a hungry and
text: passionate kiss, and in the very midst of it, he breaks
text: off and pulls back, his darkness rushing at him. She is
text: staring, surprised, and he is looking a bit shaken,
text: getting the words out just above a whisper.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I better go.
text: She doesn't know what to say. The moment hangs. He
text: leaves. Once he closes the door, the breath escapes her,
text: and she shakes her head -- feeling like an idiot. She
text: lost control. With a stranger.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Oh, God.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Catch leaving Sharon's building in a turmoil of emotions,
text: staring hard at his thoughts -- and he steps into the
text: path of a car. The CAR SCREECHES to a stop, and the
text: scream of those brakes and white light of the head lamps
text: paralyze Catch, and he sees --
dialog: 37.
scene_heading: FLASHBACK - SLIVER OF IMAGE
text: Headlights suddenly washing into a vehicle he is driving.
speaker_heading: BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)
text: This sliver of memory jolts HIM -- and then another one
dialog: comes.
scene_heading: FLASHBACK - HEADLIGHTS
text: coming closer and the scream of brakes from his memory,
dialog: and all of this is exploded --
speaker_heading: BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)
text: by the angry DRIVER shouting at him.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: What the hell do you think you're
dialog: doing?!
text: Catch is numb -- completely shut down there in the middle
text: of the street. The Driver exits his car and comes toward
text: him, raging.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Are you crazy?!
text: Catch isn't even aware of him. The man gawks at this --
text: and now Catch walks off. It is raining. The streets are
dialog: wet.
scene_heading: ANGLE - RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT
text: As Catch continues his walk, he is still a bit shaken --
text: but when he passes a parked car with the window half
text: open, rain getting in, he hesitates. He can't just walk
text: on. He looks about. He tests the lock. He opens the
text: door, rolls up the window, closes the door, walks on.
text: But a MAN is just exiting a doorway to the street -- and
dialog: calls out...
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Hey! Hey! What did you do?
text: Catch stops and turns in the rain. The Man hurries
text: toward him, upset, angry.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: That's my car! What the hell were
dialog: you doing?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Nothing. I just...
text: The Man shoves him.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I saw you! What did you take out
dialog: of there?!
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: No, I rolled up the window. It's
dialog: rain...
text: The Man gets in his face, shaky...
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: You take my phone?! Hah?!
text: He shoves Catch again, and Catch's desperate confusion
text: explodes in a surprising reaction, grabbing the Man's
text: jacket front in one hand and not punching him but quickly
text: slap, slap, slapping him, saying...
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Hey! Hey! Wake up! Wake up!
text: The Man is now speechless, frozen, terrified, as Catch's
text: eyes hold him with a fierceness -- and a sadness.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I helped you.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I helped you.
text: Catch lets him go, and immediately begins walking away,
text: hunching into the rain, his expression dark and troubled.
text: He gets five steps away and turns. The Man steps back --
dialog: but Catch only says...
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: And he walks on. The Man watches him go.
scene_heading: INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT BUILDING CORRIDOR - NEXT DAY
text: Candace, Catch's neighbor, is waiting for the slow,
text: RATTLING ELEVATOR with her son.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The elevator door opens -- and there is Catch, seated on
text: a newly-bought wicker chair in the elevator with a small
text: table across his lap, other boxes nearby and a
text: long-stemmed rose in his hand, wrapped for giving.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Oh. Sorry.
text: He rises and hurriedly gets his purchases off the
text: elevator so the woman and little boy can enter.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Shopping day?
text: He smiles at her, a bit less subdued than before as he
text: gets his things into the hall -- and he manages a special
text: look for Tommy, a wink. He frees the elevator; they step
text: inside. As the door starts to close, Catch's face
text: "follows" the sliding door with a funny look for the boy.
text: We hear Tommy laugh as the door closes. Catch carries
text: his new possessions to his apartment.
scene_heading: EXT. OLDER HOUSE - LATE DAY
text: A well-kept older home, well-planted, pretty. A woman of
text: nearly 60 is tending the flowers. She hears someone
text: approaching the gate in the wooden fence. She looks up.
text: Sharon is at the gate, in uniform, on her dinner break.
text: The older woman is her MOTHER, Elaine Pogue. There is an
text: old strain between them, a sadness -- and a nervousness
text: in Elaine. She's a quiet woman. She smiles at her
text: daughter as Sharon comes through the gate. They hug
text: tentatively, a lot of baggage here. Sharon turns to the
dialog: garden.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: It's looking great, Mom.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: (pleased)
dialog: Thanks, honey. It's the best year
dialog: ever for the impatiens. The very
dialog: best.
text: There is a beat of awkward silence.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Let's go in.
scene_heading: INT. POGUE HOME - DAY
text: As they enter.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: It's a bit dark inside, older furniture, lots of keepsake
text: clutter and photos. Sharon is restless in here -- bad
dialog: memories.
speaker_heading: SHARON
text: Looks the same. Still smells like
dialog: cigarettes. I thought he quit.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
text: He's down to six a day.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Your hair looks nice.
text: Her Mother touches her hair, self-consciously. She can't
text: help glancing at her daughter in all that gear --
text: bullet-proof vest under her shirt, radio, cuffs -- and
dialog: that gun.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Are you well?
text: Sharon steps close to the mantel. There is a photo of
text: her there, graduating from the police academy, a
text: professional, not a family shot. She is surprised.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I guess I'm well. Is this always
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Yes. It's always there.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Did Larry tell you I came by where
dialog: he's working? Is that why you
dialog: called me?
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: I called because we want to invite
dialog: you to our renewal of vows. It's
dialog: three weeks from Saturday.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Who's 'we.' You said 'we' want to
dialog: invite you.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: The family.
text: Sharon takes that in, still looking about.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: How come you're renewing your
dialog: vows?
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: It's sort of... a fresh start.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Your idea?
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: No. Both of us. It's a way of...
dialog: having the marriage blessed.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Wasn't it blessed before?
text: Her Mother sighs, sad for all the trouble between them.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Sherry... of course it was
dialog: blessed. You just...
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I just what, Mom?
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: You just think about the bad, and
dialog: you never remember the good. I
dialog: wish you remembered the good.
text: Sharon stares deeply at her.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Sorry. I wish I did, too.
dialog: (then, almost
dialog: like a child)
dialog: Does he? Remember any good about
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Of course. He doesn't hate you.
dialog: He just... still feels hurt.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Hurt? I hurt him?
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Being arrested like that.
dialog: Somebody doesn't forget that.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Oh? How come you forgot what he
dialog: did?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: It wasn't as bad -- you always
dialog: make it sound worse. And it
dialog: hasn't been that way for years.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I'm glad it hasn't been that way.
dialog: That means it worked, Mom. That
dialog: was the point. That's why I did
dialog: it. Christ. Why do I get
dialog: punished for it?
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Honey, nobody's punishing you.
dialog: We're inviting you. Will you
dialog: come?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Of course I'll come.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: We didn't think you'd want to.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Why not?
text: Now her Mother shows a trace of fear. She says gently...
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: We don't want any trouble... on
dialog: that day. Please.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Mom, I'm your daughter. I don't
dialog: want any trouble -- ever. I'll
dialog: come to the ceremony. I won't
dialog: come to argue, and I won't come in
dialog: uniform.
text: They each get a small, sad smile.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
text: It's on the 23rd. Saint Monica's.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I'd like you to send me an
dialog: invitation. Mrs. Vander said it's
text: a beautiful invitation.
text: Her Mother starts to leave the room.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: I'll show you.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Mom. I'd like to get one... in
dialog: the mail... from my family. Okay?
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Yes.
text: Sharon goes to the door, then stops and turns, letting
dialog: her guard down all the way to say...
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Tell Dad... thanks.
text: And she leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - EVENING
text: Sharon is climbing the outdoor staircase to her
text: apartment, tired after her shift, drained a bit by her
text: visit home. When she reaches her door she sees that a
text: long-stemmed rose has been masking-taped to her door.
text: Written on the masking tape is: "Catch Lambert" and a
dialog: phone number.
text: She pauses, staring at this, gets a little grin.
scene_heading: INT. SHARON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (HOURS LATER)
text: Sharon is dressed for bed in a sleep shirt, lying on the
text: bed, surrounded by old photos and a couple of photo
text: albums from her girlhood. In a vase on her bed table is
text: Catch's rose.
text: Sharon is feeling blue, looking at her young self within
text: the family that has shut her out. She closes the book,
text: angry at herself for nearly crying. She sits up and
text: catches sight of the rose and rummages in the drawer and
text: pulls out the tape with Catch's phone number on it.
text: She's very conflicted about this. She puts the tape
text: down, but it sticks to her fingers. She tears it off and
text: tries to throw it onto the table, but it hangsoff her
text: thumb. She sighs and steels herself and dialsthe
dialog: number.
scene_heading: INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT
text: He has bought a shelf unit that "needs some assembly" and
text: he's at work with a screwdriver, his new chair and table
text: nearby, the phone on the floor. PHONE RINGS, and he
text: picks it up.
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: FULL SHOT
dialog: As we INTERCUT the call:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Do you have a machine?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Do you have an answering machine?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Will you hang up please, and I'll
dialog: call your machine.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Why?
text: She hangs up. He stares at the phone a moment,
text: bewildered. He hangs up, and his PHONE RINGS. He lets
text: it ring. His MACHINE comes on with no recording, only a
speaker_heading: BEEP.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Hi. Maybe we can... have
dialog: breakfast or something. I get up
text: early and run in Ballard Park.
dialog: There's a Denny's across from the
dialog: park. Like eight or so. If
dialog: you're there, you're there.
text: She hangs up, sighs a heavy one.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Oh, God.
text: And she falls back on her bed.
scene_heading: INT. DENNY'S - MORNING
text: Catch walks in, glances at the clock. It's 7 A.M. He's
text: nervous -- and excited. He takes a seat where he can
text: watch the park, the runners. He waits.
scene_heading: INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - MORNING
text: She has tossed and turned all night. She is awake,
text: turning to look at her clock-radio. It is 7:14. She
text: raises a hand over it.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: It changes to 7:15 and the RADIO COMES ON. She slams her
text: hand down on it, cutting it OFF. She lays back and
text: heaves a sigh that becomes a moan, sits up again and
text: picks up the phone, dials the number on the tape.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Hi, don't pick up. Look, I didn't
dialog: sleep much and anyway this is a
dialog: bad idea. I was feeling funky
dialog: last night and I'm all right now
dialog: so let's just leave it where it's
dialog: at. Bye. Oh, thanks for the...
dialog: Bye.
text: She hangs up and lays back down and pounds her head into
text: the pillow and covers herself, even her head, with the
dialog: sheet.
scene_heading: INT. DENNY'S - MORNING
text: Catch is waiting, watching out the window. It's 8:05,
dialog: until we...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. DENNY'S - MORNING
text: ... and now it's 8:38, and Catch is still waiting and
dialog: watching.
scene_heading: INT. SHARON'S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: She is still in bed, under the sheet. Someone begins
text: KNOCKING on her door and she sits up, bleary and
text: frustrated.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Damn it!
text: She stumbles out of the bedroom to her door.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: What?! Who?!
speaker_heading: CATCH (O.S.)
dialog: It's me.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Oh, Jesus.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She opens the door. He wears a stern look. She is not
dialog: apologetic.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I was just falling asleep.
dialog: Finally.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: We made a date.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: It wasn't a 'date.'
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Okay, an 'appointment.' I keep my
dialog: appointments.
text: She gives an exasperated moan and turns to stagger back
text: to bed. He closes the door and follows.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I called you. I called you at
dialog: seven.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I get up early. I walked there.
dialog: I waited there.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Check your messages.
text: She heads for the bed, passing a mirror, looking at her
text: rumpled self and groaning at the sight. She climbs into
text: bed and snuggles there and puts the sheet over her head.
text: He is entering the bedroom. He carries a Denny's take-
text: out bag.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: (under the sheet)
dialog: I need more sleep. Come back in a
dialog: month.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Come back? What makes you think
dialog: I'd come back here?
text: The lump under the sheet says...
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Then why are you here?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I'm here to tell you that when you
dialog: tell someone you're going to be
dialog: somewhere then that someone
dialog: rearranges his life and you should
dialog: be more aware of that and a lot
dialog: more considerate instead of
dialog: just...
text: She has come out from under the sheet and is watching
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: What's in the bag?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: What? None of your business.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Did you bring some coffee?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: You think you deserve coffee?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: What else did you bring? Food?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: (opening the bag)
dialog: You definitely don't deserve food.
dialog: I've got coffee, sugar, sweetener,
dialog: non-dairy...
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Just black. Black. Thanks.
text: She sits up. He hands her the coffee. She sips,
text: relishing the sip, then studies him.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: So what kind of life did you
dialog: rearrange in order to get to
dialog: Denny's? You never said one word
dialog: about yourself last night. What
dialog: d'you do?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: What's the difference?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: What's the difference?! You're
dialog: standing in my bedroom. That's
dialog: the difference. Who are you?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Somebody who keeps appointments.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: You're ducking. Don't duck.
dialog: (then a thought)
dialog: Oh, shit -- you're married, right?
text: Convinced -- she picks up one of the throw pillows from
text: the bed and tosses it at him.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I'm not.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I don't believe you.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: You don't believe me? Give me
dialog: back the coffee.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Give me the coffee.
text: She hands him the coffee. He hits her with the pillow
text: and hands her back the coffee. He has made her smile,
text: but she continues, half teasing now.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Oh, God. Oh, wait -- you're
dialog: involved in some criminal
dialog: activity, aren't you? Great --
dialog: That's all I need.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: My name is Catch Lambert. I don't
dialog: work. I don't commit any crimes.
dialog: I like being with you. We can
dialog: start from here -- from now.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Bullshit. I'm... I let you in
dialog: here. I'm not going to be some
dialog: fool. I need the details.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: And I need to start from here.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: That's ridiculous. Why?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: That's the way it is.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Oh. Your rules.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: My rules.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Jesus. Okay. Fine. I don't
dialog: really want to know you anyway.
dialog: Goodbye.
text: He is conflicted -- but he won't relent. He walks to the
text: door. She stares, waiting. But he never turns around.
text: He walks out. She is mystified, exasperated. She hears
text: her FRONT DOOR CLOSE. She puts the coffee on her bed
text: table -- and finds herself staring at that damn rose.
text: She suddenly gets up and begins to dress hurriedly --
text: with a plan.
scene_heading: EXT. BOULEVARD - DAY
text: Sharon is driving, speeding a bit, getting to Catch's
text: building ahead of him.
scene_heading: EXT. CATCH'S BUILDING - DAY
text: He approaches his apartment building, unlocks the front
text: door, walks in the entrance area. Now we see, across the
text: street, Sharon exit her car and follow him.
scene_heading: EXT. BUILDING - DAY
text: The front door has locked automatically. Outside there
text: is a panel of buzzers and apartment numbers. Sharon hits
text: all the buttons. Somebody BUZZES her in.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY - DAY
text: Sharon enters, looks at the elevators. It's not moving.
text: She goes to the stairs, listens, hears him TRUDGING UP
text: the stairway. She follows silently.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
text: As Catch reaches his apartment door, unlocks it, opens it
text: and walks in.
dialog: 50.
scene_heading: INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Before he can close the DOOR behind him, it BANGS open
text: wider, startling him -- and Sharon is in the doorway,
text: staring hard at him.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Can I come in?
text: She walks in and closes the door and starts looking
text: around as he says...
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Yeah. Sure. Come in.
text: Despite his recent "decorating" the apartment is still
text: nearly empty. No books, magazines, photographs, no
text: clutter of life. She glances into the equally sterile
dialog: kitchen.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: You live here? Nobody lives here.
dialog: This place is some kind of front,
dialog: a scam, a drop -- or what?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: This is what you told me about --
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Your interrogation. Do I need a
dialog: lawyer?
text: He has made her look at herself, and take a breath.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I just don't want to be jerked
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I'm not.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Then tell me straight out. Who
dialog: are you?
text: He is silent, and she starts to leave. Moment of truth.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: What is it you're looking for?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Your life. I don't want any

speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: This is it. I sleep here. I walk
dialog: around town. That's all of it.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: That's all of it?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Yeah. Except for you -- the way I
dialog: feel about you.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Which is?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Surprising. I thought it was
dialog: impossible. I thought I was...
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: You thought you were what? Gay?
speaker_heading: CATCH
text: Dead. In a way.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I'm supposed to understand that?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: No. Did you ever wonder what
dialog: 'scratch' meant, when people say,
dialog: 'we'll start from scratch'? This
dialog: is scratch. We can start from
dialog: here.
text: She looks at him, looks at his empty place, his non-life,
text: and back at him again.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I don't know. I just don't know.
text: She breaks off the stare and heads for the door. He
text: watches her go.
scene_heading: EXT. UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY (SAME DAY)

scene_heading: INT. MRS. CHU'S HOME - DAY
text: As Catch enters. She is watching TV. He does glance
text: into the living room briefly to throw her a quick hello
text: smile, before moving to the kitchen. She SNAPS OFF the
text: TV and begins turning the photos face down as she sends
text: her voice to the kitchen.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: I remember that. That was a
dialog: smile.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: He is putting groceries away as she rolls into the room.

speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: You know the cop -- the woman cop?
dialog: She... visited me.
text: Mrs. Chu registers surprise at this, but keeps it covered
dialog: and casual.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: Oh? Where did she sit?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I have a chair now.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: You're... seeing her?
text: He darkens a bit as he works.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: She has a lot of questions. She
dialog: wants to know everything.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: Of course she does. Everybody
dialog: does.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: We could start from today. What's
dialog: so wrong with that?
speaker_heading: ELANORA

speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Tell her what?
text: Mrs. Chu comes closer.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: Tell her, Catch. Tell somebody.
dialog: It's been almost two years.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: (a warning)
dialog: Nora...
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: Every time I tell somebody, it
dialog: gets a little bit easier. I'm not
dialog: saying it goes...
text: His next warning is tough and absolute.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Nora!
text: She is silenced. The moment hangs. She rolls her chair
text: to him, takes a box of cookies out of his hand, opens the
text: box and eats one, defusing the moment.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: She nice?
text: He starts to work again.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: She's tough.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: She pretty?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: That doesn't matter.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: She is pretty.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: She's sort of pissed-off at me.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: Apologize.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: It doesn't matter. We like it
dialog: when men apologize.
text: He stares at her a while.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I'm sorry I yelled at you.
text: She smiles and hands him the box.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: Have a cookie. See?
scene_heading: INT. POLICE REPORT ROOM - NIGHT
text: Sharon is typing at the computer, dark and dogged in her
text: work. Lieutenant Sanderman is watching her through the
text: glass wall of the watch commander's office. He comes out
text: of the office and moves to where Sharon is typing.
speaker_heading: SANDERMAN
dialog: Sharon...
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: (typing)
dialog: Lieutenant...
text: We can see the computer screen now. Sharon is searching
dialog: for any prior record of "Catch Lambert" -- arrests,
dialog: convictions. She has several "Carl Lamberts" on the
dialog: screen, even a "Casper," no Catch.
speaker_heading: SANDERMAN
dialog: Anything bothering you?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Why? What'd I do?
speaker_heading: SANDERMAN
dialog: Nothing. I'm talking about your
dialog: general attitude lately.
text: Sharon stops typing. She can find nothing. She clears
text: the screen, sighs.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: My attitude's fine. End of a long
dialog: day. I'm tired.
speaker_heading: SANDERMAN
dialog: Family matters getting to you?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Family?!
speaker_heading: SANDERMAN
dialog: Your brother, Larry...
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: What about Larry?
speaker_heading: SANDERMAN
dialog: You know Nester -- on the Culver
dialog: City P.D.? He went out on a
dialog: violent domestic dispute
dialog: yesterday. A neighbor called it
dialog: in. It got a little ugly. No
dialog: arrest -- a warning.
text: This hits her hard.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Larry. Oh Christ.
speaker_heading: SANDERMAN
dialog: Nester said it's not the first
dialog: time.
text: Sharon is quiet a while, taking it in, shaken by it.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Thanks for telling me.
scene_heading: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET (CULVER CITY) - DAY (NEXT MORNING)
text: Sharon, not in uniform, is approaching Larry's house. It
text: has a small yard with kids' toys strewn about and a tire-
text: swing. She walks up on the porch and RINGS the DOORBELL.
text: She hears VOICES inside, LARRY AND KATHY, a quick
text: murmuring, low-voice argument, can't make out the words.
text: In a moment, Larry opens the door.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Jesus, you're up early.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I wanted to catch you before you
dialog: went to work.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I thought you were on late shifts.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I don't sleep much. Can I come
dialog: in?
dialog: 56.
scene_heading: INT. LARRY'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: The place is messy. A TV can be heard -- CARTOONS.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: What's up?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Where's Kath?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: She's busy with Larry Jr. right
dialog: now.
text: Sharon nods, but then walks past him.
scene_heading: INT. CHILD'S ROOM - DAY
text: As Sharon walks into this toy-strewn room. Larry Jr. is
text: sitting on the floor, watching a small TV. Kathy is not
text: with him. Sharon kneels beside the boy a moment.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Hey, Champ.
text: But he stays focused on the TV, some darkness, some
text: unsayable worry in his eyes. She picks up a toy car,
text: speaks softly.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Y'know, they call this one a woody
dialog: 'cause it has wood on the sides.
speaker_heading: LARRY JR.
dialog: I know.
text: Now he looks at her with sad and bottomless eyes. She is
text: hurting for him. Larry is now in the doorway. Sharon
text: kisses the child's head and walks out, passing her
dialog: brother.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Why'd you come by?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: To see Kathy.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: As Sharon heads for the master bedroom, Larry takes her
dialog: arm.
speaker_heading: LARRY
text: She's not feeling good.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Sharon pulls away from her brother.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I'll just say hello.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
text: Sharon walks in. Kathy is sitting on the bed, her face
text: badly bruised. They stare. Kathy speaks quietly, her
text: eyes filling.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Don't make it worse.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: It gets worse?
speaker_heading: KATHY
text: He's okay now. He's torn up about
dialog: it. Don't make him mad.
text: Sharon moves closer. She reaches out, touches Kathy with
text: a comforting touch as the woman turns her bruised face
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: When Larry and I were growing up,
dialog: our mother said that all the time.
dialog: 'Don't make your father mad.'
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Has he hit Larry Jr. yet?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: He never would.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Oh. Just you, huh?
text: Larry is in the doorway now, angry.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: What d'you think you're doing in
dialog: my house, Shar? In my home.
text: She walks out of the room and he follows her.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: She turns on him.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: You see a pattern here, bro?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I lost my temper. Things got out
dialog: of hand. It won't...
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: People always say that: 'I've got
dialog: a temper.' Like it's an excuse.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I don't need a goddamn lecture.
text: She comes very close to him.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: You want to hit someone? Next
dialog: time your 'temper' flares up, Lar,
dialog: and you just have to hit somebody,
dialog: you go home and hit your father.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: You blame everything on him.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I'm blaming you, you fucking
dialog: coward.
text: He grabs her shirt hard.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: You don't come in here...
text: He pushes her into the wall.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: You don't come in here and call me
dialog: names.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: What do you call a man who uses
dialog: his wife as a punching bag?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Coward.
text: He swings a slap at her. She blocks it and punches him
text: hard in the face, and he crashes down on the floor.
text: Kathy comes running, calling out...
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Don't hurt her, Lar...!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Kathy sees that it's Larry on his ass. The little boy
text: comes out of his room. There is a surprised moment.
text: Then Kathy picks up the child and takes him back to his
text: room. Larry is sitting up, shaken, his nose bleeding.
text: Sharon goes close to him, rigid with fury.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I know how it feels, 'cause I
dialog: remember. I remember standing
dialog: between you and Dad and taking the
dialog: blows for you -- and for what?!
dialog: You turned out to be just like
dialog: him, you bastard.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: And so did I.
text: And she leaves the house and SLAMS the DOOR.
scene_heading: INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: She is just returning home after her shift, very tired,
text: drained. She absently turns ON the TV, the STEREO. She
text: notices a blinking light on her MESSAGE MACHINE and hits
dialog: the button.
speaker_heading: LARRY (V.O.)
dialog: I bet you feel real proud of
dialog: yourself, Shar, knocking me down
dialog: in front of my family. You know
dialog: what I've got in my hand? I've
dialog: got a Polaroid picture of my
dialog: busted-up face, and I'm thinking
dialog: of sending it to your department,
dialog: to your lieutenant. I'm going to
dialog: turn you in to the police, Shar,
dialog: and see how you like it.
text: The message ends. She stands there a moment.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Oh, God. Oh, shit.
text: She sits on the edge of a chair, worried, deep in her
text: thoughts, hitting bottom -- the darkness engulfing her.
text: In a moment, she looks at her desk, walks there, opens a
text: drawer, pulls out that piece of tape with Catch's number
text: on it -- but it is all stuck to itself. She hesitates,
text: then starts to pick it apart when a KNOCK at the door
text: makes her jump. She wonders, then, somehow, she knows.
text: She walks to the door.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: It's you, right?
text: She unlocks and opens the door, stares at Catch, very
text: vulnerable, on the very edge, her pain and fear over
text: Larry just under the surface. Catch holds a box of
dialog: cookies as an offering.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Can you just shut up? Just shut
dialog: up and listen.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I didn't say anything.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I don't want to talk. I don't
dialog: care if you have to play some game
dialog: and pretend you're a... 'angel of
dialog: mercy' or... whatever. I don't
dialog: care, but I don't want to hear
dialog: about it. All right? I don't
dialog: want to hear anything.
text: She steps back, allowing him in, and closes the door and
text: turns to him.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: It's a bad night.
text: He sees her pain and puts his arms around her, pushes
text: through his fear and holds her -- and she lays her head
text: on his chest. He embraces her fully, and the effect on
text: him goes deep, to his core, where there is both pain and
text: longing, but he holds on to her, even rocks her a bit.
text: She sighs. In a moment...
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: This is good... but I'm too tired
dialog: to stand up anymore.
text: He walks her to the couch and has her sit, and then
text: slowly, gently, he "disarms" her. He lifts her leg,
text: takes the ankle holster and gun off, puts it on the
text: table. He turns her, takes the cuffs off her belt from
text: the middle of her back. He reaches into her pants pocket
text: and removes the Mace. From her shirt pocket he takes her
text: I.D. shield. He has her lie down on the couch now, their
text: faces close, eyes locked. They linger...
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: You want to kiss me?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He looks a little lost, but he nods, helpless. He comes
text: toward her lips -- finally -- but just before they touch,
text: she says, softly...
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Kiss me someplace I've never been
dialog: kissed.
text: He's not sure what to do. He begins to look her over --
text: as if hunting, and she gets a soft smile. He starts
text: slowly toward her ear -- but she shakes her head. Her
text: shirt is out of her belt and her midriff bare, and he
text: starts to move there, but checks her with a look. She
text: shakes her head. He hunts. Her smile deepens a bit. He
text: takes her hand and turns it over, going for the soft
text: flesh on the underside of her forearm, and she closes her
text: eyes. He kisses her there softly, and then again, and
text: then he lavishes kisses from her wrist to the underside
text: of her elbow as she sighs with pleasure and draws up her
text: knees in a kind of sensual glow that is leading them
text: to... No. He stops. She looks at him, a deep look, soft
dialog: voice.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Why do you stop? You always stop.
text: She has a glimpse of his mystery, the old sorrow, the
text: deep pain. He hugs her drawn-up knees, closing his eyes
text: a moment. Then he sits on the couch, puts a pillow on
text: his lap and raises her slightly, lays her head on the
text: pillow. He strokes her hair, her scalp as she closes her
text: eyes and sighs, slowly moving toward sleep. Our TRUMPET
text: MUSIC slides in here, lush and dreamy as we linger a
dialog: while, and then --
scene_heading: SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - MORNING
text: Just after dawn. Catch has slept on the couch. He is
text: beginning to awaken now as the first light strikes the
text: windows. The dreamy TRUMPET FADES OUT. Catch's eyes
text: clear, sleep replaced by thought, and he is suddenly
dialog: shaken by --
scene_heading: FLASHBACK - CATCH'S POV
text: -- a sliver of memory. But in this one, he is driving.
text: We see his hands on the wheel. Then his POV looks to the
text: side and we see an Asian-American woman seated beside
text: him, attractive, about his age. Her name is Annie. She
text: is saying something to him. We don't hear the words.
text: When the FLASHBACK ENDS --
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)
text: Catch sits up on the couch, jolted. He gets another
dialog: sudden --
scene_heading: FLASHBACK - HEADLIGHTS
text: glaring through his windshield, blinding him. He gasps,
text: sitting there on the couch, but it's all over. He
text: stands, rattled, and he moves toward Sharon's bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Sharon is peacefully asleep. He stands over her with
text: troubled eyes, but this slowly changes to a loving look.
text: He bends close to her face. He feels her breath on him.
text: He wants to lie down with her -- but he raises a hand and
text: very gently brushes her cheek. She stirs. He does it
text: again. She sighs a peaceful sigh, opens her eyes. He
text: smiles at her.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: New day.
scene_heading: EXT. BOULEVARD - DAY
text: Sharon is driving Catch home. They are now on a main
text: boulevard of stores, office buildings. They stop at a
text: light. Both are surprised by a voice calling out from
text: the pedestrians crossing the street.
speaker_heading: PINDELLA (O.S.)
dialog: Catch?
text: They look up to see a well-dressed man pausing in the
text: middle of the crosswalk to face their car. He is in his
text: forties, tall, with grey-blond hair. This is RICHARD
text: PINDELLA. He has a small smile and wave for Catch.
text: Sharon is curious, looking at Catch. Catch throws the
text: man a dark look and then turns away, ignoring him,
text: nervous, intense.
speaker_heading: PINDELLA
dialog: Catch?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: (to Sharon)
dialog: Drive, will you?
text: Pindella is moving toward the car, Sharon watching him,
dialog: wondering.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Drive!
text: The light changes. Pindella hurries to the curb as the
text: cars surge forward. Sharon drives slowly, checking the
text: mirror to see Pindella stare after them -- then enter the
text: office building on the corner.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Will you get off this street?
text: She makes a turn, glancing at Catch.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: What? You owe him money?
text: But his dark look persists, and he doesn't answer.
dialog: Then...
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: If you take a right and stop -- we
dialog: can walk from here. I'd rather
dialog: walk.
text: He is nervous, being in the car -- and glad to leave it
text: when she pulls over. She watches this, wondering.
scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
text: Sharon exits the car and locks it, staring at Catch.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: If you're in trouble...
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I'm not.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: If you're in trouble with him,
dialog: maybe I can help.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Forget about him. Somebody I used
dialog: to know. I don't want to know him
dialog: anymore. That's all. Forget
dialog: about it. Walk with me.
text: She hesitates, then falls in beside him as he walks on.
text: They walk along in silence, the neighborhood growing more
text: seedy, tougher as they go. Catch is relaxing now, trying
text: to push it all away. Sharon looks around her.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: This is not a great place to walk.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I like it here. It's fine.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I work here. It's not fine.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: What's the problem?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Besides the shootings, break-ins,
dialog: rapes, cart thefts? We've got a
text: loose dog raiding garbage cans,
dialog: knocking 'em over. Can't catch
dialog: him. Got somebody blowing a
dialog: trumpet between midnight and
text: three. Can't find him.
text: As someone approaches them, Catch makes eye contact and
text: smiles a small, friendly smile-in-passing. He gets a
text: brief smile in return. He and Sharon amble on. He does
dialog: it again.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: You know everybody here?
text: He nods to another YOUNG MAN he's never met...
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: How's it goin'?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Goin' uphill, man.
text: Catch and Sharon smile.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: (to Sharon)
dialog: You try it.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Try what?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Go ahead. We need this.
dialog: Everybody.
text: She has misgivings. A young woman is bustling along.
text: Sharon makes eye contact and presents a nervous smile and
text: a nod -- but the woman looks at her sternly and bustles
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I feel like a jerk. I feel like a
text: smiley face.
text: Catch smiles, Sharon frowns, but when an OLD MAN passes,
text: she gives a small smile. The Man lights up.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Mornin'.
text: Catch looks at her. She tries to shrug it off, but can't
text: quite hide her pleasure. Now Catch is pausing as a woman
text: is walking her six-year-old daughter to their parked car.
text: Catch makes eye contact with the girl and does a goofy
text: wave that makes her smile. Sharon smiles, too. As the
text: girl's MOTHER is unlocking the car, the girl shyly looks
dialog: back at Catch for more fun. He does that quick finger
text: trick -- trying to catch his own thumb, and the girl
text: giggles But the Mother is impatient.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Go on.
text: The girl gets in. The Mother is about to close the door.
text: She frowns, mean-eyed.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Move your arm!
text: The girl slides in further, and the Mother slams the
text: door. The girl follows her mother with hurt eyes as she
text: walks around to the driver's side. Catch has paused to
text: watch this, his eyes gentle on the girl. The Mother is
text: about to enter the car when she sees Catch staring.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: What are you staring at?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: She feels bad 'cause you yelled at
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: What?! Who the hell do you think
dialog: you are?
text: Sharon is uncomfortable. Catch persists, never flinching
text: at the woman's anger.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: She just needs you to smile at
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: It's none of your business!
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Why not smile at her? What's it
dialog: cost?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Who the hell are you to talk to
dialog: me?!
text: Catch's anger is like flint in his eyes. It surprises
text: Sharon. She's upset by this.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: You're so damn impatient.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Get away from me!
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: You're so busy being pissed off,
text: and time is going by.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: It's not her fault.
text: The Woman gets into the car and slams the door.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I'm calling the police!
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: No. I'm calling the police.
dialog: (turns to Sharon)
dialog: Hey -- police.
text: The Woman speeds her car away. Sharon gets in Catch's
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Jesus Christ, Catch.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Maybe she'll think about it now.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON

dialog: neighborhood angel?! Jesus!
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: No. No, I just... some people are
dialog: walking around blind...
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: That's not your problem!
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Don't tell me what my problem is!
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Okay, fine -- you tell me what it
dialog: is!
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Maybe it's not my problem. Maybe
dialog: it's your problem. Maybe you're
text: going around blind.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Blind to what?!
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Blind to what's going on around
dialog: you. Blind to what people need.
dialog: We're supposed to take care of
dialog: each other. We're supposed to
dialog: keep each other safe. That's the
dialog: way it should be -- if you're not
dialog: going around blind, like that
dialog: woman...
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Or like me, right? What about
dialog: you? How come you can see?
text: That stops him, the darkness rising. He looks about,
text: trying to contain it.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I think I'll... walk the rest of
dialog: the way on my own.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Yeah. Fine.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I'll call you later -- about the
dialog: hiking.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I'll be out.
text: She turns and walks away. He is still angry, but sorry
dialog: to see her go.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Shar... wait. Hey!
text: But she keeps walking, and he watches her walk away.
text: Then he walks on, upset, mad at himself, trying to pound
text: through it, walking quickly. He is passing an alley,
text: when he hears a CRASH. He looks in...
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - DAY
text: He sees a large dog that has just knocked over a garbage
text: can. He and the dog stare. Catch walks into the alley,
text: approaches the big dog, squats down to look the animal in
text: the eye, and begins petting it. The big mutt is now
text: leaning into the petting, and Catch's eyes go deep -- and
text: slowly find their way to a sad smile.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY
text: Sharon and Robby are patrolling in their unit. Robby is
text: driving. Sharon is watching out the window with a deep-
text: eyed look, a bit down because of her argument with Catch.
text: She is staring as she rolls along.
speaker_heading: SHARON'S POV
text: She is watching the people on the street, NOTICING, for
text: once, just how isolated they are, each in a box, passing
text: without connecting.
speaker_heading: ON SHARON
dialog: watching.
scene_heading: INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT DAY
dialog: We've never seen the apartment flooded by sunlight like
text: this, all blinds open.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: We START in the kitchen, staring at the drawer that is
text: now so loaded with toys, it won't shut. Some brightly-
text: painted soldiers are sticking out of the drawer.
text: In the living room there are two chairs now, and more
text: lamps and tables. Our PAN REVEALS that the dog from the
text: alley is sitting in the living room, watching Catch --
text: whom we now see is hanging a picture on the wall -- a
text: mountain scene. He holds the picture in one place, then
text: moves it to another, wondering. His fight with Sharon
text: still colors his mood, but he's working through it.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Do we go for... symmetry? Or...
text: more off-center. Japanese.
text: He glances at the dog as he moves the picture.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Are you into this? Bob?
text: The dog watches him.
scene_heading: EXT. LARRY'S HOUSE - EVENING
text: It is early evening of the same day, and Sharon is just
text: off shift, out of uniform in her own car, parking on
text: Larry's street and walking to the door. She knocks --
text: and takes a step back. Larry opens the door, already
text: angry, his nose bandaged, eyes blackened a bit from the
dialog: blow.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I don't want you around here.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Let's go talk in the yard.
text: They stare. She starts walking back into his darkening
text: front yard, looking over her shoulder. She walks to a
text: tree where the tire swing hangs, waits there. He goes
text: back inside, but leaves the door open. In a moment he
text: reappears, coming outside, closing the door behind him.
scene_heading: ON SHARON AND LARRY

text: He has a Polaroid photo in his hand, holds it in front of
text: her, dried blood and bad bruising on his face.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Nice, huh? Beautiful. The
dialog: cops'll love this, right?
dialog: Evidence. Don't you guys love
dialog: evidence?
text: He puts it in his pocket, and they stare a moment more.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: You wanted me to swing.
text: She looks away. She nods, speaks softly.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I'm sorry I hit you so hard.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: But you're not sorry you hit me.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Jesus, Larry, what about Kathy's
dialog: face?!
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: That's not your business! Nobody
dialog: called you, right? She didn't ask
dialog: for you to come here. This is my
dialog: family. You don't get it, 'cause
dialog: you've got no family. Nobody. So
dialog: you try to run everybody else's
dialog: life. Jesus Christ -- get your
dialog: own life. That's the goddam
dialog: problem. Get your own goddamn
dialog: life.
text: Their stare holds, but she is giving way.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Okay. I'm sorry I came here. I'm
dialog: sorry I hit you. Okay?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Okay what?
dialog: This is very hard for her.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Don't go to my department, all
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Why the hell not?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Larry...
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Why not?!
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Because the job's all I got.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: That's what I said, right? No
dialog: life.
text: She nods, her voice smaller, almost a whisper.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: That's what you said.
text: He makes her wait, thinking it over.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: And you won't come around here.
dialog: You won't call. Ever.
text: In a moment Sharon nods.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: And I don't want you to come to
dialog: Mom and Dad's celebration...
text: Her eyes snap to his, surprised.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Not the church. Not the party.
dialog: Stay away. I don't want you
dialog: around. I don't want to see you,
dialog: Shar.
text: After another moment, she nods again -- and he snatches
text: the photo out of his shirt pocket and pushes it against
text: her chest and walks away. The photo falls to the ground.
text: Larry says without turning...
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Go get a life.
text: ... and she snaps.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I got a life!
text: The words burst out of her, thick with tears, but she's
text: not crying. Larry stops and turns.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: How the hell would you know about
dialog: my life?!
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: You know nothing about me, because
dialog: you don't want to know. The
dialog: family doesn't want to know me.
dialog: Well, too bad. Sharon's got a
dialog: life. Sharon's got a boyfriend.
dialog: Sharon's going hiking in the
text: morning with her boyfriend. She's
dialog: not sitting alone miserable like
dialog: you want. Too bad!
text: She reaches down, snatches the Polaroid photo off the
text: ground, walks to her car, enters and slams the door as
text: hard as it is possible to slam it.
scene_heading: EXT. SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS - DAY
text: Moving through the panorama are two small figures on a
text: hiking trail, traveling uphill on a ridge.
scene_heading: ON SHARON, CATCH
text: Sharon is pounding along, barely out of breath. She
text: studies the beautiful view, and it helps her. It lifts
text: her. Catch is falling behind, breathing heavily.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Hey. Hey! Can you wait up a
dialog: minute?!
text: She waits. He catches up.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I thought you walked all over the

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: (gasping)
dialog: The city is flat. Okay? Can we
dialog: stop here? Can we examine the
dialog: view? Have a Milky Way? I've
dialog: burned every calorie I ever had.
text: But she walks on.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: My favorite lunch spot is another
dialog: half mile.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Up?!
text: She smiles and walks on, and he follows, calling out.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I'm not one of those competitive
dialog: guys, you know!
scene_heading: EXT. POND - DAY (BIT LATER)
text: Sharon is already unpacking their lunch as Catch trudges
text: up and collapses near a stream-fed pond. She hands him a
text: sandwich, but he shakes his head.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: No thanks. I can't eat and have a
text: heart attack at the same time.
text: She smiles again and takes a bite and stares off, and
text: soon enough her dark thoughts come and cover her, and
dialog: Catch notices.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: As soon as you get happy, you get
dialog: sad.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I'm okay. Everything's code four.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Everything's what?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Everything's fine.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Fine? This isn't fine. I know
dialog: fine. This is something else.
dialog: Something happened yesterday.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Yesterday -- you mean you want to
dialog: hear about it?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Sure I do.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: No kidding. Why? You never talk
dialog: about yesterday.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: All my days are the same.
text: He keeps staring, waiting. She is chewing a sandwich,
text: looking at him. Finally, she begins -- with no emotion.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Yesterday. Okay. Yesterday we
text: rolled on a 415. Juliette and
dialog: Sanchez had these four guys
text: against a wall, but they were
text: H.D.B. and definitely unco-op. It
dialog: got pretty jumpy, but we got them
text: in the car with a couple of
text: bruises and Robby got a sprained
dialog: wrist, so I did the rest of the
dialog: shift with a rookie who lost it
text: over a D.B. in Sunset Park, old
dialog: woman who'd been dead maybe six,
dialog: seven days, and I usually do all
dialog: right but the smell got to me, and
dialog: I can still smell her. Then we
dialog: arrested a prostitute working out
dialog: of her home, and I carried her
dialog: little girl out to the social
text: worker, and the kid was holding on
dialog: real tight and making my shoulder
dialog: wet and I wanted to punch her
dialog: rock-head mother, and then shift
dialog: ended and I had a nice visit with
dialog: my brother Larry.
text: He is staring at her. He takes her hands, holds them.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: (softly)
dialog: I'm sorry. That would make
dialog: anybody sad.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Sorry you asked?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: No. No, you can always tell me.
text: She stares a moment, then speaks with an irony he doesn't
text: pick up on.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Well... I feel better now. You
dialog: feel better?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I feel fine. Great.
text: He takes off his T-shirt and begins stripping off his
dialog: shorts, his underwear!
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: What are you doing?!
text: She is surprised, smiling, as he plunges into the pond,
text: her darkness dissipating.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Catch! There's no swimming here!
dialog: And you can't be naked in a state
dialog: park!
text: He dives under and surfaces again.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Take the day off, Pogo!
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: What if a park ranger comes?!
text: He dives and surfaces once more. We STAY CLOSE ON him.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Take your badge off for once.
dialog: Don't be such a damn Marine about
dialog: everything. Just...
text: He stops because she isn't there. He looks about. Then
text: suddenly he sees her, poised on a boulder right above
text: him, in her underwear about to dive! He yelps and gets
text: out of her way, and she dives off the rock in classic,
text: near-professional form, a beautiful, sleek dive. She
text: hits the water just right and surfaces, and they splash
text: and swim and frolic and dunk each other in unabashed
dialog: play.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: At one point she jumps at him to dunk him, and he catches
text: her. They are in chest-deep water and their faces are
text: close. They pause -- then she goes in for a kiss, but he
text: pulls his head back, avoiding that kiss and says...
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Someplace I've never been kissed.
text: She smiles, staring, then slowly reaches her hands to his
text: face, gently closes his eyes and is about to kiss him on
text: the closed lids, but she changes her mind and instead
text: puts her lips tenderly on each of the small scars on his
text: face. Then she moves away. He opens his eyes. She
text: walks to the shore, moves to her clothes and starts
text: getting dried and dressed, giving him a soft look.
text: Catch comes to the shore to dry himself, but as he
text: dresses, Sharon glances at his body -- and the scarring
text: on his chest and arms. He is troubled about this,
text: avoiding her eyes. Then he makes a decision.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: They tell me I was in an accident.
dialog: Long time ago.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Looks like a bad one.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I don't remember it. I...
text: She waits -- but he says no more. She continues to
text: dress, sliding her shorts over her wet underwear -- but
text: before she puts her shirt on, she turns her back to take
text: off her wet bra. He glances at her. She looks over and
text: catches him glancing. They both smile softly,
text: ironically, as they finish dressing.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: We should be thinking about lunch.
dialog: We have to pack up.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: So soon?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Some of us have to work.
dialog: (teasing)
dialog: You ever work?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Yeah. I worked.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Oh? You remember that? Working?
text: She smiles and walks off toward the food. He stares
text: after her, his smile fading into thoughtfulness, memory,
text: as he dresses.
scene_heading: EXT. COFFEE HOUSE - DAY
text: Catch is standing outside, looking in through the large
text: window, searching. His eyes settle on a man, and he
text: stares. The man, about his age, is having coffee and
text: reading the paper. Catch is staring deeply, mustering
text: his courage. He walks into the place.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE HOUSE - DAY
text: Catch hesitates, then walks over and stands beside this
text: man until he -- JACK MOLINA -- looks up. Jack beams with
text: recognition and surprise.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Catch -- Jesus!
text: Catch is held back, smiling a bit, but on thin ice here,
text: dipping into his past.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How are you? Sit down. Been
dialog: years. You been out of town?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: (sitting)
dialog: I've been around.
text: Jack's smile clouds as memory kicks in.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, man, I'm really sorry about
dialog: what happened. I never got a
dialog: chance to say...
text: Catch, with a steady look, says...
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: We don't need to go there.
text: Jack nods a moment.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Okay. All right. So... what
dialog: d'you want, a coffee?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I want my old job back.

dialog: What d'you think?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You been workin'?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: No, but I'm up to speed.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: Well, it's not good with Randal
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, he's out of it, but Danny
dialog: Coley's got something going.
dialog: Wanna go see 'im?
text: Catch stares, nods.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Finish your coffee.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY (LATER SAME DAY)
text: In a seedy parking lot, tough part of town, Robby and
text: Sharon are arresting two teenage girls. One of them is
text: leaning on the car as Sharon searches her. Robby stands
text: back with the other (cuffed) girl. Robby is staring at
dialog: Sharon through this moment -- noting the difference in
text: her, still very professional -- but softer. The girl is
text: upset, near tears. Sharon is gentle in her search.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I have to check these jacket
dialog: pockets. What's your name --
dialog: Allison?
text: The girl nods, not trusting her voice.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I need to unsnap this, Allison.
dialog: I'm checking your waistband. You
dialog: got to Whitney School?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: St. Mark's.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Sharon is searching, Robby is noting all this, his eyes
dialog: appreciating the difference.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Lift your arms higher. Got a good
dialog: basketball team at St. Mark's.
dialog: You play basketball?
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT (LATER THAT NIGHT)
text: Sharon and Robby are still on the job, their unit rolling
text: down a residential street of apartment buildings. A
text: parked car is BLASTING MUSIC, and Robby halts beside it.
text: Sharon starts making dancing moves to the MUSIC, sitting
text: there beside Robby, and he stares at her as she grooves,
text: kidding it. Then Robby HITS the HORN to get the driver's
text: attention in the parked car. Robby makes a gesture to
text: lower the volume, and the man SNAPS OFF his TAPE. Robby
text: rolls on, glancing at Sharon. She wears a small smile,
dialog: checking their beat.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: What's going on, Pogo? You're not
dialog: happy or anything?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Well, it's a mix, Robby. Life is
dialog: shit, but I'm dating this great
dialog: dead guy.
text: She smiles at Robby's look.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: He says before I came along, he
dialog: thought he was dead. Sounds
dialog: better when he says it --
dialog: (stops abruptly)
dialog: Listen.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Shhh. Sh!
text: Robby stops the unit, rolling the windows down. They
text: hear the FARAWAY SOUND of...
speaker_heading: SHARON
text: The trumpet player.
text: Robby pulls over.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: This time we got his ass.
text: They exit the car and stand in the street, looking up,
text: scanning the dark buildings -- but the sound is hard to
text: track, a FAINT BALLAD on a skillful HORN.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Got 'im?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Look at that moon.
text: They stare at the full moon. In a moment, we hear the
text: sound of ROARING CARS, their TIRES SCREECHING as they
text: turn onto this street, one car speeding ahead to cut off
text: the other and force it to stop. The two male drivers are
text: screaming at each other. Robby shakes his head.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Full moon, man. Hey!
text: They run toward the drivers who are exiting their cars to
text: confront each other. One big guy carries a baseball bat.
text: Robby heads off one DRIVER while Sharon intercepts the
speaker_heading: BAT-MAN.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: This guy's crazy!
speaker_heading: BAT-MAN
dialog: This asshole side-swiped me!
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Are you McGuire?
speaker_heading: BAT-MAN
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Mark McGuire?
speaker_heading: BAT-MAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Then put that bat away. Put it in
dialog: your trunk. Now.
text: The man hesitates, then moves toward his trunk.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: I never touched his car.
speaker_heading: BAT-MAN
dialog: You lying bastard!

text: tackle, bringing him down hard on the street -- and we
dialog: immediately...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SHARON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)
text: as she lies on the bed, on her stomach, her top off, and
text: Catch straddles her, massaging her back and shoulder
text: which are sore from her tackle.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Ow. Ow!
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: No. That's good. Deeper.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: (as he works)
dialog: How heavy was this guy?
speaker_heading: SHARON
text: Like a truck.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: God. Tractor-trailer?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Pickup. Ow. Ow! That's really
dialog: good.
text: She begins to moan as he digs out the pain. He is
dialog: fighting against the erotic charge of this, trying to
dialog: keep it medicinal, but he's got his hands all over her
text: naked back, and she is moaning -- so he stops and takes a
dialog: breath.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I better... More oil.
text: He reaches to the bed table and puts oil on his hands,
text: noticing a card that stands open on the tabletop, a very
dialog: pretty invitation.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: This is pretty.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Don't get oil on it.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Renewal of vows -- that's great.
dialog: Is this your parents?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Yes. Just put it down. I'm not
dialog: going.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Why not?
text: She doesn't answer. He puts it down, comes back to the
text: slow rubbing of her shoulders, her neck. In a moment...
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: If I go, my brother'll hurt me
dialog: with the department. I got mad
dialog: and knocked him down. All they
dialog: need is a complaint. Just leave
dialog: it alone and keep rubbing. Okay?
text: She moans in pleasure as he rubs, trying to push all
dialog: other thoughts away.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: So... he says you can't go?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Can't you rub without talking?
dialog: (then)
dialog: It's been bad with my family a
dialog: long time, so the hell with it
dialog: anyway. If they don't want me
dialog: there, I don't want to be there.
dialog: All right?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: All right.
dialog: (then, as he works)
dialog: Bad how?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Oh, Jesus!
text: But we see her eyes turn inward toward the old pain and,
text: for once, she shares it.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: My father used to knock us around,
dialog: all of us. But I'm the one who
dialog: called the cops -- finally.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: They say I turned against the
dialog: family.
text: Catch works in silence a while, absorbing this, looking
text: at Sharon with more tenderness than ever. In a moment...
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: But... they invited you.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: You don't know anything about it.
dialog: So forget it.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Well... I know about family.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Oh, yeah? What about it?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: It's... a door you don't close.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I didn't close the door.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: You're closing it now. Right?
dialog: Family invites you, you go.
dialog: Family shows up, you welcome them
dialog: in. That's family.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Oh, sure. What if they don't
dialog: deserve it?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Then you forgive.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: You have all the answers.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: No. I just... It seems like a
dialog: chance, doesn't it? A chance to
dialog: make things right. I'd take it.
dialog: Then you tried -- y'know? And
dialog: it's up to them.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Sharon is considering his words, but she's also deep in
text: her old pain, defensive, challenging.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: You close with your family?
text: That hits him, but he keeps rubbing her, gentle now,
text: looking a little lost. He doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: See? So why should I listen to
dialog: you?
text: But as he works her back in silence, we see her facing
text: her pain and thinking through it.
scene_heading: INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING
text: Just after dawn. Catch is on the couch, stirring in his
text: sleep, in the grip of an unsettling dream. We hear what
text: he hears: the VOICES of his wife, his son, murmurings.
text: We're not sure of the words, even laughter. Catch's eyes
text: snap open, jolted out of sleep, but the VOICES don't
text: stop, and he suddenly sits up. The VOICES FADE as he
text: catches his breath, gulping air. He tries to calm down.
text: In a moment, he rises and moves to Sharon's bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
text: He comes to the side of the bed and sees that she is
text: asleep. He sits on the bed and studies her, his dark
text: thoughts dissipating as he watches her sleep, his eyes
text: going deep. In a moment he begins to raise a hand to
text: brush her cheek -- the way awakened her before -- but he
text: stops before touching her. Instead, he brings his face
text: close to her and lightly kisses her.
text: She stirs. He kisses her again. She opens her eyes.
text: They stare at each other. She raises a limp hand and
text: touches his face. He begins to come close, slowly, for
text: another kiss. She welcomes it. They kiss on the mouth,
text: very tenderly. They kiss again -- deeper. They kiss
text: again, and she holds him, and he moves fully onto the
text: bed, lying over her and supporting his weight on his
text: elbows and kissing and kissing and letting go for once,
text: hungry for her because she is in his heart now, and she
text: is a salvation, and there is a moment when they both
text: pause and stare clear-eyed, acknowledging what they are
text: doing, and both of them abandon their fear and pain and
text: begin to smile, and they make love that way, smiling, as
dialog: we slowly...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 85.
scene_heading: INT. BLUES CLUB - NIGHT
dialog: The night of that same day finds us at this neighborhoody
dialog: place with a lot of down-to-earth atmosphere and not a
text: lot of noise, like Harvell's in Santa Monica -- earthy
text: blues and jazz from a small band in a darkish club, small
text: dance floor. We PAN during this slow number and ARRIVE
text: AT a few dancing couples, including Sharon and Catch who
text: mostly just hold each other and sway. When their eyes
dialog: meet, there is a lot of deep pleasure there.
text: The music ends. The small crowd applauds. Couples head
text: back to the tables, but the little band goes right into a
text: more up-tempo but still earthy blues. Sharon stops and
text: pulls Catch back onto the dance floor. He smiles and
text: follows.
text: This number has a driving beat, and, slowly, we watch
text: Sharon drop her inhibitions and become more and more free
text: out there, and Catch is smiling and wowed by her, and she
text: laughs, wowing herself, and she keeps going, getting wild
text: and playful, and it's something to see. We LINGER ON the
text: joy and abandon. She's earned it. They go a little
dialog: crazy, happy crazy, and in a while we...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: SAME - HOURS LATER
text: The blues club is emptying out. It's late. The band is
text: finishing what seems to be its last number, for the last
text: of thinning crowd -- including a tired, happy Sharon and
text: Catch who applaud the end of the number. Catch stares at
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: What's your favorite song?
text: He rises -- as if to go to the band with a request. She
text: smiles, spent.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Catch, I'm beat. So are they. I
dialog: think they're finished.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: One more. It's a surprise.
text: She watches as he leaves her, walks to the bandstand. He
text: talks to the leader who is the PIANO PLAYER.
speaker_heading: SHARON'S POV
text: From the instrument cases on the floor behind the piano,
text: Catch picks up a trumpet case, opens it. Now Sharon's
text: tired smile is changing to curiosity, wonder.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: ON CATCH
text: As he puts the mouthpiece on the horn, nervous, but
text: excited, too, speaking to the Piano Player.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Thanks, Danny.
speaker_heading: DANNY (PIANO PLAYER)
dialog: Gonna be good having you back,
dialog: Catch.
text: Catch comes to the edge of the bandstand, grinning a bit
text: at Sharon, at his surprise for her, nervously fingering
text: the horn. He puts it to his lips.
speaker_heading: ON SHARON
text: Mouth-open surprise -- and then smiling with the wonder -
text: - and Catch begins to play, closing his eyes and
text: rendering a ballad, like the haunting "ANGEL EYES."
text: Sharon's smile slowly fades, replaced by a much deeper
dialog: look, not only because he is so good, but because he is
text: showing her his heart, his love and even his pain -- more
text: than he can show her any other way. We INTERCUT as he
text: opens his eyes briefly, watching her, sending her the
text: music, closing his eyes again to fall into the song -- as
text: Sharon's eyes fill at the beauty and sadness of it, and
text: at this look inside her man. We LINGER. Then...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CLUB - NIGHT
text: We keep the sound of CATCH'S TRUMPET going as he and
text: Sharon exit the club and begin to stroll away, arms
text: around each other. In a moment, he stops. He can't go
text: another step. He has to kiss her. He holds her face and
text: comes in for the kiss, and above the music we hear her
dialog: say softly.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Where I've never been kissed.
text: He stops and stares a moment, then takes her hand and

text: boulevard and there, in the center of the street, kisses
text: her, and she responds, and it is their finest, fullest
text: moment, lifting on the MUSIC, and it is ironic and
text: prophetic that at its peak they are washed over by the
text: revolving light from a police car and a SIREN that CHIRPS
text: once as they break, staring.

speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Oh, God.
text: We WIDEN to see Ray and Sanchez in their police unit 20
text: feet away. Ray uses a small electronic bullhorn to
dialog: say...
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Are you in danger there?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Go away.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I was talking to him, Pogo.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: No thanks, Ray. Everything's code
dialog: four. Go away.
text: Sharon laughs aloud and walks (with Catch in hand) to the
text: police car, her joy overwhelming any embarrassment. She
text: gestures behind them at the jazz club.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: See that place? He's going to be
dialog: playing there every weekend.
text: Catch notes the pride with which she says this.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (impressed; to Catch)
dialog: Oh, yeah? What d'you play?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: It's music, Ray. You wouldn't
dialog: like it.
text: She waves and walks off with Catch, arms around each
text: other. The cops watch them go.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. CATCH'S BEDROOM - DAY (NEXT MORNING)
text: Sharon is asleep, alone in the tousled bed.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING
text: Catch is dressed, putting a leash on Bob, glancing into
text: the bedroom at Sharon.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: There is love in his look, and then a passing question,
text: too, a residue of fear now that their relationship has
text: begun in full -- but it all ends up in a soft smile for
text: her as he walks Bob to the door. He hesitates at the
text: door -- then walks into the kitchen and slides open that
text: drawer of toys, stares at them.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - MORNING (MINUTES LATER)
text: Sharon is waking, sleepy. She rises, finds a robe and
text: slips it on, calling out softly for Catch.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING
text: Sharon sees that Catch and Bob are gone. She drifts to
text: the window, looks at the day, looks down at the street --
text: and she sees them.
speaker_heading: SHARON'S POV
text: She sees Catch and Bob on their way into the park across
text: the street from the building.
speaker_heading: ON SHARON
text: She smiles and moves into the bedroom to dress.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY PARK - DAY (MINUTES LATER)
text: Catch is walking Bob in the park, but is also checking
text: for someone, studying the playground. He begins walking
text: toward the swings.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - SANDBOX
text: Tommy, Catch's neighbor, is playing in the sand with a
text: metal truck. Catch walks up to Tommy, carrying a bulging
text: plastic bag -- but Tommy's attention is on Bob, and pets
text: the big, friendly dog.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - CANDACE
text: She sits on a bench nearby, watching this, smiling a bit.
dialog: 89.
scene_heading: ON CATCH, TOMMY
text: Catch kneels in the sand, beside the boy, and he spills
text: out the contents of the bag -- action figures,
text: superheroes, soldiers. Tommy goes wide-eyed at the
text: array. Catch is pleased by the boy's reaction. Catch
text: keeps a layer of emotion covered here.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: You like these?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Yeah!
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Well... They're for you. We can
dialog: pretend it's your birthday.
text: Tommy stares at him, then back at the toys in delight.
text: Candace is walking toward them, and Catch turns to her.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I hope you don't mind.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: They're for me, Mom!
text: Her look of surprise questions him.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Yeah. I've... kind of been saving
dialog: them up.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: For Tommy?
text: He nods. She kneels close to her boy, the toys, pleased
text: but not quite knowing what to say.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Well, thank you. Thanks a lot.
text: Catch nods, grins at Tommy who is already at play with
dialog: the figures.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - SHARON
text: She has entered the park and witnessed this from a
text: distance. She is angling toward the playground.
speaker_heading: ON CATCH
text: He watches Tommy at play with the figures, but it's
text: almost too much for him. He touches the boy and rises,
text: smiles and nods at Candace and begins to walk off.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: ON SHARON
text: She hurries her steps to intersect with Catch.
scene_heading: ON CANDACE, TOMMY
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Wow, Tommy -- Look at them all.
dialog: Did you say thank you?
text: Now Tommy looks up. Catch is moving away with Bob,
text: walking home. Tommy stands up, Candace calls out to stop
dialog: Catch.
speaker_heading: CANDACE
dialog: Excuse me!
speaker_heading: ON CATCH
text: But he is walking on, some of the emotion seeping
text: through, not darkness, some old joy welling up. We see,
text: in b.g., Tommy starts to run after him to say thanks. We
text: now have a convergence of Tommy, Sharon and Catch, who is
text: moving steadily toward the street, crossing a bike path
text: now. A BIKER is coming on. All in one moment Catch
text: hears the WHIZZ of the BIKE, Tommy calling out "Thank
text: you," and Candace shouting "Be careful!" And Catch goes
text: cold inside and turns quickly and rushes onto the bike
text: path, taking the collision with the bike so Tommy is sure
text: to be safe. Catch and the biker fall hard. Sharon stops
text: -- holding her breath. Tommy watches, wide-eyed, and
text: Candace comes running.
text: Catch is rising, a little sore and soiled. The biker is
dialog: angry.
speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: Goddammit -- I saw the kid.
dialog: Jesus. I wasn't even close.
text: But Catch is walking away with that frozen, numb look,
text: all shut down by his fear and his memory as Bob trots
text: along beside him and the Biker comes after him and Tommy
text: and Candace watch him go and Sharon hurries her steps to
text: catch up. The Biker reaches Catch first.
speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: Wait a minute! Hey!
text: But Catch won't turn to him, walking on -- and the man
text: gets in front of him, raging.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: Why the hell did you cause a
dialog: wreck?! I told you -- I saw the
dialog: kid, you idiot. I was...
text: Pain and darkness build in Catch's eyes until he says in
text: a quiet, choked voice, right into the Biker's face...
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: One more word, and your life will
dialog: change forever.
text: The man stops talking, looking at the dead certainty in
text: Catch's eyes. He wants to say more, to save face, but
text: Catch's look holds him like a fist. Sharon has stopped,
text: frozen, watching. The Biker turns away and walks back to
text: his downed bike as Catch moves on. Sharon can hardly
dialog: believe all of this, following Catch again.
speaker_heading: ON CATCH, SHARON
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Catch! Catch!
text: It takes a moment for her voice to penetrate, then he
text: quickly turns and sees her approaching.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Are you all right? Your elbow's
dialog: bleeding. I...
text: But he is tight, nearly frozen, everything held in.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: What's wrong?
text: He walks away from her, and this shakes her, and she
text: catches up again.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Where are you going? Catch --
dialog: you're scaring me. Please...
text: But he walks on, desperate, and she gets in his way,
text: faces him.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Please, Catch, don't... Can't you
dialog: talk to me?!
text: He turns and walks off, heading for the street.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Please. Wait. I... Catch!
text: He has walked into traffic -- not completely unmindful of
text: the cars, but desperate to get away. She watches this,
text: frozen, as HORNS BLARE. He has to stop in the middle of
text: the street to wait a moment, and he stands there,
dialog: stricken.
speaker_heading: ON CATCH
text: As the traffic moves around him and the dog -- a HORN
text: BLARES, BRAKES SCREECH, and he thrown into a storm of...
speaker_heading: FLASHBACKS
text: That come sharper and faster than before, bits and pieces
dialog: of memory outside any order: He is driving, Annie smiles
text: at him, headlights blind him, Annie screams, the little
text: boy in Annie's arms grins at him, BRAKES SCREAM, Annie
text: says something to him, calmly, but he can't hear her, the
text: headlights blind him again and BRAKES SCREAM again, and:
speaker_heading: BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)
text: Catch stands there shaken and shut down.
speaker_heading: ON SHARON
text: Watching him, shocked and frightened for him. She sees
text: the traffic let up, and Catch crosses and walks toward
text: home. She watches him go.
scene_heading: EXT. BUSY STREET - DAY (LATER)
text: As Robby and Sharon's police unit moves along with
text: traffic. In a moment they pull over and park beside an
text: office building. It is the same building the man entered
text: shouting, "Catch!" Sharon watches the building's
dialog: entrance. After a while...
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Are you going to tell me why we're
dialog: sitting outside this building
dialog: again?
speaker_heading: SHARON
text: Watching for somebody. Tall guy.
text: 40s. Grey-blond hair.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: What's it about?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: It's personal.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Fine -- what am I supposed to do?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Chill.
text: She watches the building, studying the people who come
dialog: and go.
scene_heading: INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Catch is at home, still shaken by what happened to him in
text: the park. He reaches for the PHONE, punches in a number.
text: It RINGS and Elanora Chu picks up. Catch is deep in his
dialog: pain.
speaker_heading: ELANORA (V.O.)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: ELANORA (V.O.)
dialog: Hi! How are you? Have you been
dialog: out in this great afternoon?
dialog: Brenda took me for a walk.
text: She senses the silence on the other end and quiets a bit.
speaker_heading: ELANORA (V.O.)
dialog: Anything wrong?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I've been... remembering.
text: She is quiet for a moment.
speaker_heading: ELANORA (V.O.)
dialog: Catch... This is good.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: It's awful.
speaker_heading: ELANORA (V.O.)
dialog: No. No, there's good to remember.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He doesn't speak, shakes his head.
speaker_heading: ELANORA (V.O.)
dialog: Catch?
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I'll call you.
text: He hangs up, staring at his thoughts.
scene_heading: EXT. BUSY STREET - DAY
text: Sharon is still staking out the office building. Robby
text: is fidgeting. She just keeps watching. When Robby
text: begins to speak, she puts up a hand to stop him, going
text: very still, staring out the window at the man who Catch
text: was afraid of, Richard Pindella. The man enters the
text: building. Sharon gets out of the car, intense...
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Give me fifteen.
text: And she hurries after the man.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
text: As Sharon enters, sees the man at the elevators. He gets
text: into an elevator, and she just misses him. She watches
text: the elevator indicator. It stops at two. She hurries up
dialog: the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
text: As Sharon bangs into a hallway through the stairway door.
text: She looks one way, looks the other way down the long
text: hall, and sees the man just entering a door. She walks
text: to that door. It is marked "private." She knocks and
text: walks in.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - DAY
text: She enters a comfortable office, many shelves, books,
text: couch and chairs, big desk. She hears the man's voice
text: from an anteroom. He's coming toward her.
speaker_heading: PINDELLA (O.S.)
dialog: Excuse me -- that's a private
dialog: entrance...
text: He sees her now, sees the uniform.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PINDELLA
dialog: Oh... is there a problem?
text: He's calm, gentle in the eyes. She stares a moment,
text: trying to keep her emotions undercover.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I'm not sure. Who am I speaking
dialog: to?
speaker_heading: PINDELLA
dialog: I'm Dr. Pindella.
text: She takes her time, afraid.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: What kind of doctor?
speaker_heading: PINDELLA
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Do you know a Catch Lambert?
speaker_heading: PINDELLA
dialog: Oh. Yes! Is he in trouble?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I... need to talk to you.
text: He glances at his watch, worried for Catch.
speaker_heading: PINDELLA
dialog: Well, I have a patient in five
dialog: minutes. But I can...
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Are you a...?
speaker_heading: PINDELLA
dialog: I'm a psychiatrist.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: And Mr. Lambert...
speaker_heading: PINDELLA
dialog: My relationship with Mr. Lambert
dialog: is confidential.

dialog: way into this.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: He's your patient. He's your
dialog: patient we... know all this. This
dialog: is police business. I'm officer
dialog: Sharon Pogue -- L.A.P.D.
speaker_heading: PINDELLA
dialog: Look... I want to help Mr. Lambert
dialog: but I can't tell you anything that
dialog: isn't public record.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: In general. In general. He's
dialog: your patient, and he...
speaker_heading: PINDELLA
dialog: He's not my patient. He walked
dialog: away from treatment. That was...
dialog: nearly a year ago.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Why did he walk away?
speaker_heading: PINDELLA
dialog: I can't discuss that, but if you
dialog: know how to reach him, I would
dialog: appreciate being able to talk to
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: (desperate)
dialog: You can help by just telling me
dialog: what's in the public record.
dialog: It'll take me half a day to do a
dialog: search. Can you tell me? Just...
text: She is unable to play this out as a "cop," her emotions
text: coming through. Pindella sees this. She sits on the
text: edge of a chair and takes a breath, speaks more softly.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Can you please tell me what's in
dialog: the record?
text: He stares a moment, sympathetic -- and realizing...
speaker_heading: PINDELLA
dialog: You were with him -- in the car.
dialog: Your uniform threw me. Are you
dialog: his friend?
text: She looks at him, nods.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: More.
text: He takes that in, leans back on the desk.
speaker_heading: PINDELLA
dialog: I can tell you he was in an
dialog: accident, hospitalized, referred
dialog: to me as an outpatient...
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: What accident?
speaker_heading: PINDELLA
text: A bus... a city bus hit his
dialog: vehicle. That was a couple of
dialog: years ago. It was... an awful
text: thing. His family was in the van.
dialog: His wife and child. His wife's
dialog: parents...
speaker_heading: SHARON
text: A bus... and a van. Where? On...
dialog: the freeway?
text: Something is pulling at her memory. Her vision turns
text: inward, and she stops breathing for a moment --
dialog: remembering. She was there. And here we get a...
speaker_heading: FLASHBACK - CARNAGE
text: A glimpse of the carnage -- what she saw, first on the
text: scene -- with Catch lying there. All the while Pindella
dialog: is speaking.
speaker_heading: PINDELLA (V.O.)
dialog: I think so. Yes. Near Santa
text: Monica. On the freeway. He was
dialog: severely injured but... thrown
text: clear. The others were trapped in
dialog: the van.
speaker_heading: BACK TO SHARON (PRESENT)
text: still in shock, looks at Pindella again.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Survivors? Only him? I... don't
dialog: remember.
speaker_heading: PINDELLA
dialog: Remember?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Yes. I was there. I was there.
text: Pindella stares, then...
speaker_heading: PINDELLA
dialog: His wife's mother survived, but...
dialog: she was paralyzed.
text: She takes a moment, absorbing this.
speaker_heading: PINDELLA
text: Elanora Chu. She's still in town,
dialog: I believe.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Does he... still see her?
speaker_heading: PINDELLA
dialog: He used to. I don't know.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'm glad to see... he has someone
dialog: else who cares about him. I know
dialog: he's running from this. He left
dialog: all his friends, his home, his
dialog: whole life.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: He says... he doesn't remember the
dialog: accident.
speaker_heading: PINDELLA
dialog: He lost a lot of memory. I tried
dialog: to help him with that. He
text: resisted. Walked away.
text: She stares.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I think he remembers me.
text: Very subdued now, she asks...
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: How does he live?
speaker_heading: PINDELLA
dialog: He received a large settlement
dialog: from the city, but he...barely
dialog: touches it. He was a professional
dialog: musician.
text: She stares at him and nods.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY
text: Sharon is in the report room, using the computer,
text: hunting. We MOVE AROUND to see her and the screen. She
text: is searching the police records to find the accident.
text: The CONTINUING TRUMPET RIFFS are the motor for this. She
text: suddenly stops as we FOCUS ON the name: "LAMBERT." Then
text: we watch her as she punches up the data and she reads.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: We MOVE THROUGH Sharon's nearly dark apartment, its
text: stillness in strange contrast to the manic TRUMPET RIFFS.
text: We PAN to find her curled in a chair, staring deeply,
text: sadly, drinking a drink. As we PAN, we DISCOVER she is
dialog: looking at that mural of the mountains and through this
text: to her thoughts, and then she makes a decision and rises
text: and goes to the phone, punches in a number.
scene_heading: INT. CATCH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: He is sitting on his bed, back against the headboard,
text: sitting there fully dressed, shoes and all, knees up --
text: as he plays his muted trumpet, hard and fast, playing the
text: incredible riffs we've been hearing, playing in a driven
text: way, keeping his demons away. When the RING of the PHONE
text: breaks through, he stops suddenly. He waits. His
text: MACHINE CLICKS ON and BEEPS. We INTERCUT the call as
text: Sharon's voice comes on, subdued.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Catch, it's me. Can you pick up?
text: But he sits there, waiting, listening.
speaker_heading: SHARON

scene_heading: EXT. WESTWOOD STREET - CORNER - NEXT DAY
text: Catch waits on a busy street corner in Westwood Village
text: not far from Santa Monica. He is waiting, glancing over
text: the passing crowds for Sharon. He sees her. She is off
text: duty, out of uniform. He watches her until she spots
text: him. She smiles a little, but there is a mix of fear and
text: sadness in her smile. They walk to each other and stop
text: and hug, but it is brief, and then she keeps walking
text: slowly, and he walks beside her. There is a strain
text: lingering between them.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Shar, I'm sorry about yesterday.

speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: So... why'd we meet here?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: So you're the trumpet player who
dialog: was waking people up -- on my
dialog: beat.
text: They walk along in silence a moment.
speaker_heading: CATCH

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CATCH

dialog: agitation, but covering it.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: You going to tell me where we're
dialog: going?
dialog: (as she doesn't
dialog: answer)
dialog: That's okay. I mean... I'll go
dialog: anywhere with you, Shar. Jaws of
text: death. The mall on a Saturday.
dialog: Just about any...
text: He slows his steps, looking across the street and down
dialog: half a block...
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: We see an ivy-covered brick building there, with a sign
dialog: that is too far away for us to read.
scene_heading: ON CATCH AND SHARON
text: He looks quickly away from that building. She sees his
dialog: growing agitation.
speaker_heading: SHARON

speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I've got you now. I'm holding on
dialog: -- like before.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: What d'you mean?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Like I held you before. Like I

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: What makes it so... unspeakable,

dialog: hear this.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Is it because you were driving?
text: He turns away, closing his eyes.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I read the reports, and it wasn't
dialog: your fault. It wasn't. Is it
dialog: because you survived and they
dialog: didn't?
text: She puts her hand out for him again.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Catch. Please. Hold on, and
dialog: we'll go in there together...
text: He does not take her hand, so she takes his and walks a
text: few steps toward that building.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: You can talk to them. You can say
dialog: goodbye or I love you or
dialog: whatever...
text: He pulls his hand away again, more violently, a layer of
text: rage over his pain.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: This is wrong! It's wrong! Why
dialog: are you doing this?!
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: To help you.
speaker_heading: CATCH

dialog: we're fine...
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: We're not. We're not fine, Catch.

speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Don't talk about that! Don't!
speaker_heading: SHARON

dialog: Say it! I'm asking you to say it.
text: Her tears come, and she shakes her head.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Because I want it too much. I
dialog: want everything with you. I want
dialog: all of you -- not just the part
dialog: that isn't hiding and running
dialog: away...
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Why are you pushing so hard? Why
dialog: does it have to be your way? Why
dialog: does it have to be your truth?
dialog: This is who I am! This is the way
dialog: I am!
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Not anymore. It doesn't have to
dialog: be this way anymore because you're
dialog: not alone -- because we're the
dialog: family now. We can be the
dialog: family...
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: You like to push people, don't
dialog: you? You just have to push and
dialog: shove and make it right for you --
dialog: for you. You push everybody,
dialog: Shar. You even pushed your family
dialog: away, didn't you?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He has stung her. The tears are in her throat. She has
text: to take a moment, but she pushes through to say
dialog: quietly...
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I just... want to say...
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: You already said it. You said it
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: When you're ready, I'll be there
dialog: for you. I just want to say that.
text: And she turns and walks away. He watches her go, angry,
text: scared and sorry for what he said. He takes a few steps
text: after her, wanting to call out and to stop her. We see
text: him almost call to her. He is coming apart, watching
text: her, needing her so much, but unable to call out.
text: He is shaky. He takes a glance at that building, then
text: away. He stares after Sharon -- but she's out of sight
text: now. He steels himself, then looks across the street
text: again at that building.
text: He is desperately afraid. He stares at the building a
text: long while. He begins to cross the street. He makes
text: fists to keep from shaking. He walks to the entrance.
scene_heading: EXT. BUILDING - DAY
text: This is the "Wellston Memorial Chapel and Mausoleum."
text: The sign is on one of the brick pillars. The iron gate
text: is open. He can't walk in there. He just can't. He
text: walks away quickly, as if escaping.
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE BUILDING PARKING LOT - NEXT DAY
text: The new shift of cops is heading for its cars -- Sharon
text: and Robby, Ray and Sanchez, others. The mood is relaxed,
text: teasing talk, but Sharon is way down. She tries to push
text: her mood away and tough through it.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Rib House after shift today?
dialog: 4:30?
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: I think I'll head home.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Pogo? Bring your friend.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: No, I think I'll turn vegetarian.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Gotta have that meat to keep your
dialog: strength up.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: How come it's not working for you?
text: There is a scattering of laughter -- almost by rote -- as
text: Sharon enters her car without even the hint of a smile.
text: Robby notices. She just punches up the CAD monitor, all
text: business. Our TRUMPET MUSIC comes in, aching now, and
dialog: takes us into...
scene_heading: INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: She is exercising on the machine, sliding into her
text: crunches, fast and furious, but all the pain and sorrow
text: is in her eyes, and in a moment she just stops. The
text: TRUMPET MUSIC KEEPS GOING ON through this. She looks
text: over at the phone.
scene_heading: INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: We PAN OVER Bob-the-Dog, watching something. We see a
text: few scattered sheets of music lying about, hearing
text: RUSTLING, and we ARRIVE AT Catch, seated on the floor,
text: shuffling through a stack of sheet music, driven, looking
text: for something. The PHONE RINGS. He ignores it. He is
text: opening up each chart of music, shaking it out,
dialog: searching.
text: Sharon's voice comes on his machine, almost hollow with
dialog: sorrow.
speaker_heading: SHARON (V.O.)
dialog: Catch. Can you... pick up?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Will you call me?
text: He keeps searching, seeming to not even listen. The
text: MACHINE CLICKS OFF. He shakes the next music chart and
text: something falls out. He stares at this piece of paper,
text: picks it up, slowly turns it over. It is a picture of
text: himself, a man blowing a horn, drawn in crayon by a four
text: or five-year-old. Catch stares at this with a depth that
text: goes on forever, as the MUSIC ENDS.
dialog: 107.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NEXT DAY
text: Sharon and Robby are rolling to a stop in a strip mall
text: parking lot, exiting their car. No rush. She's still
text: very downbeat. As they walk from the car, he keeps
text: glancing at her, concerned for her.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Pogo...?
text: She puts up a hand to brush all the words away. She
text: can't talk about it. She pushes through it by doing the
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Which store is it?
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: The little market there. They
text: came through a back window last
text: night. Mostly vandalism...
text: They walk on, but as Sharon reaches the sidewalk, a
text: little child, three years old or so, toddles out the door
text: of a shop. A SKATEBOARDER is rattling along, and Sharon
text: makes a grab for the child, taking his arm gently...
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Whoa...
text: ... and pulling him to safety as the Skateboarder passes
dialog: by shouting...
speaker_heading: SKATER
dialog: Sorry!
text: And now the WORRIED MOTHER is emerging from the shop...
speaker_heading: WORRIED MOTHER
dialog: Oh, God, thank you. Billy!
text: She picks up her boy, walks back into the shop. Sharon
text: stands there -- as it all blooms inside of her, rocks
dialog: her, really, this little act, evoking Catch, who he is,
text: what he said and what he means to her. Robby is a few
text: steps ahead, waiting for her, but she can't move yet,
text: looking around her now at the people walking among the
text: shops and cafes. She picks one. She catches the eyes.
text: She gives a brief smile. The smile is answered, shyly,
text: kindly, the person moves on.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Pogo?
text: She doesn't move for a moment. Then she turns to Robby.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: There's something I have to do. I
dialog: need an address and phone.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: What's the name?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Elanora Chu.
text: Robby looks at her, then nods, giving her this.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Let's do it.
text: They walk back to the car.
scene_heading: EXT. UPSCALE RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY
text: We see Sharon walking quickly from her police car to the
text: front of Mrs. Chu's home. Robby waits in the unit.
scene_heading: EXT. CHU HOME - DAY
text: Sharon walks under that covered portico to the front
text: door, but before she rings the bell, a voice startles her
dialog: a bit.
speaker_heading: ELANORA (O.S.)
dialog: Pogo?
text: Mrs. Chu emerges from the shadows of the portico, rolling
text: her wheelchair toward Sharon. She has a smile for her --
text: but with some reserve.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I'm Sharon Pogue. I know all
dialog: about the...
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: Elanora.
text: Sharon nods, very held back. She gestures toward the
text: wheelchair self-consciously.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I'm sorry for... what happened. I
dialog: know about the accident.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: (hopeful)
dialog: He told you?!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: No. I found out, and... I
dialog: remembered. I was there.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: Oh. Yes.
text: Sharon stares a moment, begins with some of her tough
text: cover in place, over her emotions.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I guess he comes here a lot -- to
dialog: talk to you.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: He shops for me. Twice a week.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Oh. And when he comes here -- he
dialog: never mentions the past, never
dialog: talks about the accident?
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: And you... let him do that? All
dialog: this time? Why?
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: It's what he needs.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Walking all over the city like...
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: Like an angel. Yes. Sweet man.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: But... you let him get so lost.
text: Elanora is a bit defensive now.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: I let him find his own way through
dialog: it. Why did you come here,
dialog: Sharon?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Because... I want to know how to
dialog: help him.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: You are helping him.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: He... he was paying me back, I
dialog: guess, for the accident, for
dialog: helping him. That's why he
dialog: felt... so close to me. But...
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: Is that what you think?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: But now he probably hates me.
dialog: I...
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I took him to the cemetery, and...
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: The cemetery!
text: Elanora's look darkens and she begins to shake her head
dialog: in worry.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I thought it might help him...
dialog: come back, you know? But he
dialog: wouldn't even go in. He screamed
dialog: at me.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: (upset)
dialog: What made you take him there?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: For the truth...
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: He knows the truth.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: But he won't even say it, or...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: That's his way. That's his way
dialog: through all this. He made a wall
dialog: -- around that whole day, that
dialog: night -- other things, too. He
dialog: keeps them behind the wall -- his
dialog: little boy, my daughter. He can't
dialog: help it. The cemetery?! Do you
dialog: know how hard it is for me to go
dialog: to the cemetery? Can you imagine?
text: Sharon is shaken by this, realizing, crumbling a bit as
text: Mrs. Chu goes on.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: That's where it stares you in the
dialog: face -- the loss. And it's too
dialog: much sometimes.
text: Elanora takes a breath, acknowledging how upset she is.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: See? I'm still finding my way
dialog: through it. And Catch -- it
dialog: almost kills him to think about it
dialog: or say it or drive a car or see
dialog: the place where it happened or...
dialog: go by the cemetery.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I was trying to help him... come
dialog: back to some kind of life. I...
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: But he was coming back. Do you
dialog: realize how much he changed in the
dialog: past weeks? His apartment, his
text: life, his music is coming back.
dialog: He fell in love! He even got a
dialog: job, Sharon -- for you. For the
dialog: two of you. Isn't that coming
dialog: back? Why do you have to rush?
dialog: Everybody has to rush these days.
text: Sharon, battered by the truth of this, is totally exposed
text: now, realizing, admitting.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I was scared. I push so hard...
dialog: when I'm scared.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: Scared of what?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Losing him. So I did. I lost
dialog: him. He won't talk to me. I... I
dialog: didn't know what I was doing.
text: Elanora sighs, looking at her, and her anger drains away,
text: studying Sharon's misery.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: You were finding your way. What
dialog: else can we do? You think I'm
dialog: always sure what to say to him,
dialog: what not to say? I do what I
dialog: think is right and hope he sees
dialog: the love in it.
text: She shakes her head at Sharon's tears, her warmth showing
dialog: now, liking this girl.
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: Look at you -- so worried now, so
dialog: miserable. That's the love in it.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Did I... make it worse for him?
speaker_heading: ELANORA
dialog: I don't know. I really don't.
dialog: But I think he'll see the love in
dialog: what you did.
text: Sharon stares, without much hope. She puts out her hand
text: to touch Elanora's, to say goodbye. Elanora takes her
text: hand and holds on a moment, staring into the girl, with
text: strength. Sharon nods and walks off, dark and sad.
text: Elanora watches her go.
scene_heading: INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: It's the next day, and Sharon is preparing to go to her
text: parents' renewal of vows. She is at the bottom -- with
text: Catch gone from her life -- but she is doing her best to
dialog: go through with this.
text: We START ON a table, looking at the invitation and next
text: to that is a wrapped gift. We hear Sharon moving about,
text: see her nervous, half-dressed, speaking to herself. In
text: the b.g. we hear our TRUMPET-BASED MUSIC. Very soulful.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I just came by to... wish you
dialog: well. To... congratulate you and
dialog: wish you well. Shit.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She checks the mirror again, doesn't like the look,
text: starts undressing, comes back to the table with the gift
text: on it, wonders if she should add more decoration to the
text: box. She does, and as the trumpet plays on we --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: SHARON
text: dressed differently, re-wrapping the gift and then --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: SHARON
text: dressed differently, rewrapping it again and then --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: SHARON
text: sitting still in a chair, holding the gift on her lap,
text: looking at the clock, nervous, scared, sad.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY (SAME DAY)
text: Catch is walking down a commercial street -- no Bob-the-
text: dog, no strolling gait. He is focused, deep-eyed, on a
text: mission of some kind. Our MUSIC CONTINUES over this and
dialog: on into...
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: The MUSIC CONTINUES over Sharon driving to the church,
text: parking, taking a deep breath, exiting the car. There is
text: no one else outside the church. The ceremony has already
text: begun. She's planned it that way. She enters the church
text: as the MUSIC FADES OUT.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - DAY
text: As Sharon comes in quietly. The church is not full, but
text: perhaps 50 people sit in the front pews, watching the
text: ceremony at the altar: The priest, Mr. and Mrs. Pogue,
text: altar boys. Sharon moves forward and slips into a pew a
text: few back from the altar. The slight disturbance of
text: people sliding over to let her in causes a few people to
text: glance over.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: One of them is Kathy. They trade a brief, nervous nod.
text: Then Kathy whispers to her husband...
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: She came.
text: We see Larry grow tense and angry.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Don't say anything. Think of your
dialog: parents.
text: Larry doesn't look at Sharon. The little boy, looking
text: fine in a tiny suit and tie, and being bored, leans to
text: look at his aunt.
text: Sharon and Larry, Jr. trade a look. She winks, then
text: settles back in her pew, watches.
speaker_heading: ON ALTAR
text: We get our first look at Sharon's FATHER, Carl Pogue, 62.
text: Standing beside his wife, a rather big, stolid guy, taken
text: with the moment, both he and his wife emotional over
text: this. He wears a hearing aid. The priest is speaking.
speaker_heading: ON SHARON
text: watching with a mix of feelings as the mass continues and
text: the vows are renewed, the priest reciting the rituals.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: The PRIEST'S VOICE from the church plays over this scene,
text: invoking the blessings, saying the prayers of the mass as
text: we watch Catch continuing his mission, slowing his steps
text: now and pausing at the entrance to the Welston Memorial
text: Chapel. He hesitates. We see the price he's paying and
text: the determination. He walks through the gate.
scene_heading: EXT. CHAPEL GROUNDS - DAY
text: He walks into a courtyard of several small buildings in a
text: garden setting -- all red brick and ivy, fountains and
text: flowers. He is fighting his way through this, moving
text: closer to one of the buildings. He is nearly alone on
text: the chapel grounds, and, as he reaches the sheltered wall
text: of this building, he is alone.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: This is a wall of bronze vaults within the bricks, and on
text: each vault is a plaque -- a name. His breath shivers in
text: his body as he struggles to lift his eyes. Slowly, his
text: gaze comes to rest on a name: "LAMBERT."
text: As he stares, the PRIEST'S VOICE from Sharon's church
text: FADES OUT, and we are left with silence. Catch is
text: shaky,. He takes a step closer to the wall, to the name,
text: to them -- and he tries to speak, but can't. He tries
text: again -- his voice intimate, just above a whisper at
dialog: first.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Annie. Chet. I don't... want you
dialog: to think I forgot about you. It's
dialog: just that I... I couldn't find
dialog: you.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I woke up, and you were gone.
dialog: Everything was gone. It all
dialog: just... disappeared. In one
dialog: minute. I couldn't remember that
dialog: minute. I lost it. It took me so
dialog: long to find it. I think I found
dialog: it all now. I used a calculator.
dialog: I did. I figured it out. You
dialog: know... we get about 1400 minutes
dialog: a day and so I figured it out. I
dialog: was 33 years old and three months
dialog: and eight days, so it was... I've
dialog: got it here...
text: He fishes a piece of paper out of his pocket. His hand
text: is shaking as he reads a number off the paper.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: It was minute number 17 million
dialog: eight hundred ten thousand, two
dialog: hundred... or so.
text: He puts the paper away.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: That's the one I lost. And...
dialog: when I lost that minute, I guess I
dialog: tried to lose it all, all the
dialog: memories -- because they hurt. I
dialog: tried, but... I couldn't do it.
dialog: We --
dialog: 116.
scene_heading: FLASHBACK - INT. VAN
dialog: to that minute and, for once, we go in order and play out
text: each piece of it. We see Catch driving the van, his wife
text: ANNIE beside him. His son Chet is in back with his
text: grandparents, Elanora and her husband. The boy is a bit
text: whiny, pouty.
text: We INTERCUT the flashback WITH --
speaker_heading: CATCH
text: at the grave, struggling through this.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Chet... you weren't feeling so
dialog: good, remember? It was your
dialog: birthday, and you ate too much.
text: We see Annie and Catch both glance back toward Chet, and
text: we get present sound in this FLASHBACK scene as Catch and
text: Annie both say, "What's the matter? Hm? Aww." And then
text: Annie looks out the window and turns to Catch and -- we
text: CUT TO Catch at the grave, his eyes filling.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: And, Annie, you said... you
dialog: said...
text: In the FLASHBACK we see Annie turn to him again, and this
text: time we hear her say, softly...
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Slow down in the rain, all right?
text: We GO TO Catch at the grave, fighting tears.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: And I don't know if I slowed down.
dialog: I don't know. I hope I did,
dialog: but... I didn't always listen. I'm
dialog: sorry. I'm really sorry.
text: Back in the FLASHBACK, we see Annie reach around as
text: Elanora hands Chet to her. Then we're BACK at the grave
text: and INTERCUTTING so that we see Catch speaking through
dialog: his tears and we also see this tender moment played out
text: in the van.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: ... You put him on your lap, and
dialog: he looked at me, and I made a
dialog: face. Remember? I made you
dialog: smile, Chet.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CATCH (CONT'D)
dialog: And then we all smiled, and it was
dialog: a great minute. It was. I'm
dialog: really glad... I found that
dialog: minute. No matter what.
text: Catch stares at the grave, in tears, as the rest of that
text: minute now plays out, punishing him. It lasts only about
text: three seconds: a bus out of control, headlights suddenly
text: glaring through the windshield, Catch turning the wheel,
text: BRAKES SCREAMING, PEOPLE SCREAMING -- and then it's over.
dialog: And Catch has been battered by the memory, and is
text: weeping, but has not looked away. He is still staring at
text: the name of his family, and he is able to say, in a
dialog: broken voice...
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I won't forget... anymore. I love
dialog: you.
text: He steps forward and puts his hand on the plaque, rests
text: it there. We STAY ON this, then in a moment, we...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - DAY
text: The renewal of vows is over, and Sharon is standing in
text: the aisle, nervous and not sure what to do. Guests are
text: up and milling about, many leaving the church. "See you
dialog: at the house." "See you at the party." Etc. A
text: PHOTOGRAPHER is setting a group shot at the front of the
text: church. Mr. and Mrs. Pogue, Larry and Kathy and the
dialog: little boy...
speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPHER
dialog: All right. The whole family in
dialog: this one. Just...
text: Out of the milling crowd comes Sharon, taking a breath
text: and braving it, walking up there, speaking quietly.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Where do you want me?
text: The Photographer turns to her, wondering.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I'm the daughter.
speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPHER
dialog: Oh! Oh, well, how about...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 118.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: We see the family shift so that Larry and his family are
text: on one side of the parents. Sharon follows the
text: Photographer's gesture to stand at the other side, beside
text: her Mother. Her Father has not looked at her. The photo
text: is taken. Sharon now turns to her mom and dad. This is
text: difficult, the strain is thick in the air.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: You both look so great.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: You, too.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I just wanted to...
text: The Father speaks to her, his voice not hard, but flat,
text: not warm either. No smile.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: You coming to the party?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Sure.
text: He nods, then turns to greet well-wishers. Sharon is
text: left alone by the drifting away of the family, but one
text: old couple greets her, the older woman (Mrs. Vander)
text: wearing her new blue dress, her HUSBAND beaming beside
dialog: her.
scene_heading: MRS. VANDER
dialog: Sherry! Look how nice you look.
speaker_heading: HUSBAND
text: Big police officer now.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Not so big.
dialog: (to Mrs. Vander)
dialog: Nice dress.
text: Sharon moves off toward a side exit, trying to catch up
text: with Larry and his family.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE OF CHURCH - DAY
text: As Larry and his family exit -- and Sharon comes out of
text: the church, calling ahead.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Larry...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 119.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He starts to just walk on, ignoring her, but Kathy takes
text: the little boy and walks ahead, with a look at Larry, at
dialog: Sharon.
scene_heading: ON SHARON AND LARRY
text: They nod to a few passing guests. Then they're alone.
text: His nose is still bandaged, but less so, anger and
text: betrayal in his eyes.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: How did you have the guts to walk
dialog: into a church after breaking your
dialog: word?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I have to be here. It's a chance
dialog: to make things right, and I'm
dialog: taking it.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Why even talk go me? You got what
dialog: you wanted. You laugh about it?
dialog: You tell your cop friends how
dialog: you...
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: You think I talk about it?! You
dialog: think...
text: She stops herself, catching her rush toward the old
text: anger. She goes calmer, deeper, even sad.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Here, Lar.
text: She hands him something. It is the Polaroid photo. He
text: looks at it, surprised. They lock eyes. She speaks
dialog: softly.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I was invited. I'm here. I'm
dialog: going to the party. You do what
dialog: you want.
text: And she walks off toward the parking lot.
scene_heading: INT. POGUE HOME - DAY
text: We're in the midst of the party. We see Sharon drifting
text: a bit, a hello here and there. She feels out of place.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 120.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Though the home and yard are thick with people, there is
text: some tension, especially in the core group -- all who
dialog: know about the estrangement of Sharon. Now and then a
text: nervous glance from her mother is directed at Sharon, or
text: a hostile glance from Larry.
text: Sharon passes the videographer, who is pointing light,
text: camera and microphone at the Vanders -- having them put
text: their good wishes on tape. She smiles, then looks over
text: and sees her Father across the room. He is alone. She
text: steels herself and heads his way. He makes eye contact,
text: then averts his look. She is approaching him, about to
text: speak, when he walks up to some friends and starts joking
text: with them, leaving Sharon hurt, humiliated.
text: Her mother has seen this and comes to her, speaking
text: quietly, nervously.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Don't make him talk about...
dialog: anything today.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Mom, I was going to fix his tie.
text: His tie is crooked.
text: She sighs, pushing through her hurt to say...
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: It was a nice ceremony.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: (worried)
dialog: Yes. We're running out of
dialog: chicken, though. Nobody's eating
dialog: the ham.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: It's a great party, Mom. You look
dialog: happy.
text: Some joy is allowed to surface in her Mother's face.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Thirty-five years and still in
dialog: love, huh?
text: Her Mother's look clouds a little, nervous again.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: You think that's wrong, don't you?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Of course not...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 121.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: I always... I feel like
dialog: apologizing to you. But I love
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: And then I feel like apologizing
dialog: to him for loving you. I'm the
dialog: one in the middle. I'm the only
dialog: one in this family who knows how
dialog: to forgive anybody.
text: And she walks away. Sharon's eyes follow her, surprised
text: and thoughtful. She watches her Mother approach her
text: Father and straighten his crooked tie. Then Kathy is
text: moving toward Sharon. Sharon turns to her and they both
text: speak quietly -- at the same time.
speaker_heading: BOTH
dialog: You look great.
text: Then they smile sad smiles. Kathy gestures to her face,
text: the faded bruise.
speaker_heading: KATHY
text: Tons of makeup. On Larry, too.
text: They smile wryly again.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Sorry about that, but... I
dialog: couldn't stand him doing that to
dialog: you. I took it on...
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Don't worry. I'm not your mother.
dialog: If he tries it again, I'm gone.
dialog: I'm out of there, me and Larry
dialog: Junior. He knows that.
text: They stare, and Sharon gives her a hug, Kathy returns it.
speaker_heading: ON LARRY
text: We see Larry, across the room, notice this hug. He keeps
text: his expression intact for the group he's in, but we see a
text: flare of anger in his eyes.
dialog: 122.
speaker_heading: ON SHARON
text: moving across the living room.
text: She sees Larry Jr. sitting alone and goes to him, sits
text: beside the child -- who looks sad.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: What's up with you?
speaker_heading: LARRY JR.
dialog: They won't let me watch T.V.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Oh. Well... let's pretend this is
text: T.V. It's a show about a party.
text: They look about the room.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: (as if it's a secret)
dialog: That man... is really a super
dialog: hero.
speaker_heading: LARRY JR.
dialog: Is not.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Is too. And so is she. Look.
dialog: See? Red tights under her
dialog: dress... Oh-oh, that man gave her
text: a drink with something in it.
speaker_heading: LARRY JR.
dialog: With what?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: With stuff to make her sleep.
dialog: He's a bad guy.
text: The woman sips her drink, and the boy smiles, getting
dialog: into it.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: She drank it.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Watch. She'll fall down any
dialog: minute.
text: The boy is suddenly swooped up, lifted away by his
text: father. Larry puts the boy down near the door.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Hey, sport, you should go play
dialog: outside.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 123.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He turns to Sharon.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Stay away from my family.
text: Then he turns to the crowd, smiling a smile without
text: humor, speaking loudly.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Hey, everybody, keep it down.
dialog: Somebody might call the police.
text: There is some nervous laughter, people watching them now.
text: Sharon is angry and embarrassed, keeping her voice low.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: What're you doing?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (to crowd)
dialog: Once the cops leave, we can really
dialog: party.
text: The crowd around them is all staring now -- as he turns
text: back to Sharon.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Why don't you give everybody a
dialog: break -- and go home?
text: In the hushed tension that follows, a GLASS falls and
text: SHATTERS, and more people quiet down and stare. Sharon
text: looks at her glaring brother, looks at her Mother
text: nervously picking up the broken glass -- no support
text: there. Angry and shaken, she turns to the door.
text: She walks to the door, opens it, starts to leave, starts
text: to close the door behind her, and she stops, take takes a
text: breath, battling hard against the old patterns of hurt
text: and anger. She looks at that nearly-closed door. She
text: pushes it open and walks back in.
text: We see a surprised and angry look from Larry, a worried
text: look from her Mother -- but Sharon is moving through the
text: crowd, searching until she sees her Father. She heads
text: toward him. He sees her and walks into the kitchen,
text: avoiding her. She follows him. We see Larry and his
text: Mother exchange an anxious look -- and then move toward
dialog: the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Sharon enters, waits, others are leaving the kitchen,
text: leaving her alone with her dad, but he starts to follow
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 124.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Don't walk away. Okay?
text: He acts as if he just noticed her.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: What?
text: She gestures toward his hearing aid.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Is it working? Do you need to
dialog: check it?
text: He absently touches the device.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: It's fine.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Dad...
text: But the kitchen door opens. We hear the party going on
text: out there. Larry and Sharon's Mother enter, her Mother
text: looking at her husband and back to her daughter, very
text: frightened. Larry is raging in a near whisper.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: What the hell are you doing?!
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Sharon, please.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Please? Please what?! Will you
dialog: stop protecting him? You were
dialog: always protecting him! Don't talk
dialog: to your father. Don't bother your
dialog: father!
text: She turns to her dad.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I'm going to bother you for one
dialog: minute, Dad. Okay? Can you
dialog: handle that?
text: Larry advances on her.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Just get the hell out...
text: And she turns on him in a fury that halts him.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 125.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: This isn't about you, Larry -- or
dialog: you, either, Mom. This is between
dialog: me and my father, so leave us
dialog: alone for one goddam minute!
text: She turns back to her father.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: How about you, Dad. Do you want
dialog: me to leave?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Up to you.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Dad... I'm asking. Am I welcome
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Jesus -- you're here, aren't you?
dialog: What d'you want?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I want to know!
dialog: (then, quieting)
dialog: Do you want me here? Do you love
dialog: me, Dad? I want to know.
text: The question's out, and she's totally exposed now -- and
text: the silence that follows breaks her heart. She nods
text: toward his hearing aid. Her voice is close to a whisper,
text: thick with tears.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Do you... need to... check that
dialog: again?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: I feel like...
text: He can't finish it.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: What, Dad? You feel like what?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: I feel like I don't have a
dialog: daughter anymore.
text: She takes the blow and doesn't crumble, only her eyes
text: show the depth of the pain. She speaks quietly, softly.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 126.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Well... you do. It's a shame
dialog: you're going to miss knowing her.
dialog: You're going to miss all that.
text: And she leaves, brushing past Larry and her Mother.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Sharon comes out of the kitchen, blinking back tears.
text: The party goes on around her, oblivious. She stops on
text: her way to the door because she sees the video crew
text: moving, hunting the next guest -- and she makes a
text: decision and walks toward them, stops in the light, faces
dialog: the camera.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I'm next.
text: As they roll tape, people turn, gather, watch. Sharon
text: speaks over a torrent of emotions.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: (to camera)
dialog: Hi, Mom and Dad. Congratulations.
text: We see her family coming out of the kitchen and walking
text: into this, surprised, stopping still.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Y'know... being in this house
dialog: reminds me of something. I was
dialog: about ten, I guess, and Larry and
dialog: I were playing aliens -- remember,
dialog: Lar? We're making a lot of noise,
text: and Dad comes home from work tired
dialog: and pissed off...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: HER FATHER
text: watching this. Her Mother is near panic, Larry staring
text: hard, Kathy wondering. INTERCUT their reactions
dialog: during...
speaker_heading: SHARON
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: We're yelling like mad, and Dad
text: bursts into the room and says,
dialog: what the hell are you doing? And
dialog: I'm scared. I'm really scared.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 127.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARON (CONT'D)
dialog: And I say, we're playing alien
dialog: invasion, Dad, and he says, oh,
dialog: yeah, I'll show you a damn
dialog: invasion, and he picks me up,
text: picks me up off the floor and
text: throws me on the couch. I hit
dialog: that couch and bounce off, and he
text: grabs Larry and throws him on the
text: couch, and then... then he starts
dialog: making these monster sounds, and
dialog: he says, we came to earth to kick
text: ass, and I run at him and jump on
text: him and he tosses me on the couch
text: and then Larry, and we're laughing
dialog: so hard I almost wet myself, and
text: he keeps tossing us and growling
dialog: and beeping, and it was... it was
dialog: great. It was great, and I'm
dialog: never going to forget that.
dialog: Never. And I miss that. I miss
dialog: it. So I just... I wanted to tell
dialog: you tanks for that, Dad. Thanks.
dialog: That's all.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Bye.
text: She hands the microphone back and walks away as the
text: surprised looks, the deep looks of her Father, Mother,
text: Larry and Kathy follow her. She walks to the front door
text: and leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. POGUE HOUSE - DAY
text: Sharon exits and starts to walk away. She sees Larry Jr.
text: look up from his play. He smiles at her. She returns
text: the smile -- it means a lot to her, and she walks on. As
text: she reaches the gate, she notices something across the
text: street that halts her. She stops still, surprised and so
dialog: pleased.
speaker_heading: HER POV
text: Catch is there, waiting near her car, watching her now.
scene_heading: BACK TO SCENE - FULL SHOT
text: as Sharon walks to him, so glad he's there, needing him
text: -- but still not sure of what he's feeling about her,
text: until she gets close and sees his eyes and the way he
text: opens his arms -- and they embrace, and she holds on
text: tight, eyes closed.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 128.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: They break the embrace, still holding on, searching each
dialog: other's eyes.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Sorry, Shar. For what I said.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Me, too.
text: In a moment, he gestures toward the Pogue house.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Was it bad?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: They don't like me in there.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Then they don't deserve you in
dialog: there.
text: She stares a moment more, still together.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: That's a nice thing to say.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: It's not a thing to say. It's the
dialog: truth.
text: She can only look away, not wanting to cry.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: Why do you try so hard not to cry?
text: She stares at him again. Her throat fills with tears,
text: mouth is trembling a bit. She starts quietly, finally,
dialog: with nothing held back -- but this is not anger as much
dialog: as mourning.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: It's not fair.
text: The tears come, and she doesn't fight them, emptying the
text: old, old wound, speaking through her weeping now. The
dialog: first time we've seen her cry.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: It's not fair. Things got better
dialog: for them because of what I did.
dialog: Things got better, and I'd still
dialog: do it. I'd do it all over again.
dialog: And it's not fair they shut me
dialog: out. It's not.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 129.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: It's not fair. I was 19, and I
dialog: didn't know what else to do. I
dialog: didn't know how else to stop it.
dialog: It's not fair I don't have a
dialog: family anymore.
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: No. It's not, Shar. It's not.
text: He raises his hands to her face, places a palm gently on
text: each cheek, and she covers his hands with her own and
text: closes her eyes. They remain that way awhile. In a
text: moment he lightly kisses her forehead. There is a depth
dialog: to his words...
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: We're the family, Pogo.
text: She opens her eyes, staring deep into his. He has said
text: it all -- as it is and as it will be. She smiles a bit
text: through her tears and nods. He puts an arm around her
text: shoulder and holds her tight against him as they walk to
text: her car. She puts an arm around his waist.
text: They reach the car, and she unlocks it, gets in behind
text: the wheel as Catch gets into the passenger seat.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY
text: Sharon just sits behind the wheel, still shaky from
text: crying. She puts the key in the ignition, but doesn't
text: move -- no longer sad, but drained now. He watches her.
text: In a moment, he gets out of the car.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR - FULL SHOT
text: Catch comes around to Sharon's window. She rolls the
text: window down, concerned, wondering what he's doing. Is he
text: leaving? But he reaches for her door and opens it and
dialog: says without a fuss...
speaker_heading: CATCH
dialog: I'll drive.
text: She stares a long moment, realizing, but also making no
text: fuss about it as she gets out of the car, walks around
text: and enters the passenger side. They close the car doors.
text: Catch STARTS the CAR and drives them away. Drives them
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: THE END
