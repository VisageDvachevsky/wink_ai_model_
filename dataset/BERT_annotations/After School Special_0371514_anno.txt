speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: 1 INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY 1
text: As we wind down the crowded hallway in this typical American
dialog: high school...
scene_heading: 1A ANOTHER CORRIDOR 1A
text: ...we hear all the sounds of a STANDARD PORNO FLICK, from the
text: unenthusiastic screams of fake ecstasy to the cheesy music.
scene_heading: 1B INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY 1B
text: The sounds echo in the empty hall. Behind the stage a light
text: from an open door...
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.)
dialog: This is unwatchable. It's not even in
dialog: focus. And geez, look, the boom mike is
dialog: in the shot. This is really shoddy work.
scene_heading: 1C INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - A/V ROOM - DAY 1C
text: The door leads into this room, as we continue on to a
text: TV MONITOR displaying a sweaty guy's ugly face.
speaker_heading: DEACON (O.S.)
dialog: Why do they always show the guy's face?
dialog: It's like, can't we just assume he's
dialog: enjoying it?
text: We slowly PULL BACK from the TV.
speaker_heading: FRED (O.S.)
dialog: Because they're trying to make us feel
dialog: like we're better looking than that guy,
dialog: so we should be able to get chicks as hot
dialog: as her.
speaker_heading: DEACON (O.S.)
dialog: How the hell do you know?
speaker_heading: FRED (O.S.)
dialog: It's a basic rule of porno.
text: Finally, we REVEAL our three heroes: MATT, FRED, and DEACON.
dialog: They're watching the porno...
scene_heading: 2 INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - A/V ROOM - DAY 2
dialog: ... before school with the sound turned way down, but you can
text: still hear the porno. The three guys are sitting with their
text: book bags on their laps to conceal any possible bonerage.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 2.
speaker_heading: DEACON (V.O.)
dialog: It all started on my seventeenth birthday
dialog: with our usual morning routine: film
dialog: appreciation.
text: The school bell RINGS and Deacon clicks off the TV.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Deacon! What are you doing? I was
dialog: watching that.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Come on, let's go. We're going to be
dialog: late.
speaker_heading: DEACON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: And when I say film appreciation, I mean
text: film duplication. Fred steals them, Matt
dialog: copies them, and I sell them.
text: Matt walks over to the TV and presses eject on five VCR's.
text: The original plus four copies pop out.
dialog: CLOSE ON the original tape: "Ramalot Productions presents
text: Dirty Darla #7," as Matt hands it to Fred and the copies to
text: Deacon. They smile.
scene_heading: 3 INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY 3
text: The guys are waiting in line for lunch.
speaker_heading: DEACON (V.O.)
dialog: Fred's the kind of kid who's basically
dialog: given up on high school. He figures his
text: glory days are way ahead of him.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: First, I go to Yale, then Harvard law,
dialog: then when I'm making a hundred grand a
dialog: year, I'll have a whole stable of hot
text: chicks sitting around topless on my
dialog: yacht.
text: He smiles ears to ear, looking for approval.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (to Deacon)
dialog: Will that work?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: (to Fred)
dialog: You are a complete moron.
text: Deacon and Matt walk off. Fred calls after them.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: What?
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 3.
scene_heading: 4 INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY 4
text: The video monitors up and down the hallways display an image
text: that reads "Fifteen Days Till Midterms."
text: Fred sees two AMAZING GIRLS walking towards him.
speaker_heading: DEACON (V.O.)
dialog: Until that big payday, Fred's sex life
text: consists of spanking it.
speaker_heading: AMAZING GIRL
dialog: That test was sooo hard.
text: That's too much for Fred to take. He adjusts his pants, turns
text: ninety degrees, and makes a beeline for:
scene_heading: 5 INT. BOYS' BATHROOM - DAY 5
text: Fred looks under the stalls to make sure no one's in there,
text: then enters a stall and locks the door.
text: He puts his book bag down, then places a protector on the
text: toilet seat and sits down. He pulls a large wad of toilet
text: paper off the roll. Then, from out of the book bag, Fred
text: pulls a bottle of Moisty-Mate hand lotion. He smiles.
scene_heading: 6 INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY 6
text: Fred is walking to class when he spots a HOT GIRL, rubbing a
text: stain off of her shirt. Another HOT GIRL grabs her arm.
speaker_heading: HOT GIRL
dialog: We're going to be late. Are you coming?
text: Fred perks up.
scene_heading: 7 INT. BOYS' BATHROOM - DAY 7
text: Fred walks into the stall and grabs the toilet protector.
speaker_heading: DEACON (V.O.)
dialog: Fred averages two to five time a day,
dialog: depending on how many girls he sees in
text: the hallway.
scene_heading: 8 INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY 8
text: Matt is videotaping the students (including J.T. and Mark)
text: running down the hallway to class. Fred watches.
speaker_heading: DEACON (V.O.)
dialog: Now Matt-- Matt's what you'd call a late
dialog: bloomer. Secretary of the Audio Visual
dialog: Club, amateur filmmaker, and complete
dialog: dork.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 4.
text: J.T. and Mark grab Matt's camera and film each other flipping
text: him off. Matt grabs it back and the Twins walk away laughing.
text: Fred shakes his head.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: All great directors start this way. I'm
text: documenting the essence of high school.
text: Teenagers running to meet their destiny
text: only to find it's just home room. It's
dialog: very existential.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: So's my balls. See you later.
speaker_heading: 9 OMITTED 9
scene_heading: 10 INT. OUTSIDE THE LOCKER ROOMS - DAY 10
text: Matt trudges into the locker room area, holding a towel to
text: his bloody nose.
speaker_heading: DEACON (V.O.)
dialog: In the normal course of things, Matt
dialog: probably wouldn't even have been our
dialog: friend, but Fred likes having someone to
dialog: boss around, and I think Matt's actually
dialog: pretty cool once you get to know him.
text: Just then, the burly GIRLS' SWIM TEAM COACH comes out of the
text: girls' locker room. She walks by Matt without noticing, and
text: the door to the locker room closes slowly.
text: Matt's attention is drawn to it. The door stops with a CREAK,
text: a sliver of daylight still visible.
text: Matt shakes his head and starts to walk away towards the
text: boys' locker room. Then, he stops. He's torn. He's still too
text: immature to really be interested, but he thinks he should be.
text: He looks around quickly, then slowly approaches the door. He
text: turns his head sideways, and places it up against the crack.
speaker_heading: 10A MATT'S POV 10A
text: The proverbial jackpot. Teenage girls changing. Bras.
dialog: Panties. Towels...
speaker_heading: 10B REVERSE ANGLE 10B
text: Matt's eyes widen. And then, they CLOSE TIGHT. He quickly
text: scurries away.
speaker_heading: DEACON (CONT'D; V.O.)
dialog: Well, at least he's got the key to the
dialog: A/V room.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 5.
scene_heading: 11 INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY 11
text: Deacon talks quietly to a DORKY FRESHMAN.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Dirty Darla #7 is a modern classic. This
dialog: is grade-A porn, my friend. Worth a lot
dialog: more than twenty dollars.
speaker_heading: DORKY FRESHMAN
dialog: Sweet.
text: He hands him the money and Deacon makes the exchange for the
text: tape. The freshman clutches it like gold and scurries away.
text: Deacon heads out down the hallway towards his locker. He sees
text: a gaggle of teenage GIRLS gossiping.
speaker_heading: DEACON (V.O.)
dialog: People always talk about how tough it is
dialog: being a teenage girl. I mean, if I have
dialog: to watch one more TV movie about bulimia
dialog: or self mutilation or vaginal dryness...
text: Deacon reaches his locker and opens it. He sees some
text: CHEERLEADERS bouncing down the hallway. Deacon takes out some
dialog: books for class.
speaker_heading: DEACON (CONT'D; V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll tell you what's really hard. Being a
dialog: seventeen year old boy. Imagine what it's
dialog: like to have only one thing on your mind
dialog: all day, every day, but to have
dialog: absolutely no way of getting it.
scene_heading: 12 INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY 12
text: CLOSE ON a textbook showing the anatomy of the vagina.
text: PULL BACK to reveal Deacon, seemingly staring into space, but
dialog: really staring at...
speaker_heading: DEACON (V.O.)
dialog: Testosterone is a drug more powerful than
dialog: heroin. I don't really have any evidence
dialog: to support that, but the point is, a
dialog: horny teenage boy will do almost anything
dialog: for even a glimpse of sex.
text: ... his BIOLOGY TEACHER's erect NIPPLES visible through her
text: conservative bra and blouse. Aside from her flashing
dialog: headlights, she's the kind of woman you wouldn't notice even
dialog: if you were alone with her on a two-man luge. But that
text: doesn't matter-- Deacon can't take his eyes off of them.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 6.
scene_heading: BIOLOGY TEACHER
dialog: (in the background)
dialog: ... the increase in the hormone
dialog: testosterone causes certain physiological
dialog: changes in the adolescent male...
speaker_heading: DEACON (V.O.)
text: We're suffering. Suffering from a deep,
dialog: debilitating addiction to something we've
dialog: never even had. Teenage boys are like
text: time bombs, ready to explode.
speaker_heading: BEHIND DEACON
text: Two GUYS are whispering.
speaker_heading: GUY 1
dialog: Did you hear about Rachael?
speaker_heading: GUY 2
dialog: No, what happened?
speaker_heading: GUY 1
text: John Baldwin nailed her.
text: Deacon bolts upright and spins around, concerned.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Are you talking about Rachael Unger?
speaker_heading: GUY 1
dialog: Yeah. It was at Richard Rosenblatt's
text: party. In the bathroom.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: (crushed)
dialog: You're kidding.
scene_heading: 13 INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK) 13
text: RACHAEL UNGER, Deacon's girlfriend at the time, is naked
text: under Deacon's sheets after school one day. Deacon ENTERS
text: from the bathroom and is immediately surprised by her state
text: of undress.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Rachael! What are you doing?
text: She sits up and strikes a sexy pose.
speaker_heading: RACHAEL
dialog: We've been together for a year now, and I
dialog: thought it was time to take our
dialog: relationship to the next level.
text: Deacon is becoming very nervous.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 7.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Now?
speaker_heading: RACHAEL
dialog: You've been talking about this for
dialog: months.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: I didn't think you were listening to me.
text: Suddenly, Rachael becomes a little self-conscious.
speaker_heading: RACHAEL
dialog: Don't you want to?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Of course I do. But, I, um... I don't
dialog: have anything...
text: She pulls out a condom.
speaker_heading: RACHAEL
dialog: I do.
text: But he's still hesitating.
speaker_heading: RACHAEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Deacon, what's the problem?
text: Deacon looks at her waiting there for him, his for the
text: taking. An eternity passes. Then,
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: I have a math test tomorrow.
scene_heading: 14 INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY (END FLASHBACK) 14
text: The Teacher CLEARS HER THROAT and Deacon snaps out of it. He
text: turns away from the guys behind him as they continue to
dialog: describe the John Baldwin incident.
speaker_heading: DEACON (V.O.)
dialog: "I have a math test tomorrow." The bottom
dialog: line is, I just couldn't do it. I don't
dialog: know why, I just couldn't. And I've
dialog: cursed myself every day since then.
text: Deacon is suddenly...
scene_heading: 15 INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY 15
text: ... very depressed as he trudges to his locker. Which is
dialog: nothing compared to how he feels when he looks
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 8.
scene_heading: DOWN THE HALLWAY
text: and sees Rachael at her locker, hugging some people good-bye
text: (including a good-looking guy who must be JOHN BALDWIN).
text: Rachael looks down the hallway towards Deacon, but Deacon
text: ducks away.
text: Now he's even more embittered.
scene_heading: 16 EXT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY 16
text: Fred and Matt are walking towards their bikes after school.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Did you videotape it?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: Yeah. I took my camera to gym class with
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: You are the biggest moron I have ever
dialog: known.
text: Just then, Deacon comes up to them.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Hey, guys. Here's the money.
text: He hands out the proceeds from the operation, and Matt
text: notices that Deacon is a little out of sorts.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Something wrong?
text: Deacon lets out a deep breath.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Yeah. I heard Rachael Unger did it with
dialog: John Baldwin.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Well, you had your chance. I told you to
dialog: seal that deal.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Shut up, Fabio. I don't see you sealing
dialog: any deals.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: I'm biding my time.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Whatever. It just wasn't good timing.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 9.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: It doesn't get any better than that. You
dialog: and Rachael were perfect for each other.
dialog: And naked girls don't just appear out of
text: thin air.
dialog: (scoffs)
dialog: "I have a math test tomorrow."
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Will you shut up already?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Look, I've been thinking about this all
dialog: day. We're juniors now. Upperclassmen.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: So?
text: They reach the bike rack and start unlocking their bikes.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: So we have a responsibility to ourselves
dialog: to start having fun and getting girls.
dialog: This year is our year.
dialog: (takes the chain off his bike)
dialog: There's nothing holding us back any more.
text: Over in the parking lot, JAKE, a studly senior, revs the
text: engine on his truck. Two hot girls, KELLY and WENDY, sit on
text: his bumper, chatting.
speaker_heading: DEACON (CONT'D)
dialog: You see? That's exactly what I'm talking
dialog: about. That could be us.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: That's not going to be us this year, or
dialog: next year, or any year, ever.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Why not? All we have to do is follow the
dialog: simple lessons of Tony Montana in "Scar
dialog: Face."
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Ooh. Good movie.
speaker_heading: DEACON AND MATT
dialog: (with Cuban accents)
dialog: "First you get the money, then you get
dialog: the power, then you get the women."
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: So, we're going to become Cuban drug
dialog: lords?
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 10.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Listen, the porno pirating operation is
dialog: bringing in plenty of money. When I get
dialog: my new car tonight for my birthday, we'll
dialog: have the power to go wherever we want.
dialog: Then, there's nothing stopping us from
dialog: getting the girls.
text: Fred and Matt look at Deacon warily. Is this a plan? Then,
text: the hot girls and Jake drive past the guys.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Bye, Sphincter!
text: They laugh, then peel out with the radio blasting.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Nothing's going to change, Deacon. You're
dialog: still going to be the kid who shit his
dialog: pants in fifth grade and no one will ever
dialog: let you forget it.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: I had a stomach virus, asshole.
text: Just then, a super hot CHEERLEADER drops her car keys and
text: bends over to pick them up.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Oh, that's just not fair.
text: Fred adjusts himself.
speaker_heading: 17 OMITTED 17
scene_heading: 18 INT. VIDEO CASA DEL RUSS A.K.A. RUSS'S VIDEO MAGIC - DAY 18
text: Fred arrives dressed for work (name tag, shirt, etc.) and
text: waves to RUSS, the scraggly owner of this small video rental
dialog: store.
text: Fred passes J.T., Mark, Wendy, and Kelly and a bunch of other
text: CUSTOMERS on his way to the back section of the store.
speaker_heading: ADULT SECTION
text: Fred makes sure Russ isn't looking and ducks into the porno
text: section. Hurriedly, he pulls out "Half-Cyborg 5: Final
text: Showdown" from his book bag. But inside the case is the tape
text: for "Dirty Darla #7." He makes the switch. Fred sighs a
text: breath of relief, smiles, and walks out of the adult
dialog: section...
speaker_heading: MAIN AREA
dialog: ...right into...
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 11.
speaker_heading: RUSS
dialog: Gotcha!
text: Fred SCREAMS.
speaker_heading: RUSS (CONT'D)
dialog: I've been watching you.
text: Russ grabs Fred by the shoulders and throws him up against
text: the shelf, shaking him with every word.
speaker_heading: RUSS (CONT'D)
dialog: Those movies aren't for little monkey-
dialog: boys!
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Aaaaaahhhhhhhh!
text: The Customers stop to stare at the scene. Fred breaks free,
text: and Russ chases after him.
speaker_heading: RUSS
dialog: Come back here, you bastard!
text: Russ runs after him and DIVES at Fred's legs, knocking him
text: and entire shelf of tapes over. The tape FLY EVERYWHERE. Fred
text: is still SCREAMING.
text: Russ starts shouting at Fred so that everyone can hear. A
text: crowd gathers around to watch the spectacle.
speaker_heading: RUSS (CONT'D)
dialog: What else you got in here?
text: Russ rips open Fred's bag and pulls out items, looking for
text: more tapes. Fred tries to stop him, but the old man has an
text: iron grip and keeps him away.
text: Fred cringes as Russ exposes porno magazines, kleenex
text: tissues, baby wipes, the bottle of Moisty-Mate Firming
dialog: Lotion, Q-tips, women's sexy underwear, surgical gloves...
text: Wendy and Kelly are completely grossed out.
speaker_heading: RUSS (CONT'D)
dialog: (totally confused)
dialog: What's this for?
text: ...and a Barbie-type DOLL with a pullstring. Russ pulls it.
speaker_heading: DOLL
dialog: I'm Candy. Let's play dress-up.
text: The crowd is now seriously disturbed.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Dude.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 12.
text: Fred sits there, whimpering on the ground.
scene_heading: 19 EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY 19
text: Deacon drives the DMV Tester Car under the watchful eye of
text: the DMV TESTER.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: And I signal exactly two hundred feet
dialog: before the turn. Rule 108-1.
text: The unimpressed Tester remains expressionless.
speaker_heading: DMV TESTER
dialog: Great. Now after the right, I want you to
text: parallel park in the open space.
text: Deacon complies.
speaker_heading: DEACON
text: I begin the parallel parking maneuver by
text: pulling within three feet of the forward
text: vehicle. I now shift into reverse while
dialog: turning the wheel two revolutions
dialog: clockwise...
text: The Tester rubs his brow.
scene_heading: 20 INT. DMV - DAY 20
speaker_heading: FLASH!
text: Deacon's picture is taken. He passed.
speaker_heading: 21 OMITTED 21
scene_heading: 22 INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - DAY 22
text: It's dark, but suddenly the lights come on.
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: Surprise!
text: Deacon pretends to be surprised.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Wow. This is great.
text: The room is sparsely populated with a few of Deacon's
text: RELATIVES, his MOM and DAD, younger brother MAX (14), and
text: ROGER, a wheelchair-bound nerd with a face full of
text: orthodontic headgear and braces.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Were you surprised?
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 13.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Really. I was.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Happy birthday, Deacon. It's Lois Lane
dialog: #2. Be careful. It's still in the
text: wrapper.
text: He hands Deacon a comic book, still in the plastic bag.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Thanks.
scene_heading: 23 INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - LATER 23
text: Half-eaten cake and ice cream, unwrapped presents. Matt
text: videotapes the event.
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: Are you ready for the big present?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: (laying it on thick)
dialog: You mean there's more?
text: Deacon can hardly contain his excitement.
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: It's in the garage. Come with us.
text: He follows them, looking back knowingly at Fred and Matt.
scene_heading: 24 INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 24
text: The door opens, the lights come on, and Deacon's face drops.
text: No new car. Instead, several large wrapped boxes. Deacon
text: halfheartedly rips open the paper.
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: It's a new computer system. You've been
dialog: talking about it for months.
text: But his Mom can see his expression.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: What? That's not what you wanted?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: No, it is. It's just--
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 14.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I'll take it.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: Max!
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: We can exchange it if it's not the right
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: No, I just thought-- I thought you guys
dialog: were buying me that car I wanted.
text: Max snickers.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: A car? Why do you need a car?
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: You can ask permission to use our car
dialog: whenever you want, champ.
text: They put their arms around Deacon and smile warmly. Deacon
text: looks over at his parents' Aerostar Minivan. Everyone moves
text: back into the house, except Deacon's parents, who linger.
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I told you he didn't want a new computer.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: Like you know what anyone in this house
dialog: really wants.
scene_heading: 25 INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 25
text: The guys set up the computer. Deacon is really depressed.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Now what are we going to do?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: At least you got this great party.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Actually, we were expecting a lot more
dialog: people.
text: Fred elbows him.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: You invited more people?
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 15.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Well, we did send out flyers to like
text: three hundred people from school.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: And no one showed up?
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: I did.
text: Deacon looks back at Roger.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Great.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Uh, guys. No one showed up because
text: they're all at Tom Cooperman's house.
text: He's having a keg party.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: What? Why didn't I hear about this? That
dialog: shit's not right.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: I heard it from Rahim. He beamed me the
text: 411 in study hall.
text: A beat. Deacon's anger turns to action.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Let's go.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Yeah. Tom Cooperman kicked me in the
dialog: balls in third grade, and I swear there
dialog: is still a footprint on my nutsack.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Come on, guys. Can I just get one thing
dialog: that I ask for on my goddamn birthday?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: He's got a point.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Fine. Watch your balls.

scene_heading: 25B INT. COOP'S HOUSE - NIGHT 25B
text: CLOSE ON a set of feet, stomping on a Sony D.D.R. mat.
text: REVEAL TOM COOPERMAN dancing up a storm, in a heated
text: competition against several challengers. The CROWD goes wild
text: at Coop's moves.
text: The DOORBELL RINGS.
text: Continuing his dance steps, Coop moves to the door.
scene_heading: 26 EXT. COOP'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT 26
text: Deacon, Fred, and Matt stand on the porch, waiting. The door
text: opens, and we see Coop dancing all the way to the front door.
speaker_heading: COOP
dialog: (ad lib)
dialog: Grommets!
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Hey, Coop. Can we come in?
text: Coop un-pockets a tiny piece of paper with a thousand names
text: on it. He examines it for a long time.
speaker_heading: COOP
dialog: Sorry, son, that dog won't hunt. Y'all
dialog: ain't on the list.
text: He goes to close the door. Deacon stops it with his foot.
text: Fred flinches.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Coop. It's my birthday today, so cut me
dialog: some slack, all right?
text: Coop looks him over, then opens the door.
speaker_heading: COOP
dialog: (ad lib)
dialog: Well, pickle my turnips, why didn't you
dialog: say so? Happy birthday, friend.
text: The guys look at each other, excited. They look back at

speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Little help?
scene_heading: 27 INT. COOP'S HOUSE - NIGHT 27
text: People drinking, dancing, couples making out. Girls
text: everywhere. And over near the keg is...
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 17.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: (in a trance)
dialog: Oh, my God. There's Naomi.
speaker_heading: FRED
text: She looks good.
text: And there's NAOMI, every teenage boy's fantasy, wearing a hot
text: party dress and drinking a cup of beer. Someone lightly bumps
dialog: her...
text: CLOSE ON her lips as the beer dribbles down her chin, and the
text: world goes still .
text: She playfully wipes the beer off her moistened lips and chin
text: with the back of her hand. She turns her head and her hair
text: floats in the air.
speaker_heading: DEACON AND FRED
text: are zombies, completely mesmerized by her.
speaker_heading: FRED
text: She spilled her beer.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Yeah.
text: Fred adjusts his pants. Deacon makes a decision. One that
dialog: he'd normally never make.
speaker_heading: DEACON (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm gonna go talk to her. What have I got
dialog: to lose?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Your dignity?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: She's Rachael's friend. It's not like I
dialog: don't know her.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Ask her if she has any unusual hats.
dialog: Girls like that.
text: Deacon gives Matt a dirty look.
speaker_heading: THE KEG AREA
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Hey, Naomi.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Happy Birthday, Deacon.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 18.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: (pleasantly surprised)
dialog: You remembered.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Well, I got this flyer and--
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Oh, right. So where's Jake?
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Like I care.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: (hopeful)
dialog: So you two aren't going out any more?
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Duh.
text: Deacon's mind is racing with possibilities when:
speaker_heading: JAKE (O.S.)
dialog: Freakin!
text: It's Jake, back for another beer.
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, did you hear about Rachael Unger?
text: Before Deacon can answer...
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: He shoots, he misses, right, ass-
dialog: sphincter? Come on, Naomi. We're going in
dialog: the pool.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Screw off. I'm talking to Deacon.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Whatever.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Whatever.
text: Jake gives Deacon a dirty look, nods a "let's go" to J.T. and
text: Mark, and heads out back.
speaker_heading: NAOMI (CONT'D)
dialog: What an asshole.
text: As soon as Jake is out of sight, Deacon turns back to Naomi,
text: but she's already gone, stranding Deacon. What just happened
dialog: here?
text: REVEAL Matt helping Roger drink a beer in the background.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 19.
scene_heading: 28 EXT. COOP'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - LATER 28
text: Deacon wanders out back. It's very dark and there are several
text: people in the pool, including Jake's good-looking friends,
text: Kelly, Wendy, J.T., and MARK. It's hard to tell in the dark
text: water, but it looks like they might not be wearing any
text: clothes. Deacon sees this and starts to walk away.
dialog: J.T.
dialog: Deacon. I heard it was your birthday.
dialog: Come on in the pool, man.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: No, that's okay.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No, seriously. It's cool.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (come hither)
dialog: Come on, Deacon.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Yeah. Come on.
text: Deacon thinks about it. He takes the metaphorical plunge.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: All right.
text: He slips off his shoes and takes off his shirt. He walks over
text: to the shallow end. Deacon steps in with his shorts still on.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Dude, what are you doing? Take off your
dialog: clothes.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: We're skinny dipping, Deacon.
text: He hesitates, not sure what to do.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Oh. Okay. Sorry, I'll just leave you guys
dialog: alone then--
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: --No, come on in. Join us.
text: Wendy swims into J.T.'s arms. Her shoulders rise above the
text: water and you can just make out the top of her breast.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 20.
speaker_heading: DEACON
text: looks at her, thinks it over, and finally... slips off his
text: shorts. He gets into the pool in his underwear, then slips
text: them off, too, and throws them on the side of pool.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Wow. This feels amazing.
text: Someone splashes Kelly, she giggles, and the other kids swim
text: around. Kelly swims by Deacon seductively and he smiles.
speaker_heading: JAKE (O.S.)
dialog: Coop's doing funnels. Come on.
text: It's Jake, by the side of the pool with Deacon's clothes. The
text: other people swim to the front, and get out of the pool...
text: ...wearing clothes! Even Wendy, in a strapless bra.
dialog: J.T.
dialog: (rubbing it in)
dialog: Sorry, dude.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Hey, give me back my clothes!
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Freakin? I can't see you. Maybe I need to
text: turn on the LIGHTS.
text: And he does. The backyard lights go on illuminating the
text: scene. Deacon panics. People start looking at him, laughing.
text: Then, the cheesy colored pool lights come on, flashing
dialog: slowly.
text: Deacon is humiliated. Jake bends down to whisper to Deacon.
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you really think Naomi was into you?
text: Deacon doesn't respond. But it's not enough for Jake. He
text: picks up Deacon's underwear with a stick and examines them.
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my God! Skid marks. Aaaahhh, Deacon
dialog: shit his pants again!
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: No, I didn't! Give them back!
text: Jake does a victory lap around the pool with Deacon's
text: underwear on the stick. Everybody is laughing.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Sphincter boy shit his pants!
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 21.
scene_heading: 28A INT. COOP'S HOUSE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 28A
text: Jake locks the sliding glass door and waves at Deacon in the
text: pool. The group laughs and walks away.
scene_heading: 29 EXT. COOP'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - LATER 29
text: Deacon is still in the pool, shivering and shrivelled.
text: Finally, the lights turn off in the back yard, and Deacon
text: ventures out of the pool.
text: He grabs an inflatable elephant pool toy and slips it around
text: his privates. He slowly sneaks around the house.
scene_heading: 29A EXT. COOP'S HOUSE - SIDE OF THE HOUSE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 29A
text: A dog BARKS! He snarls at Deacon standing there wearing only
text: the pool toy. Deacon runs away into the
scene_heading: 29B EXT. COOP'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 29B
text: The Dog is right behind him. Deacon struggles with him.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Hey, watch the nads!
text: But it's no use. The dog BITES the front of the pool toy and
text: it starts to deflate...
text: ... just as the HEADLIGHTS of a car pull into the driveway.
text: Deacon FREEZES. He desperately tries to cover himself with
text: the rapidly diminishing toy being jerked away by the dog in a
text: motion that makes it look like Deacon's getting a doggie
text: hummer. A MAN gets out of the car.
speaker_heading: COOP'S DAD
dialog: What the hell kind of sick shit is this?
scene_heading: 30 EXT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY 30
text: The next day, the guys are at the bike rack, when a hot
text: SPORTS CAR drives by. Deacon is visibly bummed.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: You know how long it's going to take to
dialog: save up for a car selling porno tapes
dialog: twenty bucks a pop?
text: Fred looks down.
speaker_heading: DEACON (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: There's a small problem.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 22.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: I got fired yesterday. Russ caught me and
dialog: went berserk. Some sort of sting
dialog: operation he's been planning for months.
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: You're kidding me, right? Tell me you're
dialog: kidding.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: No. And now I have to work twice a week
dialog: at my dad's office. I told you this
dialog: Scarface plan was stupid.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Great. So now we've got no girls, no car,
dialog: and no money.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: And no porn.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Tony Montana would be very disappointed.
text: Deacon is once again...
scene_heading: 31 INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY 31
text: ... very depressed, as he sits, bored out of his mind in his
dialog: biology class.
scene_heading: BIOLOGY TEACHER
dialog: Now turn your textbooks to chapter six,
dialog: the Animal Kingdom. As you should know by
dialog: now, biology is the study of life, in all
dialog: its infinite varieties.
text: Deacon continues to stare at her perpetually hard nipples.
speaker_heading: BIOLOGY TEACHER (CONT'D)
dialog: So to keep things a little fun around
dialog: here, tomorrow we're taking a field trip
dialog: to the zoo.
text: Deacon buries his head in his hands.
scene_heading: 32 EXT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY 32
text: Deacon is talking to the Dorky Freshman near the bike rack.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 23.
speaker_heading: DORKY FRESHMAN
dialog: Is this some kind of extortion racket?
dialog: I'll pay you double if you can get me
dialog: something today.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: I'm sorry. There's nothing we can do for
dialog: a while. We don't have anything new.
speaker_heading: DORKY FRESHMAN
dialog: I'm dying. I just need something.
text: Just then, Naomi walks by on her way to the parking lot.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Hey, Naomi. What are you up to?
speaker_heading: NAOMI
text: Going home to cram for midterms.
text: With a look, Deacon shoos away the freshman dork.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Oh. I could help you. I mean, if you
dialog: needed any help.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: That's okay. I'll be all right.
text: Deacon searches for something meaningful to say, desperate
text: not to let the moment pass him by. Naomi cuts him some slack
dialog: by asking,
speaker_heading: NAOMI (CONT'D)
dialog: So where did Rachael go off to?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: She went to Paris with the French Club.
dialog: (then, taking a chance)
dialog: We're seeing other people.
text: She laughs at his attempt at being nonchalant. But she's
text: laughing with him, not at him, and Deacon can tell the
dialog: difference. He relaxes...
speaker_heading: JAKE (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, sphincter.
text: ... just as Jake drives up to them. Deacon is starting to
text: really get pissed at Jake ruining the moment with Naomi.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Look, can you please stop calling me
dialog: that? I think we're old enough to just
dialog: let it go. All right?
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 24.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Oh, sure. Sorry about that... Shit-pants.
text: He looks at Naomi.
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hi, Naomi.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Whatever.
text: She turns her back to Jake and his smile fades. He revs the
text: engine and peels out BACKWARDS. Deacon jumps out of the way,
text: but his bike is CRUSHED by the car.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Oops. Sorry.
text: He shifts gears and drives over the bike again. He laughs as
text: he drives away. Naomi gives Deacon a pitying look and walks
text: away. The moment is gone. Now Deacon is...
scene_heading: 33 INT. AEROSTAR - DAY 33
text: ... pissed. His crushed bike is in the back seat.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: (emphatic)
dialog: Look, mom. I need a car.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: But I thought we agreed--
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: I need a car of my own.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: Well, honey. A car is a lot of
dialog: responsibility.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Jesus, Mom. I'm seventeen now. I think I
dialog: can handle it.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: Well, it's also a lot of money. I'll tell
dialog: you what. Maybe you can get an after
dialog: school job to earn money for a car. I'll
dialog: talk to your father.

scene_heading: 36 EXT. ZOO - DAY 36
text: A crowd of people (including Deacon's biology class) are
text: watching something in the monkey cage.
scene_heading: BIOLOGY TEACHER
dialog: People! People! Come quickly. Witness the
dialog: miracle of nature at its most primal.
text: She's videotaping it, and Deacon looks up AT HER VIDEO
text: VIEWFINDER. It's a monkey orgy. Masturbation and fornication
dialog: everywhere.
speaker_heading: DEACON (V.O.)
dialog: And these monkeys are doing it. I mean,
dialog: they're going wild. And Miss Ariel is
text: videotaping it.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 26.
scene_heading: BIOLOGY TEACHER
dialog: (getting hot and bothered)
text: With one final thrust of his engorged
text: penis, the male deposits his seed and
text: moves on.
dialog: (suddenly bitter)
dialog: Probably to a younger, more desirable
dialog: female. One who doesn't have any
dialog: "issues." Whatever that means.
speaker_heading: DEACON (V.O.)
dialog: That's when it hit me.
text: Just then, a glob of "something" shoots out towards the crowd
text: (SFX). Everyone ducks, except for Roger, who's can't move
text: quickly enough in his wheelchair. It hits him in the face,
text: dripping down his orthodontia.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: A little help!
speaker_heading: DEACON (V.O.)
dialog: Well, Roger actually...
scene_heading: 37 INT. FRED'S BEDROOM - DAY 37
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Let's make one.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: One what?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: A movie.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Great! That's perfect! I've already got
dialog: an idea for a kind of sci-fi horror
dialog: thing. It's like "The Shining" meets "The
dialog: Jetsons."
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: No, you moron. A porno film.
text: Fred lights up.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Even better.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: And check this out. The best part of all,
dialog: is I've got an angle.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: What kind of angle?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: We can make pornos that cater to guys
dialog: like us.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: You mean virgins.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Yes. Adult films made by virgins for
dialog: virgins.
speaker_heading: MATT
text: With good cinematography.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: And cute, nice girls. The kind you'd want
dialog: to take to dinner with your parents.
speaker_heading: DEACON
text: Right. No shots of sweaty guys' faces.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: And nothing up the butt.
text: They look at him.
speaker_heading: FRED (CONT'D)
dialog: What? I don't like it when they put stuff
dialog: up their butt.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: These have to be nicely edited. We should
dialog: shoot on super 16 and transfer to video.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: No, Matt. We'll shoot it on your video
dialog: camera. We're not getting any expensive
dialog: equipment.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: How are we going to get the women to star
dialog: in the film?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: And the guys.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: I don't know. We'll surf the net. We'll
dialog: figure it out.
text: They look at each other for a beat. Finally, Fred and Matt
dialog: crack up.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 28.
speaker_heading: DEACON (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: That was really funny.
text: Deacon just looks at them, pissed.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: I'm serious about this.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: We can't make a porno movie.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Do you have any idea how much trouble
dialog: we'd get in?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Do you have any idea how much money we'd
dialog: make?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Like how much?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Enough for a car. Enough for more camera
dialog: shit. To take girls out. I don't know.
dialog: For whatever we want.
dialog: Beat. Beat. Beat. They're thinking about it.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: What about the moral implications?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: It's a free market transaction between
dialog: consenting adults. What's the problem?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: We're not adults.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: He's got a point, Deacon.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Guys, tell me the truth. Haven't you ever
dialog: wondered... haven't you ever imagined
dialog: what it would be like to make one?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Not really.
text: Deacon turns to Fred, who looks guilty.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 29.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Okay. Sure. I've thought about it. I've
dialog: thought about shaving Principal Taggert's
dialog: ass, too.
text: A look, then Deacon gets up to seal the deal.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Look. This is an opportunity we shouldn't
dialog: let slip away. If we make this movie, it
dialog: could be the best year of our lives.
dialog: We'll go in boys and come out men. And at
dialog: the end, we'll have the money, the power,
dialog: and the women. But you losers would
dialog: rather play it safe. Well, I'm not going
dialog: to waste another minute. I'm making this
dialog: porno movie with or without you. And when
dialog: I show up at school in my new set of
dialog: wheels, and you two limp dicks are
dialog: begging me for my sloppy seconds, I'll
dialog: just have to tell you, "Sorry, guys. That
dialog: ship has sailed. You blew it."
text: Ringing silence.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (sincerely)
dialog: That was a really good speech, Deacon.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Did you work that out before?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: No, Matt.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Okay... So say we were to do this. What
dialog: would we call our company?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I've got it. "After School Special."
text: They look at him. It's perfect.
scene_heading: 38 INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY 38
text: WE FOLLOW a WOMAN dressed in a Fredericks of Hollywood type
text: outfit, walking down the hallway past office suites; a
dialog: mortgage company, a dentist, etc...
text: She enters an office. As the door closes behind her, WE SEE
text: the sign on the door, "Ramalot Productions."
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 30.
scene_heading: 39 INT. VIC'S "STUDIO" - CONTINUOUS 39
text: A small, vertically integrated porno production company.
text: Blow-ups of the company's box covers on the walls, hundreds
text: of copies of titles on shelves, a small STAFF and two
dialog: adjoining rooms.
text: VIC RAMALOT, whose face we recognize from Dirty Darla #7,
text: enters from the set. His partner, MIKE, helps him on with his
dialog: robe.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That was good. Some good action.
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: I've got a question for you Mike, and I
dialog: want you to promise to be completely
dialog: honest.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Sure. Of course, Vic.
text: Vic looks at him, vulnerable.
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: Do you think I'm too fat?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Are you kidding? The camera loves you.
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: Seriously?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: Thanks, man.
text: Vic gives Mike a jive hand shake and the two do a little hug.
text: Over Mike's shoulder, Vic sees the woman who's come into the
dialog: office.
speaker_heading: VIC (CONT'D)
dialog: Darla, sweetheart. Ready for number
dialog: eight?
text: Darla drops her top and heads for the bathroom.
speaker_heading: DARLA
dialog: Sure, Vic, lemme freshen up first.
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: (to Mike)
dialog: Is he in there?
text: Mike nods, leading Vic through a door, into
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 31.
scene_heading: 40 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 40
text: where there's a terribly FRIGHTENED MAN (cameo for Ron
text: Jeremy, etc.) tied to a chair with a gag in his mouth.
text: Vic shakes his head, picking up a pair of rusty hedge
text: clippers from the table. He snaps them open.
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: So, you think you can just walk into my
dialog: town and move in on my territory?
text: The Man takes a quick look down at his own crotch, fearing
text: the worst. He shakes his head, pleading through his gag.
scene_heading: 41 INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY 41
text: The guys are huddled behind the frosted window of Fred's
text: dad's office, standing away from the RECEPTIONIST.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: We've got to have two forms of i.d. to
dialog: prove she's over eighteen.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: How much money do we need?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: A first time porno actress makes only two
dialog: fifty to five hundred bucks.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: That's it? Does that include the sex?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Yes, Matt.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: So how do we get women for this movie?
speaker_heading: FRED
text: We place an ad in the Cleveland X-Press
dialog: for "body models." That's like some sort
dialog: of code word in the industry.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Are we supposed to have sex with these
dialog: women?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: No, Matt.
text: A NURSE walks in.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Fred, your father wants you to take these
text: urine samples down to the lab.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 32.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Okay. In a minute.
text: Fred puts the samples down. She rolls her eyes then leaves.
speaker_heading: FRED (CONT'D)
dialog: We also need an adult signature to set up
text: the bank account and the web site.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Let's use Principal Taggert's name.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Oh yeah, good idea. That'll never come
dialog: back to haunt us.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Then whose name should we use?
text: Just then, MR. GREITZER comes into the office.
speaker_heading: GREITZER
dialog: I'm Ronald Greitzer here for my 4:00
dialog: appointment.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Okay, Mr. Greitzer. I'll let the doctor
dialog: know you're here for your...
dialog: (checks the book)
dialog: rectal exam. Have a seat.
text: He leaves and Fred looks at Deacon, mischievously.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Why not? It's perfect. My dad's got Mr.
dialog: Greitzer's signature on file, his credit
dialog: card number, and his social security
dialog: number...
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: And he'll never find out?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: It's not like we're going to send him our
dialog: annual report. It'll just be like an
dialog: official name of record or something.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Okay. Cool.
text: The Nurse returns.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 33.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: And take these fecal and semen samples,
dialog: too.
text: She hands Fred two more containers, and the guys exit.
scene_heading: 41A EXT. STREET - DAY 41A
text: The guys ride their bikes towards the lab to deliver the
dialog: samples.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: And we need porno names.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: It's a basic rule of porno. All people
dialog: affiliated with the production of an
dialog: adult film have porno names so their
text: friends don't recognize them.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Oh, you mean like "Johnny Hardmember"?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Exactly. That's a good one. I'll be Balls
dialog: McLongcock.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Ooh, I like it.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Guys. Those kind of names are just for
dialog: the actors.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You're just jealous that you don't have a
dialog: cool porno name like us.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Okay, fine. Then I'm Sam ...
dialog: (searching)
dialog: Slam. Sam Slam. The Back Door Man.
text: Matt and Fred look at each other, then Deacon.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: That name sucks.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: You don't get it, do you? A porno name
dialog: needs to be a very subtle thing.
text: Fred gestures and DROPS the samples which SPLATTER all over
dialog: the ground.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 34.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Sorry, Balls. I guess I'm still new at
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Matt, pick that up.

speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: And I'm telling the guy, he's got to use
dialog: form ND-45 for a third-party beneficiary,
dialog: but Johnson's gotta be the big man.
dialog: "We've been using ND-90 for twenty-two
dialog: years." But Johnson's an idiot. He
dialog: doesn't know ND-90 doesn't even exist
dialog: anymore.
text: Mom yawns. The phone rings and she gets it.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: Hello?
dialog: (covers phone)
dialog: Deacon, it's for you. It's a young lady
dialog: named Palomina.
text: Deacon CHOKES on his food. He gets up quickly and grabs the
text: phone. Max is eyeballing him, so Deacon walks with the phone
text: into the other room and talks softly.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Yeah. 345 Remson. That's right. Great.
dialog: Wednesday, three to five. Looking forward
dialog: to working with you, too.
text: He hangs up and returns to the kitchen to see the whole

speaker_heading: DEACON (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm tutoring someone ... in math. To earn

speaker_heading: JUMP CUT TO:
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 35.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Sure, you can bring your dog.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Oh. No, that's okay. Better leave him
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT TO:
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Thanks. You sound sexy, too.
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT TO:
text: The guys are getting excited.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: I can't believe this is working.
scene_heading: 44 INT. BASEMENT SET - OTHER ROOM - DAY 44
text: And there's Matt, wearing a shirt and tie, nervously sitting
text: in the rec room with a room full of CRACK WHORES.
text: They're a motley crew of fat, old, toothless, spandex-wearing
text: streetwalkers (including one TRANSVESTITE).
text: An uncomfortable silence pervades the room. Matt turns to one
text: woman wearing a rainbow-colored halter top.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: When you have sex with a strange man, do
dialog: you imagine it's like your boyfriend or
dialog: something?
text: She just looks at him.
speaker_heading: DEACON (O.S.)
dialog: (over a walkie talkie)
dialog: We're ready. Over.
text: Matt picks up his walkie talkie.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Roger. Over.
text: He looks at his clipboard and turns to the first woman.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: You can go in now.
text: She gets up and walks through the curtain.
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 36.
scene_heading: 45 INT. DEACON'S BASEMENT - DAY 45
text: The basement is set up with a casting couch. Fred and Deacon
text: are also dressed in jackets and ties. The Crack Whore makes
text: her way over to them. They stare at her, slackjawed.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Take a seat please.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Hi, I'm Balls McLongcock and this is Sam
dialog: Slam.
speaker_heading: CRACK WHORE
dialog: Tequila. You boys seem kind of young.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Don't worry. We're old enough.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Tequila. Nice name. So, have you done any
dialog: films before?
speaker_heading: CRACK WHORE
dialog: I been in some home movies. Stuff like
dialog: that. Some pictures.
text: She tosses a stack of Polaroids at them. The top one has her
text: standing next to a horse. Fred is speechless.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Okay, then. I think we have what we need.
dialog: We'll call you.
text: She's confused.
speaker_heading: CRACK WHORE
dialog: So you don't want me to suck you two off?
text: They look at each other.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: No, I don't think that will be necessary
dialog: at this time.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Maybe later.
scene_heading: 46 INT. DEACON'S BASEMENT - LATER 46
text: The whores are gone.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Maybe if we put another ad in and say
dialog: we're only looking for good looking
dialog: models.
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 37.
text: They look at him with disdain.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: There's got to be another way to recruit
dialog: porno actresses.
scene_heading: 47 INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 47
speaker_heading: FLASH!
text: Three digital images of the guys are lined up on Deacon's
dialog: computer monitor (thanks Mom and Dad!). Deacon is digitally
text: altering the photo of Fred to give him a goatee. Matt's photo
text: has already gotten mutton chops and Deacon's looking sweet
dialog: with a fu-manchu.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: I say we make them from Hawaii.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Hawaii?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: It's perfect. Do you know what a Hawaii
dialog: driver's license looks like?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: But isn't it going to seem a little
dialog: suspicious? Like why are we in Cleveland?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Vacation. People from Cleveland vacation
dialog: in Hawaii, where do you think people from
dialog: Hawaii go?
text: Matt and Fred look at each other. They shrug, then,
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Aloha.
scene_heading: 48 INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT 48
text: The next night. The three guys walk downstairs dressed in
text: Hawaiian shirts. Deacon's parents are reading and Max is
dialog: watching TV.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Hey, mom. Can I borrow the car?
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: I have to go to the video store later.
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 38.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: But, mom. You said I could use the car,
dialog: but it's never free.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: All right, Deacon. I'll walk to the
dialog: store.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Where are you guys going?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Out.
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: Why are you boys dressed like Don Ho?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: This is the new style, Mr. Lewis.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah, for ass-wranglers.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: Max!
scene_heading: 49 INT. AEROSTAR - NIGHT 49
text: Inside the car (still in the garage), the three guys apply
text: their fake facial hair to match their three new fake i.d.'s.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Are we really going to do this?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Oh, yeah.
text: He starts the ignition, and an EASY LISTENING tune blasts on
text: the radio, ruining the moment. The guys look at each other
text: for a beat, then Deacon quickly changes the station to a
text: ROCKING SONG, and get back into the mood for adventure.
speaker_heading: DEACON (CONT'D)
dialog: (once again)
dialog: Oh, yeah.
text: They pull out and drive off.
scene_heading: 49A EXT. CLEVELAND - NIGHT 49A
text: The minivan descends out of the suburbs into the lights of

scene_heading: 50 EXT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - NIGHT 50
text: CLOSE ON the Aerostar's bumper sticker: "My child is on the
dialog: honor roll at William Wall High School."
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 39.
text: The guys step out of the car and see for the first time the
text: Holy Grail of boyhood fantasies: the neon outline of a
text: topless woman at the entrance to this upscale strip club.
text: They stop and stare for a beat, before finally getting up the
text: nerve to walk up to a menacing BOUNCER sitting on a stool
text: outside the entrance, reading "The Princess Diaries."
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: I.d.'s.
text: They confidently pull out the i.d.'s and hand them over.
speaker_heading: BOUNCER (CONT'D)
dialog: Richard Runningbear from Hawaii? What
dialog: brings you guys to Cleveland?
speaker_heading: FRED MATT
dialog: Business. Vacation.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: We're on business, he's on vacation.
text: He hands the i.d.'s back.
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: Well, "tiki-alohi-noa-lohi."
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Sorry?
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: That's Hawaiian for "welcome."
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Right. Of course. We just moved to Hawaii
dialog: a few months ago. Haven't picked up the
dialog: local lingo yet.
text: They force smiles and wait for the answer...
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: Okay. Have a good time, guys.
text: Deacon grabs the i.d.'s and pushes the other two forward. He
text: grabs the handle to the door.
speaker_heading: BOUNCER (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, and guys.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Nice lamination job.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Thanks!
text: The Bouncer closes the door on them. Busted.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 40.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Look. We have to get into this strip bar.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: The next two years of high school depend
dialog: on it.
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: How old are you guys?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Twenty-seven.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Thirty-five.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Sixteen.
text: Fred smacks him.
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: Sorry, guys.
dialog: Then,
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: We've got money.
text: Deacon pulls out a wad of cash. The Bouncer looks around,
text: then thinks about it for a second.
scene_heading: 51 INT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - NIGHT 51
text: WE TRACK the guys as they slowly move down the dark corridor
text: towards the light. Each guy is in his own little world, Matt
text: and Fred following Deacon as he takes the first nervous
dialog: steps.
text: First the neon lights hit them, then the smell of liquor and
text: sweat, the sounds of barroom chatter, and finally the
text: grinding blast of MUSIC, so powerful it seems to stop them in
text: their tracks. Their eyes bug out.
text: SCANTILY-CLAD WAITRESS walking by. As they move further into
text: the club, they see actual STRIPPERS soliciting lap dances and
text: some TOPLESS DANCERS onstage. Fred smiles ear to ear.
text: The guys are locked in a deep primordial trance, broken only
text: by the voice of a COCKTAIL WAITRESS.
scene_heading: COCKTAIL WAITRESS
dialog: What'll you boys have? Two drink minimum.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Huh? Oh. I'll have a scotch. Straight up.
text: On the rocks.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 41.
text: She looks at him like he's an idiot.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I'll have a seven and seven.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Uh, same.
text: She leaves.
speaker_heading: DEACON (CONT'D)
dialog: What's a seven and seven?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I don't know. But I heard that guy over
dialog: there order one and I like the way it
text: sounds. Numerical.
text: The Waitress comes back with their drinks. He pays her and
text: then they raise their glasses.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: To After School Special.
speaker_heading: MATT AND FRED
dialog: To After School Special.
text: They drink. And CHOKE.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It tastes like poison.
text: A beautiful STRIPPER in an American flag bikini approaches.
speaker_heading: AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER
dialog: Are you boys interested in a dance?
text: They look at each other.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Okay?
text: She takes Fred's hand and walks him over to a private dance
text: couch. As the next SONG starts, a curtain lowers around Fred
text: and the Stripper. Fred is a little freaked out.
speaker_heading: IN SILHOUETTE
text: She strips off her top revealing her big American breasts.
text: She rubs up and down Fred's body, shaking her hair in his
text: face. Matt and Deacon watch intently.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Cool.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 42.
text: The song ends, the curtain comes up, and Fred is smiling ear
text: to ear. The Stripper gets dressed and Fred pays her.
speaker_heading: AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER
dialog: You want another dance?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Uh, not right now, thank you. I have to
dialog: go to the bathroom.
text: He tries to get up, but the Stripper stop him.
speaker_heading: AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER
dialog: Well how about you buy me a drink?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Okay.
text: She sits down on Fred's lap. Right on his boner.
speaker_heading: FRED (CONT'D)
dialog: Uhhhhh.
speaker_heading: AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER
dialog: (to the waitress)
dialog: Seven and seven.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You want mine?
text: She laughs.
speaker_heading: AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER
dialog: So what brings you boys to the Pretty
dialog: Kitty?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: We're from Hawaii.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Actually, we're filmmakers. We're here
dialog: looking for new talent.
speaker_heading: AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Yeah, we're looking for some beautiful
dialog: ladies looking to break into film. You
dialog: interested?
speaker_heading: AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER
dialog: No.
text: They look defeated.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 43.
speaker_heading: AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER (CONT'D)
dialog: But I know someone who is.
text: A beat, then time stands still once more for our heroes as
text: ASHLEY makes her entrance. She looks barely legal, dressed in
text: a Catholic school girl outfit, and walks up to them.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Hi, I'm Ashley. You guys are filmmakers?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Video actually. They won't let me shoot
dialog: on film.
text: Deacon pulls out his wad of cash.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Look. We're paying top dollar, hetero
dialog: only, no anal, and we're distributing
dialog: through our web site.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Aren't you kind of young?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Aren't you? You know we're going to need
dialog: two forms of i.d. to prove you're over
dialog: eighteen.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I'm eighteen. Don't worry.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Then you're hired.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Shouldn't we audition her first?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Don't worry. You guys relax and have a
text: few drinks. By the time the night's over,
dialog: you'll know I'm your girl.
scene_heading: STRIP CLUB MONTAGE:
scene_heading: 51A INT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - NIGHT 51A
text: - Ashley slinks through the fog onstage and works the pole
dialog: like good girl should: gentle but firm.
text: - Various other Strippers (a Swedish stripper named PLANTAIN,
text: the American Flag Stripper, a BLACK STRIPPER, and an EXOTIC
text: STRIPPER) give the three guys lap dances, dance on the
text: carousel, and generally suck up to them.
text: - The guys are pounding drinks like there's no tomorrow.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 44.
text: - Fred is nuzzling between Plantain's assets.
text: - Deacon licks the Exotic Stripper's salty neck and downs a

text: - The three guys are all on the bar now, doing a
text: choreographed dance routine, and stripping to their
dialog: underwear.
scene_heading: 51B EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT 51B
text: - CLOSE ON a trashcan, the guys are throwing up. PULL BACK TO

scene_heading: 51C EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - VARIOUS BOOTHS - NIGHT 51C

scene_heading: 51D EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - FUDGE FACTORY - NIGHT 51D
text: - The group is crammed into a booth at the Fudge Factory,

scene_heading: 51E EXT. DEACON'S HOUSE - DAWN 51E
text: - Ashley is dropping the guys off back at Deacon's house in
text: the Aerostar. She writes down her information on a picture of

scene_heading: 52 INT. VIC'S "STUDIO" - DAY 52
text: A LADY dressed in sexy clothes and eating chicken wings from
text: a huge bucket is waiting around on the set, but Vic is over
text: talking to Mike.
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: Someone's been recruiting new talent.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Jimmy Rimmer says they're from Hawaii.
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: Why the hell would someone from Hawaii
dialog: come to Cleveland?
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 45.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Vacation? There's the Rock and Roll Hall
dialog: of Fame.
text: Vic thinks it over.
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: That's true.
text: Vic regains his train of thought.
speaker_heading: VIC (CONT'D)
dialog: What is this? "F" with Vic month? If any
dialog: more amateurs start moving in on my
dialog: territory, I'm going to get really mad.
text: Vic opens the drawer and pulls out a GUN. He cocks it
text: menacingly.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Who you gonna shoot?
text: Vic's bluff has been called. Reluctantly,
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Calm down, Vic. I don't need you all
dialog: agitated. You still got five films to
dialog: star in today.
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: You're right, Mikey.
text: Mike takes the gun from Vic and puts it away.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Don't worry. I'll find these guys and
dialog: take care of it.
text: Vic cheers up a bit.
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: You hungry?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah, I could eat.
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: Grab some lunch?
speaker_heading: MIKE

scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 46.
scene_heading: 53 INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - DAY 53
text: Deacon wakes up sick as a dog. All the shades are drawn, but
text: Fred and Matt are already hard at work on the computer. They
text: seem completely fine, with no signs of Deacon's hangover.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: What are you guys doing?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: We came up with a great idea. We're going
dialog: to presell the videos by posting the
text: scripts on the website.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Will that work?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I don't know. But it's kind of fun. We
dialog: just wrote this whole thing about the
text: girls' locker room.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: One thing, though. If our motto is "by
dialog: virgins, for virgins," I was thinking we
dialog: should put a picture of one of us on the
dialog: web site to sort of sell the image.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You're not putting my picture up there.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: It doesn't really have to be one of us,
dialog: though, does it?
text: He grabs the yearbook.
speaker_heading: INSERT:
text: ROGER'S FACE, as Balls McLongcock, proudly displayed on the
text: web site, hawking the first feature film (coming soon) of
dialog: After School Special with the motto, "By Virgins, For
dialog: Virgins."
text: A quick knock on the door and Deacon's Mom comes in.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: Deacon, look who's here. Your friend,
dialog: Jake.
text: Jake enters, all smiles.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Hi, guys.
text: Fred quickly shuts off the monitor.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 47.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: You kids have fun.
dialog: And she leaves.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What the hell's going on, Sphincter?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I saw the strippers. And some crack whore
dialog: named Saffron came over my house the
dialog: other day looking for you guys.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: We don't know what you're talking about.
text: Jake takes some pages off the printer.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What's this? "Oh, my God. There's a boy
text: at the door looking at us naked in the
dialog: shower."
text: He flips a page.
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: "The A/V Club Secretary lathers all of
text: their glistening bodies. 'I'm so dirty,'
dialog: she moans." What the hell kind of crap is
dialog: this? Are you guys running a whorehouse
dialog: or something?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Are you crazy?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: They're not whores if we film them, you
dialog: moron.
text: Deacon can't believe Matt just blew it. Fred smacks him.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You retards are making a porno movie?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: You can't prove anything.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Who's the girl?
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 48.
speaker_heading: MATT
text: A stripper. Her name's Ashley.
text: He pulls out Ashley's picture from his manila folder. Jake
text: checks it out. His eyes go wide and suddenly he's their new
dialog: best friend.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Who's the guy?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, maybe I could do it.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: No, that's not a good idea.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: It's a lot harder than it looks.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You don't think I can do it? Trust me,
dialog: I've nailed enough girls.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Forget it.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Look, you little butt munch. I want to do
dialog: this, and if you don't let me, I'll go
dialog: and tell your mommy what kind of sick
dialog: shit you're doing.
text: Jake looks him over.
scene_heading: 54 INT. BASEMENT SET AS "YEARBOOK OFFICE" - DAY 54
scene_heading: DARKNESS.
text: Click. The lights come on. The big day has come at last. The
text: guys are nervously conferring on one side of the room, far
text: away from Ashley, who's standing alone, dressed in a
text: conservative high school girl's outfit.
text: The basement has been transformed into the guys' idea of a
text: movie set, complete with lights, camera, tripod, and sound
text: equipment. A desk and decoration make the room look roughly
text: like the high school yearbook offices.
text: Deacon gives Matt a little shove, and Matt takes a long walk
dialog: over to Ashley.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 49.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: So, um, I'll be directing.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Okay. So I want you to play this very
text: understated. It's a very visceral scene,
dialog: so it's important not to play it too over
dialog: the top.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Uh huh.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Hey, did you guys shave or something?
text: Deacon looks at the other two, all three now beardless.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Okay. I think we're ready here.
text: Fred awkwardly picks up the boom and puts his earphones on.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Boom in position.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: What?
text: Deacon pushes him over to position.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Ashley, get into position.
text: Matt gets behind the camera. They whisper conspiratorially.
text: One last reality check before they take the leap.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Are we actually going to do this?
text: They look over at Ashley. She's waiting.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: I guess so.
text: They return to position.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: So, um, we're starting with the
dialog: masturbation and then Phillip, the
dialog: yearbook editor, is going to surprise
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Okay.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 50.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: And ... action.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: (wooden)
dialog: These yearbook photos of the Debate Club
dialog: are making me so hot. I can't help
dialog: myself.
text: THROUGH MATT'S VIDEO DISPLAY, Ashley slowly strips off her
dialog: clothes. But before we get too good a look, we
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: FRED smiles ear to ear.
text: DEACON gulps.
text: MATT peers out from behind the camera.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY (O.S.)
dialog: I hope no one catches me because I forgot
dialog: to lock the door. Oh, yeah. Oh, God,
dialog: yeah.
text: FRED's smile turns into nervous ogling.
text: DEACON crosses his legs and adjusts his shorts.
text: MATT wipes a bead of sweat from his brow.
dialog: Deacon whispers,
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Close up.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Close up.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Oh yeah. Right.
text: And Matt zooms in. Ashley continues moaning and as Matt gets
text: closer, the camera starts shaking. He can't keep his hands
dialog: steady.
scene_heading: 54A THROUGH MATT'S VIDEO DISPLAY 54A
dialog: We'd love to get a look, but the camera is shaking so much,
dialog: it's just a BLUR.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 51.
speaker_heading: 54B REVERSE ANGLE 54B
speaker_heading: ASHLEY (O.S.)
dialog: Oh! Oh! Oh!
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Okay, CUT!
text: She turns off her performance like a light switch.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: What? Did I so something wrong?
text: Matt is quivering.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Uh, no. You were great. I think I've got
dialog: what I need there. I want to set up for
dialog: Jake.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: I need a bathroom break.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Not now, Fred. Jake.
text: Jake comes out of the bathroom dressed as the yearbook
dialog: editor.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Action.
text: Jake opens a makeshift door to the office.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (wooden)
dialog: Oh, my God. What are you doing?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I couldn't help myself. Please don't tell
dialog: the principal.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Give me one good reason why I shouldn't.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Cut. Perfect. Okay, then. Let's get to
dialog: the, uh, sexual material.
text: Jake pulls off his pants and starts to look a little nervous.
text: He stands in the corner, trying to psyche himself up.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Jake, you okay?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Sure. No problem.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 52.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: And ACTION!
text: But Jake is still standing there, not in the shot. He's
text: starting to sweat.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: Action, Jake.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Okay.
dialog: Still nothing.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Come on, Jake. We're filming.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: All right. Hang on a second.
text: He has his back to them, but it's obvious his bread hasn't
text: risen. Fred lets the boom mike sag a bit.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: My arm's getting tired.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: So's his.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Action...
text: Jake finally whips off his underwear and faces Ashley.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: That's it?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Hey, it's not hard yet.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I can see that.
text: Fred snickers and Jake gives him the evil eye.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Um, okay. Ashley, maybe you can help him
dialog: out.
text: She grabs his joint and Jake freezes. He remains motionless,
dialog: focusing every ounce of mental control on keeping the
text: floodgates closed. Approximately one point three seconds
dialog: later...
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Aaaahhhh!

dialog: Wait! I'm not set up for that shot!
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Can I put down the boom?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Jake? What's happened?
text: Jake, humiliated, runs to put on his shorts.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: This has never happened before. She got
dialog: me too excited.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Me? How did you ... without even getting
dialog: hard first?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (copping an attitude)
dialog: What do you want to hear? I've got a tiny
dialog: pee-pee? I'm a premature e-jac-u-la-tor?
dialog: Sometimes before I get a boner? Okay?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Calm down, Jake. We can shoot this scene
dialog: again. Just relax. We can splice it
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: We'd have to do it like twenty times to
dialog: get enough footage.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I'm out of here. And if you dickwads tell
dialog: anybody about this, first I'll kill you,
dialog: and then I'll bust you guys.
text: He pops the videotape out of the camera, takes it, and
dialog: leaves.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Now what?
text: The guys regroup, away from Ashley. The moment of truth: How
dialog: far are they willing to go?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Deacon. You do it.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Come on. This is your big chance.
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 54.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: No. You do it.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Fred.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: You.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I have to run the camera.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Oh, like you're the only one who can do
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (false bravado)
dialog: Fine. I'll do it. I'll do it for the sake
dialog: of the film. Hold this.
text: He hands the camera to Deacon and starts taking off his
text: shirt. The rest of them look at Matt with his shirt off.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Matt. Stop it.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: No, I'll do it.
text: He desperately wants someone to hold him back.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: (grabs him)
dialog: Matt!
text: They huddle again, worried about whether to go on with this.
speaker_heading: FRED (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, guys. Maybe we should just pay
dialog: Ashley and chalk this up to a failed
dialog: experiment.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Fine with me.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: No. We can get someone else.

speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: (nonchalant)
dialog: Good issue.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: DEACON (CONT'D)
dialog: You ever think about getting into film?
text: Way uncomfortable, the guy puts the magazine down and makes a
text: beeline for the door.
speaker_heading: DEACON (CONT'D)
dialog: Where are you going, man?
text: The guy is out the door. Deacon...
scene_heading: 56 EXT. JIM'S TINY MART - NIGHT 56
text: ... runs after him.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Don't you want to get it on with a sexy
dialog: lady?!?
text: Matt and Fred are sitting on the curb with some slurpies,
dialog: bummed.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: And that guy had real screen presence,
dialog: too.
text: Just then, Coop pulls up in his van and gets out.
speaker_heading: COOP

speaker_heading: JUMP CUT TO:

text: Deacon and his biology class are getting on a school bus.
text: Nearby, Naomi is crossing the parking lot when she trips and

text: Deacon instinctively rushes over to pick up her books.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Yeah. Thanks. I'm so embarrassed.
text: She pats at the stain.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: (genuine)
dialog: Really? I didn't think you got
dialog: embarrassed about anything.
text: She smiles at Deacon, cheered up by the inadvertent
dialog: compliment. The Bus HONKS for Deacon.
speaker_heading: DEACON (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, I guess I should go.
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 58.
text: He turns to walk away, when Naomi makes a decision to give

speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Deacon, wait. Block me for a second while
dialog: I change my shirt.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NAOMI
text: Facing the other way.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Oh.
text: He turns around and she changes her shirt behind him. Deacon

speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: I haven't seen you around here in a
dialog: while.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Yeah, I'm working on this project at

speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Cool. You can turn around now.

speaker_heading: NAOMI (CONT'D)

scene_heading: 65A INT. AQUARIUM - DAY 65A
text: They rush up to Deacon, whose biology class is near the

text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 59.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Deacon, come quick.
text: Deacon steps away from his class for a moment.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Matt, what's wrong?
speaker_heading: BIOLOGY TEACHER (O.S.)
dialog: Like all mammals, the whale gives birth
dialog: to live young. Can anyone name another
dialog: characteristic of mammals? Vinnie?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Our site got linked by another bigger
dialog: site. Someone must have seen our stories
dialog: and liked them.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: We got a few more pre-orders and a ton of
dialog: hits.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: How many?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Guess.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: A thousand?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Twelve thousand.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Holy shit!
text: Deacon high-fives the other two. They're all stoked.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: We need to hurry up and make this movie.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: We should go over the schedule for
dialog: tomorrow. And make sure the script is
dialog: ready.
text: Deacon's smile fades.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Uh, I can't tonight guys.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Why? Where are you going?
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 60.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: It's this thing I have to go to.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Is it a travelling carnival?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: No. Look, it's this party Naomi invited
dialog: me to.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Can we come?
text: Fred picks up on Deacon's hesitation. This isn't good.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Uh... Okay. I guess that's cool.
text: An awkward beat.
speaker_heading: DEACON (CONT'D)
dialog: I want you guys to come. It's just, I
dialog: don't know. I kind of had this vibe from
dialog: Naomi.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (still doesn't get it)
dialog: We can just meet you there.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Yeah. Okay. That's cool. Look, it's at
dialog: Mark and J.T. Slistak's house. I'll see
dialog: you guys there. I've got to get back to
dialog: class.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Later.
text: Deacon walks back to the group.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you wearing to the party?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: We're not really going to the party, you
dialog: moron.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Because I said so.
text: Matt starts getting agitated.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 61.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: But we told Deacon-- I mean, we can't
dialog: just not show up. What if Deacon is
dialog: looking for us--
text: This is too complicated to explain to Matt, so Fred just
dialog: gives in.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: All right. All right. Stop crying
dialog: already. We'll make an appearance.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Cool.
scene_heading: 66 INT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT 66
text: Amid this raging party, Deacon has taken his rightful place
text: with the in-crowd, standing dangerously close to Naomi
text: without his usual sidekicks weighing him down. Finally.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: You know, Rachael's coming back from
dialog: Paris in a couple of weeks.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: So, aren't you even a little interested
dialog: in seeing her?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: No. There's someone else I'd rather
dialog: see...
text: He looks into her eyes, waiting to see if the limb he's out
text: on is going to break. She smiles. It's working. Just then,
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Hey, guys.
dialog: It's his sidekicks and they've got some seriously bad timing.
text: Deacon shoots them an annoyed look.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: So what's this project you guys are
dialog: working on?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: We can't really talk about it.
speaker_heading: JAKE (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah. It's private.
text: Jake eyes Deacon intently.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 62.
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Why are you hanging around with this
dialog: loser?
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: What's your problem, Jake?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What's yours?
text: She storms away. Deacon follows her.
scene_heading: 67 EXT. MARK'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - NIGHT 67
text: Naomi is out on the patio.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: What was that all about?
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: He really pisses me off. Jake is such an
dialog: asshole.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Tell me about it.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: When we were going out, he was so mean to
dialog: me all the time. I think he's
text: compensating for his little dick that
dialog: never even gets hard.
text: Deacon chokes on his drink.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Well at least you were smart enough to
dialog: dump him. I mean, you deserve someone who
dialog: will treat you ... I don't know. Really
dialog: well.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: You know what you are?
text: Deacon gets a little nervous.
speaker_heading: NAOMI (CONT'D)
dialog: You're a nice guy.
text: She kisses him on the cheek. Deacon looks at her, then steels
dialog: himself to make a decision. He kisses her!
text: She's surprised, but not unwilling.
speaker_heading: NAOMI (CONT'D)
dialog: Deacon?
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 63.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: I've been wanting to do that for a long
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: So why didn't you?
dialog: Most guys would look away at this point, with a fabulous babe
dialog: with pouty lips staring you down. But Deacon passes the test:
text: he stands his ground and kisses her again. She likes it.
text: AT A WINDOW, Jake sees them kissing. He doesn't like it.
text: AT ANOTHER WINDOW, Fred sees it, too. And for a completely
dialog: different reason, he doesn't like it either.
scene_heading: 68 INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY 68
text: The set is finally ready: Ashley is lying on the bed in a
text: robe, the lights and camera are set, and Matt and Fred are
text: adjusting the video camera. The only thing missing is an
text: actor. Deacon ENTERS.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Hey, where's Coop?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: He was supposed to be here a half hour
dialog: ago.
speaker_heading: MATT
text: Maybe he got sucked into a black hole.
text: He chuckles to himself.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Good one, Spock. I can't understand why
dialog: you're not more popular with the ladies.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Look, we're wasting time. Deacon, why
dialog: don't you just go in there?
text: Deacon balks at first, then looks over at Ashley, lying
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on...
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Okay. Okay. All right already.
text: He pulls off his shirt and approaches Ashley with a pizza box
text: from out of nowhere.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: And action!
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 64.
text: Matt starts filming while Ashley pulls Deacon near her.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY (O.S.)
dialog: Maybe I can pay for the pizza some other
dialog: way...
text: We hear Deacon's ZIPPER opening offscreen as Deacon rolls his
text: eyes and reluctantly delivers his line:
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: And maybe I could throw in the sausage
dialog: for free.
text: Deacon shows no enthusiasm for what's happening down below.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Fred, you get in there, too.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Yeah, it'll be a great shot.
text: Fred takes off his shorts and walks over to the other side of
text: the bed. Ashley is offscreen, presumably lying on the bed.
text: The two guys are facing each other.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: S'up?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: How's it going?
text: Deacon shrugs.
speaker_heading: FRED (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, did you see that show on Sci Fi
dialog: about sun spots?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Yeah. They said there's going to be a
dialog: massive eruption next year.
text: Fred starts laughing.
speaker_heading: DEACON (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: You said "massive eruption."
text: Deacon starts laughing, too.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 65.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Hey, quit the chatter.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Hey, why don't you guys kiss?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You know. Make out with each other.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: All right.
text: Fred goes in to kiss Deacon, who's thoroughly confused.
text: Deacon holds him back with his hand.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Wait. Why do you want us to kiss?
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.)
dialog: Because that's what guys do in gay porn.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: What?
text: Deacon looks over at the camera. It's Ashley filming. PANIC!
text: He slowly looks down at the person he and Fred are having sex
text: with. He can barely look. It's Matt!
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: More sausage please.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 69 INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 69
text: Deacon bolts up out of bed. Nightmare. Thank God.
scene_heading: 70 INT. BASEMENT SET AS "MOVIE THEATER" - DAY 70
text: Deacon enters and the scene looks very much like the dream:
text: Ashley on the bed and Matt and Fred waiting around.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 66.
text: The set is made up to look like a movie theater, complete
text: with rows of seats, a bed sheet "screen," and a massive 5,000
text: watt light. Deacon is still a little agitated.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Where the hell is Coop? There's no way
dialog: I'm making out with Fred.
text: Then Coop comes out of the bathroom and sees everyone staring
dialog: at Deacon.
speaker_heading: COOP
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
text: Deacon is talking about making out with
dialog: Fred.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: No way. I'm holding the mike and that's
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: COOP
dialog: I thought we were doing straight porn.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: If you guys want to do gay porn, you
dialog: still have to pay me.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Hang on. Relax. It was just this stupid
dialog: dream I had.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You dreamed about making out with Fred?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: No. Well, yes. And we were both having
dialog: sex with you. But it was just a dream so
dialog: let's forget it.
text: Everyone is a little uneasy at this admission. Deacon quickly
dialog: changes the subject.
speaker_heading: DEACON (CONT'D)
dialog: What's with the light?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It's a "special effect." If you want this
dialog: film to look amateurish, you're going to
dialog: have to get someone else to do it.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Okay. Relax.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Come on. Let's do it already.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 67.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Action.
text: Matt starts his cheesy "projector light effect" and Coop
text: takes a seat next to Ashley.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: This summer tent-pole event-movie is
dialog: making me so scared.
speaker_heading: COOP
dialog: Hide your head down here and I'll tell
dialog: you when it's safe to come up.
text: As she starts to go down, we turn our attention...
text: ON FRED and DEACON, away from the action.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: (snide; whispers)
dialog: How's Naomi?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: COOP (O.S.)
dialog: Not yet. This is the really scary part.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Hey. Can I ask you a question?
text: Fred shrugs. The memory of the nightmare is wreaking havoc
text: with Deacon's conscience.
speaker_heading: DEACON (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you ever think maybe we've gotten
dialog: ourselves in a little over our heads with
dialog: all of this?
speaker_heading: COOP (O.S.)
dialog: Oh, baby. Not yet.
text: Fred appears to be pondering the question deeply. His face
text: slowly contorts to a look of seeming anguish. Then,
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Fire!
text: The coiled cord to the massive light is burning a circular
text: hole in the smouldering carpet.
speaker_heading: COOP
dialog: Unplug the light!
text: Deacon moves to unplug it.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 68.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Wait, it's hot!
text: Too late. Deacon touches the cord, SCREAMS, and reels back,
text: knocking the light over.
text: It EXPLODES onto the floor. The carpet bursts into FLAMES.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Run!
text: Ashley and Coop run up the stairs. Fred isn't far behind.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Quick, get the fire extinguisher!
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Where is it?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Over there!
text: He spots it in the corner and grabs it. Meanwhile the flames
dialog: are growing.
text: Deacon comes over and aims the extinguisher at the flames. He
text: depresses the lever. Nothing.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: It's not working!
text: Matt thinks about it for a second.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Oh. Me and Fred used it when we wrote the
dialog: foamy cat fight script last week.
scene_heading: 71 INT. FRED'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 71
text: Matt and Fred are giggling and prancing around the room in
text: bikinis discharging the fire extinguishers at each other.
scene_heading: 72 INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY 72
text: Deacon looks at him strangely for a beat, then runs into the
scene_heading: 72A INT. BASEMENT - LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 72A
text: He looks around frantically. Nothing. Then, he starts the
text: WASHING MACHINE. It slowly starts to fill up.
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.)
dialog: Hurry!
text: Deacon turns the dial to "large load," pauses and chuckles to
dialog: himself.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 69.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Large load.
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.)
dialog: Deacon! Hurry!
text: Deacon snaps out of it and grabs the laundry detergent
text: bottle. He scoops up some water and RUNS into the other room.
scene_heading: 72B INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 72B
text: He throws the soapy water onto the fire and Matt. The fire
text: goes out, but Matt's not too happy about getting soaked.
scene_heading: 73 INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 73
text: Coop is looking down the stairs to the basement. Fred is
text: freaking out. Ashley is still topless but covering herself
text: up, having just put on her panties. She goes to put on her
dialog: shirt when
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS (O.S.)
dialog: What's going on here?
speaker_heading: DEACON'S PARENTS
text: are standing in the doorway to the kitchen with Max, whose
text: arm is in a splint. Max stares at Ashley. She covers herself
dialog: some more.
text: Then, Deacon and Matt enter the kitchen from downstairs.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Nice rack.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Mom! Dad! What are you doing home?
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
text: Max sprained his wrist at soccer
dialog: practice. What is going on here?
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: Well, I'm sure there's a reasonable
dialog: explanation why there's a naked girl in
dialog: our kitchen. Right, Deacon?
text: Deacon isn't too sure.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: I, uh...
text: Deacon's mind is racing. Then,
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 70.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I'm Deacon's girlfriend. Ashley.
scene_heading: MRS. LEWIS MR. LEWIS *
dialog: His girlfriend? His girlfriend? *
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Yes, my girlfriend.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: And what were you doing with your clothes
dialog: off in my kitchen?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: We were having a make out party.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: Where are the other girls?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Their dates stood them up?
speaker_heading: COOP
dialog: Yeah. My date wasn't feeling well.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Mine has mono. From too much making out.
dialog: With me.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: What's that smell?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: We had a small fire, Mrs. Lewis. I tipped
dialog: over a candle. It was to set the right
dialog: mood.
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: A fire? Let me see the damage.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Dad, don't. Let me take responsibility.
dialog: We'll pay to have it fixed.
text: Deacon's Dad looks at Ashley again. He can't hide his pride.
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: Damn right you will.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: Well, Ashley. I didn't know Deacon even
dialog: had a girlfriend.
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: Maybe you can join us for dinner tonight.
text: Ashley looks at Deacon. Deacon's Mom glares at Dad.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 71.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: I think Ashley's busy tonight--
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Okay.
dialog: Oh, shit.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: Okay, then.
scene_heading: 74 INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 74
text: Ashley is eating dinner with the Lewises. Max keeps staring
text: at her. Mr. Lewis steals a few glances of Ashley himself
text: while continuing his work-related rant.
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: So get this. Johnson comes up to me today
dialog: and he's all like "where's the ND-90's?"
dialog: I'm like, "Johnson, they discontinued the
dialog: ND-90 like six weeks ago." I've been
dialog: telling this guy...
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
text: Johnson sounds like a moron.
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: Exactly!
text: Mr. Lewis is psyched that someone is finally paying attention
text: to him. Mrs. Lewis doesn't like the way he's looking at her.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: So, Ashley. If I could ask you a personal
dialog: question, exactly how old are you?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Nineteen. But I tell people eighteen.
text: Deacon laughs nervously.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Isn't that funny?
text: The doorbell rings.
speaker_heading: DEACON (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll get it.
speaker_heading: FOYER
text: Deacon open the door. It's Naomi.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: What are you doing here?
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 72.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: I thought I'd come by and surprise you.
dialog: Maybe we could hang out in your bedroom.
text: She looks at him seductively. Deacon looks over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Now's not a good time.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Nothing. Let's talk later.
text: He tries to close the door, but she stops it.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS (O.S.)
dialog: Deacon, who is it?
text: Too late. Naomi comes in.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Hi, Mrs. Lewis. I'm Naomi. I'm Deacon's
dialog: girlfriend.
text: And with that she looks at Deacon, figuring she just made his
text: day. It fails, however, to achieve the desired effect.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: His girlfriend?
text: She looks at Deacon. Max pokes his head through.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Deacon has two girlfriends?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Shut up, Max!
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: What do you mean? What's going on?
speaker_heading: MAX
text: Deacon's other girlfriend is having
dialog: dinner with us.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: I can explain.
text: Naomi walks into the kitchen with Max.
speaker_heading: MAX
text: This is Deacon's other girlfriend,
dialog: Ashley.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 73.
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: His other girlfriend?
text: Dad's beaming with pride. The two girls size each other up.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Oh, my God. How old are you, you slut?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Eighteen.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: I thought you were a nice guy.
text: Naomi storms out of the house. Deacon follows, then Ashley.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: You need to have a talk with him. He
dialog: could be having S-E-X.
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: I need to give him a goddamn medal.
dialog: (she storms off)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FOYER
text: Deacon watches Naomi go. Ashley consoles him.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Let her go.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Are you insane? I've been fantasizing
dialog: about Naomi Feldman since the seventh
dialog: grade.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Fantasy and reality are two different
dialog: things, Deacon. Don't fall in love with
dialog: who you think she is. You have to be sure
dialog: you love the real person.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: So what should I do?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Go after her then. Or don't. Whatever.
text: He looks at Ashley for a beat, then goes after Naomi.
scene_heading: 75 EXT. STREET - NIGHT 75

text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 74.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: She's a porno actress in your porno film.
dialog: She had to pretend to be your girlfriend
dialog: because she ran upstairs naked when the
dialog: light caused a fire. And you've never had
dialog: sex with her or even kissed her.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Yeah, pretty much.
text: He looks down.
speaker_heading: DEACON (CONT'D)
dialog: So, I guess this means you're not my
dialog: girlfriend anymore.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Not necessarily.
text: She looks at him with newfound interest.
speaker_heading: NAOMI (CONT'D)
dialog: I want to come to the set tomorrow.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: No, I don't think that's a good idea.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Why not? I'm curious. I've never seen a
dialog: porno movie actually being made.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Matt and Fred will get really mad. We're
dialog: not supposed to tell anyone.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Tell them I'm a ... creative consultant.
dialog: For the female point of view.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: No offense, but the female point of view
dialog: doesn't really matter in these films.

speaker_heading: VIC

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: VIC

speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: GREITZER

speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: Ronald J. Greitzer?
speaker_heading: GREITZER
dialog: Yes. That's right.
text: Then, a spark of understanding.
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: Oh, I get it. Brilliant. You're not even
dialog: a fuckin' kid.
text: Mike pulls the gun out and puts it to Greitzer's head.
text: Greitzer drops his glass of soda, raises his hands, and
text: starts shaking, terrified.
speaker_heading: GREITZER
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: What am I doing? I'm retiring you from
dialog: the porno business. Permanently.
dialog: Understand?
speaker_heading: GREITZER
dialog: Yes. Yes. Please don't hurt me.
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: No more sweet young pussy, no more hot
dialog: school-girl fantasies, no more goddamn
dialog: pornos "for virgins by virgins." You got
dialog: me?
text: Greitzer's eyes dart over to the side, and for the first
text: time, Vic steps into the house and sees: LITTLE GIRLS.
text: It's Greitzer's little daughter's birthday party. Six-year-

text: Greitzer's wife comes over, screaming and crying.
speaker_heading: GREITZER'S WIFE
dialog: Please don't hurt my husband!
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: Uh...
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 77.
speaker_heading: GREITZER
dialog: I'm sorry! I'll never rent them again! It

speaker_heading: GREITZER'S WIFE
dialog: You rented a dirty movie? You told me it
dialog: was Jakob the Liar!
text: Mike lowers the gun and they start backing out of there.
speaker_heading: GREITZER
dialog: What? I shouldn't be entitled to a little
dialog: joy in life?
speaker_heading: GREITZER'S WIFE
dialog: Now look at the trouble you've brought to
dialog: this house.
speaker_heading: GREITZER
dialog: And I'm supposed to know the Religious

text: Deacon is at the microwave making popcorn.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Five hundred dollars a night?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Yeah, but if you can break into films,
dialog: like these ones, you can get featured
dialog: dancing gigs and make ten times that
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Seriously. If these guys ever get their
dialog: act together.
text: Matt stumbles in carrying a pile of scripts. Fred walks in
text: behind him and sees Naomi.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: What is she doing here?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Naomi is my girlfriend.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 78.
text: Fred exchanges a glance with Matt.
speaker_heading: DEACON (CONT'D)
dialog: And I wanted her to help out. Give the
dialog: script a female point of view.
text: Fred pulls Deacon aside.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Jesus, Deacon. Didn't you see that
dialog: Beatles documentary on the History
dialog: Channel? You're pulling a Yoko Ono on us.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Fine. Whatever. Let's get started. I'm
dialog: sure she'll be really helpful.
text: Coop comes out of the bathroom dressed as the Math Team
text: Captain, complete with nerd glasses, pocket protector, etc.
speaker_heading: COOP
dialog: Oh, hey, Naomi.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Hey, Coop. Are you helping these guys,
dialog: too?
speaker_heading: COOP
dialog: (sheepishly)
dialog: Sort of.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Okay, people. Places everybody. Let's try
dialog: to do this with a little heart, okay? And
dialog: action.
text: Everyone turns to their scripts and starts the rehearsal.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: This quadratic equation is so hard.
speaker_heading: COOP
dialog: Well, maybe we should just stick to long
dialog: division.
text: Coop drops his corduroys and Naomi gasps. She stares at
text: Coop's "slide rule" for a beat, then snaps out of it.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Wait a second. Cut. This is all wrong.
dialog: She wouldn't be fantasizing about some
dialog: geek.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 79.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: He's not a geek. He's the Math Team
dialog: Captain.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: No, he should be really well-dressed, and
dialog: maybe he's a foreign exchange student
dialog: from Portugal.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Um, and the director is the only one
dialog: who's allowed to say "cut."
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Who cares, Naomi?
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Deacon agrees with me, don't you?
text: Matt and Fred look at Deacon.
speaker_heading: COOP
dialog: Dudes, come on. My nuts are getting cold.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I'm out of here.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Shut up, Coop. This is important.
speaker_heading: COOP
dialog: (swings his arms out)
dialog: And my nuts aren't?
text: Coop's hand accidentally smacks Ashley in the nose as she's
text: getting up. She SCREAMS.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: COOP
dialog: I'm sorry, Ashley.
text: She's pissed, holding her nose.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Look. This is ridiculous. Who does dress
dialog: rehearsals for a porno shoot?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Oh, sure. Why don't we throw out the
dialog: script while we're at it and "improvise."
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 80.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Guys, I appreciate the money. It's nice
dialog: to get paid for sitting around doing
dialog: nothing, but this isn't helping my
dialog: career. I've got no footage for my reel.
text: She packs up.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Sorry.
text: She leaves.
speaker_heading: COOP
dialog: Ashley, wait. I'm sorry. Ashley!
text: Then, he blurts out something unexpected:
speaker_heading: COOP (CONT'D)
dialog: (calling after her)
dialog: I love you!
text: Coop exchanges an awkward glance with the guys: he's said too
text: much. He goes after Ashley, with his pants still around his
text: ankles and his bare ass in full display.
text: He stumbles on his pants and falls on his face. He gets up
text: quickly and continues after her, still with his pants down.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Now what are we going to do? Your
dialog: "girlfriend" ruined everything.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Coop's the one that smacked her.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Besides, if you losers knew anything
dialog: about women, we wouldn't have this
dialog: problem.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Who asked you?
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: I don't have to take this.
text: She storms off, leaving Deacon there to make a decision. He

speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I, um, I'm... I'm going where you're

speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: To yoga class?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Yes. Exactly.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS

speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: It's my first time.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: Well, that's great, Ashley. You're really

speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS

speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Yeah, people tell me that all the time.

speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: Oh. Okay. Maybe later. Listen, Ashley. I
dialog: want to ask you something... personal.
dialog: About you and Deacon.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: You know Deacon is only seventeen.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: Right. So I was just wondering. You know.
dialog: If you and Deacon... Well, if Deacon and
dialog: you were...
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Um, no.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: Good. Good. That's very good.
text: She gives Ashley a warm little hug.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Listen, Mrs. Lewis. You don't have to

speaker_heading: DEACON

speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Don't you want to?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Of course I do.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Then what's the problem?
text: Deacon looks at her waiting there for him, his for the
text: taking. A long beat. Then,
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: It's my first time.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: That's okay. Just go slow.
text: And he does. He's nervous at first, not sure what to do. But
text: as she kisses him softly, suddenly we start to hear the slow
text: fade in of PORNO MUSIC playing in Deacon's head. (Now that
text: Deacon's actually having sex, it's involunarily triggering
dialog: the only thing he knows about sex: porno movies.) The music
dialog: grows louder when:
speaker_heading: FRED (V.O.)
dialog: (in Deacon's head)
text: Every two minutes, they change positions.
text: He pauses, and cocks his head in confusion. He tries to shake
text: Fred's voice out of his head, but he can't.
speaker_heading: FRED (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: It's a basic rule of porno.
text: Finally, he gives in to the porno music. He rolls Naomi on
text: top of him.
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT TO:
text: They're doing it standing up against the door.
speaker_heading: FRED (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: The door. Always a classic.
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT TO:

speaker_heading: JUMP CUT TO:

speaker_heading: FRED (V.O.)
dialog: It's a basic rule of porno.
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT TO:
text: Back on the bed, Naomi is in a state of complete bliss,
dialog: having had her first ever orgasm.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY (V.O.)
dialog: Fantasy and reality are two different

text: The next night, Deacon is talking to Ashley backstage as
text: she's getting ready to go on.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: I don't know. It was weird. Is it
dialog: supposed to be so weird?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Of course it was weird. True love can
dialog: only exist between two women.
text: Deacon is stunned.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Just kidding. I don't know, Deacon. Do
dialog: you like this girl?
text: He hesitates a bit too long.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Of course I do.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Your heart is telling you that you don't.
dialog: And I think it's time you start listening

speaker_heading: VIDEO DUPE GUY
dialog: Some outfit called After School Special.

speaker_heading: VIDEO DUPE GUY
dialog: Nothing. It's for another customer.

speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: Did you say "After School Special"?

speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Naomi. Wait. Stop.

speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: I have to meet up with Matt and Fred this

dialog: yesterday.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Deacon, you don't have to hang out with
dialog: those guys any more. Besides, you really

dialog: after last night.
speaker_heading: DEACON

speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: That's not the problem, Deacon.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Then what is it?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: I thought this was about us having fun

speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: You don't understand.

dialog: see...
text: ... Ashley's back, as she swings around the pole. She struts
text: by each of the men in the front row, reaching down to take
text: dollar bills out of their hands. She walks over to Deacon's
dialog: Dad...
text: ... but he's tipping the waitress. She does another spin
dialog: around the pole...
text: and lands in a split, face to face with...
text: ... Deacon's Dad, who happens to have a crisp dollar bill
text: between his teeth.
text: They immediately recognize each other and FREEZE. A long
dialog: beat. Then:
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: Hello, naughty school girl whom I've
dialog: never met before.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: You, too, are someone whose kitchen I've
dialog: never been in.
text: Another beat, then she grabs the bill out of his teeth, and
text: quickly moves away.
scene_heading: 91 INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT 91
text: Dad walks upstairs, still a little stunned.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: You get everything done at work?
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: Yeah. All set.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: Oh, guess who I ran into? Deacon's
dialog: girlfriend, Ashley.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 90.
text: Dad freezes.
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: Where did you see Ashley?
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: Over on Industrial Way.
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: You were on Industrial?
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: You know, she is so flexible. It's really
dialog: amazing some of the positions that girl
text: can twist herself into.
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: What?!?
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: She even offered to teach me. So I could
dialog: move like that.
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: Yeah, that would be great! I mean, if
dialog: you're into that.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: Maybe. I like her. I know she's a little
dialog: older, but I think she's good for Deacon.
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: You do?
text: Just then, Deacon walks past them down the hallway towards
text: his bedroom. Dad eyes him with a rare combination of fatherly
text: concern and male jealously.
scene_heading: 92 INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 92
text: Deacon walks past his desk and something catches his eye. He
text: stops to look at a picture of himself with Fred and Matt from
text: fifth grade. He looks really happy in the picture.
text: Then, he sees a strip of photo booth pictures taken yesterday
dialog: with Naomi. She's hamming it up for the camera, but you can
text: tell from his expression, they don't belong together.
text: He tosses the Naomi picture onto the desk.
scene_heading: 93 EXT. DEACON'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - NIGHT 93
text: Deacon stands by the water skipping rocks with Matt and Fred.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: So, what did you want to talk to us
dialog: about?
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 91.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: I wanted to say I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: For blowing you guys off.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: That's okay, Deacon.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: No, it's not. It's just sometimes I feel
dialog: like the whole world is passing us by and
dialog: we're just sitting still. I don't know.
dialog: Anyway, I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: You know, you can be a real dick
dialog: sometimes.
text: Then, Fred smiles. Deacon knows they're cool with each other.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Naomi and I did it the other night.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: No way!
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: You're kidding, right?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: No, it's true.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: How was it?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Good. At first. But then I kept thinking
dialog: about all the pornos. Trying to hit the
dialog: right spots, positions. I don't know.
dialog: After a while it kind of seemed like
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I find that extremely difficult to
dialog: believe.
text: Deacon laughs.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: So what now? Do we make this thing?
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 92.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: I don't know. Maybe we should just call
dialog: it quits.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, guys.
text: Ashley walks up to them. She looks hotter than ever, in a
text: tiny midriff shirt and short shorts.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I need you.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I need you to make this movie. For my
dialog: reel.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Well, actually we were--
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Ooh, look. An eyelash.
text: For the third time, time stands still as Ashley gently pulls
text: the errant eyelash from Deacon's eye and offers it up to him.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Make a wish.
text: Deacon is too entranced to close his eyes, but he does take
text: the opportunity to blow the eyelash off her hand. She smiles
text: and brushes back a strand of hair from his brow.
text: The guys are hooked.
text: Up through the window, over on Deacon's computer, the A.S.S.
text: Website is running, featuring Roger's smiling face with the
text: motto, "By Virgins, For Virgins." The counter is on fire.
scene_heading: 94 INT. HAIRDRESSER - DAY 94
text: Roger is getting his hair cut by a cute HAIRDRESSER, his
text: wheelchair next to him. A few other women are in the back,
text: whispering and looking over at Roger. An OPERA ARIA plays on
dialog: the radio.
speaker_heading: HAIRDRESSER
dialog: So, I'm thinking about getting into
dialog: films.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 93.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: HAIRDRESSER
dialog: You have any tips on how to break in?
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Uh, no. Not really. Acting classes, I
dialog: guess.
speaker_heading: HAIRDRESSER
dialog: Really? I didn't think there was a lot of
dialog: acting in those films.
text: Roger is confused.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Well, I guess it kind of depends.
speaker_heading: HAIRDRESSER
dialog: You think you could get me an audition?
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: HAIRDRESSER
dialog: Come on. How long have I been cutting
dialog: your hair?
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Since I was like eight.
speaker_heading: HAIRDRESSER
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: I know who you are. Don't worry. Your
dialog: secret's safe. Come on. I just want to
dialog: make one film to see what it's like.
text: Roger is still totally clueless.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: That's great. But how can I help you?
speaker_heading: HAIRDRESSER
dialog: Oh, I get it. You help me, I have to help
dialog: you. That's how it works. Okay.
text: She looks around. Then, she sprays a big dollop of hair
text: mousse into one hand and places it under the hair apron.
text: ZIP. Roger panics.
speaker_heading: HAIRDRESSER (CONT'D)
dialog: Relax.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: What're you-- Oh, God!
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 94.
text: His face contorts to match the aria playing on the radio,
text: making it look like he's singing the soprano solo.
scene_heading: 95 INT. BASEMENT SET AS "THE PROM" - DAY 95
dialog: Coop and Ashley have brought some help: Plantain and the
text: Bouncer. They're waiting around for the guys. The room is
text: their most elaborate set so far, a hotel ball room, complete
text: with themed prom banner, dance floor, stage, etc.
speaker_heading: COOP
dialog: No, no, it's a municipal bond fund.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: But what about the capital gains?
speaker_heading: COOP
dialog: Sure there's short term capital gains,
dialog: but the dividends are tax free.
speaker_heading: PLANTAIN
dialog: State and federal?
text: Deacon enters with Matt and Fred.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Hey, guys. I hope you don't mind,
dialog: Plantain and Baxter want to be in the
dialog: movie, too.
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: Hey! Mr. Runningbear!
text: Matt smiles meekly as we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE PRODUCTION MONTAGE:
scene_heading: 95A INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY 95A
text: Moments later, cheesy prom MUSIC plays and a mirrored disco
text: ball reflects light across the dance floor. As the couple
text: dances across the floor, dressed in a prom gown and tux,
text: Ashley looks into Coop's eyes.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Ira, I have something important to tell
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: COOP
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: This prom is making me so hot. I'm ready
dialog: to lose my virginity to you tonight.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 95.
text: Coop gives the thumbs up to the Bouncer, also dressed in a
text: tux, then starts making out with Ashley in an exaggerated
text: tongue-lapping display.
text: BEHIND THE CAMERA, Matt peeks out and looks at the other two
text: guys with a furled brow. Deacon gives him a forced thumbs up.
scene_heading: 95B INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY 95B
text: Coop and Ashley sit in the back seat of a Split Car. Coop
text: says, "Oh, Rachael. You're the best." Fred looks over at
text: Deacon, who just smiles sheepishly.
scene_heading: 95C INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY 95C
text: The Bouncer and Coop play chess as the guys capture the
dialog: offscreen action. Ashley says, "You're the sexiest teacher I
text: ever had." The guys turn their heads sideways to figure out
dialog: the bizarre position Ashley and Plantain have gotten
dialog: themselves into.
scene_heading: 95D INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY 95D
text: Plantain, dressed as a chaperone with a big punch stain on
text: her dress, is eating a tuna fish sandwich and smoking a
dialog: cigarette. Matt calls "Okay, people. Places. Let's get it
text: together." Plantain puts the cigarette out on her heel, hides
text: the tuna fish sandwich in her purse, and sprays the air with
dialog: Weylon J. Petunia's.
speaker_heading: PLANTAIN
dialog: My dress is ruined!
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: I'm so sorry, Miss Jorgensen. What are we
dialog: going to do?
text: She rips off her dress in one big swoop, revealing sexy
dialog: underwear.
scene_heading: 95E INT. BASEMENT BATHROOM - DAY 95E
text: Fred is in the bathroom with the Moisty-Mate, but he just
text: can't seem to get in the mood. Through the door:
speaker_heading: PLANTAIN (O.S.)
dialog: I never knew chaperoning the prom could
dialog: be so "hard."
text: Fred gives up and throws the lotion back in his book bag.
text: When he exits the bathroom, everyone is staring in his
text: direction, then quickly looks away nonchalantly.
scene_heading: 95F INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY 95F
text: The Bouncer is going at it with an ugly sex face, dripping
dialog: with sweat.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 96.
text: Fred lowers the boom and it smacks the Bouncer in the head.
text: Deacon applauds, trying to rally the troops, "Good scene.
dialog: Good scene."
scene_heading: 96G INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY 96G
text: Plantain speaks with no real enthusiasm, "I give you an A+."
text: Matt asks her to do the line again, but she says it exactly
text: the same way again. One more time, same result. Suddenly Coop
text: lets out a huge FART and everyone starts laughing. Matt
text: throws his hands up, frustrated.
scene_heading: 95H INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY 95H
text: Coop and Ashley are in the back seat, post coitus.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: That was the best prom ever.
speaker_heading: COOP
dialog: You can say that again.
text: And as Ashley actually repeats her line, we see Fred mouthing
text: it along with her, proud of his contribution to the script.
scene_heading: 95J EXT. DEACON'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY 95J
text: Matt strips off the sheets, sprays them with lighter fluid,
text: and sets them on fire. As the flames rise up and FILL THE
speaker_heading: SCREEN,
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.)
dialog: Cut. That's a wrap.
scene_heading: END MONTAGE.
scene_heading: 96 INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - LIBRARY - DAY 96
text: Deacon is studying in the library.
speaker_heading: RACHAEL (O.S.)
dialog: Deacon!
text: He turns around and there she is: RACHAEL UNGER.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Rachael?
speaker_heading: RACHAEL
dialog: Hi, how are you?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Good. Good. How was France?
speaker_heading: RACHAEL
dialog: It was so fun. We just got back
dialog: yesterday. The school totally screwed up
dialog: my class schedule.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 97.
text: Deacon looks her over.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: So, how's John Baldwin?
text: Rachael goes white.
speaker_heading: RACHAEL
dialog: Who told you about that?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Everybody knows.
speaker_heading: RACHAEL
dialog: Well everybody is a liar. I never did it
dialog: with John Baldwin.
text: Deacon is stunned.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: You didn't?
speaker_heading: RACHAEL
dialog: Jesus, Deacon. I don't even know him.
dialog: It's not like it was with us.
text: It hits Deacon like a ton of bricks.
scene_heading: 97 INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - A/V ROOM - DAY 97
text: Deacon and Fred enter and see Matt sitting by the computer.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: So...?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: How does it look?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It looks great. It's the best porno film
dialog: I've ever made.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: So what's the problem?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Are you done with it?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Well, I cut together some footage to give
dialog: to Ashley for her reel, but I don't think
dialog: I can finish this film.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Why not?
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 98.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I can't even watch it. Every time I turn
dialog: it on, I keep thinking about that tuna
dialog: fish sandwich and Coop farting all day
dialog: long.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: That was pretty gross.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: That's just it. The movie looks great,
dialog: but seeing everything else -- all the
dialog: disgusting, nasty stuff -- that's what's
dialog: taken all the fun out of it. And I just
dialog: don't want to do it any more.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Great. I knew it. I knew you couldn't
dialog: handle this.
text: Matt looks away.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Take it easy, Fred.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: No, I knew that when it came down to it,
dialog: Matt would wuss out.
text: Matt snaps.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You know what? Fuck you, Fred. You're the
dialog: wuss here. At least I don't have to whack
dialog: off every time I see a girl in the
dialog: hallway.
text: Fred shoves Matt.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Shut up, Matt.
text: Matt stands up and gets in Fred's face.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: No, you shut up! For once in your life,
dialog: be a man and admit this movie was a
dialog: mistake.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Why don't you make me?
text: The two square off, staring each other down. Until,
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: No. Matt's right. This movie was a
dialog: mistake.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 99.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: What are you talking about? This whole
dialog: thing was your idea.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Come on, Fred. Didn't you think this
dialog: movie was going to be ... I don't know,
dialog: sexy?
text: Fred looks at the other two for a beat, not sure what to say.
text: Finally, he smiles.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: How long have you guys known about the
dialog: bathroom thing?
text: Deacon laughs.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: If you didn't like making the movie, why
dialog: didn't you say something?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: I don't know. I thought you guys were
dialog: having fun. I didn't want to be the wuss.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: FRED (CONT'D)
dialog: So what about the car?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: The Aerostar's not so bad.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: What about the money and the power and
dialog: the women? What about Tony Montana?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Scar Face is just a stupid movie, Fred.
text: Fred smiles.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: So what do we do with this?
text: He holds up the tape.
scene_heading: 98 EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK (CLOSED) - NIGHT 98
text: The tape is burning in the center of a huge bonfire. A
text: massive party is raging. Tons of teenagers are dancing,
text: drinking, and having a good time rocking to a LIVE BAND.
text: At the center of it all are Matt, Fred, and Deacon are
text: finally enjoying themselves.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 100.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Hey, guys. Great party.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I've got some big news. I sent the reel
dialog: to Vivid and they want to fly me and Coop
dialog: to L.A. to talk about a contract.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Wow. That's great, Ashley.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Congratulations.
text: Deacon hugs her.
speaker_heading: BOUNCER (O.S.)
dialog: Deacon! Vinnie says we need more ice!
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Hang on, guys. I'll be right back.
text: He leaves Fred and Matt alone with Ashley.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Hey, Ashley. Can I ask you a question?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Do you think me and Matt will ever get
dialog: girlfriends?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Are you kidding? Come on, guys. You have
dialog: it made. You're smart, funny, fun to be
dialog: with. In a couple of years, girls will be
dialog: dying to meet men like you.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Well, no. Popular, good looking guys
dialog: always get the girls.
dialog: (off their look)
dialog: Hey, what was I supposed to say?
text: Then, Roger wheels by, arm in arm with his Hairdresser. No
text: more braces and headgear, Roger looks sharp with slicked back
text: hair and suave clothes.
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 101.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Hey, guys. Great party.
text: He wheels off. The guys and Ashley do a double take.
scene_heading: 99 EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - PARKING LOT - NIGHT 99
text: The Bouncer is checking off names from the invite list. A
text: long line of people are trying to get in, including J.T.
dialog: J.T.
dialog: I can't believe these losers are having
dialog: such a killer party.
text: Coop is walking by and overhears the comment.
speaker_heading: COOP
dialog: Hey, you're not on the list, dude.
dialog: J.T.
dialog: What's with you, you pussy? Are you
dialog: joining the retard team, too?
text: Just then, Plantain enters and walks to the front of the
text: line. The high school guys stop everything to stare at her.
speaker_heading: PLANTAIN
dialog: Coop!
speaker_heading: COOP
dialog: Plantain.
text: Plantain kisses him, while nonchalantly grabbing his crotch.
speaker_heading: PLANTAIN
dialog: Come on. You don't need to wait in this
dialog: line. Deacon and the guys are already
dialog: inside.
text: Coop puts his arms around her and walks away, not without
text: looking back over his shoulder for a second at J.T. standing
text: there, dumbfounded. Then, the Bouncer escorts J.T. away.
scene_heading: 100 EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT 100
text: Ashley is walking by Wendy and Kelly.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I can't believe Naomi dumped Jake for
dialog: Deacon Lewis.
text: Ashley stops.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Let me tell you something about Deacon.
dialog: That boy is amazing in bed.
text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 102.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: And you are...?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Ashley. Deacon's ex.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Seriously?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Seriously. Have your boyfriends ever
dialog: given you an orgasm?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I think so.
dialog: (off Ashley's look)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Have you ever felt so completely
dialog: satisfied in bed that you just wanted to
dialog: sleep for a week?
speaker_heading: KELLY AND WENDY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: You're wasting your time giving those
dialog: Neanderthals blowjobs. I mean, they'll
dialog: probably wind up unemployed wife beaters
dialog: anyway.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: So, are Deacon's friends seeing anybody?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Matt and Fred? I don't think so. But if
dialog: you're interested, you better move fast.
dialog: Those guys know how to do this thing ...
text: She whispers something to Wendy and Kelly. They look shocked.
text: Ashley walks off...
scene_heading: 100A EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT 100A
text: ...and finds Deacon, sitting alone on a broken-down ride. She
text: sits down next to him.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: How's Naomi?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: I don't know. Good, I guess.
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 103.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I thought she was your fantasy girl.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Yeah. She was.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: You're gonna dump her.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: I don't want to. I don't know. It's not
dialog: like it was when I was with Rachael.
dialog: Rachael and I used to talk about stuff.
dialog: We just, I don't know, connected.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Very good, Deacon.
text: Deacon is confused.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Oh, nothing. I guess I'm just glad that
dialog: you finally figured it out.
text: A moment of realization.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Yeah, I guess I did.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So I have to do this, don't I?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: (joking this time)
dialog: I guess. Or not. Whatever.
text: Deacon smiles. He finally understands that Ashley really does
text: care about him. Ashley kisses him on the cheek and exits off
text: into the horizon.
scene_heading: 101 EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT 101
text: Deacon holds Naomi's hand and they walk and talk.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: There's something I want to talk to you
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: I've been thinking. Maybe we should see
dialog: other people.
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 104.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Well, I mean, we don't really have
dialog: anything in common. And we don't really
dialog: even get along.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: You're breaking up with me?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Can we still have sex?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Listen to what I'm saying, Naomi.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: The only reason I went out with you was
dialog: because I thought you were a nice guy.
dialog: And now you're breaking up with me?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Yeah. I guess so.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: If you tell anybody about this... I have
dialog: a reputation.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: I won't. You can tell people you dumped
dialog: me if you want.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Sure. What do I care?
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: You see? You are a nice guy.
text: She kisses him on the cheek.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Just don't tell anyone about the movies.
dialog: All right?
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: JAKE (O.S.)
dialog: These guys are pornographers!
text: It's Jake, on the bandstand with the mike. He's drunk.
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: They're perverts! They make porno movies
dialog: in their basement!
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 105.
text: But no one is paying any attention.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: No one's listening to you, Jake. Give it
dialog: a rest.
text: Jake gets down to confront the guys.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Oh, really, skidmarks? I know someone who
dialog: will believe me. Your parents.
speaker_heading: DEACON
text: The web site is in someone else's name.
dialog: All our records are encrypted. There's no
dialog: tracing it to us, jerk off.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Oh, really? Well, good thing I took the
dialog: tape of Ashley masturbating in your
dialog: basement. When they see that, they'll see
dialog: what kind of movies their perfect little
dialog: Deacon is making.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Did you make a copy of it?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: You sent the original tape to my parents?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: You know, Jake, you're a real dick!
text: She punches him in the stomach. He doubles over and she
text: uppercuts him. He flies backwards, crashing through a table.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You should probably avoid pissing her
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Noted. Guys. We've got a problem.
scene_heading: 102 INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT 102

text: The guys get into the Aerostar.
speaker_heading: VIC (O.S.)
dialog: Not so fast, ladies.

speaker_heading: VIC (CONT'D)
dialog: Which one of you is Balls McLongcock?
text: Matt and Deacon give up Fred.
speaker_heading: VIC (CONT'D)
dialog: Good name.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: Too bad you're not going to be able to

speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Who the hell are you?

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Please don't kill us, Mr. Porno Man.
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: Relax. We're not going to kill you.

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: What?!?
text: The guys freak out, but Mike's gun keeps them in place.
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: (re: Fred)
dialog: Start with him.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Why me? It was all Deacon's idea!
speaker_heading: DEACON
speaker_heading: FRED!
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: Okay. Do the leader kid.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Quit squirming. It hurts a lot more if
dialog: you struggle.
text: Vic starts undoing Deacon's belt.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Wait! Wait! Wait!
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: Come on, kid. Take it like a man.
text: Vic pulls down Deacon's pants. Mike brings the blades

text: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 108.
text: Deacon is CRYING like a little girl. Fred also sobs
text: uncontrollably, creating a cacophony of boyhood terror.
text: Mike goes in for the cut...
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: We've got pre-orders!
text: Mike stops and looks back at Vic.
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: We pre-sold copies of our video.
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: (condescending)
dialog: How many? Fifty? A hundred?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: No. Sixty-three thousand, two hundred
dialog: twelve.
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That's a lot of product, Vic.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: We've got orders from all over the world.
speaker_heading: DEACON

speaker_heading: VIC

speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: FRED

speaker_heading: DEACON

speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Except you promise to supply us with

dialog: (off Deacon's look)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 109.
speaker_heading: FRED (CONT'D)
dialog: It could come in handy. I mean, until we

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: And...
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: No, Matt!
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (emboldened)
dialog: And you have to maintain the artistic
dialog: vision of After School Special.
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: And what's that?
text: Matt puts his arm around around Vic's shoulder.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: The key is to try and remember what it
dialog: was like before you had sex. What did you
dialog: used to fantasize about? A math teacher
text: who bends over a little too far. The door
text: to the girls' locker room open just a
dialog: sliver. Going over to visit your friend
text: and catching his mother coming out of the

speaker_heading: FRED

speaker_heading: MATT

scene_heading: 113 INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 113
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS

speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS

scene_heading: 113A EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 113A

scene_heading: 113B INT. AEROSTAR - NIGHT 113B

text: tell by their expression, they know.
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: Looking for something in the mail,
dialog: Deacon?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: No, I just--
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: Maybe something you'd rather not have us
dialog: see.
text: Deacon goes white.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Mom, Dad...
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: It's too late, Deacon.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Wait--
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: We just want you to know how deeply
dialog: disappointed we are in you.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: I can explain.
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: Explain? Explain?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: If you'll just give me a chance...
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: How are you going to explain this?
text: He holds up the REPORT CARD.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: How did you manage to get a "C" in
dialog: biology?
text: Deacon is in shock: relieved, confused, and a little angry.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I knew we shouldn't have let him have a
dialog: girlfriend--
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 112.
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: Let alone two--
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Is that what this is about? My biology
dialog: class? It's just a stupid midterm grade.
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: I don't like your tone, mister.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Mom, Dad. I'm seventeen now. I'm driving.
dialog: I've got a girlfriend. Well, actually, we
dialog: broke up. But you guys treat me like a
dialog: kid. Is it too much to ask for to be a
dialog: normal teenager with a normal life?
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: You broke up with Ashley?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: No. Naomi. Look. I just want to have fun
dialog: with my friends, okay?
text: They look him over. Finally,
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: Okay, then. Just make sure you don't
dialog: repeat this performance on your finals.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: I won't.
text: Relieved, he walks out into the Foyer. Max appears from
text: around the corner with the tape. They walk together.
speaker_heading: DEACON (CONT'D)
dialog: How much do you know?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Pretty much everything. Mr. Slam.
text: Max hands him a piece of paper.
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: These are my demands.
text: He looks them over.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Done.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Did you know all along?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Are you kidding? Who do you think made
dialog: the first pre-order?
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 113.
text: Max hands him the tape and they shake hands. Deacon turns to
text: Matt and Fred waiting in the foyer. They're relieved.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: 118 FRED'S FACE 118
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: I'm really nervous.
text: DEACON puts his arm around his shoulders.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: My advice is to go slow. If you feel
dialog: you're losing control, just try to relax.
dialog: Don't worry. It's easier than it looks.
dialog: PULL BACK to reveal we're in
scene_heading: INT. DMV - DAY

speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: This is for me?
speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: Are you crazy? It's for me. You want a
dialog: new car, you get an after school job.
text: Deacon's Mom is wearing a sexy outfit and carries an
text: overnight bag. She's beaming.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: But we are letting you have the Aerostar.
dialog: It may not be "cool," but it'll get you
dialog: where you're going.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Thanks, guys. Really.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: We're going away for the weekend. Your

text: Deacon's parents KISS then pull out of the driveway.
scene_heading: 120 EXT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY 120
text: Deacon pulls the minivan into the parking lot. In the
text: passenger seat is Fred. In the back seat are Matt, Max, and
text: Max's three FRIENDS. They all get out and the freshmen
text: scamper away. Matt is holding Deacon's driver's license.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It's not even in focus. This is really
dialog: shoddy work.
text: Deacon takes it back from him.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: So, guys. I decided I'm going to apply to
text: NYU next year. The film school.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Too bad we burned the film. You could
dialog: have submitted it as your sample.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Good idea, Balls.
text: The guys start laughing.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: So, I guess we all got what we deserved.
dialog: No money, no power, no women.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Tony Montana would be pissed.
text: Just then, Rachael spots them and walks over.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Speak for yourself, guys.
speaker_heading: RACHAEL

speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Yeah. But I think it worked out better
dialog: this way.
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 115.
text: Rachael smiles.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Hey, Fred. I hear you know a thing or two
dialog: about giving women pleasure.
text: Fred freezes. He steels himself, trying to build up the nerve
dialog: to say what he wants to say. Then,
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: No, I don't.
text: She's disappointed. The whole gang hangs their heads. Then,
speaker_heading: FRED (CONT'D)
dialog: Matt knows a thing or two about
dialog: pleasuring women. I know everything.
text: Fred smiles ear to ear. Wendy laughs, duly impressed.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: We should go out some time.
text: Kelly looks at Matt seductively.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Maybe all four of us could go out.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: That could work, you know, depending on
dialog: my schedule.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Cool. So call me.
text: They walk off just as Jake pushes Deacon from behind.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Watch where you're going, sphincter boy.
text: But he's dealing with a totally new and improved Deacon now.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: I thought I told you not to call me that
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What are you going to do about it?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Some people never learn.
text: Matt pulls out a funky remote control. He hits a button and
text: all the monitors come on up and down the hallway. Students
text: stop to look up at them.
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 116.
scene_heading: 121A ON THE MONITORS 121A

speaker_heading: 121B HALLWAY 121B
text: Jake is horrified.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Stop it! Stop the video!
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You probably shouldn't have mailed that
dialog: tape back to us.
text: The video starts repeating in continuous loop, but has been
text: edited to sound like a rap song.
speaker_heading: JAKE (O.S.)
dialog: Tiny pee-pee. Tiny pee-pee. E-jac-u-la-
scene_heading: tor. E-jac, e-jac, e-jac-u-laaaaaaa-tor.
text: Students point and laugh at him, while Deacon and the guys
text: continue on down the hallway, dancing to the beat. Deacon
text: kisses Rachael goodbye.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: You know, guys, I've been thinking about
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: About how making the movie didn't turn
dialog: out to be so fun. I think I figured out
dialog: why.
text: They stop at their lockers.
speaker_heading: DEACON (CONT'D)
text: Sex is like a comic book, still in the
dialog: original wrapper. Once you open it up and
dialog: read it, it loses its value.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Deep.
scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 117.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I think he's got something there. Making
dialog: that movie felt like we were tampering
dialog: with forces we couldn't possibly
dialog: understand.
speaker_heading: DEACON
dialog: Exactly. The fun part about high school
text: is unravelling the mystery of what's
dialog: going to happen next.
text: The guys smile and dial the combinations on their lockers. In
text: the background, Jake is still on the ground crying. We TRACK
text: through the hallway, outside...
scene_heading: 121C EXT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY 121C
text: ... where we see a large CAR TRANSPORT, with three hot new
text: sports cars on it. Their license plates read "JOHNNY H," "SAM

text: TRACK OVER to Mike, unloading the cars and Vic, standing
text: there smiling.

speaker_heading: MR. LEWIS
dialog: Why do they always have to show the guy's
dialog: face?
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: To make you think you can get girls as
