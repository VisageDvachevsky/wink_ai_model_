dialog: meant depressed, hard to reach. I
dialog: mean, I'm dying here! And you need

speaker_heading: ROSALYN ROSENFELD

speaker_heading: IRVING ROSENFELD
dialog: Yeah but you can't just stay in the
dialog: house with the fucking sun lamp.

dialog: Jersey, maybe even the whole
dialog: fucking country. A sheik with
dialog: hundreds of millions of dollars to
dialog: rebuild Atlantic City -- are you
dialog: fuckin' kidding me? That's
dialog: gigantic. And the Mayor, he's going
dialog: to want to see cash, he's going to
dialog: want to see it in an account, he's

speaker_heading: IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
dialog: Victor Tellegio was from Miami. He
dialog: was Meyer Lansky's right-hand man.
dialog: In his prior reputation as an
dialog: enforcer from twenty years ago, he

dialog: been our lifelong dream to build

text: Richie pretends to translate in the Sheik's ear.
speaker_heading: VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D)
dialog: You told him that? They didn't want
dialog: the Jews to make money, they didn't
dialog: want the Italians to make money,
dialog: definitely don't want the blacks to
dialog: make money. After the oil embargo --
dialog: the gasoline crisis -- the
dialog: hijackings, the Olympics, they
dialog: don't want to see Arabs make money,
dialog: trust me, not on our soil. You can
dialog: tell him this in your own way: I've
dialog: been in the casino business forty
dialog: years. It's scrutinized more
dialog: carefully than any other business.
dialog: Carmine made this legal, but we
dialog: must be careful or they'll take it
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: CARMINE POLITO
dialog: So, Mister Tellegio, how do you
dialog: think we should approach this? What
dialog: do you want to do?
speaker_heading: VICTOR TELLEGIO
dialog: If you want to get the gaming
dialog: license and keep it we have to make
dialog: our principal investor here, the
dialog: Sheik, an American citizen.
dialog: 93.
text: Irving and Richie both look at Victor intensely not sure
dialog: where this is going.
speaker_heading: CARMINE POLITO
dialog: To expedite citizenship -- well,
dialog: that requires very special
dialog: treatment.
speaker_heading: VICTOR TELLEGIO
dialog: You would know the right people to
dialog: do that, Carmine.
speaker_heading: RICHIE DIMASO
dialog: Carmine knows everybody.
speaker_heading: IRVING ROSENFELD
dialog: What are we talking about?
speaker_heading: CARMINE POLITO
text: U.S. Senators. Congressmen.
speaker_heading: RICHIE DIMASO
dialog: Wow, that's fantastic.
speaker_heading: IRVING ROSENFELD
dialog: I say stay away from that. That's
dialog: bad. That's trouble. No, that's not
dialog: good.
speaker_heading: RICHIE DIMASO
dialog: Irving please.
speaker_heading: IRVING ROSENFELD
dialog: That's trouble.
speaker_heading: VICTOR TELLEGIO

dialog: Irving? What's the problem?
speaker_heading: IRVING ROSENFELD
dialog: Nothing. No problem.
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: VICTOR TELLEGIO
dialog: Don't get your balls in an uproar.
dialog: Everything's fine, everything's
dialog: good. It's all good. It's all good.
dialog: I just hope the other part of this
dialog: is all good. And real. Because
dialog: we're real. You know that. You deal
dialog: with us. We're a real organization.
dialog: We deal with you, we don't know
dialog: what we're dealing with.
text: Everyone stares increasingly tense at Tellegio in silence.
text: This could go wrong at any minute. Tellegio looks over to
text: Richie and points to the Sheik.
text: Irving watches in horror as --
speaker_heading: VICTOR TALLEGIO
dialog: Where's he from?
speaker_heading: RICHIE DIMASO
dialog: (winging it)
dialog: Abu Dhabi.
speaker_heading: VICTOR TELLEGIO
dialog: Oh, he's from the Emirates.

speaker_heading: RICHIE DIMASO
dialog: Uh, I think, I think what he's --

speaker_heading: VICTOR TELLEGIO
dialog: No, let him speak for himself.
text: Sheik swallows hard and looks to Richie. It's a very tense

text: Tellegio stares. Everyone hangs on this. Irving and Richie
dialog: share a look -- what is he doing?
text: A DRUNK, AL KOWALSKI, a working man, friend of the Mayor
text: BARRELS INTO INTO THE TABLE, spilling drinks. Tellegio's guys
text: jump in and grab him and start to pull him away.
speaker_heading: CARMINE POLITO
dialog: No, I know him.
speaker_heading: AL KOWALSKI

speaker_heading: CARMINE
dialog: (to Al)
dialog: We're in a very serious meeting.

speaker_heading: SHEIK ABDULLAH
dialog: (In Arabic)
dialog: It is great doing business with

text: Irving exhales in relief that Paco managed to say anything
text: passable in Arabic.
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
dialog: What are the odds of an Italian guy
dialog: from Miami knowing Arabic? But it
dialog: turns out he's got casino
dialog: investments in the Mideast and he
dialog: spent two years learning it to keep
text: the upper hand.
text: Victor leans over to talk to Carmine.
speaker_heading: VICTOR TELLEGIO
dialog: Listen to me carefully. If you're
dialog: real, you put ten million in the
dialog: bank of our choice in the next two
dialog: weeks.
text: Carmine nods.
speaker_heading: VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D)
dialog: Carmine, listen to me carefully, if
dialog: you're real, you put ten million in
dialog: the bank of our choice in the next
dialog: two weeks or not only will the
dialog: Sheik feel insulted, but our
dialog: friends in Florida will feel deeply
dialog: disrespected and so will I.
