text: The SOUNDS of the FOREST WILDLIFE fill the SOUNDTRACK. BIRDS.
text: INSECTS. OWLS. A STEADY, OUTDOORSY DIN. The Hiker stops to

text: Then suddenly...all the ANIMAL NOISES in the forest stop.
dialog: Silence.
text: The Hiker stops and listens-to the uncanny, preternatural
text: quiet. Apprehension registers on his features. It's as if

text: From far off, a TERRIFYING WOLFLIKE HOWL rips the air. The

text: The SOUND of a HUGE ANIMAL SMASHING THROUGH THE TREES AND
text: BRANCHES of the FOREST.
text: The Hiker cries out in fear and runs for his life... He heaves
text: off his backpack and bolts up the trail. Looking over his
text: shoulder, he sees something shattering through the branches
text: fifty feet behind him. The huge shape, is covered with fur,
text: its claws glinting in the moonlight. The Hiker runs panic-
text: stricken through the forest. The ROARS of the thing fill his

text: the tree is shaken powerfully, heaving him sideways. He
text: shines his flashlight down at the creature shaking the tree.
dialog: A Werewolf!
text: The Hiker screams in raw terror and heaves the flashlight
text: between the Werewolf's eyes. It bounces off the creature's

text: and scratching at the tree. Bark and wood pulp fly like from
text: a chain saw. The Hiker holds on for dear life as the tree is
text: violently shaken back and forth. He tries to climb higher
text: but can't. The Werewolf is swiftly gnawing through the trunk
text: of the tree, trying to break it in half.
text: A CRACK of SPLINTERING woop.
text: The Hiker screams helplessly as the tree he hangs onto starts

text: covered with thick patches of black pubic-like hair. Covered
text: with fur, it stands upright, on its hind legs, with its front
text: legs wrapped around the tree trunk, held together by Uncle
text: Ted's handcuffs. It wears Uncle Ted's sweatpants and the
text: ragged remains of his sweatshirt, and a small metal object
text: dangles from a chain around its neck. The key to the
text: handcuffs. Its face distends in a wolf-like snout. Two
text: -grotesquely long fangs protrude from its exposed gums. Its
text: fangs are sharp and very dangerous-looking. It has been

dialog: idea.
text: The Werewolf hasn't seen Thor yet.

text: The Werewolf is chained to the lone tree in the clearing, and

text: Werewolf is the same constant LOW GROWL Thor had heard in the
dialog: distance.

dialog: kill him.
text: It is utterly mad.
