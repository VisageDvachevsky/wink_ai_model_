speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Try this. I know you're too fuckin' dumb
dialog: to be any more than a courier. I know
dialog: you're coverin' for someone else. NOW

speaker_heading: BUD

speaker_heading: SHEPARD

speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Help... My baby...my baby...

speaker_heading: KITCHEN

speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: This is new.
text: Bud examines a vial's label: "CYANIDE."
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: What's the cyanide for, Jesse?
speaker_heading: JESSE

text: An Asian JUDGE sits dead in the front seat of his car.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Remember him? Ten months ago, a judge
dialog: gets popped with a .357. Well I got a
text: Ruger from Wheeler's toilet and rushed it
dialog: through ballistics.
speaker_heading: BRADDOCK
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: It's a solid match! Dead on.
speaker_heading: BRADDOCK

dialog: Meanwhile...
speaker_heading: BRADDOCK
dialog: So who's backin' him?
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: I don't know; I do know they'll post his

dialog: can't come up with overnight.
text: Braddock listens. Bud keeps it on track...
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: I'm right about this, Mike.
dialog: (leans close)
dialog: When a guy's lookin' at two hundred years
dialog: and he ain't upset... It's like when your
dialog: wife is accusing you of fuckin' the
dialog: neighbor, but she don't know you're
dialog: fuckin' her sister too. You're pretty
dialog: calm about it, right?
text: Braddock smiles slightly.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: It's 'cause we hit the wrong nerve. The
dialog: guns, the other shit, the time... He can
dialog: have that conversation. And he is. And he
dialog: ain't upset. He's makin' eye contact,
dialog: 'cause we're fallin' short.
dialog: (the bottom line)
dialog: This guy knows things. He knows where

speaker_heading: RAY O.S.
dialog: This place is bad...

speaker_heading: RAY

speaker_heading: COBB

dialog: about it nationally.
dialog: (re: his coffee)
dialog: Pass the sugar.
dialog: Marandino does.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: That's if he was a surface informant. I

speaker_heading: CZAPP

text: Czapp looks away from Jesse and shouts down the table:
speaker_heading: CZAPP
dialog: Y'all got that?!

speaker_heading: ROACH
text: (stumbles away, shocked)
dialog: Fuck...

speaker_heading: LUCIAN V.O.
dialog: Read about the arrest, Jesse. There's a

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I don't want my brother touched.
speaker_heading: LUCIAN V.O.
dialog: (laughs faintly)
dialog: I ain't callin' about your brother. I'm

speaker_heading: LUCIAN V.O.
dialog: You should have come to me sooner, Jesse.
dialog: None of this would have happened.
speaker_heading: JESSE

speaker_heading: BUD

text: With a final burst of energy, Jesse turns, SCREAMS and rushes
text: MAN #3. Man #3 slams into the cell bars. CLANG!! Lights out.

speaker_heading: BUD

speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: You got a problem.
speaker_heading: JESSE

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Who do you hate the most? Blacks you

speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: ...I dislike what they represent in the

text: And Jesse begins to consciously or unconsciously "preach."
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: And you believe that by overthrowin'
dialog: Aryan nationalism and integratin'
dialog: races...polluted creeds, with us...You
dialog: believe you're solvin' somethin'?
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: I believe we survive by integrating

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: It ain't evil to fight it. It's evil to

dialog: (leans in)
dialog: Maybe you forget that, to justify what

speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Are we still in prison, or we back at the

speaker_heading: JESSE

text: Photo #2: Tight-shot of Catfish.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: (off Jesse's look)
dialog: Know where he's takin' them? Takin' your
dialog: family? I got a pretty good fuckin' idea.
text: Photo #3: An anonymous duplex. Catfish escorting Lynn and the
text: baby inside, past several surly Aryans looking on.
text: Jesse finally averts his eyes...
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Look at your wife, Jesse. Look at her
dialog: face. And your son. They look safe to
dialog: you?
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: I'm all you've got! I'm all your family's
dialog: got! And the longer you're in here,
dialog: they're up for grabs.
text: ON JESSE. The wheels turning. Burning. THE CAMERA MOVES IN...
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: So either you let that happen... Or I get
dialog: the judge to allow bond. This never sees
dialog: trial. And you work for me.
dialog: And that's where it hangs...
speaker_heading: BLACK.
speaker_heading: JUDGE V.O.
dialog: Jesse Wheeler. Please rise...
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM, BATON ROUGE - DAY
text: Jesse rises, wearing a suit. JUDGE PONDER, at the bench,
dialog: presides over this arraignment hearing:
speaker_heading: JUDGE PONDER
dialog: You stand accused of forty counts of
dialog: burglary, twenty nine counts of felony
dialog: theft, possession of illegal firearms,
dialog: possession or dealing in unregistered
dialog: weapons, possession of a controlled
dialog: substance, manufacture and possession of
dialog: incendiary devices, and seventeen counts
dialog: of receiving stolen goods... How do you
dialog: plead?
text: CUT TO DANIEL KIERSEY, 40s, sharp, confident, expensively
text: dressed. Jesse's attorney, rising:
speaker_heading: KIERSEY
dialog: Not guilty, Your Honor.
speaker_heading: JUDGE PONDER
dialog: Let's hear the arguments for bail.
text: The DISTRICT ATTORNEY rises from his seat:
scene_heading: DISTRICT ATTORNEY
dialog: Your honor, this man is an habitual felon
dialog: as well as a flight risk. Our office has
dialog: overwhelming evidence that Mr. Wheeler is
dialog: not only guilty, but also a serious
dialog: threat to the community. The State
dialog: recommends that bail be denied.
speaker_heading: KIERSEY
dialog: Your honor, my client deserves a
dialog: reasonable bail. He has every intention
dialog: of appearing and answering to all these
dialog: false charges. In addition, he is the
dialog: sole provider for his wife and newborn
dialog: child, who would suffer undo hardship if
dialog: this man were incarcerated.
dialog: CUT TO Judge Ponder:
speaker_heading: JUDGE PONDER
text: Bond is set at one million.
text: THE GAVEL BANGS DOWN. Kiersey shakes Jesse's hand. Smiles:
speaker_heading: KIERSEY
dialog: Congratulations.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM, JESSE'S HOUSE - PRE DAWN
text: Lynn, asleep in bed...
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: Jesse stands, holding his son, quietly comforting him. When
text: Jesse turns, WE SEE a .45 tucked in his back.
text: AND THE PHONE RINGS...
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (answers)
dialog: Yeah...
text: STATIC; he listens, then:
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Okay.
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD, JESSE'S HOUSE - PRE DAWN
text: Jesse steps through his fence into deep WOODS, to find a CAR
text: waiting idyll on a dirt road.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - PRE DAWN
text: A HEAVY-SET MAN at the wheel. Jesse gets in as the headlights
text: spin on and the car pulls away...
scene_heading: EXT. SHIPYARD - PRE DAWN
text: Dark. Eerie and desolate. The car arrives. Jesse steps out
text: and disappears into the shadows of a towering crane.
text: On the jetty, a nondescript MAN stands alone against the calm
text: Mississippi. His back is to us.
text: Jesse approaches, stands quietly beside him.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: How's your family?
dialog: We realize now...It's Bud.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Let's get somethin' straight. I ain't
dialog: here 'cause I'm scared. I done what I
dialog: did, 'cause certain people crossed the
dialog: line. They didn't keep their word.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Well my word counts.
text: They stand together, facing the liquid horizon...
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: I want a body, Jesse.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: How many you want?
text: Bud finally looks at Jesse.
scene_heading: EXT. BORROW PITS - DAWN
text: A swamp area used as a mud retrieval source for the levy.
scene_heading: Amite River. FOG OBSCURES NEARLY EVERYTHING.
text: Jesse slowly emerges... Then Bud and Metro, on all sides, MAG-
text: LIGHTS, FLAK JACKETS and SHOTGUNS. A DUFFEL BAG of SHOVELS.
text: The sounds of the swamp are terrifying. Herons and bobcats.
text: Boots hitting water. The buzz of a million mosquitos.
text: SUDDENLY A RUSHING SOUND -- An ALLIGATOR shoves off the mire.
speaker_heading: COBB
dialog: 'The fuck is that?
text: Cobb's light catches the tail whipping into the swamp.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Yard dog. Relax.
speaker_heading: SHEPARD
dialog: Where's this motherfucker taking us?
text: Jesse suddenly STOPS. LISTENS. BREATHES. Bud and Metro stare.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (directly to Bud)
dialog: Dig here.
text: Metro exchanges looks, ANXIOUS. Bud nods "okay".
speaker_heading: TIMECUT:
scene_heading: EXT. JESSE'S BORROW PIT
text: Metro engulfed in fog. Picks and shovels rise and fall.
speaker_heading: MARANDINO
dialog: Bud! We hit something!
text: Bud excitedly descends the pit to scrape gravel from metal.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Clear it off! Come on, find the edges!
text: Jesse watches as a pair of STEEL DRUMS emerge.
scene_heading: INT. STATE POLICE AUTOPSY ROOM - MID MORNING
text: The "cold room". Bud and Braddock watch as two PATHOLOGISTS
text: hose down the drums. The stench is horrible.
speaker_heading: BRADDOCK
dialog: How long they been down there?
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Jesse tells me six months.
speaker_heading: BRADDOCK
dialog: Six months? Bud, they're biodegraded by
dialog: now. Fuckin' worm food.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: We'll get an ID. Remember, we got the guy
dialog: who put 'em there.
text: BLOW TORCHES ROAR as Pathologists burn through the drums.
text: Sparks fly. The lids CRASH. Swamp water floods out... And
text: immersed within: two sore-covered, DECOMPOSING BODIES.
text: The room recoils from the fumes.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, JESSE'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Lynn is putting dishes away. The baby nearby, sleeps quietly
text: in a swing. Lynn gazes out the window...
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY, JESSE'S HOUSE
text: Jesse is under the hood of his truck, fixing the engine...
text: When a '71 Mustang, white-on-white, roars up the street.
text: Jesse glances over as the car pulls alongside the driveway.
text: It's CATFISH, at the wheel. A wolfish grin.
speaker_heading: CATFISH
dialog: 'Bout time to get a new truck there,
dialog: Jesse.
text: Jesse tightens a nut with a torque wrench, says nothing.
speaker_heading: CATFISH
dialog: Good to see you out. A free man now.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What's goin' on, 'Fish?
speaker_heading: CATFISH
dialog: On a Sunday drive, that's all. The good
text: Lord ridin' shotgun, through another
dialog: glorious Louisiana mornin'.
text: Jesse EYES his .45 atop the engine block, within reach.
speaker_heading: CATFISH
dialog: Say, Jesse... Lucian's askin' about you.
dialog: Fact, a lot of people are.
text: Jesse stays on the engine, never turns around.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You tell him I'll come by.
speaker_heading: CATFISH
dialog: (no longer smiling)
dialog: That's good. I'll see you real soon then.
text: As Catfish drives away... We HEAR a series of photos being
text: taken at high-speed. FREEZE FRAME to BLACK &amp; WHITE.
text: PULL BACK to a distant CONSTRUCTION TRAILER. Bud with a long
text: lens camera, triggers snapshots.
scene_heading: INT. DINER - DAY
text: Greasy spoon, soul food joint. Trucker and labor patrons.
text: Bud walks in, perplexed to find Braddock sitting with
scene_heading: MARTIN FITCH (30), Deputy Chief of Staff for US Attorney
text: General. Pressed suit. Young face. Out of his element.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Hey, Mike.
speaker_heading: BRADDOCK
dialog: Bud, this is Special Agent, Martin Fitch.
dialog: He's down from Washington. With the
dialog: Attorney General.
speaker_heading: FITCH
dialog: Martin. Just call me Martin.
text: Fitch offers his hand, smiles. Bud shakes.
speaker_heading: BRADDOCK
dialog: Martin's gonna be soliciting Jesse's case
dialog: for a Federal sponsor.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: How long you been with the Attorney
dialog: General, Fitch?
speaker_heading: FITCH
dialog: Just over a year.
text: Bud looks at Braddock.
speaker_heading: FITCH
dialog: I want to assure you my education and
dialog: experience is more than adequate to
dialog: handle a case of this potential.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Is that right...
text: Fitch's smile drops as Bud stares him down.
speaker_heading: BRADDOCK
dialog: Why don't we get to the particulars?
speaker_heading: FITCH
dialog: Right. Alright.
dialog: (clears throat)
dialog: To get Jesse a federal sponsor, we need
text: something substantial. A bait. In the
dialog: Justice Department, we have this mission
dialog: statement... We decide who the target is,
dialog: what's the threat assessment, the cost
dialog: value, over what time table it's gonna
dialog: take place... Which target do we go after
dialog: first. We don't want to miss a big target
dialog: hitting a smaller target, you understand?
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FITCH
dialog: Well, exposing bodies has limitations.
dialog: Those people are dead. We can't retrieve
dialog: their lives.
text: Bud blinks.
speaker_heading: BRADDOCK
dialog: He means there might not be enough to
dialog: back Jesse.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Keep him on the street without
text: protection, he winds up dead.
speaker_heading: FITCH
dialog: What I'm saying is, we need fresh leads.
dialog: He'll need to present something that
dialog: separates him from those we're going to
dialog: arrest. If Jesse can't offer something
dialog: continuous... I'm afraid we can't be of
dialog: much help.
text: Bud stares at Fitch.
text: A WAITRESS in her 50s approaches.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Ready to order?
speaker_heading: FITCH
dialog: (cuts in)
dialog: Yes. I'll take a garden salad. Roquefort
text: on the side.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: You'll take what?
speaker_heading: FITCH
dialog: (curt)
dialog: It's a dressing.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Well...we got ranch, thousand island and
dialog: oil. Which one you want?
text: Bud's chair SCRAPES back as he stands, stares hard at Fitch:
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Lost my appetite.
text: And walks out.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT OUTSIDE DINER - DAY
text: Bud stalks out to his car. Braddock follows, agitated. They
text: say nothing till they reach the car.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: I set this up. Me and Jesse. If the Feds
dialog: want to help, that's fine. But not him.
speaker_heading: BRADDOCK
dialog: What do you mean, "me and Jesse?" He's
dialog: not your partner, Bud. This case is
dialog: beyond our capacity. It requires
dialog: resources we don't have.
text: Bud unlocks the car. They stand, talking across the roof.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: They ain't takin' us serious, Mike. They
dialog: send us some kid with a year under his
dialog: belt?! He don't even know what state he's
dialog: in... You want him in charge?!
speaker_heading: BRADDOCK
dialog: You're God damn right I do! You're out on
dialog: a limb on this already, Bud! It's my job
dialog: to make sure you get back!
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: This is bullshit.
speaker_heading: BRADDOCK
dialog: That may be. What it ain't, is open for
dialog: discussion.
text: Braddock walks away. Bud simmers a moment, gets in his car.
scene_heading: INT. A ROOM - FOLLOWING MORNING
text: A bare room; nothing to tell us where we are. Jesse's on a
text: stool. He runs his fingers down his mustache, grits his teeth.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Y'all wanna talk about crime? Well I
dialog: could tell y'all things. Names.
dialog: Locations. What boat is movin' what
dialog: drugs, which one is guns. Who's gonna get
dialog: cut up and why. ...But what I got to know
dialog: is, if 'n when I do this... If I wear
dialog: your dog collar... Y'all gonna do what's
dialog: right by me and keep my head from gettin'
dialog: shot the fuck off? 'Cause the truth is,
dialog: you need me. You ain't got enough cops
dialog: with enough sense or enough time, to
dialog: clear them crimes that already been
dialog: committed and will be.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Y'all need me... I got the devil's
dialog: address.
text: REVERSE: We're in a HOTEL SUITE.
text: Shades down. Full of AGENTS: FBI, ATF, DEA, SECRET SERVICE.
text: Law enforcement everywhere. On the furniture, against the
text: wall, sitting on the floor. Staring at Jesse in silence.
text: Bud stands by the door with Braddock. And Fitch steps
text: forward, laughs nervously...
speaker_heading: FITCH
dialog: Okay, great... Thanks. Thank you, Jesse,
dialog: for that. And thank you, everyone for
dialog: attending...
dialog: (tight)
dialog: Uh, we all know why we're here. To solve
dialog: a matter of custody--
speaker_heading: FBI #1
dialog: We'll protect you and your family, Jesse.
dialog: (to the room)
dialog: It's a federal matter, gentlemen. Those
text: bodies were transported over state lines.
text: An ATF AGENT #1 imposes:
speaker_heading: ATF #1
dialog: Not so fast. Ammunition, grenades? This
dialog: man's house was a factory, for Christ's
dialog: sake. ATF is taking this.
speaker_heading: DEA
dialog: Those murders were drug related. DEA's
dialog: got to do follow ups.
speaker_heading: SECRET SERVICE
dialog: He was printing counterfeit money.
dialog: That's Secret Service.
text: ARGUING ENSUES, Agents' voices step over one another. Fitch
text: tries to take control. Jesse's been silent, until...
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: There's a hit list.
text: Fitch hears this. He turns, loudly to the room...
speaker_heading: FITCH
dialog: Wait! Wait a minute, quiet! Everyone
dialog: quiet!
text: And EVERYTHING stops. Fitch moves to Jesse:
speaker_heading: FITCH
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: A hit list. There's much as twelve. Might
dialog: be one or two less now, I ain't sure.
dialog: Some could've already been gotten.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: (to Braddock)
dialog: Now we're talkin'.
text: FBI #2 approaches Jesse...
speaker_heading: FBI #2
dialog: Why these twelve, Jesse?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Different reasons. It ain't so much why
dialog: or what they done that matters. Pick any
dialog: one of 'em off that list, AB puts you on
dialog: salary.
text: Everyone is suddenly interested. Bud sees this.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: And you, sir, if I ain't mistaken...
dialog: You're Mr. Nokes, right?
text: Agents part, revealing JOHN NOKES(50s), black, an emminent
text: figurehead in a plush suit. Surprised to be pointed out...
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: First U.S. Attorney, John Nokes?
speaker_heading: NOKES
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Well, last time I seen it...you was
dialog: number two on that list.
text: It's quiet. Nokes thinks. Then LAUGHS and approaches Jesse.
speaker_heading: NOKES
dialog: Can you fill us in on the rest of those
dialog: names, Jesse?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yes, I can. But there's something I gotta
dialog: make clear 'fore that happens.
speaker_heading: NOKES
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I've listened to you, Mr. Nokes. And I've
dialog: listened to these suits here, on who's
dialog: gonna take me in...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I will die, go to hell and take all y'all
dialog: cocksuckers with me, if he--
dialog: (motions to Bud)
dialog: --tells me to.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I want y'all to know that.
text: Jesse is explosive under the low projection delivery and a
text: CHILL falls over the room.
speaker_heading: NOKES
dialog: (to Bud)
dialog: How's that fly by you, Lieutenant?
text: Bud simply nods.
speaker_heading: NOKES
dialog: I'll sponsor him. Jesse's welfare will
dialog: come out of our budget. Anyone has
dialog: pending cases or leads for Jesse, see me.
dialog: I'll loan him out.
text: Jesse stares at Nokes. As the meeting settles back to a
dialog: comfortable level...
speaker_heading: NOKES
dialog: And, Jesse... I'm a little pissed I'm
dialog: number two on that list. Who the fuck is
dialog: number one?
text: The room erupts with LAUGHTER. Everyone except Bud and Jesse.

text: MOVE IN as crackling, electronic pixels FILL THE FRAME and...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GUARD STATION - SAME
text: A BANK OF MONITORS showing Jesse at the gates. A GUARD sits

scene_heading: INT. JESSE'S TRUCK
text: pulls down the private road.
text: Shafts of light mottle then burst, REVEALING an elegant
speaker_heading: VICTORIAN HOME.
text: Jesse parks -- walks up the porch, where Catfish is relaxing,
text: shoulder holster, revolver. And Buzz, cleaning a pistol.
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: Jesse.
text: Jesse nods, eyes Catfish.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I'm here to see Lucian.

scene_heading: CLOSE ON: A SNIFTER

speaker_heading: MALE VOICE
dialog: This operation of your's has become big
dialog: business. You need relationships now more
dialog: than ever...
text: THE VOICE belongs to RICHARD MORRIS, 40s. He sits in a
text: leather chair, facing Lucian Adams, who's face we cannot see.
text: Seated next to Morris, is Daniel Kiersey.
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: ...We've done business successfully
dialog: before, Mr. Adams. But it's a larger
dialog: scope now. I'm here today because I want
dialog: to represent you exclusively. You need
text: someone lobbying at a state level, as
dialog: well as in Washington. My organization
dialog: can provide both. We've got contacts that
dialog: you don't have and other people can't
dialog: get. Now, I'm aware that you have
dialog: multiple businesses... However you need
dialog: one go-to guy, so that all your ventures
dialog: stay coordinated and all transactions and
dialog: contracts are realized. I am that person,
dialog: Mr. Adams. That's what I do.
text: LUCIAN'S HAND lifts the cognac out of frame, drinks.
speaker_heading: KIERSEY
dialog: What's this going to cost us?
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: As a retainer, I want an advance of three
dialog: hundred-fifty thousand, along with ten
dialog: percent of whatever economic benefit I
dialog: bring to this organization.
speaker_heading: KIERSEY
dialog: Three-fifty? C'mon, Dick. That's out of
dialog: line.
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: If you want a quality global economic
dialog: plan, that's what you pay for--
speaker_heading: LUCIAN O.S.
dialog: We'll give you two, Mr. Morris...That's
dialog: what it's worth.
text: Morris goes suddenly silent, looks across at Lucian.
speaker_heading: LUCIAN O.S.
text: The advance is a drop in the bucket. The
dialog: real money is the percentage. It's in
dialog: your interest to see it my way.
text: Morris stares across the desk, several tense moments. Then:
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: You've got a deal.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, LUCIAN ADAMS' HOUSE - DAY
text: Morris emerges from the office. He glances at Jesse, then

scene_heading: INT. LUCIAN ADAM'S OFFICE

speaker_heading: LUCIAN
dialog: You have a son now, right?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah...
text: As he removes the shirt he's wearing, REVEAL tattoos: BLACK
text: SUN on his back. GERMAN RUNES, SS BOLTS, HRUNGNIR'S HEART.
text: And around his stomach, a belt of NORSE GODS with the words,
text: "INVISIBLE EMPIRE." Prison tats, dark and aged.
speaker_heading: LUCIAN
dialog: What'd you name him?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I named him Ray.
text: Lucian, no emotion, puts on a pressed dress shirt, fastens
dialog: cuff-links.
speaker_heading: LUCIAN
dialog: (over his shoulder)
dialog: Heard the cops smacked you around inside.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: 'Wasn't too bad.
text: Lucian checks his hair.
speaker_heading: LUCIAN
dialog: You've been a busy man, Jesse. More ways
dialog: than one.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Looks like you done just fine without me.
text: Business rollin' through the door.
text: And Lucian finally turns; looks at Jesse, eyes measuring...
speaker_heading: LUCIAN
dialog: Last I saw you, you asked for time. Time
dialog: to raise a family.
dialog: Time to straighten things out.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I gave you that time... Then safe jobs
dialog: start poppin' up. Lafayette. New Orleans.
dialog: Clinton. Baton Rouge. All over. The boys,
dialog: they think it's niggers, gone widespread
text: on a hunt for pig's feet. But they all
dialog: professional. Burn jobs. Hot-weld oxygen.
text: Laid out, burned, laid back, perfect.
dialog: (locked on Jesse)
dialog: I knew right then and there, only a white
dialog: respectable burglar could've done this.
text: Jesse smiles slightly. They know each other well...
text: ...When Lucian's smile suddenly drops. There's a flash of
text: controlled anger across his face; and WE FEEL a curtain of
text: tension fall heavily on the room.
speaker_heading: LUCIAN
dialog: Jesse... With all the work you been
dialog: doin': Diamonds. Emeralds. A dozen safe
dialog: jobs, behind my back...
dialog: (predatory)
dialog: Where's the tribute to the greater cause?
text: Jesse he pulls from his pocket, a tiny pouch. Sets it on the
dialog: desk...
text: He pours the contents into Lucian's palm: DIAMONDS and
speaker_heading: EMERALDS.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Like I said, I just needed time.
text: Lucian approaches the desk, opens the pouch: DIAMONDS and
text: EMERALDS... A slow smile spreads across his face.
speaker_heading: LUCIAN
dialog: Well, even prophets stumble once in a
dialog: while.
text: Lucian embraces Jesse. Tight. Then, softly in his ear:
speaker_heading: LUCIAN
dialog: It's a shame about your brother.
text: As they part, their eyes meet. Something passes between
dialog: them...
scene_heading: I/E. JESSE'S TRUCK, TRAVELING - BACK ROAD - NIGHT

scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE PLANE
text: Jesse and Lynn stare at each other. She's crying as he pulls

dialog: we cannot hear...
text: Then with the baby, Lynn boards her plane. An AGENT shuts the

text: Jesse turns to shield his face. Lights STROBE and BLAST...
text: Then, ABRUPT DARKNESS AND SILENCE...
speaker_heading: ON JESSE
text: now alone on the tarmac. Bud approaches; then...
speaker_heading: JESSE

speaker_heading: KIERSEY
dialog: There's a variety of matters to discuss
dialog: today, gentlemen. Eddie Moran's trial
text: starts next week. One of the jurors
dialog: reached out. He's asking six thousand up
dialog: front plus a job at four hundred a week.
dialog: That guarantees a hung jury with a push
dialog: for an acquittal.
speaker_heading: LUCIAN
dialog: Three hundred. Give him a no-show at the
dialog: trucking firm.
speaker_heading: KIERSEY
dialog: (as he writes)
dialog: Construction on the building Morris
dialog: brought us, in south-east Florida, is
dialog: complete. Every unit sold. We should see
dialog: revenues of one point four million over
dialog: our original projections.
text: Lucian lights a cigar, smoke curls from his lips.
speaker_heading: KIERSEY
dialog: Lastly, our "friends" from the Middle
dialog: East. They put a final offer on the

dialog: behalf. Political targets mostly, on the
dialog: basis of our approval...
dialog: (beat)

speaker_heading: LUCIAN
dialog: "Final offer?" Demands...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Close the deal. We'll cook the cash for
dialog: it. By the time they realize, we'll have

speaker_heading: LUCIAN

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: How 'bout a few of them heads off the

speaker_heading: LUCIAN
dialog: We got guys for that now. Catfish, Buzz.
dialog: What do you want to go back to that for?
speaker_heading: JESSE

speaker_heading: FITCH

speaker_heading: FITCH
dialog: Look, Carter. This is a joint task force
text: with multiple agendas, that run up the

dialog: forth at the eleventh hour that Naseem
dialog: Kazuri - an international arms dealer -

speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: That ain't what they did--!
speaker_heading: FITCH
dialog: --No! Because your informant--
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: My informant, that's right!--
speaker_heading: FITCH
dialog: --Your informant and his psychopath crew
dialog: greased half our political interests --
dialog: over a bag of fake cash! You weren't
dialog: informed, so what?
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Well I better be informed! 'Cause this
dialog: ain't fallin' short! Now, any of y'all
dialog: got a collaborative agenda in the works?

dialog: what time-lines they lookin' at? What
dialog: deadlines and why?
speaker_heading: FITCH
dialog: Above your pay-grade--
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: And is there a purposeful lack of

dialog: who are right now charting future
dialog: mistakes, as we fuckin' speak?!
speaker_heading: FITCH

speaker_heading: BUD

speaker_heading: BRADDOCK

speaker_heading: BRADDOCK
dialog: I'll handle this.

speaker_heading: FITCH
dialog: Thanks for coming down, Mike. He's been
dialog: berating my agents for the last hour.
text: Braddock pours a cup of coffee.
speaker_heading: FITCH
dialog: We're trying to band-aid a situation
dialog: here, and frankly, Carter's preference
dialog: for thug tactics isn't helping. It'll all
dialog: be in my report...
speaker_heading: BRADDOCK
dialog: (interrupts)
dialog: "Isn't helping?"
text: A big mistake. Now Braddock turns on Fitch, zeroing in...
speaker_heading: BRADDOCK
dialog: "Isn't helping?" Let's not miss what
dialog: happened here, Fitch. We work for the
dialog: same cause doesn't mean we work for you.
dialog: What are you gonna do now? Send Jesse
dialog: back out? Earn his trust? Bud Carter
dialog: delivered the biggest informant in the

text: ...FLASHES OF STEEL and two more teeth rip out at the root.
text: Catfish SCREAMS then passes out. Jesse slaps him awake.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Where's he hidin' out?
text: Catfish, last ounce of spite, cracks a blackened grin:
speaker_heading: CATFISH
dialog: Get fucked.
text: THE DRILL STRIKES. Bone deep. Gum line splays open. Teeth

text: Jesse stops. A brief reprieve. He gets up and looks around
text: the apartment. SEES: Magazines. A few revolvers. Empty liquor
text: bottles. Meth on the counter. And on the stove:
text: A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE. Beside a pie tin, speed base boiling.
text: Jesse stares. He lowers the syringe into the tin, plunger up,
dialog: drawing fluid...
text: ...then very deliberately sticks Catfish's arm with the tip

speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: I believe you.
