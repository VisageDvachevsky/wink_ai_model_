speaker_heading: BLACK
text: We hear, very clearly, the sound of light wind.
scene_heading: 1 EXT. TOWN - MAIN ST. - LATE AFTERNOON 1
text: We come up on... a streetlight. There is no illumination...
text: and no movement. We hold on it for a long moment when
text: suddenly... The streetlight bobs... and then begins to sway.
text: We slowly begin to rise up on the streetlight to reveal... a
text: small bird has landed on it. We continue to rise to reveal,
dialog: behind the bird...
text: Wind blows through the gargantuan evergreens that seem to
text: engulf the narrow main street of a small town in upstate New
text: York. Shop windows and cars on either side covered in dust,
text: the place seems frozen in time. There is no movement.
text: In the very middle of the road one can see... sand. A bizarre
text: incongruity, a long pathway about a shovels width runs the
text: full length of the street with offshoots into open doorways
dialog: of some of the shops.
dialog: We hold for a long moment:
scene_heading: 2 INT. GENERAL STORE - FRONT - LATE AFTERNOON 2
text: Slowly pushing through the doorway of a large general store,
text: also covered in dust. To the left, a cash register with small
text: shelves of nearly empty candy boxes below. To the right, a
text: towering shelf full of bags of potato chips, nacho chips and
text: pretzels... None are missing.
scene_heading: 3 INT. GENERAL STORE AISLES - LATE AFTERNOON 3
text: WE MOVE SLOWLY across the floor, down the middle of a general
text: store. Amid the towering shelves of goods on either side, one
dialog: may recognize a barely perceptible pattern of which shelves
text: are bare and which are not. There is no movement. No sound.
text: Suddenly... TINY FEET JUMP INTO OUR MOVING FRAME! Then, as
dialog: fast as they appeared... They're gone.
text: WE NOW MOVE UP the side of the store, looking down one
text: aisle... and the next. As we arrive at the next aisle we
text: catch a glimpse of... A SMALL DARK FIGURE!!! And then its
dialog: gone.
text: WE CONTINUE along the side of the store until we arrive at
text: the last aisle. At the far end of the store we see...
dialog: 2.
text: a counter. With a window. And shelves. Suddenly... A WOMAN
text: APPEARS IN THE WINDOW!
text: WE GO CLOSE ON THE WOMAN as she scans the shelves, slowly
text: lowering herself to the ground until behind her we see... an
text: 8 year old boy sitting slumped against the wall... HE IS
text: BAREFOOT. On closer inspection we see sweat on the boy's
text: brow, his skin pale from fever. The woman's knee touches down
text: on the ground next to the boy as... she sees what she's been
text: looking for. She reaches out her hand.
text: WE GO CLOSE ON HER HAND as it reaches toward a shelf... of
text: orange prescription drug bottles. Her hand suddenly begins to
text: shift certain bottles ever so slightly... AT A BIZARRELY SLOW
text: PACE... she does not make a sound. As she does this, we get
dialog: our first glimpse... of names. Names of drugs. Names... of
dialog: people.
text: HER HAND finally arrives at the very back of the shelf as she
text: gently twists a bottle that reads... AMOXICILLIN.
text: ON THE MOTHER... as she inhales slowly? And then, as if
text: doing surgery, she slowly closes her hand around the bottle
text: and GENTLY begins to move it through the shelf toward her.
text: Her hand, once again moves incredibly slowly, her now wider
text: closed hand shifts even more bottles as it passes. JUST as
text: she gets to the end of the shelf a bottle shifts... with a
dialog: RATTLE of pills. This is the first, deliberate sound we've
dialog: heard. The mother... FREEZES!!!!
text: WE RACK FOCUS to the boy on the ground, who now looks up...
text: with panic. The mother's eyes look all around the room...
dialog: The way one does when they are waiting for something...
text: LISTENING for something. After a long moment... she pulls
text: the bottle in her hand the final few inches... and off the
dialog: shelf.
text: The mother draws a huge breath of relief. As she stands up,
text: we reveal, just over the counter... TWO EYES LOOKING UP AT
dialog: HER!!!
scene_heading: 4 INT. AISLE - LATE AFTERNOON 4
text: A 10 year old girl stands on her toes, barely able to see
text: over the wooden counter to... her mother. She smiles at her
text: mother... and gives her a thumbs up. With that... she's off.
text: WE FOLLOW HER as she runs lightly through the store... she is
text: also barefoot.
text: The GIRL turns down an aisle to reveal... a small boy sitting
text: on the floor... He too is barefoot.
dialog: 3.
text: As the girl approaches we see, in the thick dust on the floor
text: he has drawn... a rocket ship. She sits with him.
text: He silently puts his hand to his chest, palm to the side...
text: crosses his first two fingers of his other hand with
text: deliberate focus... and then slowly puts his two hands
text: together. He then looks up at her... and quickly shoots his
text: crossed fingers into the air... like a rocket. She beams
text: with pride for a moment and then... Signs back to him.
speaker_heading: DAUGHTER (SIGNING)
dialog: Very good job!
scene_heading: BOY (SIGNING AS BEST WE CAN)
dialog: ....That's how... we get away.
text: The girl's smile falls ever so slightly. Then the boy
text: suddenly... TAPS her on the shoulder and scurries away...
dialog: She's "it".
text: As the girl slowly gets up to follow him, we see for the
dialog: first time... A HEARING AID...
text: The boy disappears around a corner...
scene_heading: 5 INT. NEXT AISLE - LATE AFTERNOON 5
text: The girl comes around the tall shelf into the next aisle when
text: suddenly... her eyes go wide!!! What she sees is the boy
text: standing on a small box, STRETCHING to reach a toy on a high
text: shelf. She walks quickly to him when suddenly... the toy
speaker_heading: FALLS.
text: The girl instinctively SLIDES to the ground and catches the
text: toy JUST as it's about to hit the ground! On her face we can
text: see she is TERRIFIED! She closes her eyes, taking a breath
text: with relief. When she opens them, in the foreground, we see
text: the toy she is holding... a small TOY SPACE SHUTTLE. Then in
text: the distance past the toy we see... a FIGURE.
text: She sits up to see a man standing outside the door of the
text: general store, holding a large box with what looks like a
text: quilt hanging out of it. A look of fear on his face...
text: softens, as he mimes wiping his brow with relief. She smiles,
text: puts the toy back on a shelf and runs to him.
scene_heading: 6 INT. GENERAL STORE - FRONT - LATE AFTERNOON 6
text: The father gently puts the box on the ground and pulls back
text: the pieces of thick quilt to reveal that all the contents are
text: actually wrapped in it.
dialog: 4.
text: He then reaches for a LARGE HIKING BACK PACK, and begins
text: transferring the contents of the box into the bag. As he
dialog: does, we see... cans of food, a variety of prescription
text: pills, bandages and wrapped syringes.
text: The girl arrives at his side and excitedly starts rummaging
text: through the box as well. As she does, we see... thick
text: paintbrushes, bottles of glue, bottles of lighter fluid and a
text: stack of old newspapers. Then... her face lights up. From
text: the box, she pulls out a SALVAGED SECURITY CAMERA with wires
text: exposed. The girl gives it a brief once over and then
text: removes... two exposed CIRCUIT BOARDS, very obviously only
dialog: recently removed from whatever appliance they belonged to.
text: The girl scans the boards with a voracity, pointing out to
dialog: the father particular areas of interest. Her father can't
dialog: help but smile.
text: Suddenly, the box of Amoxicillin comes into frame and is
text: placed on top... along with two boxes of sugar. The father
text: looks up at his wife. After a beat... she signs:
speaker_heading: MOTHER (SIGNING)
dialog: For my tea.
text: He just keeps looking at her.
speaker_heading: MOTHER (SIGNING) (CONT'D)
dialog: Fine. I have a sweet tooth.
text: The father smiles and is about to close the bag when... a
text: candy bar is placed on top.
speaker_heading: DAUGHTER (SIGNING)
dialog: Me too!
text: The father looks up at her with fake incredulity. Suddenly
text: the sick son in his mother's arms weakly signs:
speaker_heading: OLDER SON (SIGNING)
dialog: Me too.
text: The whole family laughs silently as the daughter GENTLY takes
text: another candy bar from a box below the cash register... We
text: can now see why the boxes are almost empty.
text: The father looks back to his arriving four year old son,
text: expecting the same, but from behind his back the young boy
text: reveals... the toy space shuttle.
text: With a sweet empathy the father reaches for the toy... and
text: shakes his head no. He turns the toy over and silently
dialog: explains it has batteries... this toy can make noise.
dialog: 5.
text: The little boy watches, confused... hurt, as his father
text: gently places the space shuttle on the counter. And then
text: gently grabs a big lollipop and puts it in the bag for the
dialog: boy.
text: The mother hands their sick son to the father who picks him
text: up and walks out. The mother kisses her 4 year old on the
text: head, shuffles the hiking bag onto her back and walks out
dialog: too.
text: The daughter looks at the boy as tears begin to fill his
text: eyes. She smiles and signs:
speaker_heading: DAUGHTER (SIGNING)
dialog: It's ok.
text: The boy shakes his head no.
text: After a moment... the girl looks back to see if her parents
text: are there. She then reaches up and takes the shuttle down
text: from the counter. With wide eyes her little brother watches
text: as she surgically removes the batteries... and places the
text: shuttle in the hood of her brother's sweatshirt. Covering it
text: from view, she holds a finger up to her lips in the
dialog: obligatory big sister way of telling him not to get her in
dialog: trouble... He beams!
text: She then stands up and places the batteries back on the
text: counter, smiles at her brother and gestures "let's go".
scene_heading: 7 EXT. MAIN STREET - LATE AFTERNOON 7
text: The daughter exits the General Store and follows her mother
text: and father, who are walking down the street only stepping on
text: the sand path. Their steps are almost silent.
text: After a moment... her four year old brother follows behind
text: her. We watch everyone walk in total silence.
dialog: Then...
scene_heading: 8 INT. GENERAL STORE - LATE AFTERNOON 8
text: We slowly push in to the counter of the store and then
dialog: realize... THE BATTERIES ARE GONE!
scene_heading: 9 EXT. ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON 9
text: A long road slices its way through a heavily wooded area,
text: which further blocks the already fading sun.
dialog: 6.
text: In WIDE PROFILE we see the family walking in a line,
text: continuing only on a sand path. The father is in front
text: carrying their sick son, then the mother with the backpack,
text: then their blonde daughter... and trailing a bit behind
text: rumbles their robust 4 year old.
scene_heading: 10 EXT. BRIDGE - LATE AFTERNOON 10
text: From the ground we look up at an old and rusted bridge
text: towering over us eerily... the sand path continues across it.
text: WE TRACK WITH THE FAMILY as they walk across the bridge...
text: There are minor creaks underneath the sand.
text: Suddenly we see... the four year old stops just before the
text: entrance of bridge. The family continues... not seeing him.
text: WE FOLLOW THE BOY'S HANDS as he fishes around in his hood and
text: pulls out... THE TOY SHUTTLE.
text: HEAD ON, we walk with the father, each member of his proud
text: brood can be seen walking behind him. We can hear his
text: strained breath... and the tiniest swish of the footsteps in
dialog: sand.
text: HEAD ON, walking with the daughter... we now suddenly hear
dialog: nothing. As she looks to be in her own world... So we are in
text: hers. A smile breaks on her face as she walks and breathes in
text: total silence. We walk with her for a long moment, when
text: suddenly behind her...
text: A FLICKERING RED AND BLUE LIGHT.
text: The girl does not turn. She just keeps walking. Still
text: smiling. As she looks up to her mother, we go into:
speaker_heading: SLOW MOTION
text: - FROM THE GIRLS'S POV, we see her mother and father spin
text: around with a frantic shock on their faces.
text: - BACK ON THE GIRL. She looks confused at her parents
text: behavior... LIGHTS AGAIN FLASH EERILY BEHIND HER.
text: - ON THE FATHER rushing to put the boy on the ground and
dialog: turning to run.
text: - ON THE MOTHER, spinning around with terror in her eyes...
text: she looks to be holding in a SCREAM.
text: - BACK ON THE GIRL slowly beginning to turn around at what
dialog: her parents could be looking at as we:
dialog: 7.
text: SPEED BACK UP TO NORMAL
text: A loud playful beeping rushes in... from the blinking
dialog: shuttle.
text: Then, from the woods we hear... THE MOST UNMISTAKEABLE
text: HORRIFYING.... SCREEEEEEEECH!!!
text: - ON THE MOTHER as she slowly lowers the backpack to the
text: ground... and her legs begin to fail her.
text: - ON THE FATHER running, violently shaking his head... It
text: looks like he's HOLDING IN A SCREAM.
text: - THE TREES BEHIND THEM... RUSTLE AND SNAP as something
dialog: barrels through.
text: - ON THE BOY... holding up his space ship proudly to his
text: incoming father... an enormous smile on his face.
text: - ON THE FATHER... 20 feet away... his face is a still frame
text: of pure fear as he runs to camera. Then:
scene_heading: THE MOST IMMEDIATE AND TERRIFYING COMBINATION OF SOUND ONE
text: COULD EVER IMAGINE.
dialog: ... A SHRIEK?... A SCREAM? ... A CRUNCH? Then...
text: ON THE FATHER as... a thin line of blood splatters on his
dialog: face.
text: - Mid run, the father's body immediately goes limp... failing
text: him as he comes to a halt just in front of camera.
dialog: - Then, as quickly as it came... THE SOUND IS GONE.
text: - IN WIDE PROFILE, The father stands lifeless... The two
text: children stand frozen with fear... the MOTHER drops to her
text: knees and... a space shuttle blinks silently in the sand.
text: The four year old... IS GONE.
text: Once again... only the wind can be heard.
speaker_heading: BLACK.
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: SILENCE.
speaker_heading: FADE IN: TITLE
speaker_heading: A QUIET PLACE
dialog: 9.
text: Still in BLACK... A new sound... Almost like that of the
dialog: ocean.
scene_heading: 11 EXT. BEACH - LATE AFTERNOON 11
text: The new sound continues. In the last of the day's sunlight:
text: WE TRACK, LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN, on... what appears to be an
text: empty beach. The pink lit sand, now combined with a sound
text: like the ocean, feels serene, almost otherworldly.
text: Slowly coming into frame, we see the face of... the daughter.
text: This is REGAN ABBOTT. Her hair is much longer. She is now
text: TWO YEARS OLDER, 12. She just looks... different.
text: REGAN lays in the sand with eyes closed... but she is not
dialog: asleep.
text: With her brow furrowed and her closed eyes darting back and
text: forth she looks oddly pained... almost as if she is wishing
dialog: herself to another place.
text: There is movement in her hands as her fingers caress an
dialog: object.
text: Her eyes suddenly POP OPEN as she sits up violently CLOSE UP
text: INTO OUR FRAME! She looks around with eyes wet and red,
text: attempting to regain her bearings.
text: WE SLOWLY MOVE AROUND her to see what she sees and are met
text: with... a jarringly incongruous landscape! Instead of a
text: glistening ocean, there in front of REGAN stand the tall
text: swaying stalks of... A CORNFIELD.
text: As REGAN looks to her lap WE SLOWLY TRAVEL DOWN to reveal...
text: she is holding THE TOY SHUTTLE. As she maneuvers it through
dialog: her fingers we see the shuttle is damaged... there are 2
text: large gouges in the fuselage.
text: Suddenly... Something startles her as she snaps her head to
dialog: the side!
text: WE GO CLOSE on her hand driving the TOY SHUTTLE into the
text: sand, not wanting it to be seen. Now ONLY THE SHUTTLE'S TAIL
text: is exposed in the foreground as we see a figure walking
text: toward REGAN.
text: Coming into focus is... her mother. This is EVELYN ABBOTT.
text: EVELYN too has changed. Hair longer... frame lower. She
text: carries a basket of vegetables. She is bare foot.
text: EVELYN stops and looks down at her daughter giving her a
text: comforting smile. REGAN can't seem to return the same.
dialog: 10.
text: EVELYN gently gestures with her head. REGAN nods... and
text: EVELYN walks on. After a moment... REGAN places the TOY
text: SHUTTLE into the large pocket in her dress and follows her
dialog: mother. As she goes:
text: WE PAN TO FOLLOW REGAN as she joins her mother and then
text: SLOWLY RISE to reveal that the two women are walking along...
text: A LONG AND WIDE SAND PATH IN THE MIDDLE OF A FARM! In the
text: distance we can see they are heading to... A WEATHERED RED
speaker_heading: BARN.
text: WE END OUR RISE just as we reveal in the foreground...
dialog: Christmas lights? Like parallel telephone wires, 2 cables of
text: large bulbs, one with red and one with white. They dance
text: playfully in the wind.
scene_heading: 12 INT. TRUCK - LATE AFTERNOON 12
text: CLOSE UP PROFILE of a steering wheel in the foreground. A
text: weathered CHEVY emblem reflects the fire orange sky in the
dialog: background.
text: HANDS come into frame and gently grip the steering wheel.
text: The right hand then slowly moves to the ignition block... and
text: turns. There is no sound. After a moment, the hand turns
text: again...again without sound. The hand turns a third time...
text: this time, the hand begins to bob ever so slightly... as if
text: the old car has started up. As the hand retracts:
dialog: WE PULL BACK to reveal... The little brother. This is MARCUS
text: ABBOTT, now 10. Moving ever so slightly, MARCUS is obviously
text: pretending to drive... though his impassive face betrays the
text: idea that he is having any fun. MARCUS seems to have aged
text: much more than the mere 2 years. His vacant eyes tell us a
text: large toll has been taken on him, though perhaps not as
text: easily recognizable on the exterior.
scene_heading: 13 EXT. TRUCK - LATE AFTERNOON 13
text: WE MOVE SLOWLY IN POV along another large sand path with high
text: grass on either side when suddenly it opens up into a large
text: clearing and we see... a tractor?... Shells of untouched farm
text: equipment litter the open area.
text: WE SLOWLY MOVE LEFT, making our way through, what is now
text: nothing more than an eery farming vehicle graveyard.
text: Suddenly... A DARK FIGURE ENTERS THE FRAME.
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: 14 INT. TRUCK - LATE AFTERNOON 14
text: MARCUS's hands move silently along the steering wheel as he
text: stares out the windshield. His body moves ever so slightly,
text: his face... relaxes... the hint of a smile. For a moment we
text: could almost believe he is driving. His eyes routinely check
text: the side mirror, then the rearview mirror... then stop. His
text: hands... and face fall.
text: THROUGH THE REAR VIEW MIRROR, we see a figure standing behind
text: the truck amidst the sea of farm equipment. Behind the figure
text: we see... A TOWERING SILO.
scene_heading: 15 EXT. TRUCK - LATE AFTERNOON 15
text: OVER THE DARK FIGURE onto the truck as we see MARCUS expertly
text: slip out of the cab window of a VINTAGE CHEVY PICKUP that
text: sits at the edge of a DESCENDING DRIVEWAY connecting to the
text: road that heads back toward the BARN. He lands in the sand
text: without a sound and begins to walk, head held low, toward the
text: dark figure... who reaches his hand out and briefly touches
text: Marcus' shoulder. Marcus walks straight past.
text: As MARCUS exits we BOOM UP the dark figure as it turns,
text: revealing... LEON ABBOTT (LEE), 38. LEE too has changed,
text: though much more obviously. He has lost weight on his strong
text: farmer frame, he wears a beard and his sunken eyes indicate
dialog: that he hasn't slept well... in a long time.
text: WE PULL BACK WIDE to reveal the sea of farm equipment sits in
text: front of a long, dilapidated, work shed roof... a makeshift
text: repair shop. The word `REPAIR' is written in flaking white
text: paint that clings to the wood above.
scene_heading: 16 EXT. BARN - SUNSET 16
text: The line of Christmas lights dance in the foreground.
text: WE TILT DOWN to see that the lights run right in between...
text: two towering doors of a weathered red BARN. The doors have
text: been left open by a gap of just over 2 feet. The edges of
text: the doors... are wrapped in foam...
text: Suddenly MARCUS walks into frame... and enters the barn.
scene_heading: 17 INT. BARN - SUNSET 17
text: WE TILT DOWN from the lines of unilluminated Christmas lights
text: running below the high reaching ceiling and...
dialog: 12.
text: ONTO MARCUS' BACK as he walks through two heavy quilts at the
text: entry of the barn hanging from the ceiling. Through the
text: quilts, a dirt floor guides us through this... barn? The
dialog: surroundings are too difficult to fully comprehend at first
dialog: glance.
text: To the left are several large horse stalls. WE QUICKLY PAN
text: INSIDE to see they are now... bedrooms. Mattresses,
text: perfectly made up, lie on the floor next to lamps and small
text: stacks of books. Clothes on hangers dangle between each of
dialog: the bars providing not only storage, but limited privacy.
text: To the right is a large pen with railings. Once a holding
text: area for cows awaiting milking, it is now... a living room.
text: Hay bales draped in blankets and old wooden chairs surround
text: an overturned pig trough, now serving as a coffee table
text: covered in books and dripping candles.
text: As MARCUS continues we notice the walls. Every inch is
text: meticulously covered in a bizarre but elegant cornucopia
text: of... trash. Foam, cardboard, and old newspapers are glued to
text: the wall in thick layers.
dialog: If one were able to look past the obvious first assumption of
dialog: a hovel or domicile of hoarders, they would see almost... a
dialog: deliberate beauty in the decor... A warmth. This is a well
dialog: maintained and loving... home.
text: WE FOLLOW ON MARCUS' BACK as he suddenly comes to... A
text: MATTRESS LAYING ON THE GROUND? MARCUS bends down and after a
text: brief struggle pushes the mattress to one side to reveal... A
dialog: large hole...
text: WE FOLLOW JUST BEHIND MARCUS... as he descends down the
dialog: ground...
scene_heading: 18 INT. BARN - SAFE ROOM - SUNSET 18
text: WE NOW SEE MARCUS has descended a makeshift stairwell into...
text: A small excavated room illuminated by work lights. Lodged up
text: against the walls and across the ceiling are wooden beams.
text: In between each beam are varying stages of an elaborate
text: process of insulation and sound proofing that consists of a
text: thick layer of newspaper as a base and then blankets and
text: pillows squeezed in on top. There is a hay bale up against
text: one wall and a mattress leaned up against another.
text: In the middle of the room, MARCUS walks past... EVELYN, who
text: is bent over behind an odd wooden box. Suddenly she stands
text: up, holding a beautiful and delicate... baby mobile.
text: As she turns and reaches the mobile high in the air to a beam
text: above her we get a clear shot... of her protruding belly.
dialog: 13.
dialog: Even a layman guess would put her over 8 months. EVELYN
text: gently taps the mobile as we:
text: ARE NOW CLOSE ON the small ducks and clouds moving through
text: the air, EVELYN below looking up... with a smile.
text: MARCUS sits down next to REGAN who is on the floor next to a
text: stack of old newspapers and bottles of glue.
text: She removes a large sheet of newspaper from a plastic tray of
text: glue, lets it drip... and then applies it to the wall with a
text: thick paintbrush. As she moves the paintbrush vertically down
text: the dripping white, a piece of an image can be seen... It is
text: a bra ad. REGAN slowly looks over to MARCUS... who stares at
dialog: it.
text: BACK ON EVELYN as she removes the top of the odd wooden box.
text: WE FOLLOW her hands in to reveal... a heavily quilted inside
text: with adorable baby blankets, a small teddy bear... and a
dialog: clear plastic air mask??
text: EVELYN's fingers fumble with something in the corner until
text: she finally threads through... a thin plastic tube... and
text: connects it to the air mask. It looks similar to an
dialog: emergency breathing apparatus one might see in an ambulance
dialog: or hospital... because it is.
text: BACK ON MARCUS, as he now removes a large piece of dripping
text: newspaper out of the tray and places it on the wall. Like his
text: sister, he swipes his thick paintbrush vertically down the
text: dripping white, this time partially revealing a front page
text: headline. It reads...
speaker_heading: `AGE OF MASS'
text: MARCUS looks at it inquisitively... and then swipes the
text: paintbrush horizontally across the whole headline.
dialog: It reads:
text: `IMAGE OF MASSACRED MILITARY SHOCKS THE WORLD'
text: MARCUS freezes... then looks below to see the top of a grainy
dialog: newspaper photograph. All we can make out is... a twisted
text: human arm. His hand slowly begins to shake as he raises the
text: paintbrush to reveal the rest of the image... when suddenly:
text: A PILLOW FLIES INTO FRAME!!!!!!
text: MARCUS JUMPS!!!!!... Only to see his mom holding a pillow
text: over the newspaper with a knowing look. After a beat, she
text: hands MARCUS a long piece of tape to secure the pillow to the
dialog: wall.
dialog: 14.
scene_heading: 19 EXT. REPAIR YARD SILO - ROOF - SUNSET TO DUSK 19
text: ON THE BACK OF... LEE, perched on what looks like the top of
dialog: the world.
dialog: From this great height we get our first WIDE SHOT of the
text: large farm that we now see sits in a clearing on a ridge...
text: surrounded by the tangled forest of the APPALACHIAN
speaker_heading: MOUNTAINS.
text: A puff of smoke rises from LEE's silhouette as he suddenly
text: raises a hand into frame... and checks his watch. A moment
text: later... As if on cue...
text: A line of CHRISTMAS LIGHTS flicker to life above the wide
text: sand path REGAN was laying on.
text: Another line of white Christmas lights flicker on... this
text: time revealing a path that connects the weathered red BARN...
text: to an old white FARMHOUSE. Then another line of lights...
text: and another! Like the image of a city power grid coming back
text: to life, we see a labyrinth of countless sand paths,
text: meticulously laid out, illuminate all over the farm in a
text: beautiful expanse.
text: NOW IN PROFILE, LEE stares down... seemingly at nothing. The
text: unfiltered cigarette burns to his fingers, causing LEE to
text: snap out of his stupor. He looks around at the horizon, it is
text: officially sundown. He reaches for a plastic bottle of...
text: Lighter fluid... and sprays all its contents into a shallow
text: metal drum in front of him.
text: Another cigarette appears from below frame. He puts it in his
text: mouth and then reaches his hands... into his jacket. His
text: right arm jiggles slightly. There is no sound. His arm
text: jiggles again. Then from his jacket, LEE pulls... a FULLY LIT
text: LIGHTER, that he protects from the wind. He lights his
text: cigarette and then leans his hands to the metal drum... A
scene_heading: HUGE FLAME ERUPTS.
text: In the glowing orange we see LEE take a long drag of his
text: cigarette. His face has no affect. After several moments the
text: flame begins to weaken and slowly fade.
text: Suddenly, far FAR off in the distance on the ridge... ANOTHER
text: FLAME ILLUMINATES. LEE doesn't even look up. Then, miles
text: past the first... ANOTHER FLAME!... THEN ANOTHER! Until we
text: can see behind LEE 5 glowing fires scattered far off across
dialog: the ridge.
text: ON LEE as he glances over and registers... then back to
dialog: staring front as we:
dialog: 15.
text: MOVE AROUND BEHIND him to see where his gaze is focused.
text: Then... we see it. There, in his left hand LEE holds... A 5X6
text: nursery school photo of a 4 year old boy.
text: LEE takes a last drag of his cigarette... and then places the
text: photo in a small box at his feet.
text: WE ARE TIGHT ON THE BOX as LEE stands and walks toward two
text: curved bars on the side of the SILO. He turns around... and
text: begins to descend A LADDER.
text: WE HOLD ON THE SMALL BOX... then just as LEE's head
text: disappears... WE SLOWLY BEGIN TO RISE.
text: Now looking at the opposite side of the ridge than we did in
text: the beginning, the rising moon's light now spills across the
text: vista of rock and trees and onto an enormous and bizarrely
dialog: out of place.... CRATER!
text: WE HOLD ON THE CRATER FOR A LONG MOMENT... Then:
scene_heading: 20 INT. BARN - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 20
text: WE ARE CLOSE on a small mound of dirt. Suddenly two hands
text: covered in winter gloves enter frame and begin to dig down
text: about 3 inches to reveal... a plank of wood.
text: WIDER NOW, we see EVELYN on her hands and knees just behind
text: the living room set up in an open, very make-shift kitchen.
text: One wall of shelves cluttered with stacks of paper plates,
text: bowls and cups. Another wall is a workbench acting as a
text: counter top and a mid 70's refrigerator.
text: EVELYN extracts from the dirt a long wooden box. Beneath
text: it... red hot rocks let off a combination of steam and smoke.
text: EVELYN brings the box to the counter top and carefully lifts
text: the lid to reveal... a perfectly cooked fish with lemon and
text: rosemary and garlic scattered all around.
scene_heading: 21 INT. BARN - BEDROOMS - NIGHT 21
text: WE TRACK with REGAN as she walks down the row of horse stall
dialog: bedrooms.
text: REGAN arrives at the threshold of LEE and EVELYN's bedroom.
text: LEE is faced away from her, washing his face in a long trough
text: like sink that runs the length of the room. Suddenly,
text: through the mirror leaning on the wall, LEE sees her... But
text: does not turn.
dialog: 16.
text: Through the mirror, the two of them looking silently at each
text: other for a moment too long... it is heartbreaking.
text: REGAN pathetically gestures "eating". As LEE nods, trying to
dialog: muster a polite smile we can see very clearly... something is
dialog: broken.
text: LEE wipes his face with a towel and then turns to face... an
text: empty doorway.
scene_heading: 22 INT. BARN - TABLE - NIGHT 22
text: The family sits down together for dinner... around an old
text: workbench. Their heads bowed in prayer, after a moment
text: EVELYN lifts her head and they begin to eat. There are no
text: plates. The food sits on various children's plastic
text: placemats. There are no utensils... The family uses only
text: bread to collect food. We slowly pull back on this silent...
text: but comfortingly familiar scene.
scene_heading: 23 INT. BARN - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 23
text: REGAN and MARCUS lie on the floor playing... Monopoly.
text: By the dim light of an oil lantern... we can see the game's
text: board is the same, but the pieces are small colored bobbles
dialog: of wool, the kind you would find on a children's Christmas
text: sweater. The houses and hotels are empty sugar packets, blue
dialog: and pink. And the money?... Small pieces of green, red, blue
text: and orange fabric rectangles... all equally sized.
text: MARCUS is five spaces away from his sister's hotel on
text: Boardwalk. He takes a sip of water and places the cup on top
text: of a tall crate being used as a makeshift side table. MARCUS
text: looks at his sister, who can't hide her smile. He mimes a
text: prayer before rolling the dice on the dirt floor, where it
dialog: makes no noise............... 5!
text: MARCUS slowly looks up to REGAN, knowing his fate. REGAN
text: smiles pointedly and then reaches for MARCUS' money. As
text: MARCUS thrusts his arm back to protect his bank, his elbow...
dialog: hits the oil lantern!!
text: A BOOMING CRASH!!!! As the oil lantern hits the ground and
text: shatters. THE SOUND FEELS HUGE!.. AS IT IS THE FIRST BIG
text: SOUND WE'VE HEARD! FIRE ERUPTS ON THE FLOOR!!! The children
dialog: stare frozen in horror!
text: LEE immediately jumps up from the table and instinctively
text: grabs a quilt and throws it on the fire. With a few silent
text: pats... the fire is gone.
dialog: 16A.
speaker_heading: SILENCE.
text: EVERYONE FREEZES!!!!... NO ONE IS BREATHING!!!
text: REGAN shoots MARCUS a look... of concern. MARCUS shoots LEE a
text: look... of terror. LEE shoots a look... to the roof.
dialog: 17.
text: ON LEE as he stands up INTO frame. He has almost physically
text: transformed from a man... into protection incarnate. He
text: slowly raises a stiff finger to his lips, his body so
dialog: tense... it looks painful. This is the unwanted version of
text: himself that lies just millimeters under his skin... 24 hours
dialog: a day.
dialog: After a long moment... nothing... It would have happened by
dialog: now...
text: LEE finally nods that everything is OK. MARCUS stares at
text: REGAN with a painfully apologetic face as she leans in and
text: touches his hand.
dialog: BANG!!!
dialog: The whole family startles in silence!!!
text: ... Something has hit the roof.
text: EVERYONE IS FROZEN... LOOKING AT THE CEILING.
text: Seconds later a high pitched SHRIEEEEEEK of CLAWS sliding
text: down the aluminum roof. The family follows the sound exactly
text: with their eyes. Then silence.
text: LEE crouches down and walks to a small window where the sound
text: stopped above. MARCUS wildly shakes his head "no", evidence
text: of his traumatic anxiety resurfacing. REGAN slowly stands,
text: looking on with wide eyes.
text: LEE arrives at the window, crouched. From his low vantage
text: point we can see the lip of the gutter... and the eerily
text: swaying Christmas lights.
text: LEE begins to stand up slowly, his face now virtually pressed
text: against the glass.
text: Suddenly, A WHIR OF SCREECHING AND GROWLING!!! A LARGE SHAPE
dialog: FALLS PAST THE WINDOW!!!!
text: ... As two raccoons hit the ground, fighting... then scamper
text: off into the dark.
text: LEE somehow exhales slowly and calmly... a trick that, no
text: doubt, took much practice... and walks away from the window.
scene_heading: 23A EXT. CORNFIELD 23A
text: The two raccoons round the corner onto a moonlit path heading
text: toward camera.. Just as they come into CLOSE UP...
dialog: 18.
text: A GIANT BLACK CLAW CRUSHES DOWN ONTO THE FIRST RACCOONS
text: HEAD... and then rips it out of frame. We hold on the second
text: raccoon running off with a soft but piercing scream.
scene_heading: 24 EXT. FARM - NIGHT 24
text: It is night. From high above, we look down to the sand path
text: between the RED BARN and the WHITE FARMHOUSE. In the
text: foreground we see the shadow of a telephone pole. Sitting on
text: the wire in silhouette... are BIRDS.
scene_heading: 25 EXT. SAND PATH - NIGHT 25
text: FROM THE GROUND, we see the FARMHOUSE in the distance... but
dialog: something is different. The color seems wrong... the angle is
text: odd. The foreground is over exposed and tiny dots fly in and
text: out of the frame.
text: Suddenly... A GIANT FOOT STEPS INTO FRAME!!!!
text: ... AND THEN ANOTHER... as we watch two bare feet... then the
text: hem of a dress... and then the silhouette of... EVELYN walk
text: silently toward the house.
scene_heading: 26 INT. FARMHOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT 26
text: WE SLOWLY PULL BACK from THAT SAME SHOT of the FARMHOUSE and
text: reveal... a plastic frame... A red light... buttons. We
text: realize this image is being viewed... on a small monitor.
text: CCTV FOOTAGE... from A SECURITY CAMERA.
text: WE CONTINUE TO PULL BACK SLOWLY as ... Another monitor comes
text: into frame... with another stacked on top of it... then one
text: next to it... and another... until we reveal, like something
text: out of a Dr. Seuss book, a wall of 20 TV's, all shapes and
text: brands sit on top of a large workbench covered with open
text: notebooks and sliced up newspapers. On each screen we see
text: elements of trees... sand paths... the barn... the silo.
text: This is a DIY version of a security console that overlooks
dialog: the entire farm... and it has taken a long time to put
dialog: together.
text: WE BEGIN TO TRACK past the empty security console and onto a
text: cinder block wall... covered in notes and newspaper
dialog: clippings. Then...
text: ... WE BARELY HEAR A TINY, ALMOST FAMILIAR, SOUND.
text: ... THEN A HANDFUL OF SMALL BEEPING SOUNDS.
dialog: 19.
text: Suddenly a portion of one visible newspaper clipping shows a
text: close up and much more detailed image of... the enormous
text: crater. The headline reads:
text: `NUMBER OF CONFIRMED GLOBAL LANDING SITES GROWS TO 128'
text: A post-it note sticks to the clipping that reads:
speaker_heading: LANDED 10-18-2018
text: WE PASS BY more clippings, catching glimpses of dramatic
text: headlines and surreal images:
scene_heading: `PRESIDENT CALLS FOR EMERGENCY EVAC IN ALL MAJOR CITIES'
text: `CHURCHES, MOSQUES, TEMPLES FLOODED WITH PEOPLE'
text: WE PASS BY a grainy newspaper photo of a military stand
text: off... With ONE creature. The headline reads:
scene_heading: `MILITARY EXPERTS AGREE: "INDESTRUCTIBLE"
text: ...AGAIN WE HEAR THAT FAMILIAR SOUND as it gets louder.
text: WE CONTINUE TO TRAVEL as... A MAP enters frame. Like one you
text: would get at a gas station, it is covered in illustrated
text: forests and rivers... it is a map of THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
text: The portion above Manhattan... is covered in hand drawn red
text: circles and pins, each accompanied with a date and names...
dialog: of the dead.
text: WE MOVE FURTHER ALONG to reveal... low quality stills of
text: security footage barely showing... THE CREATURE. Each still
text: is drawn on and analyzed. Then... a large white board
text: covered in writing comes into frame, leaning against the
text: wall. Amidst the scratches of written and rewritten thoughts,
text: we can make out two lists labeled, `QUESTIONS' and
speaker_heading: `CONFIRMED'
text: In the `QUESTIONS' column are listed; "NO DEMANDS?", "NO SIGN
text: OF ORGANIZATION", "BLIND?" "HOW MANY?"... "SOUND... WHY NOT
dialog: ATTACK ALL SOUND?"
text: In the `CONFIRMED' column are phrases like; "4-6 CONFIRMED IN
text: PACK"..., "DO NOT ATTACK SMALL SOUNDS". Then we see the phrase
text: "DO NOT EAT KILL".
text: WE MOVE TO the very bottom of the white board where we see
dialog: the word... "WEAPON???"...
text: Listed below words are crossed out... "EXPLOSIVES"...
dialog: "FIRE"... "CHEMICAL"...
dialog: 20.
text: AGAIN WE HEAR THAT FAMILIAR SOUND... NOW LOUDER.
text: ... THEN AGAIN THE HANDFUL OF SMALL BEEPING SOUNDS.
text: WE MOVE OFF OF THE white board and scan past ANATOMICAL
text: DRAWINGS of A SHARK SENSING PREY USING MAGNETIC FIELDS,
scene_heading: DOLPHINS NAVIGATING THROUGH MINE FIELDS, THE ELECTROMAGNETIC
text: SPECTRUM and finally images of... THE INNER EAR...
text: WE NOW MOVE THROUGH meticulously organized shelves covered in
text: tools... and wires... and various pieces of salvaged
dialog: electronic equipment and finally onto...
text: LEE'S BACK. He is hunched over the workbench working
text: intensely on something... he is wearing large black
text: headphones. We see him reach out of frame as we:
text: WE PUSH PAST an old microphone that is connected to... AN OLD
text: TRANSATLANTIC HAM RADIO. In the glowing light from the box we
text: see all kinds of knobs and needles. Below a switch labeled
text: with two stickers that say "RADIO" and "SPEAKER", LEE'S hand
text: comes into frame and turns a large knob revealing... THE
scene_heading: SOURCE OF OUR FAMILIAR SOUND...
text: LEE IS SEARCHING FOR A SIGNAL. ANY SIGN. ANY SIGN... OF LIFE.
text: Suddenly... he presses down on a button on the microphone...
text: ... THE HANDFUL OF SMALL BEEPING SOUNDS... IS MORSE CODE.
dialog: ... THERE IS NO RESPONSE.
text: WE follow LEE's hand off of the button and onto... a small
text: soldering iron. As he picks it up:
text: WE GO TO LEE at his workspace. With magnifying glasses in
text: front of his eyes, he works with surgery like precision... on
text: a small contraption. A small string of smoke rises from his
dialog: work.
scene_heading: 27 INT. FARMHOUSE - BASEMENT - STEPS - NIGHT 27
text: WE ARE OVER the warmly, lit from above, stairwell with LEE at
text: his work station in the background as...
text: Delicate bare feet touch down softly, and deliberately on the
dialog: steps... Like a child knowing where to step so they don't
dialog: wake their parents.
text: WE BOOM UP to reveal... EVELYN as she stares at her husband,
dialog: who hasn't heard her, worried?... Admiring?... Lost?
dialog: 21.
text: A flicker of a memory echoes through her face as she smiles
text: and then walks to him... EVELYN IS WEARING EAR BUDS.
text: ON LEE as a hand touches down gently on his shoulder... he
text: doesn't flinch at all. There is immediate recognition
dialog: there... Safety. The hands then reach down... and remove
text: Lee's headphones. The sound of the searching radio in the
text: headphones is nearly inaudible.
text: LEE sits back and holds up... A HEARING AID. It looks like a
text: somewhat common hearing aid... but with handcrafted
text: modifications...upgrades. There is a wire extension that
text: extends from the top... almost like an adapter or plug.
text: The hands gently grab LEE's face and turn it. LEE looks up
text: at EVELYN who he now sees... is wearing lipstick, has pulled
text: her hair back... and has changed into a beautiful dress.
text: This... is DATE NIGHT. LEE smiles as EVELYN takes a step
text: back and with the gentlest of movements, she sweetly beckons
dialog: him to her.
text: LEE looks back at his work for just a moment, his face once
text: again... focused. Then he lays the hearing aid down on the
text: table... and stands up.
text: WE HOLD ON THE HEARING AID and then SLOWLY PULL BACK to
text: reveal... a pile of more hearing aids, each with a variety of
text: different modifications, scattered all around his work bench.
text: This is something he has been working on for a long while.
text: WE TILT UP from the workbench to see... LEE arrive at his
text: wife's side as she puts her hand up on his neck and smiles up
text: at him warmly, as if there is no where else to be... nothing
dialog: to make her happier.
text: FACE TO FACE NOW, LEE finally allows a smile, looking down at
dialog: his time tested partner.
text: EVELYN's eyes close as she places her forehead to his and the
text: two begin to gently sway... in total silence.
text: Suddenly... EVELYN takes LEE's hands from around her back...
text: and places them on her protruding belly. After a moment she
text: looks up lovingly at her husband to see...
text: LEE'S SMILE HAS DISAPPEARED. STARING DOWN AT THE BELLY, HIS
text: FACE LOOKS... LOST.
text: Knowing this man inside and out, EVELYN keeps her gaze firmly
text: into her husband's eyes and slowly moves her hands up LEE'S
text: arms and gently onto his face. Holding more than his visage
text: in her hands... LEE finally looks up at her.
dialog: 22.
text: EVELYN smiles with recognition of the man she married as her
text: right hand travels to her right ear. She removes the earbud
text: from her ear... and seamlessly places it in his, as:
dialog: MUSIC RUSHES IN!
text: The only record on the record player, this is the song they
dialog: were married to. This is...
text: NEIL YOUNG'S HARVEST MOON
dialog: Perhaps it's due to the lack of sound thus far in the
text: movie... or maybe the marrying image of the two dancing, but
dialog: the sounds of the song are crystal clear. We can perfectly
dialog: hear every chord, every tremor of vocal chord as we:
dialog: PULL BACK on this perfect moment... through the basement...
text: to the small rectangular basement window to reveal... water
text: hitting the glass.
scene_heading: 28 EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 28
text: We see a strong rain pouring down around the house.
scene_heading: 29 EXT. FARM - MORNING 29
text: A beautiful crisp morning.
scene_heading: 30 EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAND PATH - DAY 30
text: FROM THE PORCH of the farmhouse, as water drips down from
text: overhead, WE SLOWLY travel along the sand path toward the
text: barn when suddenly we arrive at... a small stream of water
text: cutting right through a, now washed away, segment of the sand
dialog: path.
text: Suddenly LEE's bare feet enter frame... and then a large
text: hiking backpack enters frame next to him.
text: ON LEE as we see a momentary glimpse into the painstaking,
dialog: and never ending, workload that goes into maintaining this
dialog: farm.
text: CLOSE on hands as LEE's bare fingers gouge into the
text: unforgiving earth at the edge of the sand path to divert the
text: water. Stones come into frame to form a temporary wall.
text: Then... LEE hoists, the very obviously heavy, hiking bag onto
text: his knee. He then slowly and silently undoes a handmade flap
text: at the bottom of the backpack. From the opening of the bag
text: pours... SAND.
dialog: 23.
text: Quickly and silently, sand piles up on the ground as we
text: witness for the first time, LEE's ingenious system that has
dialog: kept his family safe all this time.
scene_heading: 31 INT. BARN - SAFE ROOM - DAY 31
text: CLOSE UP OF A GAUGE... Very faint bursts of air can be heard.
text: WE SLOWLY PULL BACK to reveal EVELYN sitting on a hay bale...
text: with a blood pressure sleeve on her arm and a stethoscope in
text: her ears. Behind her is a shelf full of bandages and IV bags.
text: She stops pumping the bulb, stares down at the gauge... and
text: then gently lets the air out and removes the sleeve.
text: EVELYN marks her daily blood pressure on a calendar next to
dialog: her. On this calendar we see... her estimated due date is 4
dialog: weeks away.
text: After a moment, she leans over and places the bottom part of
text: the stethoscope... onto her belly.
text: A faint sound of adjusting and then...
text: LUB DUB... LUB DUB... THE BABY'S HEARTBEAT ENGULFS US!!!
scene_heading: 32 EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 32
text: WE CREEP SLOWLY ALONG the sand path heading toward the front
text: door of the FARMHOUSE. Suddenly... REGAN steps into frame,
text: walking deliberately... as if tiptoeing.
scene_heading: 33 INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 33
text: REGAN reaches the front door of the FARMHOUSE... and stops at
text: the threshold. As she looks down at the worn wood floor,
dialog: scanning, we can notice... deliberately painted markings on
dialog: the floor.
text: Just then, REGAN takes a dramatically long step inside,
text: placing her foot down... directly on the first colored
text: marking... silence. Looking almost relieved, REGAN once
text: again scans the floor and then focuses on another marking.
text: She takes another long step, this time far to her right...
text: and touches down on the next marking... silence. It almost
text: looks like she's playing `TWISTER'. Getting more confident,
text: she scans the room, finds another spot and steps quickly.
dialog: 24.
scene_heading: 34 INT. FARMHOUSE - BASEMENT STAIRS - DAY 34
text: WE LOOK DIRECTLY up the basement stairs toward the warm
text: hallway at the top.
text: Suddenly... REGAN takes a long step into frame. Her
text: silhouette looks down the dark stairwell.
text: After a moment, she slowly puts her foot down on the first
dialog: step... when suddenly...
text: A DARK FIGURE APPEARS BEHIND HER AND GRABS HER!!!!!
scene_heading: 35 EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 35
text: CLOSE ON REGAN... as she is placed down onto the sand path.
text: A HAND COVERS HER MOUTH!
text: AS REGAN spins around we see... LEE kneeling in front of her.
speaker_heading: LEE (SIGNING)
dialog: You CANNOT go down there!
speaker_heading: REGAN (SIGNING)
dialog: WHY NOT???
speaker_heading: LEE (SIGNING)
dialog: You know why.
speaker_heading: REGAN (SIGNING)
dialog: I won't make a sound!!! I'm not a
dialog: child!!!
text: LEE pauses... that line stings.
speaker_heading: LEE (SIGNING)
dialog: Just... don't.
text: The two stare into each other's eyes communicating more than
dialog: any sign language could.
text: Suddenly... LEE reaches up to her face?... His still dirty
text: hands push the hair back over her right ear? It seems so
text: uncharacteristically warm and gentle when suddenly...
text: LEE reaches into his pocket with his right hand and pulls
text: out... THE HEARING AID from the night before.
speaker_heading: LEE (SIGNING) (CONT'D)
dialog: This time, I was able to use small
text: amplifiers from the stereo speaker
dialog: to--
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: REGAN (SIGNING)
dialog: It won't work.
speaker_heading: LEE (SIGNING)
dialog: No, our problem has always been
dialog: power, but this should increase the
dialog: frequency to--
speaker_heading: REGAN (SIGNING)
dialog: It never works!!
speaker_heading: LEE (SIGNING)
dialog: ... But we'll keep trying til it
dialog: does.
text: REGAN looks up at him blankly... as LEE reaches to bring the
text: new hearing aid up to her ear when suddenly...
text: REGAN pushes his hand away.
text: LEE reaches up to her ear to try again... REGAN pushes his
text: hand away again, giving him a cold stare. With so much
text: history behind it... It's a bizarrely heartbreaking
dialog: altercation.
text: He tries again... she pushes again... even harder.
text: LEE looks at his daughter as she looks at him... her venomous
text: face, betrayed by the large tears that roll down her cheek.
text: After a long moment... REGAN snatches the hearing aid from
text: her father's hand and walks away.
scene_heading: 36 INT. BARN - HAY LOFT - DAY 36
text: ON MARCUS' back as he scribbles in a notebook. WE GO CLOSE to
text: see... MARCUS is writing in a math notebook. His pencil
text: suddenly pauses, moves up the page through a long math
text: problem... and stops again. Suddenly... a finger comes into
text: frame.... and points at a different part of the problem.
text: WE PULL OUT to reveal... EVELYN and MARCUS sitting in a small
text: curated area with a desk, book shelves and a white board
text: covered in various phrases, shapes and equations. We suddenly
text: realize EVELYN... is HOME SCHOOLING him!
text: MARCUS suddenly nods and once again begins writing as EVELYN
text: looks out the small door of the hay loft and down to the sand
text: path below... As LEE arrives. Suddenly...
speaker_heading: MARCUS (SIGNING)
dialog: ...please don't make me go...
dialog: 26.
text: EVELYN looks over to see MARCUS's face... awash with panic.
speaker_heading: EVELYN (SIGNING)
dialog: You will be fine. Your father will
dialog: always protect you.
text: MARCUS GRABS HER ARM TIGHT!... IT STARTLES HER. With tears
text: in his eyes, he mouths to her... "PLEASE!"
speaker_heading: EVELYN (SIGNING) (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen to me... It is important
dialog: that you learn these things. He
dialog: just wants you to be able to take
dialog: care of yourself...
text: MARCUS looks at her.
speaker_heading: EVELYN (SIGNING) (CONT'D)
dialog: Take care of ME!
text: EVELYN lightens the conversation by pretending to age in
dialog: front of our eyes.
speaker_heading: EVELYN (SIGNING) (CONT'D)
dialog: ... when I'm old... and grey...
text: EVELYN leans on him. MARCUS can't help but smile.
speaker_heading: EVELYN (CONT'D)
dialog: ...and I have no teeth...
dialog: EVELYN pretending to have no teeth... is too much for MARCUS
text: to hold back his silent laugh.
scene_heading: 37 EXT. BARN - DAY 37
text: OVER LEE'S large shoulder we barely see MARCUS... moving ever
text: so slightly in one direction and then another.
text: ON LEE, with a large hiking pack on his back. He adjusts the
text: straps of a backpack on MARCUS.
speaker_heading: LEE (SIGNING)
dialog: Too tight?
text: MARCUS shakes his head no.
speaker_heading: LEE (SIGNING) (CONT'D)
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (SIGNING)
dialog: No... I don't want to go.
dialog: 27.
text: LEE looks up at EVELYN. Then back to MARCUS.
speaker_heading: LEE (SIGNING)
dialog: There's nothing to be scared of.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (SIGNING)
dialog: ...of course there is.
text: Suddenly behind LEE we see... REGAN appear.
speaker_heading: REGAN (SIGNING)
dialog: I'll go.
text: LEE looks over at his daughter and pauses.
speaker_heading: LEE (SIGNING)
dialog: No, no. I need you to stay here
dialog: and help your mother.
text: LEE stands up. To EVELYN:
speaker_heading: LEE (SIGNING) (CONT'D)
dialog: We'll be back before dinner.
speaker_heading: REGAN (SIGNING)
dialog: I want to go.
speaker_heading: LEE (SIGNING)
dialog: Just stay here. You'll be safe.
text: LEE turns to EVELYN... who looks at him with slight
dialog: disappointment.
speaker_heading: LEE (SIGNING) (CONT'D)
dialog: ... Next time.
text: LEE pauses... and then kisses EVELYN. LEE and MARCUS walk
text: down a sand path toward the woods.
text: EVELYN turns to REGAN... who is already walking away.
scene_heading: 38 INT. BARN - REGAN'S ROOM - DAY 38
text: REGAN enters... And throws the hearing aid her father made
text: her onto the dirt floor. This is the first time we have seen
text: her bedroom. It is sparse. A hay bale covered in bed
text: sheets... a small crate with a neat pile of books inside and
text: several candles on top... a small wooden mirror leant against
dialog: the wall.
text: REGAN drops to her knees. On the ground we now see all kinds
dialog: of electronic equipment and tools.
dialog: 28.
text: Architectural drawings are pinned to the wall. It is like a
text: mini version of her father's work bench.
text: REGAN grabs her pillow, rips the pillow case off... and
text: begins furiously packing.
text: She grabs clothes, a water bottle, a notepad and then... THE
text: TOY SHUTTLE. She gets up to leave and then looks back... at
text: the hearing aid on the ground.
text: CLOSE ON REGAN's PROFILE as her hand comes into frame and
text: moves to the hearing aid she currently wears. Suddenly... a
text: long wire is slowly pulled from deep in her ear canal.
text: REGAN's eyes wince with almost a snap of pressure as the wire
text: comes loose.
text: REGAN then gently feeds the new hearing aid into her ear...
dialog: and pauses.
text: Suddenly... REGAN clicks on the new hearing aid.
text: ........................................Nothing.
text: WE WATCH the thin veil of anger on REGAN's face cascade into
text: honest sorrow as REGAN's eyes squeeze shut brutal
dialog: disappointment.
text: WE PULL OUT to see REGAN sitting quietly on the floor. The
text: quake of her shoulders betray her... as we watch her cry.
text: After a moment... she reaches for a pillow case... and exits.
scene_heading: 39 EXT. WOODS - VALLEY PATHWAY - DAY 39
text: FROM A DISTANCE LEE leads MARCUS down a thin sand path that
text: cuts down the steep valley side and through the lush and
text: learned evergreens of the mountain's canopy.
text: MARCUS walks rigid, like one would in the dark. His saucer
text: eyes furtively clock every detail of his surroundings. LEE
text: walks casually and confidently, periodically turning to wait
text: patiently for his son. This is a day of teaching.
text: ON MARCUS as LEE puts a hand quickly, but gently on his son's
text: chest, stopping him in his tracks. LEE focuses down the
dialog: path.
text: OFF MARCUS's quaking face peering around his father:
text: WE TOO MOVE around from behind LEE to see... a DEER...
text: sitting in the middle of the sand path. An adolescent buck,
text: it holds it's impressive, but still delicate antlers upright
text: and proud as it stares directly at LEE and MARCUS.
dialog: 29.
dialog: An image obviously long thought impossible, the moment
text: carries a certain calm... almost spiritual.
text: After a long moment, the buck efforts its way to its feet.
text: Then turns and deftly steps... perfectly along the sand
dialog: path... And disappears.
scene_heading: 40 EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 40
text: CLOSE ON the roof of the farmhouse. Water from the previous
text: night's storm still drips off the edge.
text: WE SLOWLY TRAVEL down the drainpipe running along the side of
text: the house when suddenly... the drain stops... and we see PVC
text: pipe has been attached instead. WE CONTINUE along the PVC
text: piping to the bottom where we see THE PVC PIPE bend... AND GO
text: STRAIGHT THROUGH A SHATTERED PANE OF THE BASEMENT WINDOW.
scene_heading: 41 INT. FARMHOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY 41
text: FROM INSIDE THE SHATTERED PANE, we now follow the PVC pipe
text: into... an old washing machine... now filled with rain water.
text: Suddenly... a piece of clothing slowly comes into frame and
text: silently descends into the water.
text: WE WIDEN OUT TO SEE EVELYN places more clothes into a
text: WASHER... that is unplugged. We see that she is simply using
text: the corrugated tumbler inside as a wash board.
text: She removes a large plaid shirt just above the water line
text: (still inside the tumbler) and squeezes it dry. The action is
text: virtually inaudible.
text: CLOSE UP on a small pile of clothes being stacked onto other
text: clothes. Then a CINCH.
text: EVELYN stands up over the newly packed cloth laundry bag...
text: then bends backward, attempting to relieve a pain in her
text: back. When she's done, she picks up the full laundry bag
text: with one hand... and another full laundry bag with the other.
text: EVELYN struggles to the foot of the stairs with the two bags
text: and puts them down. She then takes a deep breath looks up
text: the stairwell and begins to ascend... again carefully placing
text: her feet on specific spots on each step. Holding one bag as
text: high as she can and dragging the second behind her... It's
text: uncomfortable watching a fully pregnant woman traverse in
dialog: this manner.
text: WE GO CLOSE ON several stairs as EVELYN'S feet step up... and
dialog: drag the bag up the first step... then the second.
dialog: 30.
text: Her feet disappear. As she drags the bag up onto the
text: third... IT CATCHES ON A BENT NAIL IN THE STAIR!!
text: ON EVELYN, not seeing the cause, pulls again... AND BEGINS TO
dialog: FALL!!!!!!
text: She catches herself on the wall, her eyes lit up... breathing
dialog: heavily... she's ok!
text: She quietly picks up the bags again and pulls once more.
text: CLOSE UP ON: THE TIP OF A NAIL IN THE STEP LIFTING OFF THE
text: STEP, ALMOST STRAIGHT UP... AND THEN RELEASING THE BAG.
text: ON EVELYN, satisfied, as she drags the bags to the top of the
text: stairs and disappears.
text: WE RACK FOCUS to reveal, in the foreground...
text: THE NAIL STANDING STRAIGHT UP!!!
scene_heading: 42 EXT. FARM - DRIVEWAY - LATE AFTERNOON 42
text: CLOSE ON BARE FEET... walking along a sand path.
text: WE BOOM UP TO REVEAL... REGAN walking with purpose. In her
text: hands she carries a pillowcase. Inside the pillowcase... an
dialog: irregular shape.
text: After a moment, she looks up to... the telephone pole.
text: Sitting on the power line are... MORE BIRDS. There is
text: something buoyant about them. Something... oblivious.
scene_heading: 43 EXT. RIVER - LATE AFTERNOON 43
text: An immediate and jarring sound of water rushes in as we are:
text: TIGHT ON MOVING WATER over rocks.
scene_heading: [NOTE: THE SOUND WILL CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRETY OF
speaker_heading: THIS SCENE]
text: WE TILT UP to the tall grass of a riverbed. Suddenly... LEE
text: and MARCUS exit from the trees.
text: ON MARCUS as he takes in the picturesque landscape. He has
text: never been here before. Suddenly, his eyes slowly move down
text: to the ground.
text: CLOSE ON HIS BARE FEET... at the very edge of the sand path.
text: There is nowhere else to go.
dialog: 31.
text: MARCUS watches as LEE takes off his backpack and places it at
text: the edge of the river. Then, he kneels down and looks
text: intently into the water. Suddenly... LEE's face softens. He
text: takes one more look back at his son... and then plunges his
text: hands into the river.
text: MARCUS looks on confused as his father seems to yank and pull
text: at something. Suddenly... LEE's hands burst out of the water
text: holding a handmade wooden contraption. MARCUS starts to back
text: away... Pulling that contraption out of the water DEFINITELY
text: MADE A SOUND!!! MARCUS' eyes shoot around into the trees, up
text: the river, looking... listening... when suddenly...
text: LEE PULLS OUT A LARGE TROUT FROM THE TRAP... THE FISH
text: THRASHES WILDLY AND THEN... IT BREAKS FREE FROM LEE'S HAND!
text: IT DROPS DOWN ONTO LEE'S BAG FLAPPING AND THRASHING...
dialog: AND MAKING NOISE!!!!
text: MARCUS goes white! WHAT HAS HIS FATHER DONE???? MARCUS
dialog: signs...
speaker_heading: MARCUS (SIGNING)
dialog: They're going to hear you...
dialog: They're going to HEAR YOU!!
text: In one swift move, LEE pins the trout to the ground and grabs
text: his son, pulling him in close. LEE silently calms his son
text: down, coaxing him to take deep breaths. As MARCUS trembles...
text: LEE raises his hand... and signs...
speaker_heading: LEE (SIGNING)
dialog: Not... if there is a constant sound
text: nearby that is louder.
text: MARCUS doesn't understand. LEE shows him. First, he reaches
text: down to the ground and places his hand off the path moving
text: the dirt slightly. He repeats...
speaker_heading: LEE (SIGNING) (CONT'D)
text: Small sounds... safe.
text: LEE's hand moves back to the trout... Repeats
speaker_heading: LEE (SIGNING) (CONT'D)
dialog: Big sounds... not. Unless...
text: LEE's hands move to the moving water of the river... Repeats
speaker_heading: LEE (SIGNING) (CONT'D)
text: There is a constant sound nearby
dialog: that is louder... To mask it.
dialog: 32.
text: Suddenly the trout flaps again. MARCUS looks down... then up
text: to his dad... His brain processing.
speaker_heading: LEE (SIGNING) (CONT'D)
dialog: You know what?...
text: LEE checks his watch... then looks up river... then back to
dialog: his son.
speaker_heading: LEE (SIGNING) (CONT'D)
dialog: ...I want to show you something.
scene_heading: 44 EXT. FARMHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 44
text: Disoriented, WE MOVE THROUGH a wall of dancing color. Then
text: suddenly we see... EVELYN, as she holds up a piece of
text: clothing and pins it to a clothes line. The scene is
dialog: oddly... beautiful.
text: As the clothes on the line dance, we can suddenly see, behind
text: EVELYN... AN OLD FALLEN TREE THROUGH THE BACKSIDE OF THE
speaker_heading: HOUSE.
scene_heading: 45 INT. FARMHOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALL - LATE AFTERNOON 45
text: WE TRACK SLOWLY along through the bannister of the upstairs
text: hallway when suddenly... EVELYN'S head appears. WE CONTINUE
text: with her as she slowly walks up the stairs... almost as if
text: compelled. As she ascends, looking right past camera, we get
text: a clear look into the bedrooms behind her. In one room, we
text: catch glimpses of a POP MUSIC POSTER, a PINK DESK... and an
text: empty bed frame. In the next, we see a Nerf basketball hoop,
text: a life sized Pokemon doll... and half built LEGOs strewn
text: across the floor. ...Neither room has doors.
text: EVELYN finally crests the top of the stairs and walks out of
dialog: frame.
scene_heading: 46 INT. WATERFALL - LATE AFTERNOON 46
text: A bizarre and beautiful image and sound! Light dances and
text: bends through a cascading rampart we finally identify as... A
speaker_heading: WATERFALL.
text: WE PAN OVER to see LEE and MARCUS enter from outside and
text: slide along the rock wall.
text: MARCUS looks up to his father, incredulous. LEE looks down
text: at him. After a moment, with a mischievous smile on his face,
dialog: LEE...
dialog: 33.
dialog: HOOTS LOUDLY!!!
text: THIS IS THE FIRST VOCALIZED SOUND WE WILL HAVE HEARD IN THE
dialog: MOVIE!!!!
text: MARCUS' eyes shoot up to his father, immediately scared
dialog: again!
text: His father looks out at the waterfall... and HOOTS
dialog: AGAIN!!!... The way one would walking in a tunnel with their
dialog: child.
text: LEE turns to MARCUS and crouches down, gently holding his
text: trembling son's shoulders.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: ... You're alright.
text: THESE ARE THE FIRST WORDS WE HAVE HEARD IN THE MOVIE... AND
text: THE FIRST WORDS MARCUS HAS HEARD IN 4 YEARS!!!!
text: WE ARE ON MARCUS' face... staring... shaking... somewhere
text: between terror and wonderment.
speaker_heading: LEE (CONT'D)
dialog: ... I promise.
text: His father smiles and nods comfortingly...
text: Finally MARCUS... meekly HOOTS!
text: His father's head gently tilts, as if to say "you can do
dialog: better".
text: MARCUS looks back out the rushing water, then back to his
dialog: father... and HOOTS LOUDLY!!!
speaker_heading: LEE (CONT'D)
dialog: Now... that's more like it.
text: The smile on MARCUS and LEE's face can only be described
dialog: as... once in a lifetime.
scene_heading: 47 EXT. ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON 47
text: WE MOVE SLOWLY ALONG A ROAD, PANNING DOWN from gargantuan
text: trees... until we finally reveal... REGAN walking towards
dialog: camera.
text: Suddenly coming into frame all around her is... THE BRIDGE.
dialog: 34.
text: WE FOLLOW REGAN as she walks across the bridge, now more
text: overgrown with weeds and roots. Then suddenly... REGAN comes
text: to a stop... and kneels down in sand as:
text: WE CONTINUE TO MOVE BACK SLOWLY. Suddenly coming into frame
dialog: is the top of....
dialog: A HAND MADE CROSS!!!
text: REGAN reaches into her pillow case and pulls out... THE TOY
speaker_heading: SHUTTLE.
text: WE FOLLOW REGAN'S HANDS as she deftly removes one of the
text: colored plastic pieces underneath. It quietly slides off to
text: reveal... a battery panel and several multicolored wires. She
text: reaches into the front pocket of her dress and pulls out
text: pliers and quickly cuts the green wire.
text: REGAN reaches into the pocket of her dress again and pulls
text: out... batteries! She slides the batteries in confidently.
text: We follow REGAN's hands as they move to the base of the cross
dialog: and place... the TOY SHUTTLE in the sand. We now see that
text: the shuttle sits amongst a pile of other weathered toys...
dialog: and flowers.
text: REGAN PAUSES.................and then flips the tiny switch.
text: ...RED AND BLUE LIGHTS CASCADE OVER HER FACE...
dialog: ...But no sound.
scene_heading: 48 INT. FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 48
text: WE ARE TIGHT on EVELYN's back as she walks through another
text: door-less threshold. As she continues into the room, we begin
text: to see the walls... covered in rocket ships.
text: OVER EVELYN as her eyes stop... on a cartoon mobile of the
text: planets. She taps it... exactly as she tapped the mobile in
text: the baby's room... This time watching it orbit around...
text: without a smile.
text: WIDE ON THE ROOM for the first time we see... THE ROOM IS
text: METICULOUS. The bed is made... the toys perfectly placed on
dialog: the shelves.
text: CLOSE ON THE BED... AS EVELYN SITS DOWN SLOWLY. Light floods
text: through the original paned window... casting the shadow of a
text: cross on the floor in front of her.
text: EVELYN looks over to the small night stand by the bed where a
text: lamp and a hand made mirror sit.
dialog: 35.
text: Suddenly, she lifts up the mirror... and dusts the table with
text: the washcloth from the line.
text: EVELYN stares out the window oddly... at peace. As LEE has
text: his ritual atop the silo to contemplate on the irreversible
dialog: loss of his son... EVELYN has this. EVELYN... keeps her
dialog: son's spirit alive.
scene_heading: 49 INT. WATERFALL - LATE AFTERNOON 49
text: CLOSE ON a water bladder poking into the rushing wall of
dialog: water. Filling immediately, we:
text: PULL BACK and FOLLOW LEE... as he sits down on a rock next to
text: his son and hands him the bladder. MARCUS drinks as LEE
text: looks on... a brightness washing over him. This is a moment
dialog: of... calm. A moment... of family. A moment... of real
dialog: life.
text: WE FOLLOW the bladder as MARCUS hands it up to his father,
text: who happily takes a large swig. Suddenly we HEAR:
speaker_heading: MARCUS (O.S.)
dialog: Why didn't you let her come with
dialog: us?
text: LEE looks down at his son.
speaker_heading: LEE (O.S.)
dialog: Because... I need to keep her safe.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (O.S.)
dialog: ... Is it because you blame her for
dialog: what happened?
text: LEE freezes instantly... his heart stops.
text: Finally he looks down at his son... in shock? In awe?
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Because she blames herself...
text: LEE's eyes blink and flutter as he tries to gain control of
dialog: his thoughts...
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: No, I don't bl--... It was no one's
dialog: fault.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: ... You still love her, right?
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Of-- Of course I do.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: ... You should tell her.
scene_heading: 50 INT. FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 50
text: CLOSE ON EVELYN IN THE HAND MADE MIRROR, as she stares at the
text: frame... made up of colorful zoo animals staring back at her.
text: At the top of the mirror, the name... "BEAU"
text: FROM THE DOORWAY, WE ARE WIDE ON THE ROOM as EVELYN stands up
text: and slowly makes her way to the door carrying the small
dialog: mirror.
text: Just as she reaches the doorway... she stops. Her body
text: tightens. Her face... changes. Her hand shakes as it
text: reaches out to the side of the doorway. WE HOLD ON HER a
dialog: moment and then go:
text: CLOSE ON her feet rocking slightly in the doorway.
dialog: Suddenly......
dialog: FLUID HITS THE FLOORBOARDS!!!!
scene_heading: 51 EXT. WOODS - LATE AFTERNOON 51
text: LEE and MARCUS appear through an oddly beautiful exit from
text: the woods and begin walking along a path.
text: PROFILE on LEE as we see the tall thin trees of a swamp
text: behind him.
text: PROFILE ON MARCUS from the opposite side as swamp trees are
text: also behind him. Suddenly... A DILAPIDATED house comes into
text: frame. MARCUS turns to look.
dialog: MARCUS' POV of the eery house...that stands as a reminder
dialog: that people once lived here happily.
text: CLOSE ON MARCUS looking up on the house. His face... now
text: fearful. Suddenly, behind MARCUS, just out of focus in the
dialog: short distance...
dialog: A DARK SHADOW!!!
text: No sooner has the FIGURE exited frame, MARCUS... CRASHES INTO
text: HIS FATHER... WHO IS STANDING COMPLETELY STILL.
dialog: 37.
text: MARCUS looks up at his father... who stares off sharply into
dialog: the short distance...
text: OVER MARCUS as he slowly leans around his father to see what
text: he's looking at, when suddenly we see...
text: A TERRIFYING MAN AT THE EDGE OF THE SWAMP!!!
dialog: A human form unlike anything most of us ever will... or
text: should get to see, the man's emaciated body quakes and then
text: shudders as if a synapses misfire. His face is sunken...
text: almost ghoulish and the look in his pitch black eyes
text: communicates something far beyond fearful. Much worse, this
text: is the rare look of a brain that has accepted a living
dialog: nightmare... as an everyday reality.
text: ON MARCUS as he slowly raises his hand... into a wave.
text: ON THE MAN... who doesn't move.
text: ON LEE as his eyes travel slowly down the man's frame.
text: ON LEE'S PERSPECTIVE as we see the man's dirt covered face,
text: then a ratty and ripped flannel shirt, and then... blood
text: covered hands... blood covered jeans... and finally at his
text: feet, in the high grass...
text: LONG HAIR AND A HAND OF.... A DEAD WOMAN
text: ON LEE as his eyes slowly come back up to meet the man's.
text: LEE now also raises his hand... and places a tense finger on
text: his lips.
text: ON THE MAN... as two large tears run down his face. In his
dialog: eyes... the knowing fear of the end of his life as... he
text: takes a deep breath in.
text: LEE immediately grabs MARCUS.
text: TIGHT ON LEE sprinting down the path carrying his son. OVER
text: HIS SHOULDER, the man in the background:
text: LETS OUT A PRIMAL SCREAM!!!!!!
text: ... A bottomless sound of pain and surrender, the sound
text: blasts onto us like a wave.
text: LEE suddenly dives behind a hallowed out tree trunk and
text: throws MARCUS' back up against it.
text: ON MARCUS as his father clasps his hand over his mouth.
text: MARCUS' eyes widen as overwhelming panic takes over.
dialog: 38.
text: ON LEE as he looks down at his son... with the most beautiful
text: sense of calm. The way one holds the hand of someone in their
dialog: last seconds on earth, LEE's smile is pure comfort... pure
dialog: love.
text: Suddenly we hear... THE FAMILIAR TERRIFYING SCREEEEEEEECH!
text: ON MARCUS... who begins violently shaking his head... his
text: soul seemingly coming out through his skin. Then suddenly we
text: hear... THE SNAPPING OF TREES!
text: ON LEE as his look now shoots to the tree line behind the man
dialog: when suddenly...
text: WE HEAR the man's primal scream of pain turn into... an
dialog: animal sound of death.
text: BACK ON MARCUS as he covers his ears. Through the muffle of
dialog: MARCUS' covered ears we can still hear... The most horrific
text: sounds of ultimate pain... crunching... and then...
dialog: POP!!!!
text: A deafening
dialog: ...SILENCE...
text: MARCUS' eyes almost seem to dim right before us...
text: As he goes limp.
scene_heading: 52 INT. FARMHOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALL - LATE AFTERNOON 52
text: FROM THE FLOOR we follow drops of fluid down the hall,
text: leading to... EVELYN gripping onto the railing with both
text: hands as she slowly traverses the stairs going down, focusing
text: intently on each step.
text: ON EVELYN's face as she takes slow, deep breaths. Her eyes
text: surging with panic... and pain.
dialog: IT'S 4 WEEKS TOO SOON!
text: Suddenly... EVELYN's eyes go wide.
dialog: CONTRACTION!!!
text: CLOSE ON EVELYN'S BELLY as she slowly sinks down into the
text: steps and INTO A CLOSE UP.
dialog: In EVELYN's face we will witness, many of us for the first
text: time, the complex and overwhelming sensory overload that is a
dialog: contraction... all swallowed back with every fiber of her
dialog: being in order to remain.... Silent.
dialog: 39.
text: Just at the moment it looks as though EVELYN may explode...
text: the contraction subsides.
text: WE ARE ON EVELYN's BACK as she struggles up onto her feet and
text: down the remaining stairs. As she rounds the banister and out
text: of frame... WE HOLD ON THE FRONT HALL.
text: Out the front door and onto the sand path warmly lit white
text: from the Christmas lights above.
scene_heading: 53 INT. FARMHOUSE - BASEMENT - LATE AFTERNOON 53
text: WE ARE LOW looking up the basement stairs as suddenly...
text: EVELYN appears in the narrow doorway and grabs hold of the
text: wall, still carrying the children's mirror. She takes a
text: moment and then begins to descend the exposed stairs with the
dialog: same deliberate effort.
text: COMING TOWARDS CAMERA, EVELYN gets bigger and bigger in the
text: frame until her head disappears, then her belly.
text: Just as her foot comes down into close up we:
text: RACK FOCUS to... THE NAIL STANDING STRAIGHT UP!!!!
text: EVELYN's foot steps STRAIGHT DOWN ON IT!!!!!
text: WE WATCH THE NAIL PIERCE INTO THE BOTTOM OF HER FOOT... and
text: then ERUPT THROUGH THE OTHER SIDE!!!!!!!!
text: THE SOUND CUTS OUT as we go:
text: CLOSE ON EVELYN as the shock and searing pain collides in her
text: brain behind her eyes. Then...
text: CLOSE ON THE MIRROR as it SILENTLY CRASHES DOWN THE STAIRS...
text: then rattles around in a circle before coming to a
dialog: standstill.
text: SOUND COMES RUSHING BACK IN
text: ON EVELYN as full blown fear washes over her. That sound was
text: most definitely HEARD. She looks down...
text: CLOSE ON EVELYN's FOOT... as she SLIDES THE FOOT SLOWLY UP
text: THE NAIL... and POPS IT FREE. Blood immediately begins to
text: drip from the wound.
text: EVELYN rushes down the remaining stairs, wincing with every
dialog: other step.
dialog: 40.
text: WE FOLLOW ON EVELYN's BACK as she hurriedly shuffles through
text: this basement that once felt familiar in the romantic glow of
text: their slow dance... but now feels stark... and desperately
dialog: lonely.
text: Finally, EVELYN arrives... at LEE's security console. She
text: desperately pushes past stacks of notebooks and files, boxes
dialog: of various electrical equipment like cellphones, cassette
text: players and EGG TIMERS that have been pillaged for parts.
text: EVELYN finally moves... THE BOX OF HEARING AIDS... to reveal
text: that there on the wall... is a large, hand made switch.
text: EVELYN grabs the knob at the top and thrusts it down.
scene_heading: 54 EXT. FARM - LATE AFTERNOON 54
text: Suddenly, flickering to life against the dusk colored sky...
text: LINES OF RED CHRISTMAS LIGHTS!!!
text: Like the white lights before, the power grid like system
text: illuminates the farm in bright... RED!!!
scene_heading: 55 EXT. ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON 55
text: REGAN lies in the sand next to the cross. Behind her we
text: see... RED LIGHTS THROUGH THE TREES!
text: ... REGAN doesn't see them.
scene_heading: 56 INT. FARMHOUSE - BASEMENT - LATE AFTERNOON 56
text: ON EVELYN, leaning on LEE's console. Her eyes closed, she
text: takes slow, deep breathes, as if to convince herself that it
dialog: will all be OK now... The signal has been sent.
text: For a brief moment... a smile... as she then opens her eyes
text: and moves back to the stairs.
text: As she clutches the support beam and goes to take her first
dialog: step up...
text: A LARGE SHADOW FLASHES PAST THE DOORWAY!!!!!
text: EVELYN spins back away from the stairs in terror.
scene_heading: 57 EXT. WOODS - VALLEY PATHWAY - DUSK 57
text: As sky begins to settle into dusk above the towering trees...
text: LEE enters carrying a limp MARCUS.
dialog: 41.
text: He trudges up the sand path, looking down at MARCUS.
text: MARCUS' eyes are open... but he is not present.
text: ON LEE'S BACK NOW, as he and his son crest the hill.
text: WE BOOM UP to see the dark horizon line of sky... give way to
text: the top of the silo... and then the fire red ground
text: illuminated by Christmas lights.
text: ON LEE as we see his face register exactly what this means.
text: He breaks into a full sprint.
scene_heading: 58 INT. FARMHOUSE - BASEMENT - DUSK 58
text: CLOSE ON one of the basement windows as red light pours
dialog: through.
text: WE PULL BACK SLOWLY as:
text: EVELYN's HANDS enter frame. She desperately pushes on the
dialog: window... nothing.
text: EVELYN roams around the basement like a caged animal
dialog: searching for any way out...
text: She moves back to LEE's security console, scanning the
dialog: desk... think... THINK!
text: Suddenly her eyes fall upon... the box of small electronics
text: she just moved to get to the switch.
dialog: Suddenly we hear:
text: A SCRATCHING OF CLAWS ON A WALL AND A CRASH OF GLASS FROM
dialog: ABOVE HER!!!!
text: EVELYN freezes with fear. Then....
text: THE HORRIFIC SCREEEEEEEEECH CAN BE HEARD!
text: EVELYN closes her eyes as the same sound that preempted her
text: son's death washes over her.
text: Then... her eyes shoot open in pain...
dialog: CONTRACTION!!!
text: Larger than the second one, this one brings EVELYN to her
text: knees, her head dips to the ground as she grimaces in intense
dialog: pain.
dialog: 42.
text: CLOSE ON EVELYN as her head suddenly shoots back up... The
text: red light pouring in from the basement windows cuts a line
text: across her face revealing her exploding eyes trying to
text: swallow the pain. Tears begin to fall... she is unable to
dialog: breath.
text: Then suddenly... air slowly escapes as she exhales... the
text: contraction has passed. After a moment of realization?...
text: Disbelief? She stands up and out of frame.
text: WE HOLD and then slowly pan down to... a small pool of blood
text: on the floor.
scene_heading: 59 INT. FARMHOUSE - DUSK 59
text: NOW LOOKING DOWN THE STAIRS from the doorway in the first
dialog: floor hallway... we see...
text: EVELYN rush through frame past the stairs.
text: ... WE CAN BARELY MAKE OUT A NONDESCRIPT SOUND.
scene_heading: 60 INT. FARMHOUSE - BASEMENT - DUSK 60
text: ON EVELYN as she quickly slides in behind a large boiler. We
text: can see the basement stairs in the background.
text: EVELYN squeezes her eyes shut... and begins murmuring to
text: herself... THE NONDESCRIPT SOUND IS SLIGHTLY LOUDER... A
text: TICKING...
dialog: And then....
text: EVELYN's eyes shoot open... What now? Suddenly....
dialog: CONTRACTION!!!!
text: We are on EVELYN'S face as she endures this immeasurable pain
dialog: in this unthinkable moment...
dialog: Then we hear...
scene_heading: TICK.... SCRAAAAAPE... TICK.... SCRAAAAAPE
text: Whatever IT is... it's coming DOWN THE STAIRS.
scene_heading: TICK.... SCRAAAAAPE... TICK.... SCRAAAAAPE
text: EVELYN crushes herself even tighter against the wall behind
text: the boiler... closing her eyes and exhaling in pure, painful,
text: silence as the contraction subsides...
dialog: 43.
dialog: Suddenly we hear...
dialog: SILENCE...
text: EVELYN turns and peers through the water tanks.
text: IN EVELYN'S POV as she scans the room through the sliver of a
dialog: view then suddenly...
text: We can barely make out more than a SLIVER of a creature's
text: shoulder or back from in between the tanks. WE CAN SEE THAT
text: IT IS COVERED IN SMALL ARMOR LIKE PLATES! Suddenly...
text: The small plates on the creature's shoulder... BEGIN TO LIFT
dialog: UP??!! Like the pieces on a colander, or... an old satellite
text: dish... the small plates open up with the crackle and pull of
text: anatomical goo underneath. Then all of the sudden... the
text: plates BEGIN TO ROTATE! Like directional microphones, the
text: plates... begin searching the room... FOR SOUND!
text: From behind the tanks, EVELYN watches as the creature's
text: plates turn toward the wall of monitors. Suddenly, each of
text: the screens... begins to flicker!!! Then... the picture goes
dialog: completely dark!
text: EVELYN then suddenly rolls her back against the tanks to look
text: from one side of the room... to the other.
text: Suddenly... We now can identify the NONDESCRIPT SOUND FROM
text: EARLIER as... TICKING.....
text: Then, sitting on a shelf on the wall opposite the console, we
dialog: see...
dialog: AN EGG TIMER!!!
text: WE CONTINUE TO PUSH IN, THE TICKING SOUND NOW MUCH LOUDER,
text: when finally, just as we land CLOSE UP on the egg timer...
dialog: RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING!!!!!!!!!!!
text: THE CREATURE SCREEEEEEEEEEEECHES!!!!
dialog: AND ATTACKS THE SOUND!!!!!!!
text: EVELYN opens her eyes...
text: That's it! Her plan worked! EVELYN thrusts herself away
dialog: from the tanks!!
text: WE TRACK WITH HER as she moves as quickly as she can to the
text: exposed stairs and begins to climb.
dialog: 44.
scene_heading: 61 INT. FRONT HALL - DUSK 61
text: FROM THE KITCHEN WE LOOK THROUGH THE HALLWAY ONTO THE FRONT
text: DOOR. Suddenly... EVELYN bursts out of the doorway from the
dialog: basement.
text: WE FOLLOW ON HER BACK as she maneuvers her feet desperately
text: from PAINTED SPOT to PAINTED SPOT down the hall to the front
dialog: door and to freedom!
text: She grabs the stair post for support as she crosses through
text: the front hall, only steps from the door when, OVER HER
dialog: SHOULDER we barely see:
text: A DARK SHADOW WALKING UP THE SAND PATH!!!
text: EVELYN immediately spins around into CLOSE UP as we now LEAD
text: HER as she rushes up the main stairs.
text: At the top of the stairs, WE TILT DOWN as she reaches to the
text: floor and picks up the thick blankets covering the landing.
text: Behind her... THE FRONT HALL LIGHTS BEGIN TO BRIGHTEN!
scene_heading: 62 EXT. BARN - DUSK 62
text: WE HOLD ON the side of the barn... as LEE enters with MARCUS
text: and places him on the ground.
text: WE FOLLOW LEE as he slowly cranes his neck to look around the
text: barn. There, beautifully lit in RED is the sand path leading
text: to the farmhouse. LEE's eyes travel down the path and up the
dialog: stairs and...
text: ONTO A LARGE DARK SHADOW... NOW IN THE FRONT HALL!!!
text: LEE snaps his back against the wall, his eyes darting with
text: fear as he thinks... thinks. Finally he turns to his son who
text: stands looking at him blankly.
text: LEE immediately digs into his back pack and pulls out... A
dialog: FLASH LIGHT!
text: LEE places the flashlight in MARCUS's hands. MARCUS looks up
text: to him with familiar panic in his eyes.
text: LEE then slides closer to his son... and gently places his
text: hands on MARCUS' shoulders.
text: Suddenly, LEE places his left hand straight up against his
text: chest, crosses the fingers of his right hand, brings the two
text: together and... shoots his right hand into the sky.
dialog: 45.
dialog: This... is the same exact sign his four year old son made in
text: the general store at the beginning of the movie. This...
text: means ROCKET.
text: MARCUS shakes his head no.
text: LEE gently places his hands on MARCUS' face and looks
text: directly in his eyes. No doubt informed by the heart opening
dialog: day they've had... It is a beautiful moment of strength as
text: LEE communicates so much to his son. First and foremost,
dialog: there is understanding... and even an apology for the
text: situation they are in. But then the look turns to imploring.
speaker_heading: LEE (SIGNING)
dialog: Your mother needs help. I need you
dialog: to do this... for her.
text: MARCUS looks to his dad... his eyes change.
speaker_heading: LEE (SIGNING) (CONT'D)
dialog: ... please...
text: And with that... MARCUS is gone.

text: FROM ABOVE we see EVELYN enter the room carrying the thick
text: blankets from the stairs and turns on the bathroom light...
text: spots of blood smear on the floor.
text: ON EVELYN as she slowly gets into the bathtub. Tears fall
text: down her face as she reaches over the wall of the tub... and
text: starts stacking the blankets from her knees to her chest.
text: As she folds the last blanket over herself...
dialog: CONTRACTION!!!
text: This time her eyes go wide with the electric shock like pain.
dialog: This... is the big one. THIS... IS HAPPENING!
text: Suddenly we hear...TICK.... SCRAAAAAPE... TICK.... SCRAAAAAPE
text: Whatever IT is... it's trying to climb the stairs.
text: TIGHT ON EVELYN's hand as it jerks and grips til it turns
dialog: white from force.
dialog: 46.
text: FROM ABOVE, we see EVELYN in extreme pain... but somehow
dialog: keeping it all in.
text: Suddenly... a small stream of blood begins to trickle by her

scene_heading: 65 EXT. FARM - CORNFIELD - DUSK 65
text: MARCUS walks down a thin sand path, suddenly stops... and
text: looks up to a HUGE OVERARCHING FIGURE ABOVE HIM!
text: It is a watering device found in cornfields that tower high
text: above the corn and roll slowly through the fields on giant
dialog: wheels.
scene_heading: 66 INT. FARMHOUSE - UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DUSK 66
text: ON THE BATHTUB. All that can be seen are EVELYN's eyes as
text: she peers over the bathtub wall. Through the door... and to
text: the steps. Suddenly we hear again...
scene_heading: TICK.... SCRAAAAAPE... TICK.... SCRAAAAAPE
text: Just then... The light bulb above EVELYN begins to DIM!!!
text: QUICKLY BACK ON EVELYN as she begins to cry, preparing for
dialog: the end. And then...
dialog: CONTRACTION!!!!
text: FROM ABOVE as EVELYN's face shoots to the sky... with no
text: affect. Her eyes wide, the rest of her face is calm.
text: Then we see... Blood and fluid now pool around her feet as
text: the light above her... goes out.
text: From only the light from the window we see EVELYN's face...
text: finally crack in pain. Her mouth opens... releasing the most
text: guttural... and now two person...
dialog: SCREEEEEEEAM!
dialog: 47.
text: BUT, right at that moment, the screams of mother and baby are
text: drowned out by a thundering.....
text: BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!
scene_heading: 67 EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAND PATH - NIGHT 67
text: WE TRACK WITH LEE as he sprints down the sand path holding
text: the shot gun like a civil war soldier rushing into battle
dialog: as...
text: ENORMOUS BLOOMS OF FIREWORKS BURST BEHIND HIM!!!!
text: Red, green, white... large plumes, small sparkles falling
dialog: down.
text: In the midst of this unthinkable nightmare... it's gorgeous.
scene_heading: 68 EXT. ROAD - NIGHT 68

text: CLOSE ON REGAN as the colors illuminate on her face.
scene_heading: 69 INT. FARMHOUSE - FRONT HALL - NIGHT 69
text: FROM THE DINING ROOM, we look into the front hall in the
dialog: background.
text: Suddenly, from the doorway... the muzzle of a gun pokes
text: through. Then moments later... LEE walks in stealthily.
text: Moving the gun exactly where his eyes point... he clears the
dialog: room.
text: ON LEE'S BACK as we look down the gun barrel. He looks to
text: the dining room. He looks to the living room. He looks to
dialog: the... STAIRS!!!
text: LEE'S POV as he walks up the stairs. On each stair... drops
text: of blood. To the left, along the wall, the wallpaper has been
text: intermittently RIPPED... IN THREE EQUIDISTANT MEANDERING
speaker_heading: LINES.
dialog: 48.
scene_heading: 70 INT. FARMHOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT 70
text: THROUGH A DOORWAY onto the now exposed wood floor landing
text: with the bannister outlining the upstairs hall.
text: Suddenly, the top of LEE's head enters frame... just as the
text: creature's had only moments before... Then his gun, facing
text: into the bedrooms to the side. LEE moves the gun confidently
text: in all directions, making sure the upstairs is clear.
text: As LEE's gaze comes around to face directly at us... his gun
dialog: lowers... and:
text: WE SLOWLY PULL BACK INTO THE ROOM TO REVEAL... the
text: bloodstained edge... of the BATH TUB.
text: ON LEE's BACK as he rushes to the tub to find... just blood
text: in an empty bath tub.
text: LEE turns into his own CLOSE UP PROFILE as his back slides
text: down the bathtub and onto the floor. His hand releases the
text: gun to the floor. His eyes close and he begins to... softly
dialog: weep.
text: A mirror behind LEE reflects the room back to him, revealing
text: for the first time... a beveled glass shower door at the
text: opposite end of the room. Suddenly...
text: A BLOODY HAND HITS THE GLASS!!!!... And the shower door
dialog: slowly opens!!!
text: OVER LEE as he scrambles to the shower and opens the door!
text: Stuffed inside... is a quivering pile of blankets.
text: LEE drops to his knees and pulls back the blankets to see...
text: his wife. Pale, with eyes closed... she's breathing. And in
text: her arms... a sleeping newborn baby.
scene_heading: 71 EXT. CORNFIELD - NIGHT 71
text: WE HOLD ON THE TOPS OF THE DENSE CORN, the creature like
text: silhouette of the giant watering device looming... as the
text: last of a series of bottle rockets fire into the darkening
dialog: night sky.
text: WE MOVE ABOVE THE CORN and then descend through it onto a
text: thin sand path and onto... MARCUS. WE FOLLOW WITH HIM as he
text: safely walks back toward the BARN, holding his flashlight, as
text: the final bursts of fireworks illuminate behind him. On
text: MARCUS' face... is genuine pride. He knows he has done
text: something heroic. Suddenly...
text: WE HEAR THE SNAP OF CORNSTALKS!!!
dialog: 49.
text: MARCUS, frantically whips his light around the path behind
dialog: him.
text: WE FOLLOW HIS LIGHT as it scans the path and the stalks...
dialog: Even with nothing there... it's terrifying.
text: Just then... His flashlight begins to DIM....
dialog: SNAP!!!
text: MARCUS whips his light around to the thin sand path in FRONT
dialog: of him... nothing...
text: SNAP!!! CRUNCH!!! SNAP!!! CRUNCH!!! Something ELSE is
dialog: moving toward him... fast!
text: MARCUS turns around, away from the BARN... AND RUNS!!!! WE
text: ARE ON MARCUS' FACE AS HE RUNS... Scanning, scanning...
text: SNAP!!!... SCANNING!!!... CRUNCH!!! SCANNING!!
text: HIS FLASHLIGHT... STARTS TO FLICKER OUT...
text: THE CORN TO HIS RIGHT... BEGINS TO SNAP... ITS COMING CLOSER!
text: MARCUS turns and begins to run... INTO THE CORN!!!!
text: WE ARE NOW IN A TERRIFYING PERSPECTIVE... HANDHELD, AS CORN
text: CROSSES RIGHT PAST LENS. THE FLASHLIGHT not able to cast
dialog: light on anything that's not right in our face, creating
text: almost a STROBE EFFECT!!! MARCUS is making... A TON OF
dialog: SOUND!!!!
text: ON MARCUS' FACE... pure panic. When suddenly... WE ARRIVE
text: into a small clearing to see... A TRACTOR, completely
text: overgrown with corn. MARCUS immediately climbs onto the
text: tractor and frantically whips his light around the
text: clearing... and into the dense corn...
text: THE LIGHT... STARTS TO DIM.... SNAP!!! CRUNCH!!! SNAP!!!
text: CRUNCH!!! Something is moving toward him FAST! THE LIGHT
text: BEGINS TO FLICKER.... and then goes out.
text: Suddenly, off in the corn in front of him (AND FOR THE FIRST
text: TIME) we hear... A LOUD SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEECH!!!! The light
text: suddenly BLARES BRIGHT as...
text: A DEER HEAD POPS OUT OF THE CORN!!!!!!!!
text: ALL IN AN INSTANT, MARCUS flies back in fear! Slipping from

scene_heading: 72 EXT. FARM - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT 72
text: Fade in: The night is now dark.
text: WE ARE BEHIND REGAN walking. AS WE ARE WITH HER... WE ARE IN
scene_heading: TOTAL SILENCE.
text: She looks around at the remnants of the last horrifying
text: moments... More reminiscent of a soldier returning to a
text: battlefield, then a girl returning to a farm, we see
text: countless streamers of firework smoke still falling
text: gracefully from the sky. The tips of dry cornstalks
text: flicker... alight with small flames. Off in the distance we
text: see... lights of the SILO. Shining like a beacon.
text: REGAN walks along the eerie shadows of corn stalks when
text: suddenly at her feet... cracks of light.
text: REGAN lowers to her knees and puts her head to the ground to
text: see... a bright light, cutting through the bottom of the
text: stalks of corn. Suddenly, the pliers REGAN used to work on
text: the TOY SHUTTLE... slip out of the pocket of her dress...
text: ...AND CRASH ONTO A ROCK ON THE GROUND!!!
text: REGAN... doesn't even notice... because she didn't even hear
text: it... REGAN sits back up to kneeling position when suddenly
text: the cornstalks behind her... BEGIN TO LAY DOWN... AS A SHADOW
text: EMERGES!!!At that exact moment... we begin to hear the oddest
dialog: and unpleasent beeeeeeeeeeeep.
text: Suddenly, REGAN's eyes begin to squint slightly. Then... her
text: hand slowly reaches up to her ear?...
dialog: SHE CAN HEAR THE BEEP!!!!
text: SUDDENLY... the SHADOW moves closer to REGAN... and THE
text: BEEEEEEP GROWS!!! Now at a near deafening level, we see the
text: shadow behind REGAN... stop? REGAN's face now scrunches up
text: in agony as she grabs her ears!!! REGAN digs into her right
text: ear, rips out the hearing aid and launches forward!!
dialog: ....SILENCE.....
text: REGAN suddenly kneels back up into frame... THE SHADOW IS
text: GONE!... SHE NEVER EVEN KNEW IT WAS THERE.
text: Breathing wildly, REGAN looks at the hearing aid in her hand.
text: Her face is almost electrified! As excruciating as that
dialog: was.... THAT IS THE FIRST SOUND SHE HAS EVER HEARD!
text: REGAN... slowly puts the hearing aid back in her ear...
dialog: ....nothing....
dialog: 51.
scene_heading: 73 EXT. CORNFIELD - NIGHT 73
text: WE FOLLOW REGAN as she walks down the small path leading
text: to... the clearing. One ladder stands, the other ladder on
text: the ground, bottles and fireworks litter the ground. And
text: then, there in the center of the clearing, lit by the
text: flashlight... one half of a deer carcass.
dialog: ... No sign of MARCUS...
text: REGAN slowly bends down to pick up the flashlight when
text: suddenly... THE CARCASS MOVES! REGAN jumps back,
dialog: terrified!!!
dialog: Then from under the neck of the deer... a hand!!
text: REGAN runs over and pushes the carcass off of... MARCUS, who
text: has been safely lying underneath.
text: Covered in blood, he scrambles to try to get to his feet.
text: REGAN grabs him and holds him tight. She places her finger
text: to her lips... just like her dad.
text: She looks around to see if they have a chance to run... and
text: then thinks better of it. She looks back to her brother...
text: and places her hand on his chest.
text: WE RISE above the clearing, above the overgrown tractor...
text: and once again into the night.
scene_heading: 74 EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 74
text: WE ARE WIDE on the FARMHOUSE. The RED CHRISTMAS lights sway
text: gently in the now calm night air.
text: After a long quiet moment...
text: LEE appears at the doorway. He carries EVELYN in his arms...
text: The baby in hers.
text: He slowly descends the porch stairs and begins to walk toward
text: the BARN... his eyes locked firmly on his cargo. For a
text: moment, as LEE walks, this all feels almost like a dream. Or
text: the end of a nightmare. Respite.
text: WE ARE TIGHT ON EVELYN who we see is unconscious from the
text: trauma and the loss of fluids... THEN DOWN TO the tightly
text: wrapped baby sleeping in her arms.
text: LEE looks ahead to the doors of the BARN off in the seemingly
dialog: never ending distance.
dialog: Suddenly...
dialog: 52.
text: THE BABY BEGINS TO STIR!!!
text: LEE's eyes shoot down to see the baby streeeeeeeeetch... and
text: slowly begin to open it's eyes.
text: ON THE BABY as it looks up, searchingly, at his father... as
text: his father picks up his pace!
text: Suddenly... we begin to notice the dim red light on the
text: baby's face... BEGINS TO FLICKER!
text: ON THE BARN DOORS getting closer... closer.
text: ON LEE as he trudges with everything he has to get his baby
text: to safety when suddenly... a cold wind blows across LEE's
text: face and through his hair.
text: LEE slowly looks down as...
dialog: THE BABY CRIES!!!!!!
text: WE HOLD DIRECTLY ON LEE, LEADING HIM, as he breaks into a
dialog: full sprint!
text: LEE'S eyes momentarily dart quickly to the side, not at all
dialog: prepared for what he might find.
text: WE NEVER LEAVE LEE's FACE. As his head bobs back and forth
text: from running, we intermittently catch glimpses of the long
text: path behind him. First we see the FARMHOUSE shrinking in the
text: distance behind him. And then we hear...
dialog: SNAP!!!
text: BEHIND LEE... the large tree near the farmhouse moves
dialog: wildly!!
text: LEE's eyes never even widen. There is no surprise. This is
text: the moment he knew would come. As he sprints with everything
text: he has... the string of bulbs above him... DIM DOWN TO ALMOST
dialog: NOTHING!!!!
text: IN THE DARK DISTANCE BEHIND HIM... A
text: SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEECH!!!!...
dialog: Lee... Is... Running... running... closer... closer...
dialog: then....
text: LEE BURSTS THROUGH THE HEAVY QUILTS!!! HE'S IN THE BARN!!
text: WE ARE ON LEE as he sprints through the familiar interior of
text: the BARN. When suddenly...
dialog: WE HEAR A HUGE BANG!!! Then...
dialog: 53.
text: THE HEAVY QUILTS FLY UP INTO THE AIR!!!... JUST AS LEE
text: DESCENDS INTO THE GROUND!
scene_heading: 75 INT. BARN - SAFE ROOM - NIGHT 75
text: LEE falls back onto the steps, barely holding onto his wife
text: and child as his free hand reaches for... the mattress!
text: As LEE finally grabs the mattress and slides it over the
text: opening above the stairwell...
speaker_heading: BLACK
dialog: In total darkness we hear:
text: LEE'S BREATH QUICKENS... AN ODD SOUND OF SOMETHING HEAVY...
text: ABOVE... THE CREATURES ARE INSIDE THE BARN!!!! A CACOPHONY
text: OF SCRATCHING, TEARING AND SCREECHING... Then...
text: FIRE!!... LEE's lighter cuts through the black and then
text: retreats into a small glow in the room as we try to
text: comprehend what's happening. We see EVELYN has been placed
dialog: on a hay bale as...
text: ABOVE... A CRASH!!!!! THE CREATURES ARE TEARING THROUGH THE
text: ROOMS... AND DROWNING THE SOUNDS OF THE FAMILY BELOW... FOR
text: THE MOMENT...
text: LEE picks up the crying baby... as we PUSH IN. For one brief
dialog: second amidst the fury of nerves and sound we see... a father
text: holding his newborn child for the first time. It is a
dialog: precious, once in a lifetime moment.
dialog: Then...
text: A PLASTIC MASK COMES INTO FRAME... and ONTO THE BABY's
dialog: FACE!!!!
text: As if in an airplane video, LEE wraps the mask's strap behind
text: the baby's head... and then LOWERS THE BABY INTO THE WOODEN,
dialog: QUILT LINED BOX!
text: WE PAN TO THE SIDE of the box... along a clear plastic
text: tube... to a stand up air canister. LEE's hand enters frame
text: and turns the valve... a quiet whisper of air.
text: LEE stares down at his tiny crying baby wearing an oxygen
text: mask. The juxtaposed image seemingly almost as bizarre to
dialog: him as it is to us. THEN...
dialog: 54.
text: LEE PLACES A LARGE STACK OF BLANKETS OVER THE TOP OF THE
dialog: BOX!!!!... AND THEN A COVER!!!!
text: THE BABY'S SCREAMS CAN'T BE HEARD...
text: THE BANGING... THE SCREECHES... INCREASE IN TEMPO AND
dialog: SOUND!!!
text: LEE just stares down at the small casket like box...
dialog: This either works... or they're dead...
scene_heading: 76 EXT. CORNFIELD - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT 76
text: WE FOLLOW REGAN and MARCUS as they sprint up the main sand
text: path/driveway running parallel to the cornfields. With the
text: flashlight slicing through the darkness... it's nearly
text: impossible to tell where we are. Suddenly the corn ends and
dialog: OVER MARCUS AND REGAN we see...
dialog: Shadows of farm equipment!
text: REGAN turns her head... and looks up.
text: REGAN's POV as we climb higher and higher... to the top of
dialog: the SILO!
scene_heading: 77 INT. BARN - SAFE ROOM - NIGHT 77
text: Silence... The frame filled with a dark brown... Time has
dialog: passed. Then...
text: WE TRAVEL DOWN from the dirt ceiling... past a hook on the
text: wooden support beam... to a clear plastic IV BAG hanging...
text: down a fluid filled plastic tube... and into an arm.
text: WE PULL BACK to reveal EVELYN lying on the hay bale
text: comfortably... her eyes still closed. She has been
text: bandaged... and wears LEE's sweater. A single burning candle
dialog: by her side. Then...
text: EVELYN SHOOTS AWAKE!!! SHE SCRAMBLES TO SIT UP THROUGH THE
text: PAIN!!! HER EYES SEARCH A LOW LIT ROOM!!! SHE GOES TO SIT
text: UP AND WINCES... AN IV IS IN HER ARM!!
text: Out of the darkness... comes LEE! He is holding the baby.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: It's ok. It's ok! Your safe.
text: EVELYN looks up at LEE immediately confused as to why he's

speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: It worked?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: It worked.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: It worked... it worked...

dialog: Where's Marcus?
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I'll find them.
speaker_heading: EVELYN

speaker_heading: EVELYN

speaker_heading: EVELYN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: EVELYN (CONT'D)
dialog: He was so heavy...
dialog: LEE freezes...
speaker_heading: EVELYN (CONT'D)
dialog: I can still feel the weight in my

dialog: LEE can't speak.
speaker_heading: EVELYN (CONT'D)
dialog: My hands were free-- I was carrying

speaker_heading: LEE

speaker_heading: EVELYN

text: front of the shallow metal drum their father sat in front of
dialog: the night before.
text: REGAN walks around the fire looking out across the farm for
dialog: any sign of her father.
text: Just as the fire is about to die out, REGAN walks back and
text: squirts the last remaining fluid from the bottle. The fire
text: rages again and illuminates the two children... as well as
text: the fading hope on their faces.
text: The fire begins to die down again. REGAN rummages in the box
text: picking up the empty bottles of lighter fluid and shaking
dialog: them frantically...
text: She shakes the last empty bottle... And slumps down...
dialog: defeated... scared.
text: In the last moments of the dying flame...
speaker_heading: MARCUS (SIGNING)
dialog: He'll come for us.
text: The two kids stare off desperately over the farm...

text: BUT THIS TIME... ITS ONLY TWO!
text: The kids don't even notice.
scene_heading: 79 INT. BARN - NIGHT 79
text: WE ARE ON THE FAMILIAR image of the interior of the BARN.
text: Suddenly, the mattress on the ground... moves. Then...
text: LEE's head slowly arises from underground.
text: LEE stands to see their barn... their life has been tossed
dialog: and ravaged.
dialog: 58.
text: LEE places the mattress back over the large unfinished hole
text: leading down to the safe room and stands up. LEE stares down
text: at the mattress... and what it protects... then walks out of
dialog: frame.
text: WE HOLD ON THE mattress a moment... And then SLOWLY MOVE
text: along the floor of the BARN... past the monopoly game...
text: until we reach the bedroom stalls to see...
text: A LARGE CLAW MARK GOUGED OUT OF THE BARN WALL!
text: As we move down we see... a pipe above the long trough on the

text: MOVES ACROSS THE FLOOR!
scene_heading: 80 EXT. SILO - ROOF - NIGHT 80
text: CLOSE ON REGAN, oddly lit. She lays on her back staring up...
text: at the stars. REGAN fumbles with something in her ear...
text: WE GO EXTREME CLOSE on her turning the tiny dial on top of
text: her hearing aid. As she does... she places her other hand by
text: her ear and rubs her fingers together, hoping to hear a
dialog: sound.... Nothing.
text: REGAN turns the dial even more... nothing.
text: REGAN immediately rolls over, frustrated. Sitting directly
text: in her view, on his dad's small stool... is MARCUS looking
text: out hopefully to the farm.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (SIGNING)
dialog: He'll come.
text: REGAN scoffs and goes to get up when suddenly, under her

text: attempts to get her bearings.
text: EVELYN's POV as she scans across the ceiling, down the walls
text: and finally onto... the blanket covered crib in the middle of
dialog: the room.
text: A relieved smile appears on EVELYN's face... and then a
text: wince... as she slowly tries to sit up.
text: She quietly slides her legs off of the hay bale and toward
dialog: the ground when... she suddenly stops!
text: WE FOLLOW EVELYN's eyes down her body to the ground to see
dialog: her legs...
dialog: ARE SUBMERGED IN WATER!!!!
text: EVELYN's eyes shoot frantically around the dark room again
text: and finally land on the source of red light from above. She
text: leans forward to see... CHRISTMAS LIGHTS...
text: THE MATTRESS HAS BEEN MOVED!
text: From one corner of the large opening... a stream of water
text: pours down into the room. Suddenly...
dialog: A SNORT!!!!
text: EVELYN's head slowly turns... The look on her face reveals to
dialog: us the immediate truth that her brain won't yet admit.
text: EVELYN's POV as we scan the room once more. This time, in
text: the shadowed corner of the room...
dialog: A LARGE BLACK SHAPE!!!!!
text: EVELYN is frozen with fear as she watches....
text: THE SILHOUETTE OF A CREATURE STANDING DIRECTLY ABOVE HER
dialog: BABY'S CRIB!!!!!!!!!!
text: EVELYN'S eyes travel down from the creature... to her baby's
dialog: crib where...
text: THE QUILT BEGINS TO MOVE!!!.... THE BABY... IS WAKING UP!!!
text: Suddenly... WE HEAR THE BEGINNINGS OF THE LOW HUM!!!
text: We see a flash of red reflected off the small plates... as
text: they open.
dialog: 60.
text: WE HOLD ON EVELYN, her brain racing as fast as her heart, as
text: she slowly looks at THE PLATES ROTATING... SCANNING THE ROOM.
text: Suddenly... Her breath stops... as EVELYN...
dialog: STANDS UP!!!!!
text: As she stands... We watch the rings in the water from EVELYN
text: flow through the room... TO THE CREATURE!! The plates
text: immediately turn down toward the rings in the water.
text: EVELYN looks over to the water running down the steps... then
text: back to the creature. It is clear it can't place exactly
text: where she is due to the sound of the dripping water.
text: WE FOLLOW on EVELYN'S back as she begins to slowly... MOVE
dialog: THROUGH THE WATER!!!
text: Suddenly... the red lights from the barn above begin to
text: DIM... and illuminate THE CREATURES BACK!!!
text: WE GO CLOSE on it's small plates completely opened up and
text: vibrating... WE TRAVEL CLOSE up it's back through the tunnel
dialog: of receiving its plates have created and end CLOSE ON the

text: THE WATER BEGINS TO MOVE as... THE CREATURE TURNS TO EVELYN!!
text: WE GO CLOSE ON THE VIBRATING WATER TRAVELING TO EVELYN...
text: UP ON EVELYN as she closes her eyes and continues walking
text: backward, when suddenly we see... A GUSH OF WATER CASCADING
scene_heading: BEHIND HER.
text: Without flinching, EVELYN COVERS THE BABY... AND WALKS RIGHT
text: THROUGH THE CASCADING WATER suddenly... DISAPPEARING!
text: ON EVELYN, her back pressed up against the dirt wall. The
text: water pouring only inches from her face... like a small
dialog: waterfall.
dialog: 61.
text: Then just in front of EVELYN... distorted behind the
text: waterfall... THE CREATURE SLOWLY ENTERS... then...
text: Though our view is skewed through the water... IT OPENS IT'S
dialog: MOUTH!!! Even through the distortion, we still understand
text: what we're seeing is A LONG CRESCENT OF RAZOR SHARP TEETH!!!!

text: OVER LEE'S BACK WE NOW SEE ABOVE THE VAST CORNFIELDS... TO
dialog: THE SILO. Then...
text: ANOTHER SOUND...
text: LEE slowly turns only his head as we hear... a low, growling
text: hum... almost like that of a swarm of bees.

text: DARK SNAKING LINES CUTTING THROUGH THE CORN!!!
dialog: 1 line... no 2... no... 4!!!
text: THE SOUND GROWS LOUDER AND LOUDER as WE TILT with these

text: SLICE THROUGH THE CORN AROUND HIM!!!
dialog: 63.
text: WE MOVE BACK AROUND LEE as he spins around to watch the lines
dialog: head directly for...
scene_heading: 86 EXT. SILO- ROOF - NIGHT 86
text: REGAN runs to the edge of the hole to see... Two giant trap
text: doors of the silo roof swinging... GROANING BACK AND FORTH!!!
text: Many feet below, we see MARCUS... waist deep in a mountain...
speaker_heading: OF CORN.
text: REGAN'S body quakes as she does everything she can to resist
text: the urge to call out when suddenly... MARCUS MOVES!
text: MARCUS looks up at his sister as he wiggles and squirms,
text: desperately trying to get free. But with every movement
text: MARCUS... BEGINS TO SINK!!!
text: REGAN signs to her brother to stop moving!! When suddenly...

text: Then... A SCREEEEEEEEEEEEECH!!!!
dialog: BANG!!!... BANG!!!... BANG!!!
text: MARCUS now thrashes wildly from fear!... AS HE SINKS EVEN
dialog: FASTER!!!
text: ON REGAN as she tries to sign to her brother frantically when
dialog: suddenly...
text: ONE OF THE SWINGING TRAP DOORS RIPS FREE FROM THE SILO AND
dialog: PLUMMETS TOWARD MARCUS!
text: As the steel door crashes into the corn like a guillotine
text: only inches away from him, MARCUS lunges out of the way!!!...
text: That desperate quick movement... causes the corn to give way
text: even more... as it now engulfs MARCUS up to his chest!!!
text: Suddenly....A CRACK OF LIGHT PIERCES THROUGH THE SILO
text: WALL.... AND THEN ANOTHER!!!... THE CREATURES ARE TRYING TO
dialog: CLAW THROUGH!!!
text: ON REGAN as she tries to process it all and then finally...
text: SHE JUMPS DOWN INTO THE HOLE!!!!!!!

speaker_heading: THE CORN.
text: REGAN begins to push the fallen steel door toward her
dialog: brother.
text: ON MARCUS as he desperately reaches his hand out toward the
dialog: door... his face beginning to sink under the corn!!!
text: REGAN makes one last desperate push of the door toward her
text: brother's hand... AS CORN ENGULFS HER TO HER CHEST!!!
text: In one swift move, MARCUS places his hand onto the fallen
text: silo door that sits atop the corn like a floating log in a
dialog: river.
text: MARCUS's hand grabs hold of the steel and begins to pull
text: himself out. As he gets his arm up on the steel door, he
text: turns back and reaches for his sister... WHO IS NOW ENGULFED
dialog: UP TO HER NECK!!!
text: MARCUS immediately reaches back to grab her hand... but REGAN
text: shakes her head and motions for him to stop! Then... she
text: takes one last deep breath as...
text: HER FACE DISAPPEARS INTO THE GRAIN!
scene_heading: 88 INT. SILO - NIGHT 88
text: DARKNESS...
text: A whirring of dense sound, like that of heavy rain on a car
text: roof. Trickles of fading light as the sound grows quieter...
text: and quieter and then... is gone.
scene_heading: 89 INT. SILO - GRAIN PILE - NIGHT 89
text: MARCUS ferociously claws at the grain where his sister once
dialog: was when suddenly...
dialog: HE BEGINS TO MOVE!
text: MARCUS looks back across the mountain and sees that the corn
text: IS BEGINNING TO POUR OUT OF A HOLE BEING MADE BY SLASHING
text: CREATURES!!!! And as the corn pours out the side, the corn
text: MARCUS sits atop... BEGINS TO GIVE WAY AND SLIDE TOWARD THE
text: HOLES... AND THE CREATURES!

dialog: the sound grows...
dialog: ...Boom!.....BOOM!... Suddenly...
scene_heading: 91 INT. SILO - GRAIN PILE - NIGHT 91
text: A HAND POPS OUT OF THE CORN RIGHT NEXT TO MARCUS!!!

dialog: in... the deepest breath of air her lungs can handle.
scene_heading: 92 EXT. CORNFIELD - DAWN 92

scene_heading: 93 INT. SILO - DAWN 93
text: ON MARCUS as he wraps his arm around his sister and pulls her
text: up to the steel door.
text: ON REGAN, sweating... breathing heavily... She looks to
dialog: MARCUS... who is looking away??
text: MARCUS puts his finger to his mouth to tell his sister to be
dialog: quiet.
text: Now with MARCUS, we suddenly realize... THE BANGING HAS
speaker_heading: STOPPED!
text: MARCUS grabs his flashlight and shines it down toward the
dialog: hole created by the creatures... NOTHING!
text: MARCUS shines the flashlight to another set of slash marks on
dialog: the silo wall... NOTHING!
dialog: 66.
text: MARCUS shines the flashlight across the now still corn...
speaker_heading: SILENCE!
dialog: Then suddenly... A SQUEAK!!!!
text: MARCUS' flashlight launches up to the roof of the silo...
text: where the second of the two doors squeaks back and forth.
text: MARCUS' flashlight looks all around the trap door... All
dialog: around the roof... NOTHING!!!
text: As MARCUS leads the light back down the silo wall, he briefly
text: illuminates REGAN, when suddenly...
dialog: BOOM!!!!
text: THE CREATURE JUMPS DOWN INTO THE LIGHT!!!! IT'S PLATES AND
dialog: MOUTH FULLY OPEN!!!!
text: REGAN looks up to the creature in horror and then whips
text: around... and tackles MARCUS off the door!!!
text: THE CREATURE STEPS TOWARDS THE KIDS!!!
text: REGAN grabs the edge of the door and lifts it over her and
dialog: MARCUS' heads!
text: PINNED UNDERNEATH THE SILO DOOR, MARCUS looks over to his
text: sister to see... SHE IS HOLDING HER EAR... NEARLY CONVULSING
text: WITH PAIN!!! Not knowing what is happening to her he slowly
text: reaches out his hand to her when suddenly...
dialog: BANG!!!
text: A GIANT CLAW RIPS THROUGH THE SILO DOOR, RIGHT BETWEEN THE
dialog: TWO CHILDREN!!!
text: The children stare at the claw, horrified when suddenly...
text: THE CLAW BEGINS TO SHAKE... AS IF HAVING A SEIZURE!
text: After a long moment of seizing up... THE CLAW RIPS BACK
dialog: THROUGH THE DOOR... AND IS GONE??
text: WE HEAR THE TERRIFYING SCREEEEEEEEECH OF THE CREATURE!!!
text: Then... the sounds of SLASHING METAL!!! WE BARELY SEE THE
text: CREATURE AS IT BURSTS IN AND OUT OF FRAME... SCRATCHING AND
text: SLASHING AT THE SILO... TRYING TO GET.... OUT!!!!
text: Suddenly, a HORRIFYING RIPPING SOUND!!! And then...
dialog: 67.
dialog: SILENCE....
text: The children look at each other.... silent... waiting.
text: After a long moment, REGAN and MARCUS begin to slide the silo
text: door off of them... and peak out.
text: MARCUS picks up the flashlight and shines the light all
text: around the silo... then suddenly stops... The children just
text: stare... AS WE SLOWLY PULL BACK TO REVEAL...
text: AN ENORMOUS HOLE TORN THROUGH THE SILO!!!
text: MARCUS looks back to his sister... breathing heavily... WHAT
dialog: JUST HAPPENED?
scene_heading: A94 EXT. SILO - DAWN A94
text: WE GO WIDE to REGAN and MARCUS jumping down from the same
text: large hole... onto a large pile of corn that has spilt out
text: into the night... THEY ARE COMPLETELY ALONE.
text: MARCUS suddenly grabs REGAN'S hand and pulls her to her feet.
text: ON THE BACKS OF THE KIDS as they sprint through the farm
dialog: equipment graveyard holding hands...
text: Suddenly, REGAN turns to head into the cornfields... MARCUS
text: yanks her arm to stop her.
text: REGAN looks at her brother... The look in his eye is begging
text: her to trust him... she does as MARCUS pulls her to his safe
dialog: place... the PICK UP TRUCK at the end of the driveway!
text: As they arrive at the truck MARCUS expertly disappears
text: through the cab's driver's side window... REGAN instinctively
text: dives underneath the truck.
text: WE SLOWLY PULL BACK on the truck. MARCUS' head pokes up from
text: the back window of the cab. REGAN lies still underneath.
text: They are split up... but safe.
scene_heading: 94 EXT. SILO - DAWN 94
text: WE MOVE along a sand path, just as we did in the beginning of
text: the movie, where the end of the cornfield opens into a
text: clearing to reveal... THE WORK TRUCK off to the far left.
text: LEE appears into frame.
text: ON LEE as he shines the flashlight... scanning the scene.
dialog: 67A.
text: HIS POV as it is... eerily quiet. LEE's flashlight shines
text: all the way to the far right onto the gaping hole in the
text: SILO... BUT THERE ARE NO CREATURES. Just the cement mixer
text: and some tools tipped onto the ground.
dialog: 68.
text: Fearing the worst... LEE makes his way to the hole.
text: ON REGAN as she lifts her head to see the light shining on
text: the SILO... and her father walking toward it. Her eyes go
text: wide. She begins to shake her head... then wave her arms as
text: best she can... no... no... NO!... but LEE doesn't see her.
text: LEE begins to walk slowly toward the SILO.
scene_heading: 95 INT. FARMHOUSE - BASEMENT - DAWN 95

dialog: another as...
text: EVELYN descends the stairs, holding the baby!
scene_heading: 96 INT. TRUCK - DAWN 96
text: Through the rearview mirror we see reflections of LEE's
text: flashlight as it scans up and down the SILO behind.
text: ON MARCUS as the dim light reflects onto his closed eyes...
text: and he wakes up. In the rearview he sees the flashlight and
text: immediately spins to look out the window at his father...
text: standing only yards from the hole. The smallest whisper...
speaker_heading: MARCUS (WHISPER)
dialog: ...Dad... no... NO....
text: Overcome with fear, MARCUS instinctively slides to the driver
dialog: side door... AND OPENS IT!!!!
scene_heading: 97 EXT. TRUCK - DAWN 97
text: As the driver's side door wrenches open, the age of the truck
dialog: and the years without use become painfully evident as...
text: IT MAKES A HIGH PITCHED SHRIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEK!
scene_heading: 98 EXT. SILO - DAWN 98
dialog: Almost transported back to that fateful day on the bridge, we
text: watch as LEE's head slowly turns as he raises his light onto
dialog: the truck and... his son!!

dialog: next... LEE RUNS!!!
dialog: 69.

scene_heading: 101 EXT. SILO - DAWN 101
text: ON LEE... running.
text: ... Desperately trying to keep his promise to his wife...
scene_heading: 102 INT. TRUCK - DAWN 102

scene_heading: 103 EXT. SILO - DAWN 103
text: OVER LEE as he sprints as fast as he can towards the truck,
text: now only 40 yards away...30...
text: THEN... on either side of LEE...
text: TWO SHADOWS BLOW PAST HIM!!! RACING, SCRAMBLING, CLAWING...
text: Still in full sprint, LEE watches...
text: AS THE FIRST SHADOW CLOSES IN ON THE TRUCK!!!!
scene_heading: 104 INT. TRUCK - DAWN 104
text: OVER REGAN looking out the back window as the creature gets
dialog: closer...closer...
text: THE BEEEEEEEP ONCE AGAIN BEGINS TO GROW... and GROW. Just as

text: experience that pain again... TURNS THE HEARING AID OFF....
dialog: We are now in total silence.....
dialog: 70.
text: REGAN looks down at her brother on the floor... Just as....
text: BANG!... THE TRUCK THRASHES VIOLENTLY!!!
text: The kids grab onto... whatever they can...
text: BANG!!!!!!!!!... THE TRUCK THRASHES VIOLENTLY AGAIN!!!!
scene_heading: 105 EXT. TRUCK - DAWN 105

dialog: hear the full sound of the violent attack!
text: OVER LEE, WE SEE THE TRUCK BEING SMASHED...

scene_heading: 106 EXT. TRUCK - DAWN 106

dialog: driveway...
scene_heading: 107 INT. TRUCK - DAWN 107
scene_heading: BACK IN SILENCE
text: ON REGAN AND MARCUS as she holds her brother and looks around

dialog: she sees...
text: ANOTHER CREATURE BURST OUT OF THE CORN AND... SLAM INTO THE
dialog: PASSENGER SIDE DOOR!!!!
text: GLASS SHATTERS!!!... And the truck... LIFTS UP!!!
scene_heading: 108 EXT. TRUCK - DAWN 108
text: ON LEE'S BACK, SPRINTING, now only twenty yards away... when
text: he sees the right side of the truck lift high into the air.
text: For a moment it looks as though it is going to tip all the
text: way over... Then SMASHES BACK DOWN TO THE GROUND!!
text: We now bear witness to something eerily familiar as LEE's
text: BODY... GIVES OUT ON HIM.
dialog: 71.
text: WE CIRCLE around LEE as HIS FEET SCRAPE TO A STOP... HIS
text: SHOULDERS LOWER.
text: WE END OUR MOVE on LEE's face as he scans the smashed
dialog: truck...
text: His eyes seem to actually flicker as his brain fires and
dialog: misfires... trying to process this nightmare... this LOSS...
dialog: When suddenly...
scene_heading: 109 INT. TRUCK - DAWN 109
text: ON REGAN, jammed down into the floor of the passenger seat.
text: She reaches over to her brother... and lifts his head. MARCUS
text: opens his teary eyes, shaken... but alive. REGAN slowly

text: MAKES DIRECT EYE CONTACT WITH HER FATHER...
scene_heading: 110 EXT. TRUCK - DAWN 110
text: WE ARE CLOSE ON LEE as he registers this miraculous sight of

scene_heading: 111 INT. TRUCK - DAWN 111

text: AND INTO THE BREAKING MORNING SKY
scene_heading: 115 INT. TRUCK - DAWN 115
text: TOTAL SILENCE...
text: OVER REGAN ONTO MARCUS as they both stare straight...

scene_heading: 118 INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAWN 118
text: THROUGH THE LIVING ROOM WINDOW, WE LOOK OUT onto the
text: cornfields... and up to the silo. Suddenly... We see a tiny
text: pick up truck appear and rumble down the dirt road.
text: WE SLOWLY PULL BACK through the living room as the truck
text: rolls past the next window... and then the next. AS WE NOW
text: PULL OUT of the living room and into the front hall,
text: suddenly... EVELYN appears walking down the staircase, almost
text: vacant. She is carrying the shotgun!
text: WE CONTINUE TO MOVE, NOW ON EVELYN'S BACK... as she slowly
text: walks out the front door and down the front steps. As she
text: steps down to the sand path... THE PICK UP TRUCK SLOWLY
text: RUMBLES TO A STOP AT THE END OF THE PATH!!!
text: MARCUS AND REGAN pop out of the truck and run as fast as they
dialog: can into their mother's arms!!!
text: EVELYN ENVELOPES HER CHILDREN WITH EVERYTHING SHE HAS!!!... A

text: rushes down the stairs and into the basement.
text: Then... REGAN takes a long step into frame. Her silhouette
text: looks down the dark stairwell.
dialog: 74A.
text: After a moment, she slowly puts her foot down on the first
dialog: step... and nothing happens.
text: For a brief moment... she looks behind her... but no one
dialog: comes.
dialog: 75.
scene_heading: 120 INT. BASEMENT - DAWN 120
text: WE ARE ON THE STAIRS as REGAN's feet step down into frame.
text: As REGAN reaches the basement floor, she pauses a moment,
text: still looking at her feet... and then slowly turns.
text: EVELYN picks the baby out from a box and grabs MARCUS tight.
text: We watch REGAN's face as she enters her father's workspace...
text: FOR THE FIRST TIME!!! She is stunned.
text: OVER REGAN as she steps down and begins to walk through the
text: room. Her eyes track, AS WE DID WHEN WE FIRST SAW THE ROOM,
text: past the TOWERING WALL OF SECURITY MONITORS... along the wall
text: of NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS, NOTES, AND SCIENTIFIC IMAGES. Her
text: eyes continue now toward her father's WORK STATION. THROUGH
scene_heading: BOXES OF SALVAGED ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT and onto... LEE'S HEAD
text: PHONES. REGAN picks up the head phones and follows the
text: wire... TO HER FATHER'S HAM RADIO. She looks down at the
dialog: knob her father used to search... and the microphone he used
text: to reach out. For the first time REGAN sees... REGAN
dialog: REALIZES... THIS is what her father was doing all this time.
dialog: THIS is what he was doing... FOR THEM! ON REGAN taking all
text: this in, when her eyes move just slightly to the side... and
text: she freezes.
text: EVELYN immediately turns and gestures to her children to
text: follow her behind the water heater... they must hide.
text: REGAN... doesn't move. OFF HER FACE... WE BOOM DOWN SLOWLY
text: BEHIND the shelves of LEE'S sacred workspace... past circuit
dialog: boards... salvaged electronics and exposed wiring... and LAND
text: ON A SHOT DIRECTLY ACROSS LEE'S DESK... TO REGAN's HAND...
text: AS REGAN reaches out, WE RACK FOCUS to... THE PILE OF HEARING
text: AIDS HER FATHER HAD BEEN WORKING ON ALL THIS TIME.
text: REGAN'S hand pushes into the pile like a shovel... and
text: emerges with a handful of hearing aids...
text: Suddenly... THE FLOORBOARDS ABOVE THEM CREAK!!!
text: MARCUS and EVELYN look up. REGAN... does not... Because she
dialog: can't hear it.
text: EVELYN immediately grabs MARCUS and heads for the water and
text: oil tanks. She sits MARCUS down safely... and then places
text: THE BABY IN HIS ARMS... and turns.
text: MARCUS takes in his new sibling for the first time.
text: OVER REGAN, COMING INTO FOCUS... is EVELYN, still carrying
text: the shotgun. She kneels by her daughter's side.
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: EVELYN (SIGNING)
dialog: We have to hide, my love.
text: REGAN slowly turns to her mother... and shows her the hearing
dialog: aids.
text: EVELYN looks down at her daughter who for the first time...
dialog: is weeping... our tough warrior princess, in this moment...
text: is still just a little girl.
text: EVELYN stares into the pained eyes of her little girl when
text: suddenly... REGAN's eyes begin to rise... higher... and
speaker_heading: higher above EVELYN.
text: WE CUT TO EVELYN TO SEE...
text: A LARGE SHADOW RISES UP BEHIND HER!!!!
text: EVELYN seeing REGAN's eyes rise... just knows.
text: In one swift motion EVELYN suddenly springs up... and aims
text: the shotgun directly at the CREATURE.
text: WE CUT WIDE to see... and hear, the room... is totally still.
dialog: For the rest of this scene...Like the greatest of westerns,
dialog: we are in the most epic... of standoffs. Time... stands
text: still. Air... doesn't move. Tension... is dripping from the
dialog: walls.
text: ON REGAN... holding her breath... just stares
text: ON MARCUS... frozen behind the water tank... just stares.
text: ON EVELYN... arm outstretched, with weapon ready... just
dialog: stares.
text: ON THE CREATURE... SLOWLY OPENING ITS PLATES!!!!
text: As the monitors once again... go fuzzy.... Each of the humans
text: can only watch as these small plates open with the suction of
dialog: anatomical goo...
text: They can only watch as the plates crackle ever so slightly...
text: as they turn... and search...
dialog: ...for the sound that will end it all.
text: CLOSE on sweat dripping down from MARCUS's forehead. TRACKING
text: DOWN MARCUS' face, we see the inevitable path his sweat will
dialog: take until we leave his face and arrive on... The baby.
text: CLOSE ON EVELYN's arm... as it begins to quiver...
dialog: 77.
text: CLOSE ON EVELYN'S eyes as her brain makes the realization...
dialog: she can't hold this gun much longer...
text: CLOSE ON THE CREATURE... as it opens more... and more plates!
text: CLOSE ON REGAN, her eyes begin to search the room... her
dialog: father's room looking for something... ANYTHING!
text: REGAN's POV as her eyes search the room... search the wall...
text: search the boards. Finally her eyes land on one specific
text: thing on her father's board... She sees the phrase...
dialog: `WEAPON??'.
dialog: Suddenly...
text: REGAN... reaches up to touch her mother's arm.
text: EVELYN looks down at REGAN...
text: REGAN gently shakes her head then gently touches EVELYN's
text: arm... and slowly lowers the gun.
text: EVELYN looks down at her daughter... her eyes begin to well
dialog: up... this is it... This is the end.
text: EVELYN slowly reaches out to take REGAN's hand. As REGAN's
text: hand begins to clasp into hers... SHE STOPS...
text: EVELYN looks down to see REGAN slowly pull her hand away...
text: and open it up. There in the palm of REGAN's hand... are
dialog: hearing aids.
text: REGAN slowly turns to her father's work bench to see the pile
dialog: of hearing aids her father... made... sitting just in front
text: of the microphone of the HAM RADIO.
text: REGAN looks back up to the board at the phrase...
dialog: "WEAPON??".
text: REGAN looks to the creature still searching the room for
dialog: sound.
text: REGAN raises her hand to her ear... AND TURNS HER FATHER'S
dialog: HEARING AID BACK ON!
text: Immediately.... THE EXCRUCIATING BEEEEEEEP FLOODS OUR WORLD!
text: Suddenly THE CREATURE... STOPS! IT'S PLATES... SNAP SHUT OUT
dialog: OF PROTECTION!!!!!!
text: REGAN looks on as the CREATURE SCRAMBLES BACK IN OBVIOUS
speaker_heading: PAIN!
dialog: 78.
text: After a moment REGAN... SWITCHES THE HEARING AID OFF!
dialog: ...SILENCE...
text: EVELYN looks down at her daughter...
text: REGAN... slowly moves her hand across her father's workbench
text: to... THE HEADPHONES.
text: THE CREATURE... NOW SCREEEEEEEEEEEECHES!!!!... slowly gets
text: back to it's feet ... AND TURNS DIRECTLY TOWARD REGAN!!!
text: REGAN's fingers travel up the black cord of her father's
text: headphones to... THE HAM RADIO! Suddenly REGAN unplugs the
text: headphones from the HAM RADIO as we hear... A POP OF FEEDBACK
dialog: FROM THE NOW OPEN SPEAKER!!!!
text: THE CREATURE.... SCREEEEEEEEEECHES... AND MOVES FOR REGAN!
dialog: Just then...
dialog: WE ARE ON MARCUS who's sweat has indeed made it to his
text: chin... THEN FALLS.
text: WE FOLLOW THE SWEAT... AS IT HITS THE BABY... THE BABY BEGINS
dialog: TO CRY!!!!
text: THE CREATURE SUDDENLY WHIRLS AWAY FROM REGAN TOWARD THE TANKS
text: TIME SLOWS DOWN....
text: ALL IN ONE MOMENT....
text: - REGAN reaches her hand up to her ear... AND REMOVES THE
text: HEARING AID HER FATHER MADE HER
text: - THE CREATURE REARS UP TO STRIKE THE WATER TANK!
text: And in that exact moment, REGAN... EXTENDS HER ARM...
text: ..... WE WATCH AS REGAN PLACES HER HEARING AID...
dialog: ..... ONTO THE MICROPHONE!!!!
text: CLOSE on the HAM RADIO SPEAKER....
text: AS THE BRAIN PIERCING BEEEEEEP BLARES OUT!!!!!
text: With the sound now HUGELY more powerful and piercing we see:
text: THE CREATURE suddenly...SHOOTS UP DEAD STRAIGHT... ONCE AGAIN
text: IT'S PLATES SNAP SHUT!!!... IT'S HEAD POINTED TO THE
text: CEILING... IT'S BODY QUAKES! TENSE... WITH AGONY!!!
dialog: 79.
text: ON REGAN as her face... DOESN'T CHANGE... SHE IS SAFE NOW
text: THAT SHE ISN'T WEARING THE HEARING AIDS.
text: CLOSE ON THE CREATURE... AS EVERY PLATE ON ITS BODY CLENCHES
text: TIGHTER... TIGHTER... ALMOST DIGGING INTO THE CREATURE'S OWN
text: SKIN. And then... THEY BEGIN TO SHAKE!
text: THE CREATURE SCREEEEEEEEEECHES ONCE MORE IN PAIN AS IT NOW
text: FALLS BACKWARD TO THE FLOOR!!!
text: The plates... SHAKE MORE VIOLENTLY NOW... and that creates a
dialog: sound. Something between that of a cicada right next to your
text: ear... and the sound of a house fan's blade rubbing against
text: the cage its enclosed in, the sound... IS AWFUL!
text: Just then... A POPPING SOUND. And then another... as the
text: frequency of the sound short circuits the plates to the point
dialog: that they... BEGIN TO POP OPEN... AND THEN GIVE WAY!!!
text: As plates now begin to go limp, for the first time... WE SEE
text: INSIDE OF THE CREATURE!!! A VAST AND COMPLEX SYSTEM OF HOLES
text: AND CHAMBERS THAT CAVITATE SOUND!
text: THE CREATURE CONTINUES TO SCURRY BACKWARD THROUGH THE ROOM TO
text: THE DARK CORNER AT THE BACK REACHING FOR SOMETHING...
text: ANYTHING TO STOP THIS SOUND... THIS PAIN!
text: AS IT REACHES THE BACK WALL IT SUDDENLY STOPS. PLATES HANG
text: LIKE LIMP PETALS OF A FLOWER... AS BLACK FLUID BEGINS TO
text: TRICKLE OUT...
text: REGAN... TURNS OFF THE HEARING AID...
dialog: SILENCE....
dialog: ...
text: The only sound that can be heard is the CREATURE'S inner
text: anatomy as it rises and slowly falls... as if gasping for
dialog: life...
text: EVELYN and REGAN look over to the water tanks... AS MARCUS
text: SLOWLY STANDS UP... HOLDING THE BABY
text: EVELYN takes one step toward him when...
text: THE CREATURE LEAPS OUT OF THE DARK... AND LAUNCHES, ARM
dialog: EXTENDED TOWARD REGAN!!!
text: ON THE CREATURE.... BEHIND THE LIMP PLATES WE NOW SEE THE
scene_heading: DISGUSTING FACE OF THE CREATURE. LARGE, BLACK... AND LONG
text: AGO EVOLVED AWAY... EYE SOCKETS ARE THE LAST THING WE SEE AS
text: THE CREATURE LETS OUT A NOW DISTORTED AND THUS MORE
dialog: HORRIFYING SCREECH!!!!
dialog: 80.
text: ON REGAN... AS HER EYES CLOSE.... SHE'S READY....
dialog: When suddenly...
text: EVELYN STEPS INTO FRAME........... SHOTGUN RAISED...
dialog: BLAM!!!
text: THE CREATURE'S HEAD...... EXPLODES.....
dialog: ...Silence...
text: REGAN and EVELYN look to the CARCUS at they're feet....
dialog: DEAD!
text: After a long moment... from outside, off in the distance...
text: we hear a muffled... SCREEEEEEECH.
text: And then... ANOTHER... AND ANOTHER... The other creatures....
dialog: HEARD THE SHOT!....
text: REGAN and EVELYN slowly look to the monitors... as their
text: images once again flicker to life. On each of the
text: monitors... a quiet, undisturbed landscape....
text: Then suddenly in one of the monitors off in the left
text: corner... A CLAW STEPS INTO FRAME!!!!
text: In another monitor... A SHADOW FLASHES PAST THE SCREEN.
text: Then another monitor... ANOTHER CREATURE... AND ANOTHER...
text: AND ANOTHER... THE CREATURES ARE RACING TOWARD THE
dialog: FARMHOUSE!!!
text: EVELYN slowly turns... and looks down at her daughter.
text: REGAN looks up at her mother for a long moment and then
text: reaches out her hand to the knob of the HAM RADIO..........
text: AND TURNS THE VOLUME UP ALL THE WAY!
text: EVELYN's face... changes... as she raises the shot gun into
dialog: frame........
dialog: AND COCKS IT!!!!
