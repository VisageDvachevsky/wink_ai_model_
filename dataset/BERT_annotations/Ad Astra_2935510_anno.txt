speaker_heading: BLACK.
dialog: We TILT DOWN to REVEAL:
text: THE EARTH, AS VIEWED FROM ABOVE.
text: We HEAR MUSIC: a CHEERFUL PIECE, incongruous with the awesome
dialog: image of our planet.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A NEWS REPORT on PBS.
text: The introductory music accompanies the logo for the Public
dialog: Broadcasting System.
scene_heading: EXT. SKY - DAY
text: The bright blue sky of EARTH. Then: THE LARGEST ANTENNA
text: WE'VE EVER SEEN. A structure stretching inconceivably high
text: in the sky, into the outer reaches of the atmosphere--around
text: 100,000 feet in the air. A majestic lattice of multi-wire,
text: high-voltage tethers, studded with hardware. Towering from
text: earth, up through and above the cloud formations. Over THIS,
speaker_heading: an UPBEAT VOICE:
speaker_heading: REPORTER'S VOICE
dialog: If this looks to you like something
dialog: out of one of your children’s comic
dialog: book adventures, then you’re not
dialog: alone!
text: SERIES OF SHOTS of the ANTENNA UNDER CONSTRUCTION over which
dialog: the reporter narrates:
speaker_heading: REPORTER’S VOICE (CONT’D)
dialog: But child’s play it isn’t. This
text: represents the beginning of a new
dialog: era in celestial communications.
dialog: It’s called the Gravitational
dialog: Interferometer Space Antenna, or
dialog: “GISA,” to those of us who can’t
dialog: remember that mouthful. Its goal?
text: SERIES OF SHOTS of WORKERS in what look like SPACESUITS. On
text: scaffolding, hanging from wires, etc. OVER THESE IMAGES:
speaker_heading: REPORTER’S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: To search throughout the universe
dialog: for intelligent life. With the
dialog: recent confirmation of so many
dialog: planets capable of sustaining life
dialog: throughout the galaxy, GISA may
dialog: finally prove, once and for all,
dialog: that we are not alone.
text: File footage of ASTRONAUTS on SPACEWALKS.
speaker_heading: REPORTER’S VOICE (CONT’D)
dialog: The antenna will allow us to listen
dialog: in, across the galaxy, through
dialog: gravitational waves--seen as the
dialog: ultimate means of communication
dialog: through space.
text: Now: footage of MACHINES going this way and that, spinning a
text: lattice of tethers. They’re almost like spiders on a web.
text: Or HYDRAS, with CYCLOPS-LIKE BRIGHT LIGHTS in their centers.
speaker_heading: REPORTER’S VOICE (CONT’D)
dialog: Self-replicators are used for its
dialog: construction. And it’s not just
dialog: machines; a select few highly-
dialog: trained folks from the Army Corps
dialog: of Engineers will have to check
dialog: every inch of the carbon fiber for
dialog: flaws. It has proven one of the
dialog: most demanding jobs on Earth, but
dialog: these men and women are up to the
dialog: task. Engineer Major Roy McBride
dialog: of Las Cruces, New Mexico, says
dialog: he’s not afraid of the challenge:
text: IMAGE OF FOUR YOUNG MEN and TWO YOUNG WOMEN, seated on a
text: SOFA, in a nondescript office environment with an Army Corps
text: of Engineers logo/graphic on a screen behind them.
text: One of them is ROY MCBRIDE.
text: Roy McBride: forties, handsome. His eyes are light blue,
text: seemingly friendly, but reveal little about the man himself.
dialog: He is even-tempered, but one would not call him kind; there
text: is an icy quality to him. Still, he is not overtly cruel or
dialog: petty, and to talk to him, one could never question his
dialog: intentions or his integrity.
text: Roy speaks slowly, formally, deliberately, as though he does
text: not want ever to repeat himself. He seems guarded, sincere,
text: precise, competent. His face is blank but prone to the
dialog: occasional awkward joke, and those jokes are made almost for
text: self-amusement. He does not seem morose.
text: In fact, he smiles all the time, and his face often lights up
text: with little motivation. He speaks with a very slight
dialog: Midwestern/Western accent. Think Neil Armstrong.
text: As he speaks, on the screen appears the title “Maj. Roy C.
dialog: McBride”.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: The Army Corps of Engineers trains
dialog: us to deal with our fears. And
dialog: this team here is real inspiring--
text: Lt. Parsegian did a repair skywalk
dialog: during an episode of pulmonary
dialog: edema. Now when you see something
dialog: like that, you just wanna get up
dialog: there and do it as good as she did.
dialog: Be part of that team. So we all
dialog: feed on each other in that way.
speaker_heading: REPORTER'S VOICE
dialog: McBride is only the latest ina
dialog: long line of aerospace pioneers.
dialog: His father, noted activist and
dialog: educator H. Clifford McBride, was
dialog: part of an astronaut colony
text: tragically lost in space eighteen
dialog: years ago.
text: It is CLIFFORD MCBRIDE whom we’re LOOKING AT. Looks somewhat
text: like Bill Clinton in that old Georgetown photo--almost like a
text: countercultural figure, a_ sharp contrast with Roy's buttoned-
dialog: down appearance.
scene_heading: ANGLE BACK ON ROY:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: My Dad was...he was certainly a
dialog: different kind of astronaut. He
dialog: was a free-thinker. He went all
dialog: the way to Neptune. It didn’t end
dialog: up going the way he wanted, but
dialog: he’s the reason I do what I do. I
dialog: just think you can’t worry too much
dialog: about the past because you don’t
dialog: have control over it. So I look
dialog: forward. And like I said, we've
dialog: certainly got ourselves a helluva
dialog: team here.
speaker_heading: REPORTER'S VOICE
dialog: (cheerful again)
dialog: That team is always on the go.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: REPORTER’S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: In the clouds, it’s all about the
dialog: work, and one gets the sense that
dialog: Roy would rather be left alone to
dialog: perform his duties than talk to
dialog: this reporter:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: What I want...is to serve, to do my
dialog: job as good as I can, away from the
dialog: spotlight. It’s real critical to
dialog: maintain control and not to be
dialog: vulnerable to outside factors.
dialog: 
text: Roy flashes that smile.
speaker_heading: REPORTER'S VOICE
dialog: With all of the risks, do you ever
dialog: contemplate the larger meaning of
dialog: what it is you're trying to
dialog: accomplish? How we may be able,
dialog: for example, to detect intelligent
dialog: life out there, and find out what
dialog: they might have to say to us?
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: No...not really... That’s not for
dialog: me to comment on--I don’t consider
dialog: that sort of thing.
dialog: (the smile returns)
dialog: But...I do thank you for your
dialog: interest in the program, and we
dialog: hope your continued support leads
dialog: to our success.
dialog: ANGLE ON ROY as we:
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. GISA TETHER STATION — DAY
text: The ANTENNA STRETCHES HIGH INTO THE SKY. LOOKS LIKE IT’S
scene_heading: ALMOST DONE.
scene_heading: INT. GISA TETHER STATION - DAY
text: We are inside a crowded, cramped place, where no attention is
dialog: paid to aesthetics and a lot is paid to practicality.
text: Exposed wires and computers and electronics. A circular logo
text: of “GISA” (The Gravitational Interferometer Space Antenna).
text: Video monitors are everywhere, but so are signs of
text: recreation: a ping-pong table, board games, cards, etc are
text: mixed with more high-tech gaming equipment.
text: HANK WILLIAMS’ MUSIC is PLAYING. It’s sort of like a party
dialog: atmosphere here.
text: CLOSE ON: MEN AND WOMEN SMILING--and looking into the CAMERA.
text: Waving, gesticulating, clapping, egging us on. But we can’t
dialog: HEAR them; we HEAR MERELY the Hank Williams and the SOUND of
text: WHIRRING: an AIRPACK, for a spacesuit of some kind.
text: It is Roy’s POINT-OF-VIEW. He walks in a SPACESUIT and
text: HELMET, in his own world. A RADIO voice breaks in, over the
dialog: Hank Williams:
speaker_heading: RADIO
speaker_heading: (OS VOICE, RADIO FILTER)
dialog: Let’s see, we got some scores for
dialog: ya, Roy... It was Auburn over
dialog: Georgia Tech, 35-16... Oklahoma
dialog: 17, Syracuse 9... And San Diego
dialog: State beat Oregon, 23-20.
speaker_heading: SMILING WOMAN
dialog: (muffled; through radio
dialog: filter)
dialog: Skywalk 714! You go, boy!
text: Roy waves, gives the thumbs up. Then:
scene_heading: INT. POD
text: Aided by three men in white jumpsuits (the back of which are
text: stamped by corporate logos for RAYTHEON), Roy is positioned
text: inside a small compartment with a LATCH. To a jumpsuited man
dialog: named SAL:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: I guess there won’t be too many
dialog: more of these soon, huh Sal.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Yes sir, almost done!
text: Sal STARTS PUNCHING SOMETHING into a NEARBY COMPUTER. Roy
text: REACHES AROUND SAL'S EAR, PULLS a GOLF BALL from behind his
speaker_heading: EAR.
text: Roy taps Sal, who smiles at the quite nerdy trick, nodding--
text: he’s seen it before. Roy GRINS WIDELY. The STEEL DOOR
text: SLIDES OPEN, and SAL GENUFLECTS...
text: Only now do we realize that we've been in a STATION floating
text: inconceivably high in the sky. Not in space, certainly
text: earthbound, but frighteningly high up--higher than any
dialog: aircraft we’ve ever been inside of.
text: We move outside, above a small PLATFORM.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BRIGHT BLUE ATMOSPHERE
dialog: We're in the outer reaches of the atmosphere--around 100
text: thousand feet in the air. The ground far below is both blue,
text: where the waters are, and tawny, where the land is. The
text: earth’s curvature is beginning to be apparent.
text: The air is frigid and thin, and the environment hostile. But
dialog: there is no doubt it is beautiful. We aren’t in space; we
text: are still connected to the earth, as Roy stands at the
text: station’s exterior.
text: We cannot SEE his face, which is SHIELDED by his helmet’s
text: dark visor. We go with Roy as he steps out of the pod and
dialog: walks onto--
scene_heading: EXT. GISA PLATFORM
text: Roy BEGINS TO CLIMB DOWN a SMALL LADDER. HAIR-RAISING
text: SILENCE. Roy looks UP. The EDGE OF SPACE ABOVE. Back down:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (RADIO FILTER)
dialog: The earth sure is beautiful today.
dialog: As always...
text: As he MOVES, we SEE, BELOW HIM, the TETHER CORDS, NEVER-
text: ENDING, or so it seems. And, THOUSANDS OF FEET BELOW ROY,
text: THE EARTH. It passes below his FEET, and it’s just the most
text: spectacular vista. The CLOUD FORMATIONS are like Van Gogh's
text: “Starry Night,” magnificent swirls, vibrant.
text: Between Roy and the ground is much air activity. About a
text: dozen shuttles (mostly unmanned) crisscross below us,
text: carrying tethers, busses, tether-deployment spools, and other
text: building blocks for modular architecture. Some tethers are
text: dozens of miles long.
text: SELF-REPLICATING MACHINES, looking like HYDRAS made of
text: GRAPHENE, maneuver up and down the antenna.
text: With the shuttles below him, and SATELLITES high above him,
text: Roy is sandwiched--with a lot of space--in between.
dialog: The project is visually exciting, but for Roy, it's business
text: as usual. We HEAR STATIC. And out of the STATIC, ROY’S
scene_heading: RADIO FILTERED VOICE:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: Control, I have established visual
dialog: with tether oh-niner-four-five.
dialog: Please confirm it is offline.
dialog: Over.
speaker_heading: CONTROL (RADIO FILTER)
dialog: That's affirmative, Roy. Tether oh-
text: niner-four-five is offline.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Roger that.
text: Roy floats down perpendicularly alongside a several-mile-
text: long, multi-wire structure.
text: Roy appears small, like an ant on a tree. We HEAR HIS
text: BREATHING...
text: He rappels down, rather gracefully. Turns some kind of a
text: wheel that allows two parts of the tether to become attached.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: Control, I am...closing the loop
text: now. Over.
text: A POWER SURGE has HIT THE TETHER. Roy is STARTLED:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: (some concern)
dialog: Control, I just experienced some
text: unusual power surges. They appear
dialog: to be quite extreme.
speaker_heading: CONTROL (RADIO FILTER)
dialog: (alarmed, but completely
dialog: under control)
dialog: Uh, yeah Roy, we picked that up
dialog: too. We--we advise aborting here,
dialog: we uh, repeat--we do advise
text: aborting.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Control--I have not yet completed
dialog: my tasks--—
text: Suddenly: along the entire length of the tether to which Roy
text: is attached, the busses’ ACTIVATION LIGHTS come on, one by
dialog: one. (The lights are how we tell the structure is active.)
text: The HYDRA MACHINES START UP AGAIN!
text: Roy can see the tether is becoming active, section after
text: section, at breakneck speed--and he pushes himself away from
text: it at the last second, just as it ACTIVATES.
text: He REBOUNDS against another, parallel (ACTIVE!) tether, IS
text: SHOCKED, as he RICOCHETS against it--changing directions--and
text: begins to SPIN out of control.
text: He SPINS SO VERY FAST... Is he DEAD...?
text: But remarkably, he’s able to speak--rather calmly, given the
dialog: situation.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: (through heavy breaths)
dialog: Control--
text: As Roy continues to tumble, the radio in his helmet squawks
text: away--though never in a panicked tone:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: Obviously a serious malfunction
dialog: here--I’ve lost balance, over.
text: ROY CONTINUES TO SPIN, CRAZILY, MADLY. VIOLENTLY. He barely
dialog: avoids hitting more tethers...
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m gonna try and level out as soon
text: as this air thickens up.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Control?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Control, do you read?
text: NO ANSWER.
text: Then, as he descends: ROY STRETCHES HIS ARMS and LEGS OUT.
text: In the DENSER AIR, HE STOPS THE SPIN.
dialog: 
text: At last, Roy straightens himself out. Like a great skydiver.
text: HE PULLS THE RIPCORD...
text: A PARACHUTE shoots out from the back of his suit and opens
text: with tremendous force, YANKING HIM UP and AWAY FROM US.
text: He RIGHTS HIMSELF and begins to float safely to the earth...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. COLORADO MOUNTAINS - PLATEAU
text: Roy sinks to the surface. A WIDE SHOT as we SEE: SCORES of
text: PEOPLE RUNNING TO HELP HIM...
speaker_heading: MAN’S VOICE (PRE-LAP)
dialog: I must say, you seem to be in
dialog: remarkably good shape, Major.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - COLORADO SPRINGS CAMPUS - NIGHT
text: A ROW of HOSPITAL BEDS. Roy is sitting up, on one of them.
text: Each seat/bed has a SCREEN NEXT TO IT. Large WINDOWS LOOK
text: OUT INTO THE COLORADO WILDERNESS.
text: A pair of MED TECHS are here, doing CHECKS on Roy.
text: Roy sits alongside a window as they check his heart, lungs,
text: blood pressure, temperature, etc. Roy looks out the window.
text: Earth, dusk. Beautiful, with cloud formations. He has
text: trouble keeping eye contact with the Medical Officers. A MAN
text: takes ROY’S PHOTOGRAPH.
speaker_heading: MED TECH #1 (CONT'D)
dialog: How d’you feel?
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Well...my left shoulder’s a little
dialog: sore. It was likely hyperextended
text: at some point during descent.
speaker_heading: MED TECH #1 (CONT’D)
dialog: Yeah, you got yanked around pretty
dialog: good. But you’re in one piece.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Sad to say, some of your fellow
dialog: engineers weren't so fortunate.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What’s that, sir?
speaker_heading: MED TECH #1
dialog: We lost your support crew, on the
dialog: wire--and four hundred some odd
dialog: more here on earth, too. Been
dialog: tragic.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Gee... That’s real unfortunate.
dialog: I’m real sorry to hear that...
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: MED TECH #2
dialog: Would you like the shades down,
dialog: Major?
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: No, it’s okay. I like to observe
dialog: the, the cloud patterns and the
dialog: mountains.
text: The Med Tech hears this, nods, then TYPES something into a
text: small iPad-type device, except it unscrolls. The CAMERA
text: TILTS UP the ELECTRONIC DOCUMENT TO SEE: “MILD AUTISM”.
text: As the Med Techs pack up, Med Tech #1 holds an earplug-sized
dialog: item.
speaker_heading: MED TECH #1
dialog: (hands Roy the earplug)
dialog: You might want to put this in your
dialog: ear, sleep with it overnight. Just
dialog: to check for any head trauma. And
dialog: try to stay put, if you can.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Yessir. I would like to be able to
dialog: return to my work.
speaker_heading: MED TECH #1
dialog: [If] Your head checks out, you can
dialog: be cleared to go back as soon as
dialog: tomorrow.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Okay. I’d like that very much.
dialog: Given all that’s occurred, they’re
dialog: probably pretty shorthanded up
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: MED TECH #1
dialog: (stares for a beat; then)
dialog: Of course. Try to rest.
text: He packs up and leaves.
scene_heading: INT. DORMITORY - LATER
text: Roy is in bed, sitting up in hospital whites. A GREEN LIGHT
text: and a BUZZ to his left. He PUSHES A BUTTON. PROJECTED in
text: front of him, a very advanced form of FaceTime is showing:
text: His mother. LEANNE MCBRIDE. Late sixties. Seems older than
text: her age; her face is lined, her mouth slightly downturned.
dialog: 11.
text: She SEES him, EXPLODING WITH EMOTION. The sound is worse than
dialog: the image, for some reason:
speaker_heading: LEANNE MCBRIDE
dialog: Roy!
scene_heading: TEARS FLOW FORTH from HER:
speaker_heading: LEANNE MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank the Good Lord! I couldn’t
dialog: lose you up there too. You’re all
dialog: I've got...
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Hello, Ma. I’m all right. I’m
dialog: gonna go back to work soon.
speaker_heading: LEANNE MCBRIDE
dialog: I love you--so much. I was just so
dialog: sick with worry--
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: There’s no reason for any kind of
dialog: concern. The fuss is unnecessary.
speaker_heading: LEANNE MCBRIDE
dialog: Oh Lord... I know you don’t
dialog: understand--you can’t. Maybe
dialog: someday you will... I’m sorry
dialog: you're alone there...
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: It’s okay.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I prefer it.
speaker_heading: LEANNE MCBRIDE
dialog: I love you, Roy. You’ll always be
dialog: my little one. Maybe I can see you
dialog: for Thanksgiving?
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: It’s possible. Goodbye, Ma.
speaker_heading: LEANNE MCBRIDE
dialog: Goodbye, darling.
text: He PUSHES A BUTTON and it SHUTS OFF the image...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 12.
scene_heading: INT. DORMITORY - LATE NIGHT
text: The room is DARK. ROY is prostrate, in bed, asleep.
dialog: RESTLESS. We HEAR his PULSE, HIS HEART...
text: Roy’s EYES OPEN, and he is COVERED IN SWEAT. His EYES WIDEN--
text: like he’s SEEING A GHOST.
text: AWAKE, he has a VISION. FLASHING:
text: An image appears to him, and to us: The striking eyes and
text: most of the face of a YOUNG BOY. He seems around 8 years-
text: old, looking off-screen at something. He's smiling and
text: blinking, in EXTREME, STEP-PRINTED, SLOW MOTION.
text: But the image is very UNCLEAR. It’s BLURRY, almost like a
text: reclaimed moment from the Zapruder footage.
text: WIDER SHOT -- again, EXTREME SLOW MOTION. A SMALL BOY
text: (probably the same person as the one in the previous image)
text: runs across what might be a wet, cobble-stoned street, on a
text: cloudy day. This time:
text: A GIRL, an OLDER GIRL, is JOINING HIM. The image is
dialog: haunting.
dialog: 
text: The final image: striking, mainly because it's so odd. A
text: MEDIUM SHOT of what looks like a MEDIEVAL CASTLE (!) IRON
scene_heading: GATE, COMING DOWN, in the same EXTREME, STEP-PRINTED, SLOW
text: MOTION as in the other image.
text: ROY’S BREATHING BECOMES LABORED.
text: CLOSE SHOT on ROY as he then looks out the window. His panic
text: abating somewhat, he allows his head to REST back, ON THE
text: PILLOW. His EYES DART BACK AND FORTH, looking out to the
dialog: ceiling--and to the heavens...
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: CUT IN:
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY —- MORNING
text: A YOUNG WOMAN IN ARMY FATIGUES comes down a hallway.
scene_heading: INT. DORMITORY
text: She approaches ROY, who is dressed and sitting up. Going
text: through a “Scientific American” on-screen magazine.
dialog: 13.
scene_heading: YOUNG WOMAN IN ARMY FATIGUES
dialog: Morning, Major. I’m here to take
dialog: you to SPACECOM Control. For
dialog: debriefing. Is that okay?
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Course, Ma’am.
scene_heading: INT. FORT CARSON - CONTROL CENTER - MORNING
text: It’s the center of the base. A big “USSPACECOM” SIGN. Roy
text: is being escorted by the woman.
text: A restaurant, a souvenir stand. MUZAK plays softly.
text: Families are here, excited. There is a TOURISM BOARD desk (A
text: SIGN READS, “READY TO MEET AN ALIEN? GO TO SPACE!”). A LARGE
text: ALIEN CHARACTER, meant to appeal to children, graces the
text: painted board: “Andy The Alien”. Two YOUNG CHILDREN get
text: their PHOTOS TAKEN in ill-fitting army spacesuits in front of
text: a powder-blue backdrop.
scene_heading: INT. FORT CARSON - CONTROL CENTER - CORRIDOR
text: Roy is led down a long, winding CORRIDOR until he reaches a
text: closed door.
scene_heading: YOUNG WOMAN IN ARMY FATIGUES
dialog: Would you like anything to eat or
dialog: drink, Major?
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (friendly smile)
dialog: No, thank you. The food’s real
dialog: good in the dorm.
scene_heading: YOUNG WOMAN IN ARMY FATIGUES
dialog: That’s wonderful to hear. We
dialog: brought in a new caterer last month
dialog: and I think it’s gotten a lot
dialog: better.
dialog: And a LATCH OPENS:
scene_heading: INT. FORT CARSON - CONTROL CENTER - USSPACECOM HEADQUARTERS
text: This is USSPACECOM’s covert ops headquarters. Present are
text: FIVE of Roy’s SUPERIORS. HE SALUTES THEM, mumbles cordial
text: “HELLOS” .
dialog: 14.
scene_heading: They are: BRIGADIER GENERAL FALLON, LIEUTENANT GENERAL
text: SHARPE, COLONEL EPINGER, and a woman, ADJUTANT GENERAL AMELIA
text: VOGEL, who refers to a PDA-type device.
text: Among the others here is an older man, seated SILENTLY in the
text: corner. Observing. His name, we will learn, is DR. MARTIN
text: PEDROSA. More on him later.
scene_heading: BRIGADIER GENERAL FALLON
dialog: Major, I’m Brigadier General
dialog: Fallon. This is Lieutenant General
dialog: Sharpe, Director of SPACECOM
dialog: Special Operations. And Adjutant
dialog: General Vogel.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (nods; then)
dialog: Sirs. Ma’am.
text: The DOOR is CLOSED BEHIND THEM. Actually, more SEALED THAN
text: CLOSED. Fallon motions for Roy to sit, and he does as well.
text: As the others sit around him, he’s looking at a file:
scene_heading: BRIGADIER GENERAL FALLON
dialog: Please--sit down. Your profile’s
dialog: certainly very interesting. You've
dialog: done exceptionally well on the
dialog: assessment tests. Says here--
dialog: you've got a near-photographic
dialog: memory. Basic combat...space
dialog: training, too--just exceptional,
text: ‘cross the board.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (subtly prideful)
dialog: Thank you, sir.
scene_heading: BRIGADIER GENERAL FALLON
dialog: (looks up from dossier)
dialog: Your pulse’s never gone above 80
dialog: during any spacewalk or skywalk?
dialog: Even on this most recent fall?
dialog: That true?
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: It’s what we’re trained for, sir.
dialog: I can’t take any personal credit
dialog: for that.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE
dialog: You know Major, generally we look
dialog: for people like you, people who
dialog: won't let emotions or fears get in
dialog: the way of a task.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE (CONT'D)
dialog: People who might be called “on the
dialog: spectrum,” if you will. I do say
dialog: that with respect.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So you must not be surprised that
dialog: we've reached out to you.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: No, sir...I expected a debriefing
dialog: on account of the accident.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I am surprised that Ops is handling
dialog: it, but it’s certainly not a
dialog: problem of any kind.
scene_heading: BRIGADIER GENERAL FALLON
dialog: Well, we’ve traveled a long way to
dialog: see you here today. And it is not
dialog: a coincidence.
text: The full-wall VIDEO SCREEN behind Roy plays real-time images
text: of Fort Carson. Lieutenant General Sharpe consults his PDA
text: device. Fallon stares at Roy for a moment, then:
scene_heading: ADJUTANT GENERAL VOGEL
dialog: General, we’re ready.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE
dialog: (nods; then back to Roy)
dialog: Major, this is not about your
dialog: accident--at least, not directly.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We have...something of a highly
dialog: classified nature to show you.
text: On the WALL-SCREEN, A VIDEO begins to play. LOOKS LIKE OUTER
text: SPACE. Through a TELESCOPE.
text: No stars or anything visible. Until, tiny on the screen, a
text: blue dot. But not the pale blue dot of Earth. CUT TO: CLOSER
dialog: SHOT. We SEE that this is the magical, mysterious blue of:
speaker_heading: NEPTUNE.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE (CONT’D)
dialog: That is the planet Neptune you’re
text: looking at, obviously. Images from
dialog: the Shun-Barcelli Telescope. Two
dialog: days ago.
text: This distant planet is almost all blue, with none of the
text: organic brown of Earth.
dialog: 16.
text: It's like a shiny marble jewel, its sheen a uniform hypnotic
text: ultramarine, except for a few darker streaks and a few white
text: smudges of elongated clouds. Unearthly, that’s for sure.
text: Then, our vantage point moves, and we CUT CLOSER, longer
text: focal length. We find our view of Neptune momentarily
text: obscured by a faint, partial RING of dust and ice. An arc of
dialog: white.
text: And then, an oblong object comes into view between us and
dialog: Neptune.
speaker_heading: LARISSA.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE (CONT’D)
dialog: This is one of Neptune’s closest
dialog: moons, Larissa.
text: The small moon is dark against the eighth planet, exhibiting
text: a mild, azure glow, perhaps the reflection of the color of
text: Neptune. It’s heavily cratered.
dialog: We gradually perceive that something odd is going on:
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE (CONT’D)
text: The degradation begins here.
dialog: Followed by--
text: The peaceful blue diorama is suddenly invaded by a faint
text: greenish blush that starts small as a pinprick and grows
text: Slowly larger. All is not right with Larissa. Its blue
text: complexion is overcome by a green blemish which spreads
text: outwards and seems to utterly transform the moon's very
text: substance, cracking and fissuring it...
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE (CONT’D)
dialog: Catastrophic destruction.
text: The moon formerly known as Larissa becomes a color that
text: alternates between dark green... and dark yellow... and
dialog: black... and then...
scene_heading: IT EXPLODES. IN DEAFENING SILENCE.
dialog: 
text: Rock and dust scatter in every direction, as gravity fails to
text: hold together the transformed matter, which now glows green
dialog: and yellow.
text: CLOSE ON ROY’S EYES. Then we linger on this unsettling
text: scenario, until we return our focus to the unblinking blue
dialog: eye that is Neptune...
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE (CONT’D)
dialog: That event was most likely the
dialog: cause of the fluctuations we
dialog: experienced here, on earth. The
dialog: ones that almost killed you. And
dialog: caused many other disasters on the
dialog: ground as well.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (nods )
dialog: I'd surely like to know what caused
dialog: that, sir.
text: THE LIGHTS COME UP. Beat.
speaker_heading: COLONEL EPINGER
dialog: Major, what do you know about the
dialog: Lima Project?
scene_heading: A TURN. Roy FREEZES for A SLIGHTLY PERCEPTIBLE MILLISECOND:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: It was a research expedition to
dialog: Neptune, sir. From twenty--I’m
dialog: sorry, twenty-one--years ago.
speaker_heading: COLONEL EPINGER
dialog: Mmm-hmm. Anything else?
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Its objective was to construct a
dialog: telescope in order to search for
dialog: signs of extraterrestrial life. My
dialog: father was director.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: All crew were lost.
text: As everyone takes notes, Adjutant General Vogel slides E-
scene_heading: PHOTOS to ROY. THEY ARE OF HIS FATHER, H. CLIFFORD McBRIDE:
speaker_heading: COLONEL EPINGER
dialog: Do you remember how his departure
dialog: affected you? It WAS a one-way
dialog: mission, was it not?
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: It was, sir. But the family was
dialog: not told his absence would be
dialog: permanent. He said at the time
dialog: only that it was top national
dialog: priority to gain knowledge of
dialog: extraterrestrial life.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: COLONEL EPINGER
dialog: And how did you handle that?
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: My, my mother has often expressed
text: her devastation by his abandonment.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It’s the consensus that his
dialog: departure was unforgivable.
text: Roy lets loose a small laugh(!). An AWKWARD BEAT. He
dialog: sobers:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: Sir, if you’re trying to test my
dialog: loyalty or fitness here, it’s not
dialog: necessary. I assure you, I’m in no_
dialog: need of any kind of support in this
dialog: manner. I do accept my father’s
dialog: mental illness. And I acknowledge
dialog: it led to the mission failure.
text: The others look at each other.
speaker_heading: COLONEL EPINGER
dialog: Roy, we have something that might
dialog: come as quite a shock to you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We've intercepted secret
dialog: communications sent to Neptune, we
dialog: believe from Mars. They lead us to
dialog: conclude that your father and
dialog: others from the Project are still
dialog: alive and for reasons we do not
dialog: understand, appear to be conducting
dialog: some extremely dangerous
dialog: experiments. About which we are
text: deeply, deeply, concerned.
scene_heading: ADJUTANT GENERAL VOGEL
dialog: The last intercepted communication
dialog: revealed discovery on Neptune of
dialog: large quantities of antimatter,
dialog: Major. Enough when harnessed to
dialog: destroy the entire solar system.
text: Roy is BLOWN AWAY; that slight smile disappears. A darkness
text: overcomes his countenance, and he turns inward.
speaker_heading: COLONEL EPINGER
dialog: Major?
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (finally; clears throat)
dialog: My father is...alive, sir?
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE
dialog: We believe so. The Lima Project’s
dialog: A.I. is still online, and as you
dialog: know, this would indicate crew has
dialog: survived. We must ensure they can
dialog: do no further harm. As such, your
dialog: relationship to him is potentially
dialog: invaluable to us.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Yes sir...
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE
dialog: We'd like you to try and contact
dialog: whoever is communicating with the
dialog: Lima Project. We’ve determined
dialog: that the signal is coming from
dialog: Mars. Presumably, any message sent
dialog: there would ultimately reach your
dialog: father, on Neptune. We’ve tried
dialog: already without success. It’s a
dialog: bit of a Hail Mary...but we’d like
dialog: YOU to give it a shot, find out his
dialog: location and any other information
dialog: you can gather.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You’1ll have to go to a secure spot
dialog: on the moon, of course--for a
dialog: quantum connection that can’t be
dialog: hacked.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Sir, in the event that contact is
dialog: made, you will then...attempt to
dialog: apprehend him and bring him to
dialog: justice?
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE
dialog: That is our intention, yes. Can we
dialog: count on your participation?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Roy?
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Well sir, I--I’m just trying to
dialog: understand--
scene_heading: BRIGADIER GENERAL FALLON
dialog: Major, have you not been
dialog: LISTENING? ! ?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: BRIGADIER GENERAL FALLON (CONT'D)
dialog: Your father has threatened the
dialog: destruction of our entire solar
dialog: system. Does that not mean
dialog: ANYTHING to you?!?
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Yessir. It surely does.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: DR. PEDROSA (0.C.)
dialog: Roy, I’m Dr. Joao Pedrosa.
text: About to answer, Roy turns. At that moment, the old man off
text: to the side, Dr. Pedrosa. He speaks with a much kinder tone:
speaker_heading: DR. PEDROSA (CONT’D)
dialog: I am currently Commander of
dialog: SPACECOM lunar operations, at
dialog: Tycho. I knew your father very
dialog: well--we studied neuroscience
dialog: together, at Purdue University. He
dialog: was a very brilliant man--a true
dialog: legend in the department. He
dialog: looked at things his own way and
dialog: contemplated vast concepts. So I
dialog: can understand well his struggles--
dialog: because keeping sanity in the face
dialog: of the infinite can be a monumental
dialog: challenge.
text: Pedrosa gets up, approaches:
speaker_heading: DR. PEDROSA (CONT’D)
dialog: Like you, I was skeptical of his
dialog: survival. But after reviewing the
dialog: Neptune transmissions, I am now
dialog: convinced of their authenticity.
dialog: Of course under usual
dialog: circumstances, you would want no
dialog: part of this. But if he is truly
dialog: alive, we do not dare lose him
dialog: twice. Will you help us try to
dialog: find him?
text: ANGLE ON ROY. Roy looks down again, at the screen. It’s an
text: electronic DOSSIER. (Like an old-fashioned bank file, that
text: opens, but its papery surface is capable of displaying
dialog: digital information. Such as photos, maps, graphs, etc.)
text: They PUSH THE FILE GENTLY TOWARD ROY. He sees his FATHER’S
text: IMAGE in a photograph. He STARES AT IT. Roy looks back up
dialog: at the men:
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: I will, sir.
scene_heading: BRIGADIER GENERAL FALLON
dialog: You depart for the moon in twenty-
dialog: four hours.
text: Adjutant General Vogel SLIPS HIM a black leather folder:
scene_heading: ADJUTANT GENERAL AMELIA VOGEL
dialog: All non-relevant information has
dialog: been redacted. Please familiarize
dialog: yourself with its contents...
text: The sound FADES OUT as we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PREP ROOM
text: A small, bright room dedicated to preparing for space travel.
text: What looks like black leather Eames chairs, cases, men and
text: women in white pants and shirts helping astronauts get ready.
text: Roy is being fitted with his suit. Roy slides open a kind of
text: foldable iPad and places EARBUDS into his ear. We HEAR a
speaker_heading: RADIO VOICE:
speaker_heading: RADIO VOICE
dialog: Slate One-Niner-Four. Transmission
dialog: Lima Project, 7/19/15. Voice of H.
dialog: Clifford McBride.
text: He is listening to an FILE. We HEAR, with RADIO FILTER:
speaker_heading: H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (V.O.)
dialog: (tone: banal, scientific)
dialog: We're coming to you now from our
dialog: base of operations for the Lima
dialog: Project. And we're going to send
dialog: you images in a bit from our new
dialog: Ocular telescope. Sponsored by our
dialog: good friends at Brookhaven Solar.
scene_heading: OVER THIS: ROY’S POV as: men and women prepare for
text: spaceflight, finishing their attire--as Roy LISTENS, an IMAGE
text: of CLIFFORD MCBRIDE comes up on his screen. It is like a
text: Skype call gone wrong; the image is high-quality, but the
text: feed is poor, vacillating between a still frame of Clifford
text: McBride and a sped-up image. The AUDIO is constant.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (V.O.)
dialog: Now that we believe there are
dialog: microorganisms on many extrasolar
dialog: planets, and so many Goldilocks
dialog: planets perfect for life, we ask
dialog: the question, “How soon will it be
dialog: before we find intelligent life in
dialog: the universe?”
text: ROY’S SCREEN now features IMAGES of SPACE, then NEPTUNE’S
scene_heading: MOONS and NEPTUNE’S SURFACES as the AUDIO CONTINUES:
speaker_heading: H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: We are so excited about this
dialog: prospect. And who really knows if
dialog: we haven’t been contacted already?
dialog: Who knows if our cosmic friends
dialog: haven't tried to reach us through
dialog: gravitational waves, or some other
dialog: method we can’t fathom? We might
text: be cockroaches walking along a
dialog: chessboard, not knowing about the
dialog: great game of chess! Now--I...AMa
dialog: little surprised we don’t have
dialog: anything yet. [Surprised by] The
dialog: silence. But--I have confidence.
dialog: So...thank you, Brookhaven Solar!
dialog: We have many--
scene_heading: The SCREEN GOES BLACK. “PORTION REDACTED.”
text: A MAN IN WHITE PANTS AND SHIRT then checks with Roy. Roy
text: CLOSES the SCREEN. Referring to his suit:
text: MAN IN WHITE PANTS AND SHIRT
dialog: How’s that, Major? Not too snug?
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: No, it’s fine, thank you.
text: MAN IN WHITE PANTS AND SHIRT
dialog: The pre-breathe for the moon should
dialog: take about fifteen minutes.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Thank you.
text: The Man PLACES a BREATHING APPARATUS over Roy’s mouth and
text: nose. He moves to another passenger.
dialog: 23.
scene_heading: INT. GALLEY
text: Roy ascends the narrow scaffolding, with Pedrosa right
text: behind. It’s oddly primitive; the way to the shuttle
text: entrance is a fifty-foot stepladder which goes straight up to
text: where the LUNAR SHUTTLE awaits, nose-up. Harrowing climb for
dialog: most of us, but there are several people on this ladder,
text: looking surprisingly businesslike and quotidian.
text: A VOICE through a LOUDSPEAKER:
speaker_heading: LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
dialog: Please use the safety straps for
dialog: your wrists as you ascend. You
dialog: will find them located on the rails
text: on either side.
scene_heading: INT. LUNAR SHUTTLE
text: Roy and Pedrosa, on the shuttle. Both men LOOK into a small
text: SCANNER on the side, near the seats, while stepping on a
text: DEGAUSSING PAD. Then:
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: Degauss complete.
text: The craft seems to be part of a consortium between the Army
text: and a Southwest Airlines-type company. A hi-tech space.
dialog: Little attempt at aesthetics--most everything is there for
dialog: practicality, functionality. BANAL.
text: A dozen or so PASSENGERS are aboard. Roy finds his seat and
text: snaps together his restraints.
text: ANNOUNCEMENTS are made in English and then in Mandarin and
text: Spanish by a MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT.
text: Another FLIGHT ATTENDANT (a stout, warm woman) is giving
text: everybody pills and whispering into certain passengers’ ears.
text: Then, aloud, a recording VOICE:
speaker_heading: FLIGHT VOICE
dialog: As we exit the earth’s
dialog: gravitational field, please
dialog: remember: objects will float if not
dialog: properly stored or secured.
scene_heading: MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
dialog: Guys--our rear passenger attendant,
dialog: Michelle Grierson, was...MARRIED
text: TODAY, EVERYBODY! GIVE HER A HAND!
dialog: 24.
text: The passengers APPLAUD as ROY strains to see this Michelle
text: person behind him.
scene_heading: EXT. EARTH - HIGH ANGLE
text: The shuttle takes off and begins its ascent to the moon.
scene_heading: INT. LUNAR SHUTTLE - LATER
text: At the moment when gravity is gone, things begin to float--
text: stray pens, paper, etc. Roy of course has followed the
text: rules, but his NEIGHBOR, of Indian nationality and middle-
text: aged and burly, LAUGHS at his own ineptitude as his things
text: start to float away from him.
text: Roy SCANS the SCREEN in the SEAT IN FRONT of HIM: MAPS of the
text: LUNAR SURFACE. CLOSE SHOT on HIS EYES as he PROCESSES the
text: CONTOURS OF THE MOON’S VARIOUS CRATERS and other AREAS.
text: The Flight Attendant hands out packages of nuts. The pilot
dialog: makes an announcement:
scene_heading: SHUTTLE PILOT'S VOICE
dialog: On the left there, many of you can
text: catch an excellent view of Petavius
text: on the eastern limb. The moon’s
dialog: gibbous period’s waning, so you can
dialog: also see the Atlas, to the north.
text: Roy looks out the window, SEES the landmarks. But also
text: lights, signs of mining and human development/habitation.
text: Tracks and angular patterns. Snapping Roy out of his
text: observing, with an accented voice:
speaker_heading: A VOICE
dialog: Your first time to the moon?
text: Roy turns around. It’s his NEIGHBOR, across the aisle. The
text: NEIGHBOR is of INDIAN DESCENT.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: No, sir. I’ve been a couple times
dialog: before, as a child.
speaker_heading: INDIAN NEIGHBOR
dialog: (trying to make
dialog: conversation)
dialog: A child! Well, it’s my first time!
dialog: (laughs awkwardly; then)
dialog: There's some good new restaurants I
dialog: read, though.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: INDIAN NEIGHBOR (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm staying near Copernicus-—-they
dialog: tell me that’s safe. How about
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: My visit will be very brief.
speaker_heading: INDIAN NEIGHBOR
dialog: Oh... I’m in artificial
dialog: intelligence.
dialog: (with enthusiasm; wanting
dialog: to talk)
dialog: It’s a very strange thing, you
dialog: know, that we have so much
dialog: technology and we keep all our
text: systems without any real awareness.
dialog: I understand why, but it’s...it’s
dialog: strange, no?
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (that gentle smile again)
dialog: Sir--I'd really love to talk to
dialog: you, but I’m afraid I’m just not
dialog: allowed. I’m real sorry.
speaker_heading: INDIAN NEIGHBOR
dialog: Okay. Okay, no problem!
text: The Neighbor acts like he’s not offended. But he is.
text: The Flight Attendant then makes her way down the aisle and
text: guides herself via a series of hoops and webbing overhead.
text: She checks to make sure everyone is fastened and happy. She
text: is handing out PILLS. Roy takes a pill and sips a drink she
text: hands him from a straw.
scene_heading: SHUTTLE PILOT’S VOICE
dialog: (perfunctory)
dialog: As we begin our approach: in
dialog: accordance with FASA regulations,
dialog: we must remind you that many areas
dialog: of the moon are in a state of
dialog: extreme lawlessness. The United
dialog: States government does not
dialog: recommend travel to certain
dialog: districts--please check your
dialog: nearest USSPACECOM Outpost for a
dialog: complete list. Thank you and safe
dialog: travels.
text: Roy SECURES HIMSELF as the FLIGHT ATTENDANT hands out A
text: CUSTOMS FORM CARD to FILL OUT. She HANDS the Neighbor a
speaker_heading: STYLUS:
dialog: 26.
scene_heading: FLIGHT ATTENDANT
dialog: (with a laugh)
dialog: Don’t steal my pen!
text: Roy LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW to SEE:
text: As the craft gets closer to the surface: lots of SATELLITES
dialog: of varying sizes. A tether-type system that may remind us of
speaker_heading: the GISA.
scene_heading: MINING SITES, GREENHOUSES, SPACE JUNK, DEPOTS, and LIVING
text: QUARTERS that look like they could be housing complexes in
text: Boulder, Colorado. There are also HOUSES OF WORSHIP: a large
text: CHURCH with an open roof (centered by a giant CROSS).
scene_heading: LIT SIGNS ANNOUNCE CHAINS WE RECOGNIZE: McDonald's, Dunkin'
text: Donuts, etc. MAG-LEV TRAINS link together various bases and
text: neighborhoods, at extreme velocities.
scene_heading: EXT. MOON - LUNAR BASE
text: The ship adjusts its gyropscopes and turns over (e.g. in Elon
text: Musk's rocket designs), making a gentle landing near the
text: army’s TYCHO BASE. The base is heavily guarded.
scene_heading: INT. LUNAR HANGAR
text: The UNDERGROUND looks almost like New York’s Penn Station,
text: combined with an enormous parking garage and the most banal
text: of AIRPORTS. The SHUTTLE MOVES into position, closer to an
dialog: entrance.
scene_heading: INT. LUNAR HANGAR —- CORRIDOR
text: Dr. Pedrosa leads Roy through the corridor, which is,
text: weirdly, wood-panelled. Or is it fake wood?
text: There are FOUR MEN and TWO WOMEN who come from the OPPOSITE
text: DIRECTION, all talking amongst themselves. When Roy and
text: Pedrosa walk toward them, they stop talking.
text: Dogs roam about, smelling them and their belongings. Pedrosa
text: moves to talk to some of the men and women. Roy face
text: brightens at the sight of a dog:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (to the dog, warmly)
dialog: Hey! How you doin’ there, big
dialog: fella?
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: DR. PEDROSA
dialog: This is Major Roy McBride. As you
dialog: know, he is here to help us.
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: (to Roy)
dialog: Good morning, Major.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (looks up from the dog)
dialog: ‘Morning.
text: A WOMAN, LESLIE CORTEZ, fifties, steps forward. A MAN stands
text: near, holding a PIECE OF EQUIPMENT that looks like a small
speaker_heading: EKG machine.
speaker_heading: LESLIE CORTEZ
dialog: We've kept a spot for you in the
dialog: dormitory. An overnight stay will
dialog: be necessary.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Yes, Ma’am. But I’m just here to
dialog: do what I need to. I have my
dialog: duties on the antenna, and they’1l
dialog: probably be needing me soon.
speaker_heading: LESLIE CORTEZ
dialog: Of course...
text: Cortez leads Roy with her hand as we HEAR:
speaker_heading: MAN’S VOICE (PRE-LAP)
dialog: Uplink should be ready to go in
text: just a moment.
scene_heading: INT. LUNAR BASE —- COMMUNICATIONS CENTER - LATER
text: Roy and the others are in what looks like a recording studio.
text: A glass of water before him. Roy is seated. Dons a headset.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN ONE (CONT'D)
dialog: We're preparing the connection now.
text: Outside the booth, TWO TECHNICIANS make adjustments.
text: Roy looks at a MONITOR before him, which gives him cues, as
dialog: well as technical info regarding high-rate pulse-position
text: modulation and error-correcting codes. A RED LIGHT goes on.
text: Dr. Pedrosa approaches:
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: DR. PEDROSA
dialog: Whatever you say into this
dialog: microphone will be transmitted to
dialog: Mars, and then hopefully on to
dialog: Neptune. The first step is to try
dialog: to make contact. And then perhaps
dialog: a negotiation of some kind.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Yessir.
text: Interrupting: the CONTROL BOOTH CHIMES IN:
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN ONE
dialog: Point-to-point contact with the
text: Mars signal is now engaged.
text: Through the squawk box, Major.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Roger that.
speaker_heading: DR. PEDROSA
dialog: Depress the button in order to
dialog: speak. Remember, your father may
dialog: be listening.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Sir... What--what precisely is it
dialog: that you’d like me to say, in order
dialog: for us to achieve optimal results?
text: Dr. Pedrosa takes out a PIECE OF PAPER:
speaker_heading: DR. PEDROSA
dialog: We have assembled a text for you,
dialog: one that we believe is appropriate
text: for eliciting a response. It is
dialog: written using language consistent
dialog: with your own, utilizing data from
dialog: your profile.
text: Roy takes the piece of paper. He looks it over. Weak joke,
text: but a broad smile nonetheless:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Maybe I should've taken acting
dialog: classes! Okay...here goes...
text: Roy MOVES to DEPRESS the BUTTON. FLICKS ON THE MIC. BEGINS
scene_heading: TO SPEAK:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: This is Major Roy McBride, I’m
text: currently on Tycho Base.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Repeat. This is Major Roy McBride.
dialog: I am currently on Tycho Base.
text: ON THE MONITOR: as he speaks, there’s a voice print analysis.
text: CLOSE ON ROY. Roy’s emotions are deeply buried as he READS
scene_heading: THE PREPARED SCRIPT:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: Dr. McBride... It’s your son, Roy.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Prior to this message, I believed
dialog: you were dead. Our family was
dialog: informed of this approximately two
dialog: decades ago. We were told the
dialog: stress of deep space had altered
dialog: your behavior. And...as a result,
dialog: US SPACECOM was forced to terminate
dialog: your life support systems.
dialog: However, SPACECOM now believes you
dialog: have survived. And attempted
dialog: contact, without revealing yourself
dialog: due to fear of hacking. If this is
dialog: true, I’m very much looking forward
dialog: to hearing from you. I’ve always
dialog: felt that it’s very important to
dialog: have a true bond between father and
dialog: son. We could have this bond. I
dialog: do recall we would watch motion
dialog: pictures together, very old ones in
dialog: black and white--funny ones. And I
dialog: remember your laugh even more than
dialog: your face. I would like very much
dialog: to reconnect with you. I will
dialog: surely be able to move past any
dialog: feelings of abandonment your
dialog: departure presented me with. Your
dialog: loving son, Roy.
text: BEAT. NOTHING. These words have unlocked something in Roy.
text: He flicks off the MIC, stands. Any warmth deserts him:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: Hopefully that achieves the desired
dialog: result.
text: The PREPARED SPEECH is LIT ON FIRE by a MAN, its ashes placed
text: in a wastebasket.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: DR. PEDROSA
dialog: Any transmission will take
dialog: approximately 36 minutes, due to
dialog: the distance. So we must wait.
scene_heading: INT. HALL - LATER
text: Roy is standing outside, looks out the large window.
text: OUTSIDE: A NEARBY SIGN WITH A NEON COWBOY, PUMPING a “THUMBS
text: UP” GESTURE--just like the famous Neon Cowboy from Las
text: Vegas's Fremont Ave. Pedrosa EMERGES from the Communications
text: Center. A grim look:
speaker_heading: DR. PEDROSA
dialog: There is no response. Thank you
dialog: for your participation. You will
dialog: be returned to the earth tomorrow
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: I understand. Thank you, sir.
dialog: Sorry I was not of more help.
text: The men shake hands.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. LUNAR BASE —- BARRACKS - ROY’S ROOM - LATER
text: The room’s almost like an economy room in a hotel. With the
text: exception being that, out the window, hangs Earth. The
text: CAMERA DOLLIES OVER TO SEE: a half-eaten meal on a tray.
text: Roy SITS, near a speaker:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Confirming--shuttle 4339, moon to
text: earth, reservation number EH77902.
dialog: Last name, McBride.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Reservation confirmed, McBride, Roy
speaker_heading: C. Number EH77902.
text: He hangs up.
text: A beat.
text: A TV SCREEN is seamlessly embedded into a wall. Some
text: programming (news... sports.... something animated...).
dialog: 31.
text: The programming forms a low level of constant noise. And
dialog: then:
text: The screen CHANGES--completely BLACK.
speaker_heading: SILENCE.
text: A beat. Roy LOOKS UP.
text: A light, STATIC NOISE.
text: FADING IN is the sound of:
dialog: A MAN SINGING: “Hello, I must be going./ I cannot stay,/ I
dialog: came to say/ I must be going./ I'm glad I came/ but just the
dialog: same/ I must be going..."
text: Roy looks at the SCREEN as GROUCHO MARX APPEARS. Groucho
text: resumes singing after Margaret Dumont’s part: "I'll stay a
dialog: week or two,/ I'll stay the summer through,/ but I am telling
dialog: you,/ I must be going."
text: BEEP! The SCREEN GOES BLACK. SILENCE.
scene_heading: THEN TEXT, on the SCREEN:
dialog: “BRE YOU COMING?”
text: A SERIES OF NUMBERS AT THE BOTTOM of the SCREEN.
text: CLOSE SHOT: ROY’S EYES. Then we SEE that the screen GOES
scene_heading: BLACK. We HEAR:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (PRE-LAP)
dialog: They appeared to be coordinates of
dialog: some kind, sir.
scene_heading: INT. LUNAR BASE - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
text: Roy stands as Dr. Pedrosa and TWO MEN and LESLIE CORTEZ sit
text: around a conference table, with looseleaf binders in front of
text: them. MOON PHOTOGRAPHS, illuminated from behind, line the
text: walls. Chairs all around. Coffee. Roy is reluctant as he
text: stands at attention. HE STARES STRAIGHT AHEAD, NO EYE
text: CONTACT. The others seem STUNNED INTO SILENCE.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: I believe the proper first step
dialog: would be to get me to Mars, to the
dialog: specified coordinates. I would of
dialog: course be willing, in order to help
dialog: resolve this crisis.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: LESLIE CORTEZ
dialog: We are very grateful to you for
dialog: your service, Major. We will
dialog: analyze the information you
dialog: received. But you may return to
dialog: Colorado now.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: No Ma‘am, I’m sorry, but I do feel
dialog: I should continue to aid the
dialog: mission. My father is the
dialog: individual at issue here. And
dialog: under the circumstances I feel I
dialog: should remain involved in order to
dialog: bring him appropriately to justice.
speaker_heading: DR. PEDROSA
dialog: (leaning forward)
dialog: A personal connection is an unknown
dialog: variable and represents serious
dialog: risk.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Yes sir. However, the task itself
dialog: inherently involves risk,
dialog: especially as it appears you will
dialog: not have multiple chances. And if
dialog: it really IS my father who is
dialog: trying to reengage, obviously I
dialog: would be anxious to confront him.
dialog: But I’m also considering the task
dialog: itself, and not merely my personal
dialog: views.
text: None of them answers. Roy steps forward:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: A situation may arise that only I
dialog: am able to respond to.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So for this reason, I believe I
dialog: should be part of any continuing
dialog: mission.
text: Pedrosa can tell that Roy’s serious, DETERMINED.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)

scene_heading: INT. LUNAR BASE - MAZELIKE CORRIDOR
text: SECURITY MEN all SURROUND ROY, like he’s the President. A
text: POV SHOT of ROY as he WALKS toward:
text: AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR is Dr. Pedrosa. Over this:
speaker_heading: DR. PEDROSA (V.O.)
dialog: You will travel on a United States
dialog: military craft already designated
text: for Mars. It contains a payload of
dialog: a classified but routine nature,
dialog: and the crew will know of you only
dialog: as a passenger--a higher-ranking
dialog: officer making a visitation to the
dialog: outpost. It will depart from
dialog: outside standard surveillance, on
dialog: the Far Side of the moon. As your
dialog: participation was unanticipated,
dialog: the path from our current point
dialog: will take us through only recently-
dialog: settled territory. We will be
dialog: escorted by the United States
dialog: Army’s Space Division. And I will
dialog: protect you as far as I am able.
scene_heading: INT. MEDICAL UNIT
text: Roy is sitting up on a medical table. We STILL HEAR DR.
text: PEDROSA’S VOICE. A MEDIC approaches ROY. CLOSE SHOT on an
text: injection into ROY’S ARM.
speaker_heading: DR. PEDROSA (V.O.)
dialog: Members of the crew were selected
dialog: on the basis of skill and limited
dialog: social needs, and as such should be
dialog: no impediment.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: Dr. Pedrosa and Roy board a MONORAIL. As they do, we HEAR:
speaker_heading: DR. PEDROSA (V.O.)
dialog: You will be contacted by a Colonel
dialog: Lipset once you reach Mars.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: DR. PEDROSA (V.0.) (CONT'D)
dialog: He will assist you as you attempt
dialog: to communicate with your father.
dialog: Your stress levels will be
dialog: monitored at all times. If
dialog: psychological failure is indicated,
dialog: you will be removed from the
dialog: mission. This is necessary due to
dialog: your relationship with the target.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (V.O.)
dialog: My focus is entirely on achieving a
dialog: proper resolution, sir. You need
dialog: not be concerned. He was
dialog: emotionally unfit, and I am not.
text: They stop at a GATE.
scene_heading: INT. LARGE HANGAR
text: Several LUNAR ROVERS are lined up, in the distance. They
text: aren’t SLOW, LUMBERING THINGS, however; they are durable and
text: tough and fast and filled with artillery.
text: The ROVERS WHIR and WHINE with ferocity, their engines
text: warming up and getting ready for the trip ahead.
text: Roy and Pedrosa enter, joining a host of MILITARY ASTRONAUTS.
text: One of them, a cheerful, burly man named WILLY LEVANT, late
text: forties, pulls up an interactive 3D MAP. It shows the LUNAR
text: TERRITORIES in incredible detail. Roy listens intently as
text: Levant checks his clipboard.
speaker_heading: WILLY LEVANT
dialog: Should be fine, but... We’re gonna
dialog: be going through what is still
dialog: technically a war zone.
dialog: (looks up, w a laugh)
dialog: Here we are, meant to tame the
dialog: solar system, and instead seems
dialog: like we've just brought our chaos.
dialog: This your first time?
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (broad smile)
dialog: No, sir. I’ve been to many Army-
dialog: Navy games.
speaker_heading: WILLY LEVANT
dialog: (turns dark)
dialog: This is serious business, Major.
dialog: There’s no real way to know how any
dialog: man’ll react in combat. It’s
dialog: always a surprise.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: WILLY LEVANT (CONT'D)
dialog: (louder; to everyone)
dialog: --Almost a full moon. The Far
dialog: Side’s gonna be real black.
dialog: Fortunately we should have a clean
dialog: route from here to Veda. We’ve had
dialog: a little problem since September
dialog: with mining pirates, looking for
dialog: helium-3. But our boys did a
dialog: heckuva job and swept it all up a
dialog: few days ago.
text: Roy notices that Pedrosa is fiddling with the CRUCIFIX around
text: his neck. Pedrosa SEES Roy looking at him.
speaker_heading: DR. PEDROSA
dialog: You wish to join us, Roy? Fora
dialog: prayer?
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (quietly; without any
dialog: condescension)
dialog: No thank you, sir. It’s been my
dialog: experience that prayer doesn’t
dialog: affect outcomes.
text: Pedrosa eyes Roy for a moment, nods, then starts to pray with
text: Levant and the others as Roy prepares his suit.
speaker_heading: DR. PEDROSA
dialog: Almighty and merciful God, who hast
dialog: commissioned Thy angels to guide
dialog: and protect us, command them to be
dialog: our companions from our setting out
dialog: until our return...
speaker_heading: MOMENTS LATER
text: Roy and the others--in full SPACESUITS--board a souped-up and
scene_heading: unenclosed LUNAR ROVING VEHICLE (LRV).
speaker_heading: INT. LRV
text: This rover is CRAMPED. Pedrosa has a smaller version of his
text: mapping COMPUTER in front of him and he is next to Levant.
text: Levant is driving, and he makes a final consultation of the
text: route. ON THE TOP OF THE WINDSHIELD: photos of NUDE WOMEN.
text: Like old PLAYBOY centerfolds...
text: Roy is in the back seat:
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: WILLY LEVANT
dialog: Arright, let’s go. Veda, Sea of
dialog: Moscoviensis.
speaker_heading: RADIO VOICE
dialog: You should be clear to Veda, over.
speaker_heading: WILLY LEVANT
text: Autodrive engaged.
scene_heading: EXT. LUNAR BASE
text: The LRV departs, bursting forward with ferocity.
scene_heading: NOTE: ALL DIALOG in this sequence will have a “RADIO FILTER"
dialog: effect unless otherwise noted.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. LRV - MOVING
text: Levant is looking around with hi-tech BINOCULARS. Roy is
text: hunched back, right behind him, watching and listening:
speaker_heading: WILLY LEVANT
text: Setting two-niner-oh.
text: The LRV traverses the lunar surface. Occasionally, the lunar
text: DUST kicks up, obscuring our vision. The SUN is SHINING, and
text: yet the SKY IS JET-BLACK.
text: Roy turns back as the base recedes into the distance. THE
text: EARTH IS IN THE SKY! PEDROSA POINTS TO IT, then DOWN TO THE
text: SURFACE, FOR ROY. A TALL OBELISK, made of STEEL, in the
text: LUNAR DIRT, near the LEGS OF THE LUNAR MODULE:
speaker_heading: DR. PEDROSA
dialog: [That is] Tranquillity Base
dialog: Monument.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Surely is a magnificent sight.
text: SERIES OF SHOTS of LUNAR SURFACE.
scene_heading: EXT. THE MOON - MOMENTS LATER
text: A CARAVAN OF ABOUT TEN BLACK, ARMOR-PLATED rovers that we'll
text: call the Russian name of LUNOKHODS appear on the horizon,
text: coming toward our GUYS. The Lunokhods are driven by
text: mysterious ASTRONAUTS in DARK BLUE SPACESUITS and HELMETS
text: with mirrored visors.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: WILLY LEVANT
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: What the fuck is this...?
dialog: (to radio)
dialog: Alpha, what do we got here?
dialog: (to radio)
dialog: Alpha, we have what looks like
dialog: between ten and twelve mining
dialog: Lunokhods approaching our position.
speaker_heading: RADIO VOICE
dialog: Roger that, Willy. We'll see if
dialog: they're certified, over.
speaker_heading: WILLY LEVANT
dialog: I’m sorry, gentlemen. They said
dialog: they'd cleared this zone out. I’m
dialog: sure we'll be on our way in just a
dialog: minute.
text: AS THEY APPROACH, LEVANT LOOKS THROUGH BINOCULARS. He
scene_heading: DARKENS CONSIDERABLY.
speaker_heading: WILLY LEVANT (CONT’D)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Uh...Alpha...we may have some
dialog: problems.
dialog: (beat; more heated)
text: They appear to be armed. Possibly
text: with stilettos. Backup requested.
text: Roy STEELS HIMSELF. The Lunokhods are closing in on our LRV.
speaker_heading: WILLY LEVANT (CONT'D)
dialog: Alpha, they are definitely assuming
dialog: hostile formation--
dialog: (to computer)
dialog: Engage manual operation.
text: ROY BRACES HIMSELF. Dr. Pedrosa TURNS AROUND, points to a
text: BOX next to Roy’s FEET. Roy opens the box: WEAPONS.
text: GRENADES and a GUN which looks ALMOST LIKE a ROCKET LAUNCHER.
text: (The BLUE ASTRONAUTS in the Lunokhods brandish a weapon
text: called a STILETTO--an electromagnet-propelled jet of liquid
text: metal resembling a solid bar of light.)
scene_heading: (VISUAL NOTE: LUNAR DUST PERIODICALLY OBSCURES the VISION.)
dialog: 38.
scene_heading: EXT. THE MOON - THE PROMENADE DE LUNA
text: The LRV turns onto a route that runs adjacent to a POWER
speaker_heading: PLANT.
dialog: The Lunokhods open fire on our LRV:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLY LEVANT
dialog: (to radio)
dialog: Alpha, we’re now taking fire! WE
dialog: NEED BACKUP ASAP!
speaker_heading: INT. LRV
text: Everyone bounces forward in their seats, restrained by their
text: seatbelts.
text: ROY ARMS HIMSELF. Ahead of them, he SEES three possible
dialog: RAMPS: one to the right, one to the center, and one to the
dialog: left.
text: A FORK IN THE ROAD--the left side of the fork is closed off,
text: blocked by A BARRICADE. The LRV is headed right for it.
text: At the last second, LEVANT jerks the rover to the right. The
text: Lunokhod’s driver can’t react in time. SLAMS INTO THE
text: BARRICADE. The blue astronaut is hurled from his Lunokhod,
text: CRASHES through the windshield, flies through the air. The
text: Lunokhod flips over and over--no air resistance, so it seems
dialog: like it won’t stop...
text: LEVANT struggles to control the rover, which is in a major
speaker_heading: SPIN.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. LRV - MOVING
text: OUR LRV stops SPINNING. RESTARTING, they take the left.
text: A BULLET/SMALL ROCKET hits the back windshield, which CRACKS
dialog: slightly.
text: The Lunokhods are out of view now, but they’re out there. A
speaker_heading: RADIO VOICE pipes in:
speaker_heading: RADIO VOICE
dialog: COLONEL, WE DO CONFIRM YOU’RE
dialog: FACING PIRATE ACTIVITY. Are you
dialog: all clear now, over?
text: Roy is LOOKING BEHIND HIM:
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: There’re at least two behind us--
speaker_heading: WILLY LEVANT
dialog: (to radio)
dialog: That's a negative, Hawk. They’re
text: still out there, behind us at 140
dialog: and 220 degrees.
text: Roy leans out. His jaw jutting forward just a bit, he seems
text: anxious to do DAMAGE, a strangely VIOLENT COLDNESS coming
text: through here. He reaches down, takes out a WEAPON.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (under his breath; to no
dialog: one)
dialog: I will handle these...
text: He AIMS his WEAPON at the HORIZON. Then it appears. It
text: COMES CLOSER and CLOSER! The Lunokhod is almost upon them--
text: HE FIRES HIS WEAPON.
text: An EXPLOSION. Another Lunokhod appears on the horizon.
text: Gains on them. ROY AIMS, FIRES AGAIN. ANOTHER PUFF of DUST.
speaker_heading: WILLY LEVANT
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Excellent shots, Major! Excellent!
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Thank you, Colonel.
text: A DARKNESS OVERTAKES US. It is PERMANENT NIGHT: THE FAR SIDE
text: OF THE MOON.
scene_heading: EXT. THE MOON - FAR SIDE
text: We now reach the Far Side (i.e. the side always facing away
text: from Earth) and are weaving amongst Chinese thermonuclear
text: REACTORS. ENORMOUS LIGHTS SWITCH ON in front of the ROVER.
speaker_heading: WILLY LEVANT
dialog: (into radio)
dialog: SpaceCom, we’ve just entered the
dialog: Far Side. We need a push in 2500
dialog: clicks! 240 degrees, 58 seconds!
text: ROY LOOKS OVER TO PEDROSA.
text: ANGLE ON PEDROSA, from ROY’S POV. HE IS SLUMPED FOR A BEAT!
text: HE SITS BACK UP...
dialog: 40.
scene_heading: EXT. THE MOON - FAR SIDE - ROAD
text: Multiple SPACESHIPS DESCEND and DROP ORDINANCE. “Daisy
dialog: cutter”-esque MOABs do their thing. It’s gruesome,
text: spectacular, and Roy SPOTS IT looking behind him.
text: It’s a ferocious scene, vicious and unforgiving, made all the
text: more bizarre by the utter LACK OF SOUND. The silence and
text: carnage is astonishing. The EXPLOSIONS are beautiful and
text: ferocious. The sky’s lit up for miles.
text: MOONBASE VEDA is just ahead--it’s built over a massive crater
text: and is underneath a DOME.
speaker_heading: WILLY LEVANT
dialog: We are approaching Veda now, Major.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Godspeed to you, gentlemen.
text: Pedrosa salutes. Levant and the rest of the crew depart,
text: unsentimentally, leaving behind DR. PEDROSA and TWO FACELESS
text: ASTRONAUTS to accompany ROY.
scene_heading: EXT. THE FLATTENED LUNAR LANDSCAPE
text: Roy disembarks from the LRV, flanked by the Faceless and
text: Pedrosa. PEDROSA and the TWO MEN BOUND DOWN THE SIDE OF THE
text: CRATER, with Roy.
text: They reach the bottom, a LAUNCH PAD for the fusion-powered
text: craft, THE CEPHEUS.
scene_heading: INT. VEHICLE ASSEMBLY STRUCTURE
text: A mammoth hangar in a covert underground silo. Greenhouses,
text: other life-sustaining structures inside, too. The SILO is
text: IMPREGNABLE, surrounded by a kind of HEAT MOAT which forms a
text: giant RED CIRCLE around the PAD...
text: ROY MOVES to a STEEL BAR. DR. PEDROSA PUTS HIS FOREARM under
text: a BLUE LIGHT.
text: The SILO OPENS.
scene_heading: INT. LAUNCH PAD
text: The spacecraft--THE CEPHEUS--is poised on the pad, glowing in
text: the beacon lights. Dr. Pedrosa REMOVES HIS HELMET and
text: GLOVES. Roy does the same.
dialog: 41.
text: We PULL BACK to reveal the massive nature of the
text: spacecraft/rocket. A WOMAN, SERGEANT ROMANO, approaches:
speaker_heading: SERGEANT ROMANO
dialog: Major, are you all right? We'd
dialog: been told an officer would be
dialog: joining us, and we heard about your
dialog: trouble getting here--
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Yes, Ma’am. The chaos is real
dialog: infuriating, no doubt. But we were
text: able to engage them on their terms.
text: Pedrosa INTERRUPTS Roy, pulling him aside. Something is
text: WRONG; he’s sweaty, white as a sheet. Sotto:
speaker_heading: DR. PEDROSA
dialog: Roy--please, take it--
text: He hands Roy a thin silver card. Roy looks at him,
dialog: bewildered:
speaker_heading: DR. PEDROSA (CONT’D)
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: It is the redacted section of your
dialog: father’s profile. The password is
text: “daisywheel”. Examine it only when
dialog: you are off the grid. The hard
dialog: drive will protect you from any
dialog: viral interference.
text: Roy SPOTS BLOOD, CASCADING DOWN Dr. Pedrosa’s HAND. Looks
dialog: around for help--
speaker_heading: DR. PEDROSA (CONT'D)
dialog: Roy.
text: Roy spins back around. Pedrosa grabs him, SMEARING BLOOD on
speaker_heading: ROY'S SLEEVE:
speaker_heading: DR. PEDROSA (CONT’D)
dialog: SPACECOM does not trust you. Try
dialog: to remain as alert as possible; do
dialog: not allow them to cloud your
dialog: perception. And you will be
dialog: required at times to be less than
dialog: completely honest--but you must, to
dialog: preserve the mission and the
dialog: broader truth.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I have faith in you.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (ferociously; to others)
speaker_heading: MEDIC!
text: PEDROSA CRUMPLES TO THE GROUND. MEDICS COLLAPSE on him as
text: ROY BACKS AWAY. Roy is SURROUNDED by ARMY, among them
text: SERGEANT ROMANO. They pull him away from the dying Pedrosa.
text: Roy holds the CARD in his hand, POCKETS IT.
scene_heading: INT. SILO ELEVATOR
text: The doors open, Roy exits. OVER THIS, we HEAR:
speaker_heading: A WOMAN'S VOICE (PRE-LAP)
dialog: Major McBride?
scene_heading: INT. SUIT ROOM
text: Sergeant Romano hands a spacesuit to Roy:
speaker_heading: SERGEANT ROMANO
dialog: Your vitals are all here, on your
dialog: sleeve. Standard. Pulse, oxygen,
dialog: C02, blood pressure, and so forth.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: This is your Mission Commander,
dialog: Captain Lawrence Blunt.
dialog: (to Blunt)
dialog: Captain Blunt, this is Major Roy
dialog: McBride, he’ll be hitching a ride
text: to Mars on the jump seat.
text: Nearby, three men are donning their suits and going through
text: their EXHAUSTIVE CHECKLISTS. They eye Roy with varying
text: degrees of trepidation.
text: Focus on LAWRENCE BLUNT--early 40s, dark wavy hair, dark
text: eyes, powerful physical presence.
scene_heading: CAPTAIN LAWRENCE BLUNT
dialog: Right-o. Welcome aboard.
text: Blunt shakes Roy’s hand.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN LAWRENCE BLUNT (CONT’D)
dialog: Sounds like you went through some
dialog: tough territory to get here, Major.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: We surely did. Significant force
dialog: proved necessary.
dialog: 43.
text: Blunt nods. He looks through a clipboard, then:
scene_heading: CAPTAIN LAWRENCE BLUNT
dialog: You're certified, I’m guessing.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Yes. In EVA and spacecraft
dialog: mechanics.
text: ROY NOTICES PEDROSA’S BLOOD ALL OVER HIS SUIT.
scene_heading: CAPTAIN LAWRENCE BLUNT
dialog: Terrific... This’s First
dialog: Lieutenant Scobee--our Mission
dialog: Specialist.
text: He refers to DONALD SCOBEE--late thirties, brown hair in a
text: comb-over. He's in excellent physical condition. Looks like
text: old Nixon aide John Dean. He stares at Roy with his piercing
text: eyes as he extends a hand.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: How do you do.
text: A handshake. Scobee is COURTEOUS but tough as NAILS.
speaker_heading: DONALD SCOBEE
dialog: Major.
text: And FRANKLIN YOSHIDA. Mid-forties. Totally remote,
text: taciturn, a man of science. Barely makes eye contact with
dialog: Roy.
scene_heading: CAPTAIN LAWRENCE BLUNT
dialog: Frank Yoshida’s our Medic. And Lt.
dialog: Alan Tanner is on for navigation
dialog: and payload.
text: Finally, ALAN TANNER. Early-30s. A firm handshake and
text: muttered greeting. Roy responds:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Good to meet all you.
text: Roy tries to turn his forearm to hide PEDROSA’S BLOOD.
text: A young CADET walks in with food. Blunt looks down at an
text: illuminated SOLAR SYSTEM MAP.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: I am headed to Helios South, on
dialog: Mars.
dialog: 44,
scene_heading: CAPTAIN LAWRENCE BLUNT
dialog: That’s pretty close to where we’re
dialog: headed. We’ve got a payload for
dialog: the North division, but you can
dialog: shuttle South once we’re there.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Will do. Grateful for the ride.
scene_heading: CAPTAIN LAWRENCE BLUNT
dialog: (re: food plate)
dialog: Well all right then... Make
dialog: yourself comfortable. Looks like
dialog: there’s some ginger beer and farmed
dialog: salmon for final meal...
text: Roy turns to Sergeant Romano. Sotto:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Sergeant--do we know the condition
dialog: of Dr. Pedrosa?
speaker_heading: SERGEANT ROMANO
dialog: Yes. Unfortunately, he passed,
dialog: Major.
text: Roy nods, then turns, looks through GLASS at the ROCKET THAT
text: will TAKE HIM TO THE STARS... THE CEPHEUS... Here, as
text: everywhere, ARMED MEN and WOMEN abound. Looks down at his
text: hand: CLUTCHING THAT DOSSIER CARD.
scene_heading: EXT. LAUNCH PAD
text: Roy, in his SPACESUIT, walks with the others holding their
text: airpacks into the top of the rocket.
scene_heading: INT. THE CEPHEUS - COCKPIT
text: The cockpit is aglow with instruments and screens. Roy moves

text: Roy STRAPS IN.
scene_heading: CAPTAIN LAWRENCE BLUNT
dialog: (into the radio)
dialog: Checklists complete. We are ready
dialog: when you are, SpaceCom.

scene_heading: INT./EXT. THE CEPHEUS
text: The LIFTOFF TEAM scrambles to get away. The Cepheus, barely
text: held to the gantry, is ready to go.
scene_heading: EXT. THE MOON
text: A great fire alights beneath The Cepheus.
speaker_heading: DONALD SCOBEE (CONT'D) (V.O.)
dialog: Three, two, one.
text: The Cepheus rises, shaking off its tethers.
speaker_heading: DONALD SCOBEE (V.O.)
dialog: We have lift off...
text: It explodes forward, hurtling around the Far Side.
scene_heading: INT. THE CEPHEUS - SEDATION AREA
text: Roy fights the G's.
speaker_heading: SPACECOM (RADIO FILTER) (V.O.)
dialog: Cepheus, you are a go at throttle

scene_heading: EXT. THE MOON - CEPHEUS
text: The Cepheus fires its BOOSTERS and explodes forward, hurtling
text: around the Far Side with increasing velocity. DARKNESS
text: returns to the launch pad.
dialog: 46.
scene_heading: INT. THE CEPHEUS
text: The group settles in just a bit. The distant sounds of the
text: ENGINE are a soothing, rhythmic lullaby.
speaker_heading: DONALD SCOBEE
dialog: SpaceCom, we are commencing CTP
dialog: ingestion.
text: Everyone TAKES A PILL which comes ejected from the console--
text: EXCEPT FOR ROY, who PALMS THE PILL and SLIPS it into his
dialog: pocket.
scene_heading: INT. THE CEPHEUS - COCKPIT - LATER
text: Roy looks at his fellow travelers, all engaged in checklist
dialog: tasks, other mundane activities:
speaker_heading: DONALD SCOBEE
dialog: Pilot report A one-niner, Mars
dialog: trajectory... The burn was on
dialog: time. The residuals before nulling-
dialog: -minus 0.1...
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Captain, I think my suit’s suffered
dialog: an oxygen leak. It’s going to
dialog: require an epoxy patch.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE BLUNT
dialog: Happy to assist, sir.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: That won’t be necessary, Captain.
dialog: Thank you. I’ve got it.
text: As Roy gets up, we SEE, to his RIGHT: “CAUTION: MANUAL
scene_heading: BOOSTER CONTROL”.
scene_heading: INT. CARGO AREA
text: Roy floats in to a SECLUDED PART of the ship. He pulls out
text: what Pedrosa gave him. The DOSSIER/AMULET, a thin, silver
text: card. He inserts it into a slot of a small computer that is
text: in his sleeve. Inserts an earbud.
text: LASERS and OPTICS read his irises. SCREENS on his helmet

dialog: I'd like to use this opportunity to
dialog: reach out directly. To my son. If
dialog: you could get this to
dialog: him...please...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Roy... Solitude has increased my
dialog: perception... I look so far into
dialog: the universe here, and I see how
dialog: cruel it is in its indifference...
dialog: So many planets potentially
dialog: suitable for life, yet as of now we
dialog: hear and see nothing... I’ve come
dialog: to worry that our own long-term
dialog: survival is in doubt. My death is
dialog: not something I fear. But--the
dialog: extinction of ALL ideas, of all
dialog: human expression--that is the true
dialog: terror. Our consciousness must
dialog: extend into the future, past any
dialog: force that renders us extinct. We
dialog: must commit ourselves to this

speaker_heading: H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m sure you will have a lot of
dialog: questions about the choices I’ve

speaker_heading: EVA.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: No--we can’t stop.

speaker_heading: FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Major?
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: We need to reach Mars.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
text: (smiles, an uncomfortable
dialog: laugh)
dialog: Major, this is protocol. We have a
dialog: mayday--
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: We can’t stop!
text: Roy moves past Yoshida into:
scene_heading: INT. THE CEPHEUS - CONTROL ROOM
text: Roy enters the CONTROL ROOM, sees that the other men have put
text: on their helmets.
text: The ELECTRONIC BEEPING alert plays, and DATA flashes across
text: the main MONITORS on the bridge. Lawrence Blunt to the
scene_heading: radio, with RADIO FILTER:
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE BLUNT
dialog: Ninety-seven hundred kilometers
text: away, on the proximity alert.
text: ROY LOOKS OVER THEIR SHOULDERS TO SEE: on a panel screen: the
text: image of THE VESTA IX. A small, rotating station orbiting of
text: “Earth’s second satellite,” the asteroid called TORO. Roy is
dialog: agitated:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: The Helios Station is the
dialog: destination, Captain--why are you
dialog: stopping?
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE BLUNT
dialog: We have a mayday, major--this is
dialog: standard--
speaker_heading: (INTO COMMS)
dialog: Vesta Nine, this is Cepheus Seven,
dialog: United States Armed Forces Space
dialog: Division. Do you read, over?
text: Roy looks impatient, unsure how to press the case:
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Other craft will be in the
dialog: vicinity. We have our destination.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE BLUNT
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Major, with respect, we're
dialog: obligated to stop. As you are
dialog: merely a passenger, I’m not sure I
dialog: comprehend your position.
text: Unable to reveal anything, Roy turns away as Tanner looks
dialog: through flight information:
speaker_heading: ALAN TANNER
dialog: The craft is registered as
text: Norwegian, the Vesta Nine, orbiting
dialog: asteroid Toro. Registered for
dialog: biomedical research.
text: On another screen: A scan of the Vesta IX appears. And on
text: another SCREEN, ship schematics.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE BLUNT
speaker_heading: (INTO COMMS)
dialog: Vesta Nine, do you read, over?
text: Still nothing. Roy looks at a screen for information. Eyes
text: the SCHEMATICS for the VESTA NINE.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE BLUNT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Vesta Nine, according to the Outer
dialog: Space Treaty we are responding to
dialog: your distress call.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Do you read?
scene_heading: ROY OVERHEARS:
speaker_heading: ALAN TANNER
dialog: I just accessed their log. Last
dialog: transmission was Sept. 17, 13:37
dialog: PM.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE BLUNT
dialog: (to Command)
dialog: Command, I’m going EVA. Possible
dialog: forced entry required.
dialog: (to Roy)
dialog: You're the only non-essential
dialog: member of this craft. As you know,
dialog: protocol is for you to come along.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Will this be a problem?
dialog: 51.
text: Roy thinks for a moment, then, with thinly-veiled anger, he
text: starts to suit up.
scene_heading: INT. THE CEPHEUS - EQUIPMENT SECTION
text: Roy and Blunt strap on equipment and make final suit
text: augmentations for their EVA. Roy SEES Blunt is ARMING A
text: WEAPON, a GUNLIKE object.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE BLUNT
dialog: (stares at Roy for an
dialog: uncomfortable moment;
dialog: then: )
dialog: I'd advise you to arm yourself as
dialog: well. You’re no longer ina
dialog: predictable environment.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (curt)
dialog: I’m aware of that.
text: Frustrated, Roy turns, looks through GLASS to SEE: the Vesta
text: IX, about the size of the Cepheus, slowly rolling in place.
text: We hear Donald Scobee from the cockpit...
speaker_heading: DONALD SCOBEE (RADIO FILTER) (V.O.)
dialog: Heading three-three-four. Cannot
dialog: confirm live contact. Range three-
text: zero-seven-zero meters and closing.
dialog: (beat)
text: Reactor is still hot.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Optimum approach angle, thirteen
dialog: degrees. Coming around to three-
dialog: three-four.
text: Blunt leads Roy towards the hatch...
scene_heading: INT. THE CEPHEUS - AIRLOCK
text: Roy and Blunt stand before the airlock doors... which open
dialog: into space.
dialog: Out they go...
scene_heading: EXT. THE CEPHEUS
text: A few glittering LIGHTS distinguish the Cepheus from absolute
dialog: darkness.
text: Roy and Blunt jet towards the Vesta Ix.
dialog: 52.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE
text: They venture away from the Cepheus and frighteningly into
text: deep space. The Vesta is still distressingly far...
text: And yet, the Vesta gets closer...
dialog: And closer...
scene_heading: EXT. VESTA IX
text: And then they are upon it! Roy reaches the airlock first.
text: He PUNCHES BUTTONS on the DOORFRAME, to no avail. STATIC
text: NOISE. Blunt motions to Roy, who uses a GATLING GUN to blow
text: open the airlock. In SILENCE.
scene_heading: INT. VESTA IX - AIRLOCK
text: Roy and Blunt enter the craft, pulse weapons at the ready.
text: No one’s in sight.
speaker_heading: DONALD SCOBEE (V.O.)
dialog: Gentlemen, one of you is required
text: to find the flight recorder box.
text: Blunt points to Roy, and he and Roy move in different
dialog: directions...
scene_heading: INT. VESTA IX - DECK
text: Roy floats through the craft--it’s vacant, jammed with idle
text: instruments, empty console chairs. It’s quiet, except for an
dialog: electrical HUM. We HEAR:
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN LAWRENCE BLUNT (V.O.)
dialog: Vesta, this is Cepheus, responding
dialog: to your mayday signal... Do you
dialog: read...?
text: The ZERO GRAVITY renders a lot of things floating: PENCILS,
text: NOTEBOOKS, EQUIPMENT, LIT FLASHLIGHTS. They spin in the
dialog: craft.
scene_heading: INT. VESTA IX - LAB
text: Roy floats deeper into the craft. It’s dark. Roy scans his
text: TRACKING DEVICE from side to side. The SPINNING FLASHLIGHTS
text: illuminate spots for brief moments. Roy grabs one as it
dialog: moves.
dialog: 53.
text: By the looks of the LAB EQUIPMENT, it appears the craft
dialog: performs research on viruses and diseases.
dialog: Roy continues...
scene_heading: INT. VESTA IX —- PASSAGEWAY
text: Roy MOVES towards an OPENING that leads to a DECK. LIGHTS
dialog: are coming from that area.
scene_heading: INT. VESTA IX - ANOTHER DECK
text: Much CLUTTER here, lots of ITEMS floating around.
text: Roy moves silently. A SCREEN COMES ON. A bearded man,
text: grizzly and haunted. A NORWEGIAN ASTRONAUT:
scene_heading: NORWEGIAN ASTRONAUT
dialog: This is a eulogy for 12 good men...
dialog: Men who came to space to advance
dialog: scientific understanding of the
dialog: universe. But... Our supply
dialog: generator has failed... We can no
dialog: longer see the earth--and it is not
dialog: visible from our current
dialog: perspective... No more earth. And
dialog: we are adrift, without purpose...
dialog: With no hope in sight, we have
dialog: decided to do the only logical
dialog: thing...
text: Then: something weird... CRIMSON ORBS are floating here and
text: there. There must be at least a dozen. Most are baseball-
text: sized, some are larger, some smaller.
text: ROY touches one. Liquid. He removes his finger, the orb
text: divides into smaller orbs.
dialog: Then--
text: Something else is FLOATING TOWARDS US... A larger MASS...
dialog: ROY backs up--
text: AND bumps into a BODY.
text: A dead body. He is startled. Roy pushes past them.
text: MORE DEAD bodies ahead.
text: One body leaks BLOOD, which bubbles out of the man's torn
text: suit, up, down and around, in every direction, forming the
text: crimson orbs.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Cepheus, I have one expired
dialog: individual here, no signs of anyone
dialog: alive. I believe I’ve viewed a
dialog: suicide video file of some kind.
speaker_heading: DONALD SCOBEE
dialog: Copy that, Major. Uh, Major, we've
dialog: momentarily lost contact with
dialog: Captain Blunt here.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Appears I have as well. Will
dialog: attempt eye contact.
scene_heading: INT. VESTA IX - B-DECK
text: Roy is in the aft of the ship and is DOWNLOADING information
text: from a central computer shaft. PULLS OUT a BLACK BOX from
dialog: the console.
text: A small LIGHT on Roy’s tracker FLASHES.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (RADIO FILTER)
dialog: Captain?
text: No ANSWER.
text: Roy tenses, looks around. Starts to float in that direction.
text: Roy moves between cramped rows of SHADOWED EQUIPMENT.
text: There’s MOVEMENT in front of him. He hesitates. Then,
text: another shadowy movement...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: Captain Blunt?
text: Again, no answer! Roy RAISES HIS WEAPON. MOVES FORWARD TO
speaker_heading: REVEAL:
scene_heading: AROUND THE CORNER:
text: We SEE a truly GROTESQUE SIGHT: a BABOON DEVOURING CAPTAIN
speaker_heading: BLUNT’S FACE!
dialog: It’s a big one, a Chacma, close to 100 pounds. It’s insane
dialog: and hungry.
text: Roy jumps back, beyond startled.
dialog: 55.
text: ROY’S P.O.V. -- The baboon SEES ROY, SHRIEKS (LOUDLY--but
text: SILENT TO US because of our helmeted P.O.V.). It knocks over
text: some equipment as it swims toward us in the gravity-free
text: space, floating towards ROY’S jugular.
text: BANG! ROY KILLS THE PRIMATE WITH HIS WEAPON.
text: It TUMBLES AWAY, dead.
text: Roy comes over to help. He looks in what remains of Blunt’s
text: eyes. The pupils are not dilating. Roy PUNCHES a BUTTON on
text: the SIDE OF HIS HELMET. OUT OF BREATH:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
text: Cepheus, a research primate has
text: attacked the captain. He’s
text: critically injured. Suggest
text: retrieving the VDR and moving the
dialog: Captain to the Cepheus as soon as
dialog: possible. Please advise.
speaker_heading: DONALD SCOBEE
dialog: We confirm, this is our view as
dialog: well. Over.
text: Just then: A RUSH OF MONKEYS APPEARS, CHARGING AT ROY. HE
text: PULLS HIMSELF BACK, through an AIRLOCK, YANKING the SMALL
text: BLACK DATA BOX as well as BLUNT inside. Just in time, too,
text: as the MONKEYS SLAM into the AIRLOCK DOOR. Insanity.
scene_heading: INT. AIRLOCK - VESTA
text: Roy pulls out a HELMET from a ROW of them, inside the
text: airlock. Locking it into place on Blunt, placing carefully
text: it over Blunt’s BLOODIED FACE.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE
text: Roy and his cord--pulling the black box as well as an
text: inanimate Blunt--move back to the Cepheus.
scene_heading: EXT. CEPHEUS
text: As Roy approaches, the Cepheus is SPINNING. He gets to the
text: surface of the craft, waits until the AIRLOCK DOOR
dialog: approaches.
scene_heading: INT. THE CEPHEUS - AIRLOCK
text: The airlock doors whoosh open, and Roy rockets in with the
dialog: 56.
text: equipment and Blunt’s body on a tether cord. The doors close
text: behind him. He takes off his helmet. Yoshida helps him/them
text: through the airlock; PULLING OFF BLUNT’S HELMET, he’s
text: horrified to see what’s become of his Commander. Yoshida
text: begins immediately to work on Blunt. Roy is out of breath.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
dialog: (to Roy)
dialog: What the hell happened in there?!?
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: It was a scientific vessel--they
dialog: lost control somehow.
dialog: (with gritted teeth)
dialog: I tried to tell the Captain... ALL
dialog: of you.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
dialog: Tell us what?
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: That we have a task in front of us.
dialog: And that to stop would be a waste
dialog: of fucking time.
text: Yoshida goes back to work on the unresponsive Blunt. Leaning
text: his HEAD IN through the corrugated arch, ALAN TANNER reaches
text: for the BLACK BOX. He pulls it toward him. Then, sotto:
speaker_heading: ALAN TANNER
dialog: (re: Blunt)
dialog: What’s his status?
text: Yoshida SIMPLY SHAKES HIS HEAD. The CAPTAIN WON’T MAKE IT.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALAN TANNER (CONT’D)
dialog: I’1l inform Don, he’ll have to be
dialog: certified for flight.
text: As Tanner PULLS the black box, Roy follows him into:
scene_heading: INT. COMMAND MODULE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Tanner begins to draw on the BLACK BOX data. Scobee is going
text: through his checklist, comparing it the BLACK BOX DATA that
text: is coming in on the computer. Roy moves closer.
scene_heading: The RADIO INTERRRUPTS:
speaker_heading: SPACECOM VOICE
dialog: Cepheus, we received your message
dialog: concerning Captain Blunt. We have
dialog: Cpt.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: SPACECOM VOICE (CONT'D)
text: Scobee’s retinal scan on file, and
text: he is now in control of the craft.
dialog: Over.
speaker_heading: DONALD SCOBEE
dialog: This is Cpt. Scobee, SpaceCom.
dialog: Roger that. Over.
text: Sotto, to Scobee, Roy grabs Scobee’s arm:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Mars is our assigned destination.
dialog: That is what requires our complete
dialog: focus.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DONALD SCOBEE
dialog: Understood, Major. We’re on our
text: way to Helios Station.
dialog: (louder; to Tanner)
dialog: Prepare boosters D-6, D-9.
speaker_heading: ALAN TANNER
text: Boosters D-6 and D-9, roger that.
text: Roy HEARS something. Turns back to SEE:
scene_heading: INT. NEAR AIRLOCK
text: The life is leaving Blunt. ROY can SEE the BODY, ENTOMBED
text: inside his SPACESUIT. Yoshida finishes reading LAST RITES:
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
dialog: .+-I commend you to almighty God,
dialog: and entrust you to your Creator.
dialog: May the angels and the saints come
dialog: to meet you, as you go forth from
dialog: this life. May you see your
dialog: Redeemer face to face and enjoy the
dialog: vision of God for ever...
dialog: (to the men)
text: Airlock engaged.
speaker_heading: DONALD SCOBEE
text: Airlock engaged, roger that.
text: The AIRLOCK opens. A WHOOOSH!
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE
text: THE CEPHEUS RELEASES BLUNT’S BODY into the VOID...
dialog: 58.
text: Their fallen commander tumbles away, into the darkness. The
text: Cepheus’ BOOSTER ROCKETS FIRE, and the CRAFT speeds away--
text: leaving Blunt’s body to tumble. Forever...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MARS - LATER
text: The RED PLANET, floating in space. A space elevator with a
text: SPINNING DOCKING STATION is tethered to the planet.
text: The Cepheus ARRIVES into view, its retros thrusting.
scene_heading: INT. CEPHEUS
dialog: The men speak:
speaker_heading: DONALD SCOBEE
dialog: (to radio)
dialog: SpaceCom, we are approaching Mars,
dialog: Helios North. Over.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE THE SPACE ELEVATOR
text: It slows to a stop as it DOCKS with THE DOCKING BAY connected
text: to MARS.
scene_heading: INT. THE CEPHEUS - CONTINUOUS
text: As Roy, Tanner, Scobee, and Yoshida ready themselves to
text: leave: A DOWNLOAD COMMENCES.
speaker_heading: SPACECOM VOICE
dialog: Cepheus, this is SpaceCom. We have
dialog: a secure download for passenger Roy
dialog: McBride.
speaker_heading: DONALD SCOBEE
dialog: Send it through. Over.
text: The FILE DOWNLOADS. Roy takes the chip and:
scene_heading: INT. SECURE CORNER
dialog: Roy downloads the chip:
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: SPACECOM VOICE
dialog: An additional message was sent to
dialog: the moon’s communications center,
dialog: approximately seven hours after
dialog: your departure.
text: ROY FOCUSES. On a SCREEN comes: THE IMAGES OF THE MEDIEVAL
text: CASTLE THAT ROY has OBSESSED OVER! The MUSIC is odd, a
dialog: strange “easy listening” tune...
text: ROY MOVES CLOSE TO THE SCREEN. Then, the IMAGERY CUTS OUT,
text: leaving a TEXT SENTENCE, white TEXT on BLACK SCREEN:
dialog: “BRE YOU COMING?”
scene_heading: NEW LINE of TEXT:
text: “06:10:00”
dialog: ANGLE ON ROY as we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DOCKING AREA - CEPHEUS
text: Roy SHAKES the hands of Scobee and Yoshida and Tanner:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: My condolences for Captain Blunt,
dialog: gentlemen. I do appreciate the
dialog: ride and wish you the best on the
dialog: rest of your journeys.
speaker_heading: DONALD SCOBEE
dialog: Thank you, Major. Glad we could be
dialog: of service...
text: The HATCH OPENS for ROY, and he glides through.
scene_heading: INT. SHUTTLE
text: Roy is in the shuttle to Helios South.
scene_heading: INT. DOCKING BAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: He enters the docking bay of the space station. Nobody's
text: here to greet him, although there are cameras and active
text: screens. BEEEEP! ROY SPEAKS:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: McBride, Roy C. Submit.
dialog: 60.
text: Steps forward and puts his eye in the scanner.
speaker_heading: WOMAN ON A SCREEN
dialog: Approved.
text: A moment, then a WHOOSH! A LARGE DOOR OPENS TO:
scene_heading: INT. SPACE ELEVATOR
text: The CREW, entering in the elevator. Roy looks out, SEEING
text: THE RED PLANET’S SURFACE APPROACHING as the thing descends.
scene_heading: INT. HELIOS STATION - MARS SURFACE
text: The ELEVATOR “lands” on MARS. The LARGE STEEL DOOR UNLOCKS
text: AUTOMATICALLY. ROY steps out.
text: We don’t see any people here yet. But several SIBERIAN
text: HUSKIES walk up and down the halls of the installation. A
text: couple of them come up to our men and sniff around.
text: A weird SCREECHING sound pervades--as if something large deep
dialog: inside the station needs repair...or, at the very least,
speaker_heading: WD40.
text: THEN: A FEW SCIENTISTS staggering down the hall, too--SINGING
text: some unknown song badly, somewhat drunkenly. A GUY IN ROLLER-
text: SKATES speeds past in the background.
text: A SEEMINGLY INSANE MARS OFFICER, a woman of fifty, charges to
dialog: Roy:
speaker_heading: MARS OFFICER
dialog: Did you bring us seeds?!? What
dialog: about canned produce, did you do
speaker_heading: THAT?
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: No. I’m sorry. I don’t have any.
dialog: Sorry... Is your commanding
dialog: officer--
text: Roy looks past her. It’s MADNESS. More passersby, more
text: revelry... and the return of the Roller-Skater.
text: Next comes an unctuous officer named SERGEANT PETER BELLO
text: (fiftysomething, strangely tan) greets our man. He may not
text: be drunk, but it’s unclear if he has his wits about him.
scene_heading: SGT. BELLO
text: (with a slightly mad grin,
dialog: too loud at times)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: SGT. BELLO (CONT'D)
dialog: Good afternoon! Or evening--or
dialog: whatever the fuck! WELCOME TO THE
text: VERY LAST MANNED OUTPOST IN OUR
dialog: SOLAR SYSTEM! [I'm] Sergeant
dialog: Bello... You comin’ from earth, or
dialog: the moon??? OR WHAT?!? Wait,
dialog: whose retinal scan’d I approve?
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: I’ve been sent by SpaceCom to
dialog: conduct an inspection near Vallis
dialog: Marineris and I need access to the
dialog: location as soon as possible. I
dialog: need to see a Colonel Lipset.
scene_heading: SGT. BELLO
dialog: Oh, I bet he’s at Shunga Show,
dialog: brother! Where we should be! Keep
dialog: ourselves right in the head--and
dialog: down BELOW, if you get my meaning--
text: ROY INTERRUPTS him.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: I need to talk to him. It’s
dialog: urgent.
scene_heading: SGT. BELLO
dialog: Okay, cowboy... Okay...
scene_heading: INT. HELIOS STATION - SHUNGA PARLOR
text: An enormous dark space, almost like the Whale Room in New
text: York's American Museum of Natural History. It’s lit only by
text: black light.
text: PROJECTED ALL OVER, we SEE...several physically perfect
text: STRIPPERS (holographic--but also totally lifelike).
text: ROY joins the throng of SCIENTISTS & MILITARY. EVERYONE is
text: SMOKING POT and doing a lot of other stuff.
text: Roy walks through some of the strippers.
scene_heading: SGT. BELLO
dialog: (excitedly)
dialog: They keep us company! Don’t
dialog: misunderstand me, we’re not
dialog: allowed’t make ‘em sentient,
dialog: course. But our scientists here’ve
dialog: tampered with ‘em--given ‘ema
dialog: little more personality, we'll say!
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: SGT. BELLO (CONT'D)
dialog: They're still well within legal
dialog: A.I. cognition limits, I promise
dialog: you!
text: Roy looks around him at a couple of gorgeous (fake) women,
text: GYRATING IN UNISON to “TALKIN’ LOUD AND SAYIN’ NOTHING”.
text: Roy SEES a LARGE BUFFET TABLE with PROCESSED FOOD.
text: The virtual HOLO WOMEN move around Roy like ghosts.
dialog: It’s James Brown night, evidently. The Godfather of Soul is
text: actually here in person, “on stage”--a perfect, life-like
dialog: hologram.
text: Roy's sort of pushing the Holo Women away, like swatting
text: flies. His hand just goes through them. Roy and the rest of
dialog: the crew encounter:
text: Sitting on a cushion, smoking a BONG and working on God-knows-
text: what with old-fashioned pencil and paper, is astrophysicist
text: SAMIR MALIK--bearded, thirtysomething, bespectacled,
text: hippyish. A shit-eating grin. HIS WIFE, CHERYL, is next to
text: him. Projected around them is a WARM SPACE, almost like a
scene_heading: high-end LOG CABIN. STANDING NEARBY: COLONEL LIPSET, a
text: grizzled man, about forty-five years old. Lined face, gaunt.
text: He STARES AT ROY...
speaker_heading: SGT. BELLO (CONT’D)
dialog: Sam, this guy’s got orders, from
dialog: SpaceCom. Looking for a Colonel
dialog: Lipset.
text: Malik smiles broadly, holds out a hand to shake Roy’s.
text: COMPLETELY STONED. His hand is robotic, a metallic gold (for
dialog: no explained reason).
speaker_heading: SAMIR MALIK
dialog: Samir Malik--I’m superintendant.
dialog: With National Institute of
dialog: Sciences. Cal-Tech Mafia! This’s
dialog: my wife, Cheryl.
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Pleased to meet you.
speaker_heading: SAMIR MALIK
dialog: (with a snort)
dialog: Well, it’s a pleasure to meet
dialog: anybody this far out--’specially
dialog: anybody with their heads screwed on
dialog: straight! END of the LINE here!
dialog: 63.
text: Awkward pause, the MEN LOOK AROUND at the surroundings.
text: COLONEL LIPSET is still staring. Then:
speaker_heading: SAMIR MALIK (CONT’D)
dialog: (lets out a laugh)
dialog: Gotta maintain that human
dialog: connection somehow...
text: The OFFICER REACHES DOWN to a METAL PLANK below his feet and
text: FLIPS a SWITCH. OFF GOES the HOLOGRAPHIC ROOM AROUND THEM,
text: that “HIGH-END LOG CABIN”, revealing the real space around
text: them. Stepping forward is Colonel Lipset:
speaker_heading: COLONEL LIPSET
dialog: Major, I’m Colonel Lipset.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Sir. YES.
text: As COLONEL LIPSET MOVES to shake Roy’s hand, he LEANS IN,
text: softly into Roy’s EAR:
speaker_heading: COLONEL LIPSET
dialog: I’ve been fully briefed.
text: Straightening up, and louder:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Yessir.
text: Roy turns, HANDS LIPSET A PRINTOUT.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: My destination is these
dialog: coordinates.
speaker_heading: COLONEL LIPSET
dialog: (looks, then to Malik)
dialog: Dr. Malik?
text: MALIK LOOKS AT IT, then UP AT THEM, LIKE ROY’S NUTS. Grows
text: DEADLY SERIOUS. Turns to his wife:
speaker_heading: SAMIR MALIK
dialog: Honey, I’ve gotta go back to work.
dialog: (back to Roy)
dialog: Why don’t you take a ride with me.
scene_heading: INT. HELIOS CORRIDOR - MONORAIL
text: ROY, SAMIR MALIK in a SPEEDING MONORAIL. A LIT MAP IS IN
text: FRONT OF THEM. With Malik is his right-hand, a woman named
text: KATHRYN COLLINS. COLONEL LIPSET is with them, SILENT.
speaker_heading: SAMIR MALIK
dialog: The spot is in the middle of our
dialog: complex of fission reactors. It’s
dialog: a Westinghouse design, built--I
dialog: wanna say six earth years ago?
dialog: He looks to Collins:
speaker_heading: KATHRYN COLLINS
dialog: That’s right.
speaker_heading: SAMIR MALIK
dialog: Right. Well, there was a meltdown
dialog: in reactor three a few months after
dialog: completion. Likely a result of
dialog: industrial sabotage.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: What’s its current status?
speaker_heading: SAMIR MALIK
dialog: Kathryn knows more than I do here.
text: Roy TURNS TO THE MAP IN FRONT OF THEM as it scrolls
text: northern hemisphere, then stops. Like Google Maps’
text: View”--a remote camera has captured the exterior of
text: REACTOR. Roy studies the location.
text: Collins points to the map, which shows a “skeleton”
text: reactor’s innards.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN COLLINS (CONT’D)
dialog: This area was walled-off after the
dialog: disaster. They poured concrete to
dialog: prevent further contamination. And
text: many of the tunnels are still
text: filled with cooling water.
dialog: 64.
dialog: up to the
dialog: “Street

dialog: of the

dialog: reactor in Valles Marineris.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: What is that, to the right?
speaker_heading: KATHRYN COLLINS
text: A radio telescope. Still active.
dialog: Which is why we're continuing to
dialog: pump electricity, water, and oxygen
dialog: through the reactor. No one’1ll
dialog: spend the money to build a new
dialog: telescope away from the
dialog: contaminated area, and it needs
dialog: those things to operate.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: So this whole zone is deserted now--
dialog: but it still has power, that’s what
dialog: I’m to understand?
speaker_heading: COLONEL LIPSET
dialog: That is correct, major.
text: Everyone falls silent. Lipset’s interjection is odd. Then:
speaker_heading: KATHRYN COLLINS
dialog: SPACECOM'’s using Cornell University
dialog: to do an ongoing study of the
dialog: disaster. One of their fellows’s
dialog: named Francesca DeSanctis. She’s
dialog: their point person.
text: As Roy sifts through the reactor scans:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: I'd like to debrief her--if that’s
dialog: okay with you.
speaker_heading: COLONEL LIPSET
dialog: We'll get her to you.
text: A TENSE BEAT. Then:
speaker_heading: SAMIR MALIK
dialog: Anything we should know here?
speaker_heading: COLONEL LIPSET
dialog: I’m sorry, Doctor--how do you mean?
speaker_heading: SAMIR MALIK
dialog: (looks to Collins, then)
dialog: Well...we had a power surge, couple
dialog: of weeks ago, and we had a lot of
dialog: repair work on our hands.
speaker_heading: COLONEL LIPSET
dialog: I seem to recall reading that
dialog: quakes happen here from time to

speaker_heading: SAMIR MALIK
dialog: They do, but...
dialog: (beat; shrugs)
dialog: Look, we’ve heard rumors. About an
dialog: explosion, off Neptune.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I guess I’m wondering--should
dialog: we...evacuate?
dialog: 66.
text: Colonel Lipset looks to Roy, who responds “properly”:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: The mission’s classified, I’m
dialog: sorry.
text: Malik purses his lips. Not the most encouraging answer.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: Please find the woman.

scene_heading: INT. THE HELIOS - CHAPEL/LAB - CONTINUOUS
text: What was once solely a chapel has been converted to a lab
text: mixed with a weird version of a 1960's hippy ashram.
text: Blankets, lamps, etc. A WOMAN whose back is to us.
speaker_heading: SAMIR MALIK
dialog: Her name is Francesca DeSanctis--
dialog: she was born here. She’s part of
dialog: the Cornell Extension program and
dialog: had been working on the Mars
dialog: geology project. So she’s been
dialog: researching the territory for
dialog: years.
text: A CLOSE SHOT on FRANCESCA DESANCTIS, early forties, as she
text: turns around to us. Lovely but also fragile. Not physically
text: delicate, but somehow, we can tell she's emotionally
text: vulnerable. She is whiter than white--as if her skin has
text: never seen sunlight. Veins are visible beneath her temples.
text: She looks into the camera, then STANDS UP, walks toward us as
scene_heading: ROY ENTERS.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Good evening.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: (wide smile)
dialog: Or morning.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (gentle smile in return)
dialog: Right, yes.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I’m from USSPACECOM, and I have
dialog: some questions for you.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: All right.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: I ask you not to be concerned, I
dialog: just need to know what you know--
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: I’m not concerned.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Okay, that’s good... Dr. Malik
dialog: informs me that you've been
dialog: studying the reactors?
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: Yes. For about four years now, for
dialog: a SPACECOM study. I toured the
dialog: area myself before a series of
dialog: quakes hit the area. I was the
dialog: last to enter.
dialog: (wry smile)
dialog: I guess I’m the lucky one.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: All my records are on file, and I
dialog: have adhered most strictly to all
dialog: regulations. My scientific work is
dialog: very important. It’s, it’s what I
dialog: have.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (nods; then)
dialog: You haven't noticed anything
dialog: unusual inside the reactors?
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: Apart from the physical activity?
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: I informed SPACECOM about signs of
dialog: a physical disturbance inside the
dialog: reactor. Didn’t they tell you?
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (thrown)
dialog: No...I, I have no information on
dialog: that matter...
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: Well, it’s my feeling that a person
dialog: has been inside the core. I’ve
dialog: noticed what I think are some very
text: obvious signs.
text: ROY IS STUNNED.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I can take you down there--if, if
dialog: that’s where you need to go. I
dialog: know the routes and I can help.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (cutting her off)
dialog: Thank you. I think I have enough
dialog: information for now. I’11 contact
dialog: you.
scene_heading: INT. HELIOS CONFERENCE ROOM
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Roy and Colonel Lipset are huddling. Lipset looks at DATA
scene_heading: PAPERS. In medias res:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: I do believe now it’s possible that
dialog: my father escaped from Neptune,
dialog: yes. Ina craft of some sort,
dialog: perhaps--something of 3-D
dialog: fabrication. We’d have to find out
dialog: where he’s hiding here on Mars,
dialog: course.
speaker_heading: COLONEL LIPSET
dialog: Either that, or it’s not him.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Sir, with respect, there’s no one
dialog: else who had knowledge of the
dialog: things that have been sent to me.
text: It is him.
text: Lipset looks up. A beat. Then:
speaker_heading: COLONEL LIPSET
dialog: No one’s been inside there for
dialog: years. We don’t know what’s down
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: COLONEL LIPSET (CONT'D)
dialog: It could be extremely dangerous--
dialog: the radiation, the, the self-
dialog: replicators may still be active.
dialog: And you don’t know the
dialog: way--
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: I would go with Ms. DeSanctis. She
dialog: would guide me to the location and
dialog: I could then initiate the contact
dialog: with my father. I would set her
text: free and convince him to surrender.
dialog: You'd have continued access to my
dialog: data, and you could speak with me
dialog: directly through my MMU.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: This is the necessary mission, sir.
dialog: And time is critical.
text: Lipset begins to BURN the DATA PAPERS.
speaker_heading: COLONEL LIPSET
dialog: We'll have to follow you close
text: behind, ready to move and hopefully
dialog: obtain intel on the Lima Project's
dialog: precise location off Neptune.
text: Roy LOOKS TROUBLED. DOES NOT SPEAK UP.
speaker_heading: COLONEL LIPSET (CONT'D)
dialog: Is this a problem for you?
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: No sir...
speaker_heading: COLONEL LIPSET
dialog: Good. Because we’re only here to
dialog: help.
dialog: ANGLE ON ROY as we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HELIOS PREPARATION ROOM
text: Francesca is getting a SPACESUIT put on her. She’s rarely
text: had one on before; it looks awkward, almost preposterous, on
text: her. She’s older than Roy; she is lovely in her
dialog: vulnerability. Incredibly aware and sensitive eyes--as well
text: as a seemingly easygoing manner:
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Are you uncomfortable with the
dialog: unit, Ma’am?
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: I’ve grown up with these but I’ve
dialog: never liked them.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: This one’s considerably better than
dialog: the earlier models. I’ve noticed
dialog: increased flexibility with the
dialog: newer MMUs. They have all our
dialog: vitals here. And you can release
dialog: all the nitrogen fuel at once, if
dialog: you need to, from the pack or even
dialog: from your boots, here.
dialog: (beat; senses her stress)
dialog: If you breathe normally, there’s no
dialog: cause for panic.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: That’s what I try to do.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: “Breathe,” I tell myself. It
dialog: should be easy. It probably is,
dialog: for you.
text: She accepts that. Roy REACHES for a SMALL ELECTRONIC FLAT
text: SCREEN, which he unfolds:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Is this map accurate?
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: (nods; then)
dialog: Yes. But when we get there,
dialog: there’s also a guide rope that we
dialog: installed through the tunnels right
text: after meltdown. It leads to the
text: center of the core.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Okay...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And--and thank you, Ma’am. You can
dialog: rest assured that this is of great
dialog: importance, what you're doing. For
dialog: the Earth.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: (nods; then)
dialog: I’ve only been to earth once,
dialog: actually. As a child.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I have a tissue disorder because I
dialog: was born here. They said I'd die

dialog: on new medications.
text: Unexpectedly, she stops speaking. Looks at Roy. Her EYES
speaker_heading: WELL UP:
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT’D)
dialog: I remember it very well--I
dialog: remember, it was extremely
dialog: beautiful.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Some parts, yes.
dialog: (lets out a laugh)
dialog: Other parts...not so much.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: (interior)
dialog: I wish I could be there...I wish,
dialog: more than anything else...
dialog: (louder; eases)
dialog: A lot of people here get lonely.
dialog: And they break down. The mental
dialog: hospital at Helios is always full
dialog: of patients.
dialog: (sotto; looks at the map)
dialog: It’s why I always thought the
dialog: reactor crew itself caused the
dialog: meltdown. I think they just lost
dialog: it...
text: A beat. She seems to get an idea:
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT’D)
dialog: Hey, I think I saw a news program
dialog: on you, from a few years back. I
dialog: just realized, I think I know you!
scene_heading: ROY IS MOMENTARILY CONFUSED:
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT’D)
dialog: It was--it was about the Space
dialog: Antenna!
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Oh yes, the gravitational wave
text: antenna. It’s almost finished now.
dialog: It’s going to be an excellent
dialog: project. We’ll be able to hear any
dialog: intelligent life, possibly even
dialog: respond.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: Maybe I’1l be able to go to the
dialog: Earth and see it someday...
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Yes, it will be completed soon.
dialog: Our team was really working toward
dialog: that. All of us, back home. It’s
dialog: a very worthy endeavor--
dialog: communication with other potential
text: lifeforms.
text: DeSanctis looks at her suit. Then:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: I think you’re ready.
text: A BUTTON on Francesca’s SUIT is PUSHED and it COLLAPSES
text: AROUND HER, SNUG. She looks uncomfortable--but ready. Roy
text: SMILES at her; he’s comfortable. There’s even a level of
text: sexual attraction, maybe. Maybe. Roy talks to his sleeve:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: Doctor, Colonel--I think we're good
dialog: to go here.
text: ANGLE ON ROY as he LOOKS UP. THROUGH GLASS, we SEE: SAMIR
text: MALIK and COLONEL LIPSET looking at them.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND STATION
text: A maze-like installation. A ROVER about to depart.
scene_heading: INT. ROVER
text: In the ROVER are Roy and Francesca. With KATHRYN COLLINS
dialog: driving.
scene_heading: EXT. MARS - SHUTTLE PORT - DAY
text: The ground opens up and the rover emerges onto the strikingly
text: bright Martian terrain.
scene_heading: EXT. MARS - VALLES MARINERIS - LATER
text: The rover drives alongside one of Mars's monumental canyons,
text: VALLES MARINERIS. It's amazing.
dialog: 73.
scene_heading: INT. ROVER
text: A wonder to behold. ALL DIALOG IS RADIO FILTER:
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: That is Valles Marineris, over to
dialog: your right--it’s a thousand times
text: bigger than the Grand Canyon on
dialog: earth. And just about every other
dialog: month an earthsick person throws
dialog: himself off it.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. FRONT ROVER - CONTINUOUS
text: Francesca DeSanctis gestures to a large structure that
text: they’re about to pass.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: The area we’re entering was self-
dialog: sufficient at one time, with a
text: greenhouse and self-replicating
dialog: units for maintenance and repair.
dialog: (to Collins)
dialog: You can take us right to that white
dialog: circle, Kathryn.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN COLLINS
dialog: Will do.
text: Collins pulls the rover over to the side of the road, near a
text: WHITE STEEL CIRCLE TUBE in the dirt--about 10 feet in
text: diameter. Roy leans forward. To Collins:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: I have activated GPS so you can
dialog: find us. When we’re done. It
dialog: reports that we have twenty-six
dialog: minutes until we need to be inside.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN COLLINS
dialog: Roger that. We’ll be more than
dialog: happy to come pick you up on our
dialog: Mars Taxi service!
dialog: (no answer from Roy, So)
dialog: Good luck, both of you!
scene_heading: EXT. MARS - VALLES MARINERIS - CONTINUOUS
text: The rover’s doors open. Roy steps out.
text: Roy and Francesca are left all alone as the Rover leaves
text: behind a trail of dust.
dialog: 74.
text: It’s silent. The landscape is mostly barren--the greenhouse,
text: the radio telescope, and a few other structures are in the
dialog: distance.
text: A purple DUST STORM materializes, gathers, grows, approaches.
text: The atmosphere is obscured.
text: Luckily, the atmosphere is so thin that these twisters are
text: harmless--they just leave a RED/VIOLET HUE over Roy’s and
text: Francesca’s spacesuit and helmet.
text: Francesca finds a HATCH, covered in dust and dirt. POINTS TO
text: ROY. Roy bends down, shoves the dirt away and find a metal
text: protuberance. After removing more dirt, he is ABLE TO LIFT
text: UP THE HATCH.
text: DOWN THEY GO, INTO AN UNDERGROUND CHAMBER.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND CHAMBER
text: A CONCRETE SARCOPHAGUS. A WALL. With a CIRCULAR WHEEL,
text: leading DOWNWARD. FRANCESCA GESTURES.
text: ROY TURNS THE WHEEL. It opens, and they descend into the
speaker_heading: DARK WATER:
scene_heading: INT. TUNNELS
text: THEY ARE NOW SWIMMING in a TUNNEL of DARKNESS. Roy and
text: Francesca have HELMET LIGHTS which illuminate a few feet in
text: front of them.
text: They PULL THEMSELVES ALONG by the GUIDE ROPE.
scene_heading: ROY’S SLEEVE BLINKS: “EXCESSIVE RADIATION”
scene_heading: INT. DEEPER INTO THE TUNNELS
text: They are dark.
text: Only a few feet in front of Roy is illuminated.
text: THE TWO PULL THEMSELVES ALONG THE ROPE SLOWLY and CAREFULLY.
text: INTO THE DARKNESS.
text: But then we see the movement of particulate in the air.
text: Something is causing dust to disperse in that DARK TUNNEL...
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
text: Something appears to be moving.
dialog: 75.
text: The breaths quicken.
text: TERROR on her face. He looks down the pipeway; he can focus
dialog: on nothing else...
text: SOMETHING begins to appear in the darkness...
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: I just received a text message,
dialog: imploring us not to proceed. It
dialog: says if we do we will be
dialog: destroyed...
text: SLOWLY BUT SURELY we begin to make it out...
text: It is a creaturelike SELF-REPLICATING MACHINE.
text: We've SEEN SOMETHING LIKE IT before; they were working on the
dialog: tether, in the beginning of our story. But this one is
text: larger, somehow more unforgiving. Its HEAD is ONE HEADLIGHT;
text: the head looks like Odilon Redon’s portrait of the CYCLOPS...
text: It charges at them in silence, through the dense water. It
text: appears to be WELDING--it has TENDRILS, like a HYDRA, which
text: it uses to push itself down the TUNNEL.
dialog: It gets CLOSER AND CLOSER!
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Please send it code, tell it that
dialog: we'll proceed no further and it
dialog: need not be concerned.
text: She is typing into her sleeve. A TENDRIL REACHES OUT about
speaker_heading: to GRAB FRANCESCA.
text: AND THEN IT STOPS. STOPS PROCEEDING.
text: Roy steps forward. Approaches the enormous hydra, which
text: seems frozen and no longer threatening.
text: AT INCREDIBLE SPEED, he withdraws his PULSE WEAPON, FIRES AT
scene_heading: IT. DIRECT HIT!
text: It moves spasmodically for a moment after it is hit--almost
text: as if in physical pain.
text: ROY APPROACHES IT, CLOSE, FIRING THE PULSE WEAPON to the
text: CENTER of the EYE of the HEAD...
text: THE HYDRA JERKS SPASMODICALLY AGAIN.
scene_heading: ROY then GRABS FRANCESCA’S ARM; REACHES OVER and PULLS on
text: what LOOKS LIKE A RIPCORD of sorts from his MMU.
dialog: 76.
text: THE MMU on ROY’S BACK RELEASES ALL THE NITROGEN in the PACK,
text: YANKING HER and ROY with TREMENDOUS SPEED PAST THE DESTROYED
text: HYDRA; they TUMBLE THROUGH THE WATER, BLOWING away from the
text: HYDRA and toward relative safety.
text: ROY finds the CABLE, and, holding onto FRANCESCA, he uses her
dialog: own MMU for power.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL AIRLOCK
speaker_heading: The TWO ENTER:
text: Francesca leads him.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (to radio)
dialog: Command, it appears we encountered
text: a self-replicator of some kind,
dialog: perhaps one meant to secure the
dialog: structure.
speaker_heading: COMMAND VOICE
dialog: Copy that, Major. Is it still
dialog: active?
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
text: Negative. It has been disabled.
speaker_heading: COMMAND VOICE
dialog: All right, proceed to the core.
dialog: You have twelve minutes until you
dialog: reach the time indicated.
scene_heading: INT. DIFFERENT TUNNEL
text: The two enter a long, BLUE-LIGHT TUNNEL. After a few steps,
text: Roy stops. Something's wrong:
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: Major? Are you all right?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: My pulse is getting a little more
dialog: rapid here.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: Mine is as well. We didn’t expect
dialog: to encounter that.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: The unit was perhaps agitated by
text: the recent quake--disoriented by
dialog: having to operate alone.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: No...Ma’am--that’s, that’s not it.
dialog: Situations of that nature don’t
dialog: present difficulties for me.
dialog: (checks his numbers)
dialog: And this is indicating that my
dialog: metabolic levels are increasing
text: only now, as we approach the core.
dialog: (beat; to himself)
dialog: I, I have to address this...
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: Should we wait to enter?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Perhaps you’re getting anxious
dialog: about what you’1ll find there--
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (interrupts)
dialog: No. We must enter the core.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR
text: They MOVE THROUGH the corridor to:
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND CHAMBER - THE CORE
text: A massive chamber. Roy and Francesca come ACROSS THE
text: ENORMOUS BASE of the REACTOR. A FLICKERING SERIES of
text: FLUORESCENT LIGHTS illuminate HALF the ROOM. It looks almost
text: lived-in, frozen in time. Like there should be half-drunk
text: cups of coffee on the consoles.
text: Francesca DeSanctis’s back is to ROY.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Is this it, Ma’am?
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: All right. Ma’am, I have to inform
dialog: you, I’ve got an operation I need
dialog: to conduct shortly, and it’s
dialog: classified. So...you’re not going
dialog: to be able to remain here.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I’m sorry.
text: She LIFTS THE HELMET OFF HER HEAD. We STARE FOR A BEAT at
text: the BACK OF HER HEAD. Then:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: Ma’am? Did you hear what I said?
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: Did it--ever seem possible that you
dialog: might find out something about
dialog: yourself? Something that might--
dialog: change you?
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: I don’t know exactly what you’re
dialog: referring to. As I said, I have
dialog: some objectives, and our
dialog: conversation has to be terminated
dialog: now.
text: FRANCESCA REACHES OVER, HITS a LARGE KEY on a console. A
text: RECTANGULAR MONITOR begins to PLAY IMAGES WE'VE SEEN, of the
text: boy and girl at THE CLOISTERS!
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: It always felt like we were
dialog: destined to meet again. Like it
dialog: was fate.
text: THIS TIME, we SEE the ENTIRE SET OF IMAGES. A LARGE FAMILY,
text: at THE CLOISTERS. THE YOUNG BOY is DRAWING for a somewhat
text: older GIRL. A SMALL PICNIC, or PARTY... AND the GIRL MOVES
dialog: to SIT ON...
text: H. CLIFFORD McBRIDE'S LAP. The BOY HANDS A DRAWING TO THE
speaker_heading: GIRL.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s the only time I saw you, the
dialog: only time I was on earth. But--I
dialog: feel as though I know you so well.
dialog: Your father photographed you a lot
dialog: as a child. And I still look at
dialog: the pictures and the videos all the
dialog: time. So...I feel very connected
dialog: to you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I wish you knew about me.
text: ROY IS FLUSTERED. FOR THE FIRST TIME in our STORY, HE IS
scene_heading: TRULY THROWN.
dialog: 79.
text: The RADIO begins to SOUND in ROY’S HEAD:
speaker_heading: COMMAND RADIO
dialog: Major, we are registering her non-
dialog: compliance. We are within ten
text: meters, ready to engage.
text: She TURNS TOWARD HIM and US, HOLDING a BLACK FOLDER in HER
text: HANDS. She takes a step toward him. He reaches down, toward
text: his PULSE WEAPON.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: Your father was so lonely in his
dialog: travels. He had another life here,
text: on Mars. Another family.
text: She smiles to him, gently--a genuine though somehow
text: melancholy smile.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT’D)
dialog: He is my father, too.
text: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS then PUSHES THE BLACK FOLDER toward ROY.
text: She FLIPS IT OPEN.
text: IT IS THE DRAWING THAT THE BOY GAVE THE GIRL in the VIDEO.
dialog: 
text: ROY LOOKS AT THE DRAWING. It’s incontrovertible. HE
scene_heading: REALIZES. It’s TRUE.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT’D)
dialog: He wanted me to reach out to you.
dialog: I was afraid you couldn’t be
dialog: trusted at first. But then I lost
dialog: touch with him and when I saw you,
dialog: I knew it was the right thing to
dialog: do.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I called for you, Roy. The
dialog: messages were from me.
text: HE APPROACHES the SCREEN. NOW IT IS FOOTAGE OF ROY through
text: the YEARS, beyond the IMAGES we’ve seen. HIM AS A TODDLER,
text: AS A TEEN, AS A CADET. FRANCESCA is NOW BEHIND HIM AGAIN.
speaker_heading: COMMAND RADIO
dialog: Major, we are ready to intercede.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: What...is it you want from me...?
text: HIS EYES BEGIN TO WATER. YES, WE ARE SEEING TEARS BEGIN TO
dialog: FORM IN HIS EYES!
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: He needs our help.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (for himself)
dialog: Dr. McBride...abandoned me...
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: Your father went to Neptune to try
dialog: and save us.
text: Now Francesca, emotional as well, her back to us again:
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT’D)
dialog: The mission went too far from the
dialog: Earth, and many in the crew went
dialog: insane...
dialog: (over her shoulder, to
dialog: Roy)
dialog: You’ve seen for yourself how hard
dialog: it becomes when the Earth is no
dialog: longer visible. When they
dialog: attempted their sabotage, he did
dialog: what he had to do to continue on.
dialog: (eyes back down to the
dialog: floor)
dialog: He is a truly great man. He told
dialog: me they found antimatter, that he
dialog: wanted to make it all anew. But
text: he’s gone silent now. All his
dialog: findings have stopped being sent to
dialog: Earth. I am concerned--I worry for
dialog: him so much...
dialog: (she turns to Roy)
dialog: He needs our help. I can locate
dialog: him. I will give that to you.
text: Roy STARES AT HER for a MOMENT. Lost, almost as if he’s
dialog: short circuited:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: I have...my own...directives.
text: She approaches him:
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: We're his family. He had no way
dialog: back, but maybe you will.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Please. He needs our help! He
dialog: cared about you, he did. HE LOVED
dialog: YOU, all this time. I know he did--
dialog: 81.
text: HE IS SHAKING. A BEEPING BEGINS; it’s his VITALS, on his
text: SLEEVE. THEY'RE OUT OF CONTROL!
text: She touches his arm with tenderness.
speaker_heading: ALL OF A SUDDEN:
text: The DUCTS SLIDE OPEN. STEPPING IN: TANNER and YOSHIDA, in
text: their suits. POINTING WEAPONS RIGHT AT HER. The THREAT is
text: clear. FRANCESCA is startled. To her:
speaker_heading: ALAN TANNER
dialog: Down! On your knees! Right now!
text: Roy begins to approach Francesca. The others intervene. A
text: CHAOS BUILDS. AS TANNER PULLS OUT a STRANGE CORD:
speaker_heading: ALAN TANNER (CONT’D)
dialog: We'll handle the interrogation from
dialog: this point forward, Major.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: She--she may well have information
dialog: only I can access here!
speaker_heading: ALAN TANNER
dialog: Major, you are currently under no
dialog: condition to continue this
dialog: interview.
speaker_heading: ROY MCRIDE
dialog: That’s incorrect. It’s imperative
dialog: that you interrogate her with me
dialog: present-—
text: AS TANNER ATTACHES IT TO HER:
speaker_heading: ALAN TANNER
dialog: Orders are now that you are to
dialog: retrieve all relevant data and
text: return to the Cepheus. There is a
dialog: shuttle waiting for you. She’1l be
dialog: processed appropriately.
text: TANNER PULLS HER AWAY. SHE IS YANKED OUT OF THE SPACE, and
text: as she IS, SHE STARES AT ROY as the two EXIT. Yoshida
text: remains, with Roy.
text: Roy MOVES to the CONSOLE, where his FAMILY HISTORY CONTINUES
text: TO PLAY OUT IN FRONT OF HIM:
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
dialog: Major, we have to proceed now.
dialog: 82.
text: Roy does not move. LIKE A SHORT CIRCUIT.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN YOSHIDA (CONT’D)
dialog: Major.
dialog: (beat)
speaker_heading: MAJOR.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: YOUR ORDERS ARE TO RETRIEVE THE

speaker_heading: CEPHEUS.
text: YOSHIDA DEPARTS. ROY MOVES TO THE CONSOLE and BEGINS TO
text: REMOVE THE DATA CARD FROM THE BOARD, UNSCREWING THE CARDS.
text: THE IMAGES OF HIM DISAPPEAR FROM THE SCREEN as he TAKES ALL
text: THE INTEL HE CAN.
scene_heading: EXT. MARS SURFACE - LATER
text: ROY EMERGES, boards the automated, driverless GPS-guided
text: ROVER THAT IS WAITING FOR HIM.
scene_heading: INT. SPACE ELEVATOR
text: CLOSE ON ROY...in the silent elevator car as it lifts up,
dialog: away from Mars.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. DOCKING PLATFORM
text: Roy ENTERS/FLOATS INTO the DECK, returning from the elevator.
text: Roy retreats inward at the sight of Colonel Lipset:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (distant)
text: The tasks are completed.
dialog: Everything from the core’s system's
dialog: been obtained...
speaker_heading: COLONEL LIPSET
dialog: I’m sorry, Roy. SPACECOM and I
dialog: felt it necessary to contact your
dialog: associates from your trip to Mars.
dialog: Your behavior with them did cause
dialog: concern. We have fully briefed
dialog: them now.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Concern...?
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: ALAN TANNER
dialog: You sent data into space. You also
dialog: neglected to take your sedative
dialog: capsule, and you protested the
text: response to a standard mayday call.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: You know why I resisted now...
text: A WARNING LIGHT GOES OFF on the console.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
dialog: I'd recommend a sedative for you,
dialog: Major.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: NO. My metabolics will return to
dialog: normal in just a moment. The
dialog: environment on Mars was high-
dialog: stress, and it was a standard
dialog: reaction. I just need to do this--
text: Roy ATTACHES the DATA BOX to the Cepheus. DATA BEGINS TO
text: FLOW from it into the craft’s computer.
text: Yoshida tries to hand Roy a pill and a cup of water.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
dialog: Major--
speaker_heading: COLONEL LIPSET
dialog: Major, take the sedative--
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
text: I HAVE TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW. THIS
text: IS MY TASK.
text: Roy PUSHES THEM AWAY. Alan Tanner looks to Donald Scobee.
text: Scobee moves to speak into the console as the Cepheus
text: DECOUPLES FROM the elevator’s docking platform:
speaker_heading: DONALD SCOBEE
dialog: SpaceCom, we are ready to proceed.
text: ANGLE ON ROY as he is turned inward. No eye contact with the
text: rest of the crew.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
dialog: Major, I’m going to have to insist.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (to Colonel Lipset)
dialog: What--was the result of your
dialog: interrogation of Ms. DeSanctis?
text: The men have no reaction at first.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: Did you gain any further
dialog: information from her?
text: Then, without a word, LIPSET REACHES OVER and PRESSES a
text: BUTTON ON the CRAFT’S CONSOLE MONITOR. He types in
text: something, and on comes a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA IMAGE:
text: THE SURVEILLANCE IMAGE is of Francesca DeSanctis, seated, in
text: what looks like a small white room with a dropped ceiling and
text: fluorescent light. We hear some MURMURING, which is
text: UNINTELLIGIBLE from her, and from the others who surround
dialog: her.
text: ROY WATCHES, IN TURMOIL.
dialog: The MEN who surround her are our team: Lipset, Tanner,
text: Scobee, Yoshida. They are at moments on, and offscreen,
text: their backs to us. They appear to be interrogating her. We
scene_heading: HEAR SNIPPETS.
dialog: “What were you doing there...?"
dialog: “You are sitting there, without any..."
text: She isn’t looking at them. Entering the FRAME is LIPSET:
speaker_heading: COLONEL LIPSET
speaker_heading: LOOK AT US.
text: After a BEAT:
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: I won’t speak to you until Major
dialog: McBride is here. He needs to be
dialog: present.
speaker_heading: COLONEL LIPSET
dialog: Major McBride is not part of this
dialog: particular operation. So you're
dialog: going to need to respond to us--
dialog: right now, Ma’am.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: You don’t understand. I am not
dialog: your enemy. You’re talking to me
dialog: like I’m your enemy--and I am not.
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: COLONEL LIPSET
dialog: You are admitting that Clifford
dialog: McBride is your father, and you've
dialog: been in contact with him. That’s
dialog: correct, is it not?
text: She stares at Lipset.
speaker_heading: COLONEL LIPSET (CONT'D)
dialog: You're aware he is posing a
dialog: potentially catastrophic threat?
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: I need to see my brother. Major
dialog: McBride.
speaker_heading: COLONEL LIPSET
text: WHAT IS THE PRECISE LOCATION OF THE
speaker_heading: LIMA PROJECT?
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
dialog: I need to see my brother.
text: She STANDS UP. TANNER MOVES BEHIND HER with INCREDIBLE
dialog: SPEED. As this is happening--
text: LIPSET THROWS her BACK, to the CHAIR. VIOLENTLY. But she
text: still TRIES TO GET UP, so LIPSET SLAPS HER, HARD, ACROSS THE
speaker_heading: FACE.
text: She FLAILS. The MEN CHARGE AT HER, and TANNER PUTS her in a
text: CHOKEHOLD. Francesca starts to GASP. And SHAKE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT’D)
dialog: I--I need help--
speaker_heading: DONALD SCOBEE
dialog: If you want help, you’1l tell us--
text: Francesca SHAKES VIOLENTLY NOW. Is it a SEIZURE...?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
dialog: Hold it, hold on there--whoa--
text: SHE CRUMPLES TO THE GROUND, her body VIBRATING with
text: uncontrollable force. WEIRDLY QUIET, FAST...
text: TANNER PUTS HIS KNEE ON HER BACK. We HEAR the men through
scene_heading: MUFFLED SOUND:
scene_heading: THE IMAGE ENDS. BACK TO:
dialog: 86.
scene_heading: INT. THE CEPHEUS - COCKPIT
text: Where the men are now ominously surrounding Roy. Tanner at
text: the controls, initiating STAGE-1 liftoff away from the dock:
speaker_heading: ALAN TANNER
dialog: .+-Booster looking good at 4
dialog: minutes. Level sense arm at 8 plus
text: 17; outboard cut-off at 9 plus
dialog: ll...
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (disturbed)
dialog: Where--where is she?
speaker_heading: COLONEL LIPSET
text: The subject is dead. She stopped
dialog: breathing and couldn’t be revived.
dialog: But we extracted the coordinates of
text: the Lima Project transmissions.
dialog: From the Mars reactor data. We
dialog: know where to go.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (interior)
dialog: You...killed her?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
dialog: It was likely some kind of
dialog: congenital disorder.
text: ROY’S RAGE is building.
speaker_heading: COLONEL LIPSET
dialog: Major, your contribution to this
text: mission has come to a close.
text: The ship’s STAGE-1 thrusters (minor, low-velocity) are
text: FIRING, powering the ship away from the Helios’s upper
text: station (the top of the space elevator).
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (reverts to form)
dialog: What’s--what’s important here
dialog: is...the mission.
speaker_heading: COLONEL LIPSET
dialog: We're appreciative of your
dialog: contributions.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: I_have followed orders and
dialog: accomplished my objective. I need
dialog: to brief SpaceCom.
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
dialog: SpaceCom’s already fully aware of
dialog: the situation. You failed your
dialog: last two psych-evals.
text: Roy stops himself. He sees them surrounding him. Scobee is
text: in front of a control panel.
text: The Cepheus has reached a safe radius, about a mile away...
text: So the STAGE-2, high-power rocket thrusters now have room to
text: fire safely. Tanner initiates Stage-2 procedure, a COUNTDOWN
text: begins.
text: The suspense intensifies, and it’s eerie, as everyone’s just
text: floating, suspended, waiting...
text: Roy's FACE GOES WHITE.
speaker_heading: COLONEL LIPSET
dialog: Major. We don't want to have to
dialog: eliminate you.
text: Yoshida moves towards Roy.
text: Yoshida continues forward, towards Roy--Roy’s eyes burn with
text: intensity. Tanner GRASPS his PULSE WEAPON.
text: It's clear they do want him DEAD. Scobee APPROACHES Roy,
text: too. Lipset stays back. Just as Scobee is near Roy--
text: Roy IGNITES his MMU's BOOT JETS, which blow Scobee back
text: against the opposite wall with such force that Scobee’s
text: KILLED instantly, and he CRUSHES AND KILLS Lipset--behind him-—
text: -as well by the force of his body.
text: The OTHERS MOVE TO ROY, who--PULLS DOWN on a THRUSTER on the
text: CONSOLE of the CRAFT.
text: The ENTIRE CRAFT BEGINS TO REVOLVE, MAKING A FULL REVOLUTION
dialog: every SECOND.
text: The CENTRIFUGAL FORCE PUSHES EVERYTHING to the SIDES of the
text: craft--all the CLIPBOARDS, FLIGHT PLANS, PENS, PROCEDURE
text: BOARDS, etc. STICK TO THE WALLS.
text: The MEN are all SHAKEN up. Completely DISORIENTED for a
dialog: moment.
text: Tanner is shaken loose and hit hard, but he’s only stunned.
text: By this point, Yoshida ATTACKS Roy with vicious BLOWS.
text: Roy LURCHES TOWARD the WALL of the CAPSULE; HE PULLS a small,
text: metal CANNISTER that is strapped to the wall near him.
dialog: 88.
text: He swings the cannister at Yoshida and connects with
text: Yoshida’s skull. Yoshida tumbles away.
text: Now, it's just Roy and Tanner. Roy is bleeding. Tanner is
text: holding a PULSE WEAPON. All Roy has is the cannister. But
text: with the CRAFT SPINNING, it’s virtually impossible to AIM.
text: Tanner pulls the trigger--the weapon BLASTS.
text: Roy manages to twist out of the way of what was bad aim due
text: to the spinning. The BLAST barely misses him.
text: ROY GRABS a PEN from the SIDE OF THE CRAFT.
text: He STABS YOSHIDA in the NECK. YOSHIDA’S BLOOD BLOOMS. This
text: FORMS GLOBULES of BLOOD in the WEIGHTLESSNESS!
text: Roy uses the moment to EVADE Tanner. Utilizing the
text: NETTING/WIRING along the side of the ship, Roy scrambles
dialog: away.
text: The SUNLIGHT COMES THROUGH the WINDOWS FLASHES AS FAST AS A
text: STROBE LIGHT...
scene_heading: INT. THE CEPHEUS - ANOTHER AREA - CONTINUOUS
text: Roy moves around a CORNER, disappearing into a DARKER area of
dialog: the ship...
scene_heading: INT. THE CEPHEUS - COCKPIT -—
text: Tanner PULLS the REENTRY LEVER over his head. The CRAFT
text: STOPS SPINNING. HE wraps YOSHIDA’S WOUND with a TOWEL, to
text: stop the blood. He TURNS BACK AROUND to FOLLOW/KILL ROY.
scene_heading: INT. THE CEPHEUS - ANOTHER AREA - CONTINUOUS
text: Tanner pursues Roy.
text: Tanner presses a BUTTON to OPEN the fairing door, and leans
dialog: into that section, when...
text: Suddenly, Roy emerges from the tangle of WIRES AND OTHER
text: MATERIAL against the wall where he’d been hiding, and SHOVES
text: Tanner deep into the fairing section.
text: And Roy presses the button to CLOSE the fairing section
text: door. He’s trapped Tanner in this part of the ship.
dialog: 89.
text: The Stage-2 COUNTDOWN approaches liftoff, and Roy hurries to
text: the safety of a harness just in time. He holds onto the
text: harness as the Cepheus EXPLODES FORWARD.
text: As the STAGING occurs, and the INTER-STAGE FAIRING SECTION
text: and ROCKET ENGINE beneath it can be seen through the window
text: below Roy, falling away into the void.
dialog: NOTE: The physical environment in the ship is now especially
text: CHAOTIC and MESSY: Wiring, equipment, debris, balls of blood
dialog: and sweat... all criss-crossing this way and that in the zero-
dialog: g.--
scene_heading: INT. THE CEPHEUS - COCKPIT
text: Roy moves into the cockpit.
text: He check’s Yoshida’s pulse. Nothing. Yoshida is now DEAD.
text: Roy eyes the floating CORPSES of former crewmates Scobee and
dialog: Yoshida.
scene_heading: INT. THE CEPHEUS - AIRLOCK
text: Roy prepares the two bodies with none of the ceremony or
text: religion that were afforded to Blunt. He leaves them in the
text: airlock and steps out, back into--
scene_heading: INT. THE CEPHEUS - OUTSIDE AIRLOCK
text: He presses a button to open the airlock to the void.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - THE CEPHEUS
text: THE SHIP RELEASES THE TWO BODIES as the Cepheus speeds
dialog: away...
scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT
text: Roy grabs a fresh helmet and moves into the cockpit. A man
text: ALONE. He PAUSES FOR A MOMENT; his HANDS are BLOTCHY and
text: BLEEDING...
scene_heading: ROCKET COMPUTER VOICE
dialog: Significant damage to rocket
dialog: staging capability... Reentry
speaker_heading: protection in section THREE
text: DESTROYED...
dialog: 90.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CEPHEUS - SPACE
text: The spaceship is moving at such a terrific velocity that
text: there’s PERCEPTIBLE MOVEMENT in the surrounding field of
text: stars: APPROACHING STARS appear blue, RECEDING STARS become
dialog: amber. (This is the “red shift” effect.)
scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT
text: Roy is seated at the fore of the ship. He’s still BLEEDING
text: PROFUSELY. He goes through a MEDICAL KIT, applies GELS to
text: his wound. He’s trying to stem the seeping tide of blood.
text: He is ghostly and alone in the ship’s DARKNESS. And outside
text: of the ship’s darkness: INFINITE PITCH BLACK.
text: But... finally... a slight GLOW appears from the COCKPIT
speaker_heading: MONITOR...
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Destination, Neptune Moon Galatea
dialog: coordinates.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER VOICE
dialog: Length of journey: 19 days, 4
dialog: hours, 8 minutes. Sedation is
dialog: advised.
text: Roy HOOKS HIMSELF UP to a FEED TUBE, into his arm. He
text: BUCKLES HIMSELF IN, and straps start sending ELECTRICAL
text: PULSES to his body, to keep his muscles in some sort of tone.
text: Roy SETTLES IN, and the ROCKETS ALIGHT... He is on his
dialog: way...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE
text: The craft PASSES an UNMANNED SPACE PROBE...
text: A distant ASTEROID FIELD... JUPITER, distant...
scene_heading: INT. CEPHEUS
text: Roy examines the view outside his window. He grows AGITATED.
text: ALL OF A SUDDEN, BLOOD STARTS POURING INTO THE CRAFT, from
dialog: EVERY WALL!
text: It FILLS THE CAPSULE!
dialog: 91.
text: YOSHIDA and SCOBEE are BACK, INSIDE. They ARE ASSAULTING
speaker_heading: ROY!
text: THE CAPSULE BEGINS SPINNING AGAIN!
dialog: WHAT IS HAPPENING?
dialog: And then--
text: THROUGH THE SPINNING--he REACHES over to the console and
text: injects something into his arm.
text: Within moments, the craft is no longer spinning. THE
text: ASTRONAUTS ARE GONE.
text: HE WAS HALLUCINATING...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - SATURN - LATER
text: The giant gas planet SATURN looms magnificently against the
text: black backdrop. Its RINGS look like thin ribbons encircling
dialog: the planet. So perfect is this gas giant, so symmetrical and
text: flawless in its geometry... it almost looks UNREAL.
text: We TILT DOWN to SEE the Cepheus PASS US BY.
scene_heading: INT. CEPHEUS
text: Roy’s EYES ARE HALF-MAST. His P.O.V.: A WATERY surface over
text: his eyes causes a slight oblong, double-vision VIEW of the
scene_heading: CAPSULE CONSOLE.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER VOICE
text: Now passing final unmanned outpost,
dialog: Trojan QF99. Conserve oxygen and
dialog: food supply if possible--
text: ROY CLOSES HIS EYES.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - URANUS
text: The planet, in the distance. Roy’s spacecraft passes it...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 92.
scene_heading: INT. CEPHEUS
text: SOUNDS. It’s a 1930’s RADIO SHOW that somehow his craft has
text: picked up. ROY’S EYES OPEN.
scene_heading: A STRANGE and NATURAL and UNEXPLAINED SPACE PHENOMENON
speaker_heading: OCCURS.
text: What looks like FIREFLIES FLOWS through the CAPSULE. It’s
text: HALLUCINATORY and ROY SEES THEM through SEDATED EYES.
text: He REACHES UP to TOUCH THEM; the SPARKS SEEM TO FLOAT RIGHT
text: THROUGH his HANDS. (These unexplained phenomena do exist.)
text: His BODY BEGINS TO LIFT UP, OUT OF THE SEAT. He STAYS in
text: PLACE because of the seatbelts.
text: His BREATHING BECOMES HEAVIER. Close to some kind of panic.
text: Roy starts to HYPERVENTILATE, STRUGGLING. He INJECTS
dialog: something into his arm. As we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - NEPTUNE
scene_heading: The BLUE PLANET. STILL. EERIE.
scene_heading: INT. CEPHEUS
speaker_heading: A CHIME:
speaker_heading: COMPUTER VOICE
dialog: Task Load Index completed.
text: ROY UNBUCKLES HIMSELF.
text: MOVES back to the PILOT’S SEAT.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - NEAR NEPTUNE
text: Now: Roy’s spaceship, the Cepheus, comes into view, its RETRO-
text: THRUSTERS firing on full blast (in utter silence) to slow its
dialog: velocity.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: More prominently now, THE RINGS OF NEPTUNE.
speaker_heading: CLOSER ANGLE
dialog: 93.
text: On one of the OUTER RINGS. The Cepheus is tiny against the
text: magnificent vista.
scene_heading: INT. CEPHEUS
text: Roy PILOTS the CRAFT as it nears the EDGE of the rings, and
text: keeps pace with the speed of the rings’ orbit.
text: Roy LOOKS DOWN at the CONSOLE. BLINKING:
scene_heading: “CRAFT OXYGEN LEVEL: 12 PERCENT”
text: He LOOKS OUT HIS WINDOW and is momentarily energized by
text: Neptune’s BLUE GLOW. The rings are more visible now. They
text: are magnificent, comprised of various-sized ROCKS of dirt and
text: ice that circle around us, almost like cars on a racetrack.
text: Roy looks at the control panels, the monitors.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Locate signal source.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER VOICE
dialog: The source is [scientifically
dialog: correct location, tbd].
text: He PULLS a LARGE SWITCH.
text: The cockpit board flashes: “AUTOPILOT ENGAGED”.
text: ROY PUNCHES THE GALATEA COORDINATES into his SPACESUIT
speaker_heading: SLEEVE.
text: A BLINKING RED LIGHT on the CONSOLE.
text: He REACHES OVER, TOGGLES THE SWITCH:
scene_heading: EXT. THE CEPHEUS —- CONTINUOUS
text: Roy EMERGES from the craft, in his suit. He REMAINS TETHERED
dialog: 
text: TO THE CRAFT. The CRAFT, moving along with the orbiting
text: rings of detritus, begins to move closer to the rings...
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: CLOSER TO THE RINGS
text: He maneuvers his way BEHIND THE COCKPIT SECTION of the craft,
text: so he is protected FROM the DETRITUS of NEPTUNE’S RINGS by
text: the CRAFT’S BODY ITSELF.
text: He REMOVES a SMALL SOLAR PANEL--ABOUT FIVE FEET IN LENGTH,
text: and about THREE FEET IN WIDTH--from the SIDE OF THE CEPHEUS.
dialog: 94,
text: He CLIMBS to the ROTATING ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY WHEEL.
text: He GRABS ONTO ONE OF THE SPINNING WINDMILL-LIKE BLADES.
text: HE UNHOOKS HIS TETHER.
text: HE HOLDS ON.
scene_heading: SPINNING AND SPINNING. DIZZYING.
text: HE LOOKS AT HIS SLEEVE. A COMPASS NUMBER KEEPS SCANNING
text: different DIRECTIONAL COORDINATES.
scene_heading: AND THEN--at JUST THE RIGHT MOMENT-~
dialog: 
text: HE LETS GO.
text: HE IS PROPELLED THROUGH SPACE, without his TETHER.
scene_heading: EXT. THROUGH THE RINGS
text: He enters the rings. Miniscule particles begin to hit the
text: SOLAR PANEL that ROY USES AS HIS SHIELD.
text: Some come insanely close to ROY, to his HEAD, to puncturing
dialog: his SUIT.
text: The SOLAR PANEL is GETTING NICKED and DAMAGED by the
text: PARTICULATE, but it protects Roy.
scene_heading: EXT. CLOUDS OF NEPTUNE
text: He TUMBLES FURTHER, now ENTERING THE CLOUDS OF NEPTUNE.
text: The CLOUDS are DENSE, like bad CLOUD COVER during an airplane
scene_heading: flight. EXCEPT--THEY ARE A RICH, INTENSE BLUE.
text: As Roy TUMBLES, the SHADE OF THE CLOUDS goes from that BLUE
text: to a BEAUTIFUL and BEYOND-THIS-EARTH PINK, then to a DEEP
speaker_heading: MAGENTA.
text: AND THEN IT BEGINS TO APPEAR, EVER SO FAINTLY.
text: A SPACECRAFT.
text: It is TETHERED to the slowly ROTATING MOON CALLED GALATEA
text: which orbits NEPTUNE inside Neptune’s atmosphere.
text: It is THE LIMA PROJECT.
text: CLOSER AND CLOSER it comes to us. ROY SEEMS SPINNING TOWARD
text: IT, OUT OF CONTROL.
dialog: 95.
text: And then he THROWS the THRUSTER in his PACK. His tumbling
text: GRADUALLY GETS UNDER CONTROL.
text: He STOPS. OUTSIDE THE LIMA PROJECT STATION. IN the
scene_heading: DISTANCE: a SYMMETRICAL SERIES of SCANNING MIRROR TELESCOPES.
text: In a LATTICE.
text: NEW ANGLE OF ROY - behind him, in the deep distance, is
text: Earth, a tiny pinprick of light 900 million miles away. (See
text: recent Cassini photograph.) Then, CUT TO WHAT HE SEES:
text: Hovering over the station, still far away from Roy, are:
dialog: 
text: ASTRONAUTS. Appearing as figures on the dark blue horizon,
text: levitating over NEPTUNE.
text: THE LINE OF ASTRONAUTS FLOATS, STILL.
text: ROY PUSHES a BUTTON on his WRIST. We HEAR STATIC.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: LIMA PROJECT. This is Major Roy
dialog: McBride. I have taken control of
dialog: the Cepheus, United States Armed
dialog: Forces Space Division. I am
dialog: attempting to reach Dr. Clifford
dialog: McBride. Over.
dialog: Static. No movement.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: Repeat: Lima Project, this is the
dialog: Cepheus, of the United States Armed
dialog: Forces Space Division. I am
text: attempting to reach Dr. McBride.
dialog: Do you read.
speaker_heading: NO RESPONSE.
text: ROY TURNS his RIGHT WRIST OVER.
scene_heading: “MMU OXYGEN LEVEL: 21 PERCENT”
scene_heading: “THRUST LEVEL: 39 PERCENT”
text: HE MOVES toward the SURFACE of the LIMA PROJECT STATION. As_
text: HE DOES, he LOOKS to his RIGHT to SEE, maybe a mile away
dialog: (hard to tell relative direction here), the very BEGINNINGS
text: of a graphene arc.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 96.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. LIMA PROJECT STATION
text: Roy “floats” inside. The Craft/Station has a kind of LARGE A-
speaker_heading: FRAME.
text: Roy VENTURES through the CENTER of the STATION.
text: HUGE SPACES filled with SELF-REPLICATORS that do not resemble
dialog: anything anthropormorphic, but rather look like the kind of
text: machines which make AUTOMOBILES. WE HEAR Roy’s BREATHING.
text: ROY’S P.O.V. - The robots are in repose, ready to be
text: awakened. WE CONTINUE TO HEAR Roy’s BREATHING...
text: He passes the anthropoid robots, and enters another, even
dialog: larger, area.
text: ROY’S P.O.V. - A flurry of automated activity, as we pass
text: EVERY SPECIES OF ROBOT, from giant vehicles to small, squat
text: machines, gliding to and fro. Some are fitted with grabs and
text: manipulators and cutting/welding equipment.
text: Again, no sign of humans. The robots move slowly, with
text: secret purpose, WARNING LIGHTS whirling for the benefit of
text: the unseen humans.
scene_heading: INT. INNER SANCTUM
text: ROY now ventures to SEE, on both sides:
text: WINDOWS, through which we can spot the INTERIOR of the LIMA
speaker_heading: PROJECT.
text: As Roy makes some final adjustments to his equipment, we
text: notice one of the very small robots on the side of the A-
text: Frame. A CAMERA mounted on it silently ROTATES towards Roy,
text: and a RED LIGHT blinks on next to the camera. It knows Roy
text: is here. Roy LOOKS RIGHT INTO IT:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: I am Major Roy McBride. Do you
dialog: read. I am attempting to reach Dr.
dialog: McBride.
text: AGAIN, no ANSWER. ROY PLACES EXPLOSIVE CHARGES on the
text: DOORFRAME of the LIMA STATION.
text: They BLOW.
text: Just then, an APERTURE on the station opens up. ROY VENTURES
text: INSIDE. LIKE HE IS ENTERING A DREAM.
dialog: 97.
scene_heading: INT. LIMA PROJECT —- DORMITORIES
text: HUMAN BODIES are FLOATING, gravity-free. The FLUORESCENT
scene_heading: LIGHTS FLICKER.
text: We STILL HEAR ONLY ROY’S BREATHING. LOUD, PRESENT. We ARE
text: COMPLETELY INSIDE HIS HEAD.
text: Roy finds himself inside a KITCHEN-TYPE area, which is housed
text: somewhere within a laboratory. There are machines and
text: equipment and tables and sinks, but no people besides Roy.
text: There’s ZERO GRAVITY here.
scene_heading: ROY'S POINT-OF-VIEW:
text: A DOOR IS OPEN, revealing a dark PASSAGEWAY lit only by BLUE
speaker_heading: LIGHT.
scene_heading: INT. PASSAGEWAY
text: Roy enters/floats into it. ALL OF A SUDDEN, ALL THE MONITORS
text: on each side--and there are several--switch on. THE LIGHTS
scene_heading: BRIGHTEN. ON THE SCREENS: ROY’S FATHER! DR. H. CLIFFORD
scene_heading: MCBRIDE. Roy HALTS:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE
dialog: This will be the final message
dialog: recorded by the Lima Project. Our
dialog: efforts have come to an end, and
dialog: its entire story must be told in
dialog: the hopes that someday it will be
dialog: known.
text: ROY MOVES CLOSER TO THE SCREEN. It is his FATHER, virtually
text: seeming to speak from the dead:
speaker_heading: H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: We came here to pursue mankind’s
dialog: most noble goal: the search for
dialog: intelligent life beyond the Earth.
dialog: But our telescope has repeatedly
dialog: confirmed only the singular
dialog: importance--and ephemerality--of
dialog: our moon, oceans, and magnetic
dialog: field. After extensive analysis,
dialog: we now confirm that we are entirely
text: alone in the reachable universe.
dialog: We shall no longer honor false
dialog: gods; there is no intelligent life
dialog: elsewhere, and the rage of the
dialog: cosmos will destroy us in time.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: For this reason, we on the Lima
dialog: Project had begun to devise a plan
dialog: for a new system--with galaxies,
dialog: stars, and planets. We dreamed to
dialog: be the first lifeform to make the
dialog: universe anew.
text: CLOSE ANGLE ON ROY MCBRIDE.
scene_heading: INT. NARROW STAIRWELL
text: Roy CLIMBS the STEPS. We STILL HEAR, CONTINUING:
speaker_heading: H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (V.O)
text: With the vast stores of antimatter
dialog: we have discovered here, our
dialog: research focused on the creation of
dialog: a new big bang. Such a project
dialog: would take perhaps several thousand
dialog: years to develop. But only such a
dialog: bold, long-term endeavor would
dialog: untether us from the earth and
dialog: ensure the permanent survival of
dialog: our species.
scene_heading: INT. CONTROL CENTER - STATION
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Roy FLOATS TOWARD the Control Center. Like the Control Tower
text: of a large airport, it’s somewhat dark--but everything is ON.
text: Multiple MONITORS, SCREENS, GAUGES, etc., all like a symphony
text: of blinking, fluttering color and light.
speaker_heading: H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (V.O)
dialog: Our research is contained on the
text: onboard VD recorder. It is the
dialog: most extensive set of data ever
dialog: assembled about the visible
dialog: universe. This must be brought
dialog: back to Earth so that our
dialog: scientists can be convinced to act.
dialog: However, our computer system is
dialog: currently preventing all outside
dialog: communication. As it is charged
dialog: only with the continued pursuit of
dialog: intelligent life, it has been
dialog: unable to adapt to our changed
dialog: prerogatives. All attempts to
text: reprogram it have failed. With no
dialog: alternatives, we sought to return
dialog: to the Earth.
dialog: 99.
text: Roy looks around at the many screens in front of him; they
text: are like SECURITY CAMERAS, constantly cutting from one angle
text: to another. ONE ANGLE REVEALS:
scene_heading: A SPACECRAFT, with a GANTRY. MODEST SIZE. CLOSE SHOT ON
scene_heading: ROY. THEN CLOSE SHOT ON IMAGE OF SPACECRAFT. THEN:
scene_heading: ROY SCANS THROUGH BASIC BLUEPRINT PLANS of the LIMA PROJECT’s
speaker_heading: CRAFT.
scene_heading: INT. DATABANKS —- LIMA PROJECT
text: It is ROWS of DATA, stored. A CLOUD for all the information
dialog: collected by the Project.
text: Roy FLOATS THROUGH IT, approaching TWO LARGE ORANGE STEEL
text: CANNISTERS: “VOYAGE DATA RECORDER” He PULLS THEM OUT FROM
text: THE FRAME. Over this, we STILL HEAR:
speaker_heading: H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: A craft was assembled from 3-D-
dialog: printed parts, piece by piece, out
text: of view of the onboard system. But
dialog: it was recognized upon completion,
dialog: and our nuclear fuel has been
dialog: intentionally destroyed by the
dialog: system. This resulted in the
dialog: catastrophic destruction of moon
dialog: Larissa. All of us have suffered
dialog: severe radiation poisoning. Brain
text: death is imminent. The onboard
dialog: system will likely maintain only
dialog: our organ function in order for it
dialog: to remain operational.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT: “DR. CLIFF MCBRIDE”. A PAPER TAB, HANDWRITTEN.
text: On the DOOR of his LIVING QUARTERS.
text: Roy FLOATS INTO/ENTERS the LIVING QUARTERS.
speaker_heading: H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (V.O.)
dialog: We hope we will be mourned by a
dialog: Mother Earth that dared send so
dialog: many of her sons and daughters into
dialog: the unknown. In ancient days,
dialog: human beings looked at stars and
dialog: saw their heroes in the
dialog: constellations. In modern times,
dialog: our heroes have become creatures of
text: flesh and blood.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Others will follow us, and surely
dialog: find their way home. Our mission
dialog: must not be denied.
text: HE LOOKS AROUND. He SEES the SPACE. It is MODEST, with
text: SCIENCE BOOKS, and DIARIES, and FAMILY PHOTOS everywhere,
text: pinned on the WALLS. Then we HEAR Francesca’s VOICE, more
scene_heading: PRESENT than CLIFFORD McBRIDE’S had been:
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA’S VOICE
dialog: “The brain is wider than the sky,
dialog: for, put them side by side, the
dialog: other will include, with ease, and
dialog: you beside...”
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It’s so beautiful... Do you want
dialog: to hear another one...?
scene_heading: Then, APPEARING: FRANCESCA! SEATED, SOMEHOW STILL OBEYING
text: GRAVITY as ROY FLOATS! She STARES, saying nothing.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Roy doesn’t know what to do, or say. He STOPS HIS MOVEMENT.
text: He lifts his ARM toward her...
text: She GETS UP, begins to WALK TOWARD ROY! !
dialog: 
dialog: NEAR HIM NOW, HE REACHES OUT, and...
text: HIS HAND AND ARM GO RIGHT THROUGH HER!!!! SHE WALKS RIGHT
text: THROUGH HIM, sits down at the other end.
text: Roy LOOKS AROUND THE SPACE and SEES NOW that it’s like his
text: home where he grew up, his home from pictures. PROJECTED.
text: IT’S ALL HOLOGRAMS.
text: He SEES: HIMSELF, as a CHILD, on the FLOOR, PLAYING WITH
text: TRUCKS. And his MOTHER, LEANNE, YOUNGER. His HAND can go
text: right through them, too.
text: (As ROY FLOATS, these HOLOGRAMS remain “earthbound”; that is,
dialog: they seem to have “gravity”.)
text: Roy TURNS BACK to LOOK AT FRANCESCA. She is in conversation
text: with someone “offscreen,” smiling, looking lovely and warm
text: and everything an idealized version of her would be.
text: CLOSE ANGLE ON ROY.
text: We HEAR the PITTER-PATTER of RAIN. RAIN? ALL OTHER SOUND
dialog: DROPS OUT. And we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 101.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK - THE CLOISTERS - RAINY DAY
text: A lowered gray sky. Deserted. A monastery on the UPPER WEST
scene_heading: SIDE of NEW YORK’S MANHATTAN ISLAND. A PORTCULLIS.
text: COBBLESTONES. The VIDEO we saw, yes, but now we are “here,”
text: in the space.
text: A GROUP of children PLAY. ADULTS speak to each other,
text: standing behind the children, watching them play, making
text: small talk. The scene has a strange, dare we say, unearthly
text: quality to it. There is a distance to it; not an emotional
text: distance, but a visual distance. A haze, almost. A
dialog: dreamlike quality.
text: A SMALLER GROUP of adults, and two children, are here, too.
text: They are nearby and yet somehow apart.
text: We SEE: ROY’S MOTHER, LEANNE. Much YOUNGER. She seems
text: PREOCCUPIED, though she smiles a lot as she attends to the
dialog: children. Also here is some other woman we don’t know, about
text: Leanne's age. She is completely quiet, almost nervous, as
text: she watches the children play.
text: Then there is H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE, who is involved with the
text: children, making hats for them, drawing for them, joking with
dialog: them.
text: AMONG THE CHILDREN: the young ROY. And the young FRANCESCA
text: (though she is older than Roy--she seems around 16 or 17, he
text: around 8). She has a grin from ear to ear; Roy does not,
text: instead dedicated to whatever he seems to be DRAWING.
text: H. Clifford McBride stops clowning with another child and
text: moves to Roy’s side. Warmly:
speaker_heading: H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE
dialog: Roy?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Roy?
dialog: (to Young Francesca)
dialog: He gets very involved in what he’s
dialog: doing.
speaker_heading: YOUNG FRANCESCA
dialog: (a laugh; a smile)
dialog: It’s okay.
speaker_heading: H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE
dialog: Sweetheart, I need you to listen to
dialog: me for just a moment--you can go
dialog: back to your drawing very soon.
text: Roy finally looks up--for just a brief beat.
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: This is Francesca.
speaker_heading: YOUNG FRANCESCA
dialog: (ebullient)
dialog: Hello!
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (back to his drawing)
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE
dialog: She’s someone...very close to me,
dialog: someone I really care for. I want
dialog: you to meet her--I think you'll
dialog: really like her.
text: Roy keeps drawing--AND THEN TURNS HIS BACK TO HER A BIT.
speaker_heading: H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s not so easy for Roy to meet
dialog: new people. It’s something we’re
text: trying to work on with him.
dialog: (quieter)
dialog: We’re hoping he’1ll break through it
dialog: someday...
text: Clifford approaches Roy. Not unsympathetically, he touches
text: his son and attempts to communicate an important lesson about
dialog: human interaction:
speaker_heading: H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: (to Roy)
dialog: When someone talks to you, you say
dialog: hello, you look them in the eye.
dialog: You listen, and you ask how they
dialog: are--you don’t want them to think
dialog: you don’t care about them.
text: Roy REACTS IMMEDIATELY. He starts to get teary out of
text: embarrassment and awkwardness. Sensing this, she moves to
dialog: comfort him:
speaker_heading: YOUNG FRANCESCA
dialog: It’s okay, you can go back to your
dialog: drawing. He just wanted us to
dialog: meet.
text: Roy then eyes her directly, and without a word. She looks at
dialog: his drawing. Warmly:
speaker_heading: YOUNG FRANCESCA (CONT’D)
dialog: That's a wonderful picture. Is
dialog: that a rocket?
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (nods; then)
dialog: My father goes into space.
speaker_heading: YOUNG FRANCESCA
dialog: That’s where I’m from.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: (looks up, interested now)
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: YOUNG FRANCESCA
dialog: I’m from Mars. Which is really,
dialog: really far.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Yeah. Sometimes it’s more than 140
text: million miles away. But right now
dialog: it’s only 80 million miles.
speaker_heading: YOUNG FRANCESCA
dialog: (again with a laugh)
dialog: I didn’t know that!
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: Are you by yourself there?
speaker_heading: YOUNG FRANCESCA
dialog: No, but it feels like that
dialog: sometimes. That’s why I’m so glad
dialog: I met you.
text: UNEXPECTEDLY, responding to her kindness to such a degree he
text: can overcome his shyness, he hands his drawing to her.
text: Francesca looks at the drawing and she is very moved. TEARS
text: OF HAPPINESS come to her eyes. Roy STARES at the tears as
text: though they are foreign objects. The SWELL OF EMOTION from
text: her is as strange as anything he has seen.
speaker_heading: YOUNG FRANCESCA (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh--thank you so much! That’s so
dialog: sweet of you! It’s beautiful!
text: She gives him a BIG, TENDER HUG. Roy ALLOWS HIMSELF to be
text: “crushed” by the hug.
text: Roy's FATHER BEAMS...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 104.
scene_heading: INT. HULL OF CRAFT - CORNER OF MCBRIDE RESIDENTIAL QUARTERS
text: A chamber that appears almost like an old “Iron Lung”
text: machine. Roy APPROACHES IT.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT: “MCBRIDE, CLIFFORD, 788919-0323”
text: It’s a small, illuminated medical identification card. WIDEN
scene_heading: TO REVEAL:
text: ROY, COMING UPON his FATHER’S BODY, inside what looks like a
text: kind of ELECTRONIC SARCOPHAGUS.
text: Dr. H. Clifford McBride exists in a vegetative state, resting
text: in a large silver CASE. Through glass, we can SEE that his
text: EYES ARE slightly OPEN, his BODY HOOKED UP to LIFE SUPPORT
speaker_heading: SYSTEMS.
text: MONITORS around the case MEASURE his PULSE and other VITAL
text: SIGNS. He is KEPT COLD.
text: ROY moves to it, OPENS THE SARCOPHAGUS. STARES AT HIS
scene_heading: FATHER’S LOBOTOMIZED FACE.
text: He LIFTS his FATHER’S STIFF, LIFELESS BODY out of its
text: electronic SARCOPHAGUS, pulling off the DIODES and IVs which
dialog: keep him “alive”.
text: When the body EMERGES from the SARCOPHAGUS, it seems almost
text: to FLOAT STANDING STIFFLY UPRIGHT. It starts SPINNING IN THE
scene_heading: WEIGHTLESSNESS.
text: ROY GRABS the SPINNING BODY, in a way that becomes an
text: EMBRACE. PULLING THE BODY WITH HIM, he FLOATS BACK OUT...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE THE LIMA PROJECT STATION - IN SPACE
text: ROY releases his FATHER’S BODY INTO SPACE, PUSHING IT TOWARD
text: the SURFACE of NEPTUNE.
text: IN the DISTANCE, WE SEE H. CLIFFORD McBRIDE’S BODY drift
text: TOWARD a RING AROUND NEPTUNE.
text: The BODY comes in contact with a SMALL ICE ROCK. It SHATTERS
text: INTO A MILLION PIECES. LIKE BROKEN WINDSHIELD GLASS.
text: Almost at the VERY INSTANT that H. CLIFFORD McBRIDE’s BODY is
text: destroyed, LIGHTS COME ON in a formerly DARKENED SECTION of
text: the LIMA CRAFT.
dialog: 
dialog: 105.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - NEAR THE LIMA CRAFT - OUTSIDE 3-D PRINTED CRAFT
text: A spacecraft which remains DOCKED. It has been constructed
text: for Dr. Clifford McBride’s return, presumably. It NOW HUMS
speaker_heading: WITH LIFE.
scene_heading: INT. 3-D PRINTED CRAFT
text: Roy enters the cockpit, HOLDING the ORANGE VDR ("VOYAGE DATA
scene_heading: RECORDER”) CANNISTERS.
text: Examining the craft’s SYSTEMS, he and we recognize that it is
text: astonishingly similar to the Cepheus. (The spacecraft are
text: all constructed by 3-D PRINTER, and there is a uniformity to
dialog: their design and construction.)
text: The entire SYSTEM of the CRAFT COMES TO LIFE, ONLINE.
text: AS DOES: RADIO STATIC FROM THE EARTH! Communication has been
dialog: restored:
text: ROY PRESSES THE RADIO BUTTON, TURNS DIALS FOR A CERTAIN CODE:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE
dialog: SpaceCom. This is Major Roy
dialog: McBride. I have taken it upon
dialog: myself and have reached the Lima
dialog: Project; all crew are deceased. I
dialog: have recovered significant material
dialog: for analysis, which I am now in the
dialog: process of forwarding to you. The
text: self-replicators here malfunctioned
dialog: and must be destroyed to prevent
text: any unforseen further catastrophe.
dialog: Therefore, I’m inputting target
dialog: coordinates 34.34 North, 81.92 West
dialog: from Earth standard vector 100.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I’m going to attempt a return to
text: the earth now. The onboard system
dialog: indicates I’1l be arriving in
dialog: approximately 41 days and 9 hours.
dialog: My journey will have kept me in an
dialog: isolated state for a considerable
dialog: period by that time. I...I am very
dialog: much looking forward to the day
text: that solitude ends. Over.
text: He FLIPS OFF THE RADIO.
text: He PULLS DOWN on a LARGE LEVER which looks almost like the
text: kind of control switch for a 747 airplane.
dialog: 106.
text: He moves around the CAPSULE, OBSERVING a PRINTED CHECKLIST.
text: Adjusts SEVERAL SWITCHES.
speaker_heading: MOMENTS LATER
text: Roy is SETTLING IN to his COCKPIT SEAT. He is about to PUT
text: an OXYGEN MASK ON. He activates the CRAFT’s GYROSCOPES and
scene_heading: CONTROL STICK.
dialog: Then:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
text: Outgoing mail. McBride, Roy M.
dialog: Send to Leanne McBride.
text: He SEES an IMAGE of HIS MOTHER. It’s a photo of her, with
text: him as a little boy. A little ANIMATED BEE flies around the
text: picture, making a PUTT-PUTT SOUND.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: Record voice message.
text: After a BEEP--Roy begins to record his message. As we know,
dialog: he’s not much one for communicating--especially when emotions
dialog: are concerned. But here...
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: Mother, I’m on a classified mission
dialog: right now.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I am by myself.
text: THE CAMERA SLOWLY--almost imperceptively so--PUSHES INTO HIM:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: (equivocating; then he
dialog: steels himself)
dialog: I am attempting now to return to
dialog: the earth. In the event I cannot,
dialog: I don’t want you to wonder about
dialog: me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'd like to express to you that I
dialog: realize that you gave me an
dialog: excellent childhood. I am grateful
dialog: to you now for attempting to
dialog: nurture friendships and other
dialog: relationships. Perhaps you don’t
dialog: think I remember much, but I do.
dialog: Sometimes the smell of certain
dialog: foods will bring back exceedingly
dialog: pleasant memories... On this
dialog: mission I’ve encountered people who
dialog: knew father.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
text: He stops.
speaker_heading: HIS HEAD.
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: I don’t know how much you know
dialog: about this, but it appears he had
dialog: another child, a daughter named
dialog: Francesca. We both met her once.
dialog: She and I talked. She informed me
dialog: that father acted out of the
dialog: noblest principles. And that he
dialog: sacrificed himself in the name of
dialog: science.
text: TEARS WELL UP AGAIN. He CLOSES HIS EYES and BOWS
text: Then begins to speak again:
speaker_heading: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: Mother, I, I was unable to protect
dialog: her. I regret this--terribly.
dialog: Even worse than I regret any
dialog: negative feelings toward father.
dialog: It’s led me to commit acts that you
dialog: would condemn--but were required by
dialog: circumstance. It has forced me to
dialog: be alone, a situation I now find
dialog: unacceptable.
dialog: (exhales; regroups)
dialog: But I have succeeded in my mission.
dialog: I want to say goodbye now, and
dialog: whatever occurs on my return, I am
dialog: forever your loving son.
text: He SHUTS OFF the RECORDER. ANGLE ON THE FROZEN IMAGE of
scene_heading: ROY’S MOTHER.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - 3-D PRINTED CRAFT
text: The Craft’s GANTRY RELEASES the ship. Slowly.
text: The CRAFT begins to move, its ROCKETS FIRING.
text: Almost at the same time: A BEAM, HIGH-INTENSITY, HITS A PART
dialog: 
text: OF THE STATION.
text: It EXPLODES! In SILENCE. The colors of the explosion, set
dialog: 
text: against the DEEP BLACKNESS of SPACE.
dialog: 
text: Then another SILENT and COLORFUL EXPLOSION.
scene_heading: INT. 3-D PRINTED CRAFT
text: Roy looks through his windows to SEE:
text: A SERIES OF LASERS HITTING VARIOUS PARTS of the STATION and
speaker_heading: TELESCOPE.
dialog: 108.
text: In SILENCE, the EXPLOSIONS ARE VAST, FEROCIOUS, and somehow
text: oddly BEAUTIFUL.
text: They ILLUMINATE the dead BLACKNESS of SPACE even as they are
text: utterly destructive, devastatingly so.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - 3-D PRINTED CRAFT
text: Roy’s ROCKET starts to STAGE, AFTER its initial BURST. It
text: leaves the CONTINUED DEVASTATION of the LIMA PROJECT in its
text: wake as it PROPELS FORWARD.
scene_heading: INT. 3-D PRINTED CRAFT
text: Roy’s HEAD SHAKES TO AND FRO; the ROCKET’S FORCE is
text: ASTONISHING.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - 3-D PRINTED CRAFT
text: The CRAFT FIRES a NEW SET OF ROCKETS. It moves on, deeper
text: and deeper and deeper toward the earth. The RADIO PIPES UP,
text: and it’s in the most straightforward, almost banal, tone
dialog: imaginable:
speaker_heading: SPACECOM VOICE
dialog: Major McBride, this is SpaceCom.
dialog: We have verified the authenticity
dialog: of your coordinates and have begun
dialog: to target sites accordingly. Upon
dialog: reentry to earth’s orbit, we will
dialog: intercept your craft and you will
dialog: be debriefed. However, we do
dialog: acknowledge the potential of your
dialog: data files to transform rather
dialog: radically our view of what the
dialog: universe may hold.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We wish you godspeed on your
text: journey homeward. US SPACECOM out.
text: Finally, Roy’s ROCKET disappears from our view, hurtling back
text: toward the EARTH.
dialog: The End
dialog:
