scene_heading: INT. CARRIAGE - DAY
text: A violent struggle is in progress: CLOSE on a man's thick,
text: fleshy hand, as it grips the two slender wrists of a young
text: girl, who's trying desperately to free herself, grunting
dialog: with effort.
text: A WIDER ANGLE shows us that there are three people in the
text: carriage, the third, a man in uniform on his knees in a corner
text: hanging on to the girl's feet and lower legs as she jerks
text: and flails like a landed fish. The GIRL is SABINA SPIELREIN,
text: a dark, slight young woman of 19, olive-skinned and beautiful,
text: with waist-length dark hair. The MAN gripping her wrists in
text: her father NIKOLAI SPIELREIN, a large, coarse-looking, red-
text: faced Russian in his midforties, with a thick moustache.
text: Abruptly, SABINA stops struggling; but the relief, palpable
text: on the faces of the two men, is short-lived: for SABINA begins
text: to wail, terrible, broken-hearted sobs to freeze the blood.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKESIDE ROAD - DAY
text: A bright summer day pours sunlight on the COACHMAN as he
text: lashes the horses on, up a hill leading away from the large
text: expanse of the lake.
scene_heading: A CAPTION: ZURICH, SWITZERLAND: 17TH AUGUST, 1904.
scene_heading: EXT. BURGHOLZLI - DAY
text: The Burghélzli hospital is a massive, plain building on the
text: crest of a hill. The COACHMAN jumps down to open the door
text: and help the ORDERLY and NIKOLAI SPIELREIN as they emerge,
text: seen from ABOVE, carrying the writhing body of SABINA.
scene_heading: INT. RECEPTION AREA - DAY
text: As the MEN labour in with the struggling SABINA, she suddenly
text: goes limp and begins shrieking with laughter.
text: Two or three NURSES close in on her as the ORDERLY drops her
text: legs; while other NURSES arrive down various corridors,
text: attracted by the noise. SABINA stops laughing and sticks
text: her tongue out as far as it will go at the approaching NURSES,
text: causing SPIELREIN to smack her round the head; at which, the
text: hysterical laughter begins again.
scene_heading: WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 2.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: CLOSE on SABINA: screaming with laughter, until suddenly,
text: her eyes flick upwards and she stops again in the middle of
text: a peal of laughter: she's seen something.
text: Descending the main staircase is DR. CARL GUSTAV JUNG, a
text: tall, broad-shouldered, godlike young man of 29, haloed ina
text: backlit glow and smiling faintly as he purposefully
text: approaches.
text: SABINA is still now, staring up at the apparition.
scene_heading: INT. CONSULTING ROOM - DAY
text: SABINA sits, bolt upright on a straight-backed chair, in the
text: dead centre of a bare white room. She's wearing a simple
text: dress and her hair has been braided into one long plait.
text: There's another chair placed about five or six feet behind
text: her, slightly to one side. JUNG breezes into the room.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: Good morning, I'm Dr. Jung, I admitted
dialog: you last night.
text: He stretches out a hand, but she won't take it. This doesn't
text: seem to discourage him in the least.
speaker_heading: JUNG (CONT'D)
dialog: How did you sleep?
speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: They wouldn't let me keep the light
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: You like to sleep with the light on?
speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: I...
text: Her mouth stays open, she seems to be making an enormous,
text: unsuccessful effort to speak.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: I think we can allow that.
text: SABINA closes her mouth, relief in her eyes.
speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: I'm not mad, you know.
scene_heading: WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 3.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: Let me explain what I have in mind:
dialog: I propose that we meet here, most
dialog: days, to talk for an hour or two.
speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: Talk?
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: Yes. Just talk. See if we can
dialog: identify what's troubling you. So
dialog: as to distract you as little as
dialog: possible, I shall sit there, behind
dialog: you; and I'm going to ask you to try
dialog: not to turn round and look at me
dialog: under any circumstances.
text: He moves behind her and sits in the second chair. Her face
text: twitches, her expression is apprehensive. JUNG opens a small
text: notebook on his knee, in which he will make regular notes.
speaker_heading: JUNG (CONT'D)
dialog: Now. Have you any idea what may
dialog: have brought on these attacks you
dialog: suffer from?
text: SABINA has to struggle for some time before she can answer.
speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: Humiliation.
text: Silence. JUNG waits. SABINA'S head jerks back in a series of
text: involuntary tics.
speaker_heading: SABINA (CONT'D)
dialog: Any kind of... humiliation, I can't
dialog: bear to see it. Makes me feel
text: nauseated. I start pouring with sweat,
text: cold sweat.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: No one likes to see that kind of
dialog: thing. But these must have been
dialog: isolated incidents?
text: Silence. SABINA is in obvious distress.
speaker_heading: JUNG (CONT'D)
dialog: Were they not?
scene_heading: WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 4.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: No, often, they were often, happened
dialog: often.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: At home?
speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: My... father lost his temper all the
dialog: time, he was always angry: with my
dialog: brothers.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: With your brothers?
speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: Mmm.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: Not with you?
speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: Sometimes... ah, sometimes.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: What would he do?
speaker_heading: SABINA
text: Shout and... shout. And hit them.
text: She's writhing in her chair now, her leg twitching, her face
text: out of control.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: But you do love your father?
speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: Ah, yes, but I couldn't... I
dialog: couldn't... he was so sad sometimes
dialog: and I wasn't able to... pride... it
dialog: was the most painful kind of love...
dialog: I couldn't even... couldn't kiss
dialog: him...
text: She breaks off. JUNG waits a while.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: When you stopped talking just now:
dialog: did a thought come into your head?
scene_heading: WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 5.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: I don't... ah...
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: Or an image perhaps? Was it an image?
speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: What was the image?
speaker_heading: SABINA
text: A hand.
text: She writhes in her chair; finally she comes to rest and
text: speaks, only just audibly.
speaker_heading: SABINA (CONT'D)
dialog: My father's hand.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: Why do you think you saw that?
speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: After he... whenever he hit us...
dialog: afterwards... we had to kiss his
dialog: hand...
text: She twists and turns; JUNG writes in his notebook.
scene_heading: INT. JUNG'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: The apartment assigned to the hospital's assistant director
text: is a set of plain rooms on the second floor of the hospital,
text: comfortably furnished by JUNG's wife, EMMA, a fair, attractive
text: 22-year-old, now five months pregnant.
text: JUNG has finished his breakfast and sips his coffee as EMMA
text: moves around, clearing the table.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: What's odd is, that case I was writing
dialog: up last week: I happened to pick the
dialog: codename Sabina S. And here she is:
dialog: Sabina Spielrein.
scene_heading: WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 6.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Quite a coincidence.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: As you know, I don't believe there
dialog: is such a thing.
text: EMMA puts his empty cup on the tray.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Spielrein's not a very Russian name.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: No, Jewish. Father's a very successful
dialog: import-export man. And she's
dialog: exceptionally well educated, speaks
dialog: fluent German. Aspires to be a doctor
dialog: herself, apparently.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Perhaps she's the one.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: What one?
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: The one you've been looking for.
dialog: For your experimental treatment.
dialog: The talking cure.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: You're so astute. I've already begun
text: it with her.
text: EMMA lays a hand on her stomach.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: He's kicking, can you feel?
text: JUNG rests a hand on her stomach.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: Oh, yes. There he is.
text: He starts to put on his jacket and straightens his tie,
text: preparing to leave.
scene_heading: WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 7.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: JUNG (CONT'D)
dialog: What I don't understand is why Freud,
dialog: having proposed this radical
dialog: therapeutic idea, this talking cure,
dialog: this psychanalysis, then lets years
dialog: go by without giving even the barest
dialog: outline of his clinical procedures?
dialog: What's he playing at?
speaker_heading: EMMA
text: Presumably he uses the method on his
dialog: patients?
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: I've no idea.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: So might you be the first doctor to
dialog: try this out?
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: It's possible.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Why don't you write and ask him?
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: I don't know him. As it happens,
dialog: Miss Spielrein's mother wanted to
dialog: take her to see Freud.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Another coincidence.
text: Her tone is teasing; JUNG shakes his head, pecks her
text: affectionately on the cheek and heads for the door.
scene_heading: EXT. PINEWOODS - DAY
text: JUNG and SABINA stroll through the towering pines which cover
text: the slopes of a hill near the Burghdélzli. They're wearing
text: overcoats, SABINA's worn draped across her shoulders. SABINA
text: seems more relaxed; JUNG carries a stout walking-stick.
speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: My father thinks my mother doesn't
dialog: love him... and he's right, she
dialog: doesn't.
scene_heading: WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 8.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: My angel told me.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: What angel?
speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: An inner voice. He used to tell me I
dialog: was an exceptional person. For some
dialog: reason he always spoke in German.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: Angels always speak German: it's
dialog: traditional.
text: SABINA smiles, perhaps for the first time.
speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: He gave me the power to know what
dialog: people are going to say before they
text: open their mouths.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: Useful ability for a doctor. You
dialog: hope to be a doctor someday, don't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: I'll never be a doctor.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: Why not?
text: SABINA looks up at him gratefully: they walk on for a while
text: in silence.
speaker_heading: JUNG (CONT'D)
dialog: I have to go away for a while. I'm
dialog: sorry. We've just gotten started.
text: SABINA looks up at him, shocked.

scene_heading: WHITE Revision - 4-22-10
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: SABINA starts trembling; her expression darkens.
speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: It's all a waste of time. I can't
dialog: tell you whatever it is you want to
dialog: know, you're just making me angry...
dialog: and if I did tell you, you'd be sorry
dialog: you ever... anyway, there's nothing
dialog: wrong with me! I don't even want to
dialog: get better!
text: She instinctively pulls away from him, her coat catches on a
text: branch and is swept off onto the dusty ground. JUNG picks it
text: up, holds it out and starts to beat the dust out of it with
text: his stick. Suddenly, SABINA hurls herself at him and snatches
text: the coat out of his hand.
speaker_heading: SABINA (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop it!
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: I was only...
speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: Will you stop that!
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: SABINA looks at him for a moment, her expression fearful;

speaker_heading: SABINA

scene_heading: INT. SABINA'S ROOM —- DAY 11
text: The room is empty. However, a piece of paper is pinned to

speaker_heading: BLEULER
dialog: What does it say?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: "If I'm not back tomorrow, it doesn't
dialog: necessarily mean I'm dead."
text: BLEULER sighs, shaking his head dispiritedly.
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - DAY 12
text: It's raining. BLEULER and the NURSE come upon a small knot
text: of struggling ORDERLIES, at the centre of which is SABINA,
text: her face and arms smeared with wet mud. She's grappling
text: fruitlessly with the largest ORDERLY, but stops as soon as
text: BLEULER appears.
speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: Ah. The Herr Direktor.
text: BLEULER's manner is entirely calm.
speaker_heading: BLEULER
dialog: Miss Spielrein, I feel you may have
dialog: a little too much time on your hands.
dialog: I'm a great believer in getting our

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL BATHROOM - DAY 13
text: There's a strange-looking contraption in the middle of the
text: room: a dark wooden bath with metal attachments, two-thirds
text: full of water. Next to it, SABINA is grappling with three
text: NURSES, kicking and shouting.
text: Eventually they manage to get her undressed and into the
text: bath, whereupon something rather like a coffin-lid, leaving

scene_heading: INT. SABINA'S ROOM —- DAY 14

text: FREUD, JUNG and EMMA are FREUD's wife, MARTHA, his sister-in-
text: law, MINNA BERNAYS, and his six children, ranging in age
text: from MATHILDE, 19, to ANNA, 11. FREUD sits next to JUNG at
text: one end of the table, while EMMA sits at the far end with
text: the two adult women. A MAID squeezes around the outside of
text: the table, offering food.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: Perhaps the terms themselves should
dialog: be reviewed: if, for instance, we
dialog: could come up with some milder term
dialog: than 'libido', we might not encounter
dialog: such emotional resistance, it would
dialog: make the teaching side of things
dialog: much easier...
text: He breaks off, obliged to move his chair, so that the MAID
text: can pass and offer him food. He helps himself
text: unselfconsciously to an enormous quantity.
speaker_heading: FREUD
dialog: Is euphemism a good idea? Once they
dialog: work out what we actually mean,
dialog: they'1l be just as appalled as ever.
text: He can't help frowning as he takes note of the vast quantity
text: of food on JUNG's plate.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: I take your point, but I still think
dialog: it's worth trying to sweeten the
dialog: pill when it comes to questions of

speaker_heading: FREUD
dialog: And by the way, please don't feel
dialog: you have to restrain yourself here.
dialog: My family are all veterans of the

speaker_heading: FREUD
dialog: And how is your little Russian
dialog: patient?
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: As I told you, after the initial
dialog: abreaction, there was the most
dialog: dramatic improvement. We've enrolled
dialog: her in the medical school at the
dialog: University, where she's doing
dialog: extremely well. She's a walking
dialog: advertisement for the effectiveness
dialog: of psychanalysis.
speaker_heading: FREUD
dialog: Psychoanalysis.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: Oh?
speaker_heading: FREUD
dialog: It's more logical and it sounds

dialog: Are you still treating her?
scene_heading: WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 25.
scene_heading: 20 CONTINUED: 20
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: Yes; and we continue to unearth new
dialog: material: for example, the
dialog: extraordinary procedure she devised
dialog: as a small child, where she would
text: sit on one heel, attempt to defecate
dialog: and, at the same time, try to prevent
dialog: herself from defecating. She said
dialog: this gave rise to the most blissful
dialog: feelings.
speaker_heading: FREUD
dialog: A nice story. Those of my patients
text: who remain fixated at the anal stage
dialog: of their erotic development often
dialog: come up with the most amusing details.
dialog: And of course all of them are finicky,
text: compulsively tidy, stubborn and
dialog: extremely stingy with money. No doubt
dialog: your Russian conforms to this pattern.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: Well, no: she doesn't.
text: FREUD frowns: he puffs at his cigar, evidently somewhat put
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: JUNG (CONT'D)
dialog: The masochistic aspects of her
dialog: condition are much more deeply rooted
dialog: than any anal fixations we may have
text: uncovered.
speaker_heading: FREUD
dialog: But the two are intimately connected!
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: I can only tell you she's rather
text: disorganised, emotionally generous
dialog: and exceptionally idealistic.

text: men, deep in animated conversation, reading newspapers from
text: the racks or playing chess.
speaker_heading: FREUD
dialog: I don't think you have any notion of
dialog: the true strengths and depths of the
dialog: opposition to our work. There's the
dialog: whole medical establishment, of
dialog: course, baying to send Freud to the
dialog: auto-da-fé; but that's as nothing
dialog: compared to what happens when our
text: ideas begin to trickle through in
text: whatever garbled form they're relayed
dialog: to the public: the denials, the
dialog: frenzy, the incoherent rage... you
dialog: wouldn't believe it.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: But might that not be caused by your
dialog: insistence on the exclusively sexual
dialog: interpretation of the clinical
dialog: material?
speaker_heading: FREUD
dialog: All I'm doing is pointing out what
dialog: experience indicates to me must be
dialog: the truth... And I can assure you
dialog: that in a hundred years' time our
dialog: work will still be rejected.
dialog: Columbus, you know, had no idea what

speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: I dreamed about a horse, being hoisted

text: Suddenly, a cable breaks and the
text: horse is dashed to the ground. But
text: it's not hurt, it leaps up and gallops
text: away, impeded only by a heavy log,
dialog: which it's obliged to drag along the
text: ground. Then a rider on a small
text: horse appears in front of it, so
text: that it's forced to slow down; and a
text: carriage appears in front of the
dialog: small horse, so that our horse is
text: compelled to slow down even more.
text: FREUD considers for a moment.
speaker_heading: FREUD
dialog: I imagine the horse is yourself.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: FREUD
dialog: Your ambition has been frustrated in
dialog: some way; hence the fall.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: The rider slowing me down...
speaker_heading: FREUD
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: I think this may refer to my wife's
dialog: first pregnancy. I had to give up an
dialog: opportunity to go to America because
dialog: of it.
speaker_heading: FREUD
dialog: Ah, America. You're right, I'm sure
dialog: that's a most important territory
dialog: for us.
scene_heading: WHITE Revision - 4-22-10
speaker_heading: 22 CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JUNG
text: The carriage in front perhaps refers
dialog: to an apprehension that our two
dialog: daughters and other children perhaps
dialog: still to come, will impede my progress
dialog: even more.
speaker_heading: FREUD
dialog: As a father of six, I can vouch for
dialog: that; not to mention the inevitable
dialog: financial difficulties.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: No. Fortunately my wife is extremely
dialog: rich.
text: FREUD takes a moment to recover from this.
dialog: He forces
speaker_heading: FREUD

speaker_heading: FREUD (CONT'D)
dialog: This log.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: FREUD
dialog: I think perhaps you should entertain
dialog: the possibility that it represents
dialog: the penis.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: Yes; in which case what may be at
dialog: issue is that a certain sexual
dialog: constraint has been brought about by
text: a fear of an endless succession of

dialog: followers in Vienna are all deeply
text: unimpressive: a crowd of Bohemians

speaker_heading: SABINA
text: Perhaps he's reached the stage where

dialog: than originality.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: Mm. I tried to tackle him about his

dialog: symptom in sexual terms, but he's

speaker_heading: SABINA

speaker_heading: JUNG

speaker_heading: JUNG
text: I'm confused. I feel trapped, I've

speaker_heading: SABINA

speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: You mustn't say that.
speaker_heading: JUNG

speaker_heading: JUNG (CONT'D)
dialog: I tried to explain the situation to

speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: I don't know how you dared say those

speaker_heading: JUNG
text: She came in waving an anonymous

dialog: my patient.
speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: Of course I'm your patient!
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: Technically not, not since I stopped

speaker_heading: JUNG (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SABINA

speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: I broke one of the elementary rules

speaker_heading: JUNG

speaker_heading: JUNG (CONT'D)
dialog: You have to understand: I'm your

speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: Then heal thyself!
text: She's opened up a gash on his cheek: and as he puts up an
text: astonished hand to feel the blood which is starting to well,
text: she goes for him again. This time, he's able to grasp her
text: wrist and disarm her after a short, vicious, struggle. She

text: it on to his cheek, where it adheres.
speaker_heading: SABINA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: Explain this analogy you make between

dialog: instinct.
speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: Professor Freud claims the sexual
dialog: drive arises from a simple urge
dialog: towards pleasure. If he's right, the
dialog: question is why is this urge so often
dialog: successfully repressed?
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: You used to have a theory involving

dialog: that impulse?
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: You mean for selfish not for social
dialog: reasons?
speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: Yes, I'm saying perhaps true sexuality

speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: (with quiet

dialog: In other words, the opposite of what

speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: Yes, at the same time as being a
dialog: creative force, in the sense that it
dialog: can produce, out of the destruction
text: of two individualities, a new being.
dialog: But the individual always has to
dialog: overcome a resistance because of the
dialog: self-annihilating nature of the sexual
dialog: act.
speaker_heading: FREUD
dialog: I've fought against the idea for
dialog: some time, but I suppose there must
dialog: be some kind of indissoluble link
dialog: between sex and death. I don't feel
dialog: the relationship between the two is
dialog: quite as you've portrayed it, but
dialog: I'm most grateful to you for animating
dialog: the subject in such a stimulating
dialog: way. The only slight shock was your
text: introduction, at the very end of
dialog: your paper, of the name of Christ.
speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: Are you completely opposed to any

dialog: field?
speaker_heading: FREUD

speaker_heading: SABINA
text: He's trying to find some way forward,

speaker_heading: FREUD
dialog: If you still love him, it's because

speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: Is there no way to avert a rupture?
speaker_heading: FREUD
dialog: Correct scientific relations will be

dialog: him at the editorial meeting in Munich
dialog: in November and I shall be perfectly
dialog: civil. To tell you the truth, what
dialog: finished him for me was all that
dialog: business about you, the lies, the
dialog: ruthless behaviour. I was very
dialog: shocked. On your behalf.
speaker_heading: SABINA
dialog: I think he loved me.

dialog: All the more reason to behave better,

dialog: Present are the presidents of the local societies: Freud,

dialog: Ophuijsen, secretary of the Ziirich society.
text: JUNG is on his feet, gathering up his papers, as the rest of
text: the DELEGATES, who have been sitting round a long table
text: covered in green baize, now littered with half-empty carafes
text: and glasses of water, head for the doors.
text: FREUD, at the head of the table, some way away, is also
text: marshalling his documents. They're obviously going to be
text: the last two men left in the room; and, as if bowing to the
text: inevitable, reluctantly, FREUD eventually speaks.
speaker_heading: FREUD
dialog: I think that was a fairly satisfactory
dialog: session, don't you?
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: I was interested in what you said
dialog: about monotheism: that it arose
dialog: historically out of some kind of
dialog: patricidal impulse.
speaker_heading: FREUD
dialog: Yes, Akhnaton, who as far as we know
dialog: was the first to put forward the
dialog: bizarre notion that there was only
dialog: one God, also had his father's name
text: erased and chiselled out of all public
dialog: monuments.
speaker_heading: JUNG

speaker_heading: FREUD
dialog: Not true?
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FREUD
dialog: You mean it's most probably a myth?
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: No. I mean there were two perfectly
dialog: straightforward reasons for Akhnaton,
dialog: or Amenhopis IV, as I prefer to call
dialog: him, to excise his father's name
dialog: from the cartouches. First, this
dialog: was something traditionally done by
dialog: all new kings, who didn't wish their
dialog: father's names to continue to be
dialog: public currency.
speaker_heading: FREUD
dialog: In much the same way as your article
dialog: in the Yearbook fails to mention my
dialog: name?
text: The atmosphere is becoming electric.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: Your name is so well-known, it hardly
dialog: seemed necessary to mention it.
speaker_heading: FREUD
dialog: Do go on.
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: Secondly, Amenhopis only struck out
dialog: the first half of his father's name,
dialog: Amenhotep, because, like the first
dialog: half of his own name, it was shared
dialog: by Amon, one of the gods he was
dialog: determined to eliminate.
speaker_heading: FREUD
dialog: As simple as that?
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: The explanation doesn't seem to me
dialog: unduly simple.

dialog: towards his father?
speaker_heading: JUNG
dialog: I've no means of proof, of course.
dialog: For all I know, Amenhopis may have
dialog: thought his father's name was quite
dialog: familiar enough and that now it might
dialog: be time to make a name for himself.
text: At which point, FREUD faints, pitching forward, ricocheting
text: off the table and ending in a heap on the floor. JUNG bounds

speaker_heading: JUNG (V.O.)
dialog: If I may say so, dear Professor, you
